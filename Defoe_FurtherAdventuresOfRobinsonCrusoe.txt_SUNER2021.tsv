the	O

that	O

in	O
the	O

about	O
ghosts	O

is	O
owing	O
to	O
the	O
strength	O
of	O
imagination	O

and	O
the	O
powerful	O
operation	O
of	O

in	O

One	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
villainy	O
of	O
the	O

related	O
to	O
me	O
by	O
the	O
first	O
Spaniard	O

and	O
Friday	O

father	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
surprising	O

told	O
me	O
how	O
they	O
barbarously	O
attempted	O
to	O
murder	O
all	O
the	O
Spaniards	O

that	O

were	O
never	O
all	O

true	O
in	O

it	O
was	O
so	O
warm	O
in	O
my	O
imagination	O

so	O
realised	O
to	O
me	O

to	O
the	O
hour	O
I	O
saw	O
them	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
persuaded	O

that	O
it	O
was	O
or	O
would	O
be	O
true	O
;	O
also	O
how	O
I	O
resented	O
it	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
complained	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
how	O
I	O
brought	O
them	O
to	O
justice	O

them	O

there	O

nothing	O
in	O
it	O
literally	O

specifically	O
true	O

the	O
general	O
part	O
was	O
so	O
true	O

the	O
base	O
;	O
villainous	O
behaviour	O
of	O
these	O
three	O
hardened	O
rogues	O
was	O
such	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
much	O
worse	O
than	O
all	O
I	O
can	O
describe	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
dream	O
had	O
too	O
much	O
similitude	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
I	O
would	O
afterwards	O
have	O
punished	O
them	O
severely	O

so	O

if	O
I	O
had	O

them	O
all	O

I	O
had	O
been	O
much	O
in	O

In	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
temper	O
I	O
lived	O
some	O
years	O

I	O
had	O
no	O

no	O

something	O

other	O
of	O
this	O
in	O
it	O

so	O
that	O
my	O
wife	O
,	O
who	O
saw	O
my	O
mind	O
wholly	O
bent	O
upon	O
it	O
,	O
told	O
me	O
very	O
seriously	O
one	O
night	O
that	O
she	O
believed	O
there	O
was	O
some	O
secret	O
,	O
powerful	O
impulse	O
of	O
Providence	O
upon	O
me	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
determined	O
me	O
to	O
go	O
thither	O

that	O
she	O

nothing	O

I	O
perceived	O
that	O
her	O

that	O

of	O

that	O
it	O

as	O

away	O

my	O

was	O
quite	O

began	O
to	O
think	O
the	O
same	O
ill	O
fate	O
attended	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
born	O
to	O
be	O
never	O
contented	O
with	O
being	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
to	O
be	O
always	O
unfortunate	O
at	O
sea	O
.	O

Contrary	O
winds	O
first	O
put	O
us	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
put	O
in	O
at	O
Galway	PNM
,	O
in	O
Ireland	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
lay	O
wind-bound	O
two	O
-	O
and-twenty	O
days	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
had	O
this	O
satisfaction	O
with	O
the	O
disaster	O
,	O
that	O
provisions	O
were	O
here	O
exceeding	O
cheap	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
utmost	O
plenty	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
while	O
we	O
lay	O
here	O
we	O
never	O
touched	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
stores	O
,	O
but	O
rather	O
added	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

Here	O
,	O
also	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
in	O
several	O
live	O
hogs	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
cows	O
with	O
their	O
calves	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
resolved	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
good	O
passage	O
,	O
to	O
put	O
on	O
shore	O
in	O
my	O
island	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
found	O
occasion	O
to	O
dispose	O
otherwise	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
set	O
out	O
on	O
the	O
5th	O
of	O
February	O
from	O
Ireland	PNM
,	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
very	O
fair	O
gale	O
of	O
wind	O
for	O
some	O
days	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
remember	O
,	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
about	O
the	O
20th	O
of	O
February	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
late	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
mate	O
,	O
having	O
the	O
watch	O
,	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
round-house	O
and	O
told	O
us	O
he	O
saw	O
a	O
flash	O
of	O
fire	O
,	O
and	O
heard	O
a	O
gun	O
fired	O
;	O
and	O
while	O
he	O
was	O
telling	O
us	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
a	O
boy	O
came	O
in	O
and	O
told	O
us	O
the	O
boatswain	O
heard	O
another	O
.	O

This	O
made	O
us	O
all	O
run	O
out	O
upon	O
the	O
quarter-deck	O
,	O
where	O
for	O
a	O
while	O
we	O
heard	O
nothing	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
light	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
some	O
very	O
terrible	O
fire	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
;	O
immediately	O
we	O
had	O
recourse	O
to	O
our	O
reckonings	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
we	O
all	O
agreed	O
that	O
there	O
could	O
be	O
no	O
land	O
that	O
way	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
fire	O
showed	O
itself	O
,	O
no	O
,	O
not	O
for	O
five	O
hundred	O
leagues	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
appeared	O
at	O
WNW	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
,	O
we	O
concluded	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
some	O
ship	O
on	O
fire	O
at	O
sea	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
,	O
by	O
our	O
hearing	O
the	O
noise	O
of	O
guns	O
just	O
before	O
,	O
we	O
concluded	O
that	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
far	O
off	O
,	O
we	O
stood	O
directly	O
towards	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
presently	O
satisfied	O
we	O
should	O
discover	O
it	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
further	O
we	O
sailed	O
,	O
the	O
greater	O
the	O
light	O
appeared	O
;	O
though	O
,	O
the	O
weather	O
being	O
hazy	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
perceive	O
anything	O
but	O
the	O
light	O
for	O
a	O
while	O
.	O

In	O
about	O
half-an-hour	O
's	O
sailing	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
being	O
fair	O
for	O
us	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
much	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
weather	O
clearing	O
up	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
plainly	O
discern	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
ship	O
on	O
fire	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
most	O
sensibly	O
touched	O
with	O
this	O
disaster	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
acquainted	O
with	O
the	O
persons	O
engaged	O
in	O
it	O
;	O
I	O
presently	O
recollected	O
my	O
former	O
circumstances	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
condition	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
when	O
taken	O
up	O
by	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
captain	O
;	O
and	O
how	O
much	O
more	O
deplorable	O
the	O
circumstances	O
of	O
the	O
poor	O
creatures	O
belonging	O
to	O
that	O
ship	O
must	O
be	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
other	O
ship	O
in	O
company	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
I	O
immediately	O
ordered	O
that	O
five	O
guns	O
should	O
be	O
fired	O
,	O
one	O
soon	O
after	O
another	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
give	O
notice	O
to	O
them	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
help	O
for	O
them	O
at	O
hand	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
endeavour	O
to	O
save	O
themselves	O
in	O
their	O
boat	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
the	O
flames	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
yet	O
they	O
,	O
it	O
being	O
night	O
,	O
could	O
see	O
nothing	O
of	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
lay	O
by	O
some	O
time	O
upon	O
this	O
,	O
only	O
driving	O
as	O
the	O
burning	O
ship	O
drove	O
,	O
waiting	O
for	O
daylight	O
;	O
when	O
,	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
terror	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
expect	O
it	O
,	O
the	O
ship	O
blew	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
air	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
all	O
the	O
fire	O
was	O
out	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
sunk	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
terrible	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
an	O
afflicting	O
sight	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
the	O
poor	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
I	O
concluded	O
,	O
must	O
be	O
either	O
all	O
destroyed	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
or	O
be	O
in	O
the	O
utmost	O
distress	O
in	O
their	O
boat	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
ocean	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
at	O
present	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
dark	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
see	O

However	O
,	O
to	O
direct	O
them	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
I	O
caused	O
lights	O
to	O
be	O
hung	O
out	O
in	O
all	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
where	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
lanterns	O
for	O
,	O
and	O
kept	O
firing	O
guns	O
all	O
the	O
night	O
long	O
,	O
letting	O
them	O
know	O
by	O
this	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
ship	O
not	O
far	O
off	O
.	O

About	O
eight	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
we	O
discovered	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
boats	O
by	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
our	O
perspective	O
glasses	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
there	O
were	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
both	O
thronged	O
with	O
people	O
,	O
and	O
deep	O
in	O
the	O
water	O
.	O

We	O
perceived	O
they	O
rowed	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
being	O
against	O
them	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
saw	O
our	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
their	O
utmost	O
to	O
make	O
us	O
see	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
immediately	O
spread	O
our	O
ancient	O
,	O
to	O
let	O
them	O
know	O
we	O
saw	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
hung	O
a	O
waft	O
out	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
signal	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
made	O
more	O
sail	O
,	O
standing	O
directly	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

In	O
little	O
more	O
than	O
half-an-hour	O
we	O
came	O
up	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
took	O
them	O
all	O
in	O
,	O
being	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
sixty-four	O
men	O
,	O
women	O
,	O
and	O
children	O
;	O
for	O
there	O
were	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
passengers	O
.	O

Upon	O
inquiry	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
French	O
merchant	O
ship	O
of	O
three-hundred	O
tons	O
,	O
home-bound	O
from	O
Quebec	PNM
.	O

The	O
master	O
gave	O
us	O
a	O
long	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
distress	O
of	O
his	O
ship	O
;	O
how	O
the	O
fire	O
began	O
in	O
the	O
steerage	O
by	O
the	O
negligence	O
of	O
the	O
steersman	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
on	O
his	O
crying	O
out	O
for	O
help	O
,	O
was	O
,	O
as	O
everybody	O
thought	O
,	O
entirely	O
put	O
out	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
soon	O
found	O
that	O
some	O
sparks	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
fire	O
had	O
got	O
into	O
some	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
so	O
difficult	O
to	O
come	O
at	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
effectually	O
quench	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
afterwards	O
getting	O
in	O
between	O
the	O
timbers	O
,	O
and	O
within	O
the	O
ceiling	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
it	O
proceeded	O
into	O
the	O
hold	O
,	O
and	O
mastered	O
all	O
the	O
skill	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
application	O
they	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
exert	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
no	O
more	O
to	O
do	O
then	O
but	O
to	O
get	O
into	O
their	O
boats	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
to	O
their	O
great	O
comfort	O
,	O
were	O
pretty	O
large	O
;	O
being	O
their	O
long-boat	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
shallop	O
,	O
besides	O
a	O
small	O
skiff	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
of	O
no	O
great	O
service	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
other	O
than	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
fresh	O
water	O
and	O
provisions	O
into	O
her	O
,	O
after	O
they	O
had	O
secured	O
their	O
lives	O
from	O
the	O
fire	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
small	O
hopes	O
of	O
their	O
lives	O
by	O
getting	O
into	O
these	O
boats	O
at	O
that	O
distance	O
from	O
any	O
land	O
;	O
only	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
thus	O
escaped	O
from	O
the	O
fire	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
possibility	O
that	O
some	O
ship	O
might	O
happen	O
to	O
be	O
at	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
take	O
them	O
in	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
sails	O
,	O
oars	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
compass	O
;	O
and	O
had	O
as	O
much	O
provision	O
and	O
water	O
as	O
,	O
with	O
sparing	O
it	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
be	O
next	O
door	O
to	O
starving	O
,	O
might	O
support	O
them	O
about	O
twelve	O
days	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
bad	O
weather	O
and	O
no	O
contrary	O
winds	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
said	O
he	O
hoped	O
he	O
might	O
get	O
to	O
the	O
banks	O
of	O
Newfoundland	PNM
,	O
and	O
might	O
perhaps	O
take	O
some	O
fish	O
,	O
to	O
sustain	O
them	O
till	O
they	O
might	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

But	O
there	O
were	O
so	O
many	O
chances	O
against	O
them	O
in	O
all	O
these	O
cases	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
storms	O
,	O
to	O
overset	O
and	O
founder	O
them	O
;	O

cold	O

to	O
benumb	O

perish	O
their	O
limbs	O

contrary	O
winds	O

to	O
keep	O
them	O
out	O
and	O
starve	O
them	O
;	O
that	O
it	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
next	O
to	O
miraculous	O
if	O
they	O
had	O

In	O
the	O

of	O
their	O
consternation	O

every	O

hopeless	O

ready	O
to	O

,	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
with	O
tears	O
in	O
his	O
eyes	O

told	O
me	O
they	O
were	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O

with	O
the	O
joy	O
of	O
hearing	O
a	O

after	O
that	O
four	O

:	O
these	O
were	O

I	O
caused	O
to	O
be	O
fired	O
at	O
first	O
seeing	O
the	O

This	O
revived	O
their	O

and	O
gave	O
them	O
the	O
notice	O

which	O
,	O
as	O
above	O

I	O
desired	O
it	O
should	O

that	O
there	O

a	O

at	O

It	O
was	O
upon	O

of	O

the	O

Some	O

I	O
would	O
not	O

them	O

;	O
there	O
might	O
be	O
many	O
that	O
were	O
thankful	O
afterwards	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
passion	O
was	O
too	O
strong	O
for	O
them	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
master	O
it	O
:	O
then	O
were	O
thrown	O
into	O
ecstasies	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
frenzy	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
but	O
a	O
very	O
few	O
that	O
were	O
composed	O

serious	O
in	O
their	O
joy	O

Perhaps	O
also	O
,	O
the	O
case	O
may	O
have	O
some	O

from	O
the	O
particular	O

of	O
that	O
nation	O
they	O

I	O
mean	O
the	O
French	O

to	O
be	O
more	O
volatile	O

more	O

I	O
am	O
not	O
philosopher	O
enough	O
to	O
determine	O
the	O

nothing	O
I	O
had	O

The	O
ecstasies	O
poor	O
Friday	O
,	O
my	O
trusty	O
savage	O
,	O
was	O
in	O
when	O
he	O
found	O
his	O
father	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
came	O
the	O
nearest	O
to	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
surprise	O
of	O
the	O
master	O
and	O
his	O
two	O
companions	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
delivered	O
from	O
the	O
villains	O
that	O
set	O
them	O
on	O
shore	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
came	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
towards	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
nothing	O
was	O
to	O
compare	O
to	O
this	O
,	O
either	O
that	O
I	O
saw	O
in	O
Friday	O
,	O
or	O
anywhere	O
else	O
in	O
my	O
life	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
further	O
observable	O
,	O
that	O
these	O
extravagances	O
did	O
not	O
show	O
themselves	O
in	O
that	O
different	O
manner	O
I	O
have	O
mentioned	O
,	O
in	O
different	O
persons	O
only	O
;	O
but	O
all	O
the	O
variety	O
would	O
appear	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
succession	O
of	O
moments	O
,	O
in	O
one	O
and	O
the	O
same	O
person	O
.	O

A	O
man	O
that	O
we	O
saw	O
this	O
minute	O
dumb	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
stupid	O
and	O
confounded	O
,	O
would	O
the	O
next	O
minute	O
be	O
dancing	O
and	O
hallooing	O
like	O
an	O
antic	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
moment	O
be	O
tearing	O
his	O
hair	O
,	O
or	O
pulling	O
his	O
clothes	O
to	O
pieces	O
,	O
and	O
stamping	O
them	O
under	O
his	O
feet	O
like	O
a	O
madman	O
;	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
moments	O
after	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
have	O
him	O
all	O
in	O
tears	O
,	O
then	O
sick	O
,	O
swooning	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
had	O
not	O
immediate	O
help	O
been	O
had	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
moments	O
have	O
been	O
dead	O
.	O

Thus	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
not	O
with	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
,	O
or	O
ten	O
or	O
twenty	O
,	O
but	O
with	O
the	O
greatest	O
part	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
remember	O
right	O
,	O
our	O
surgeon	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
let	O
blood	O
of	O
about	O
thirty	O
persons	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
two	O
priests	O
among	O
them	O
:	O
one	O
an	O
old	O
man	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
a	O
young	O
man	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
which	O
was	O
strangest	O
was	O
,	O
the	O
oldest	O
man	O
was	O
the	O
worst	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
set	O
his	O
foot	O
on	O
board	O
our	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
himself	O
safe	O
,	O
he	O
dropped	O
down	O
stone	O
dead	O
to	O
all	O
appearance	O
.	O

Not	O
the	O
least	O
sign	O
of	O
life	O
could	O
be	O
perceived	O
in	O
him	O
;	O
our	O
surgeon	O
immediately	O
applied	O
proper	O
remedies	O
to	O
recover	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
man	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
that	O
believed	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
dead	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
he	O
opened	O
a	O
vein	O
in	O
his	O
arm	O
,	O
having	O
first	O
chafed	O
and	O
rubbed	O
the	O
part	O
,	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
warm	O
it	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
possible	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
the	O
blood	O
,	O
which	O
only	O
dropped	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
flowing	O
freely	O
,	O
in	O
three	O
minutes	O
after	O
the	O
man	O
opened	O
his	O
eyes	O
;	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
after	O
that	O
he	O
spoke	O
,	O
grew	O
better	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
the	O
blood	O
was	O
stopped	O
,	O
he	O
walked	O
about	O
,	O
told	O
us	O
he	O
was	O
perfectly	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
a	O
dram	O
of	O
cordial	O
which	O
the	O
surgeon	O
gave	O
him	O
.	O

About	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
after	O
this	O
they	O
came	O
running	O
into	O
the	O
cabin	O
to	O
the	O
surgeon	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
bleeding	O
a	O
Frenchwoman	O
that	O
had	O
fainted	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
the	O
priest	O
was	O
gone	O
stark	O
mad	O
.	O

It	O
seems	O
he	O
had	O
begun	O
to	O
revolve	O
the	O
change	O
of	O
his	O
circumstances	O
in	O
his	O
mind	O
,	O
and	O
again	O
this	O
put	O
him	O
into	O
an	O
ecstasy	O
of	O
joy	O
.	O

His	O
spirits	O
whirled	O
about	O
faster	O
than	O
the	O
vessels	O
could	O
convey	O
them	O
,	O
the	O
blood	O
grew	O
hot	O
and	O
feverish	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
man	O
was	O
as	O
fit	O
for	O
Bedlam	O
as	O
any	O
creature	O
that	O
ever	O
was	O
in	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
surgeon	O
would	O
not	O
bleed	O
him	O
again	O
in	O
that	O
condition	O
,	O
but	O
gave	O
him	O
something	O
to	O
doze	O
and	O
put	O
him	O
to	O
sleep	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
after	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
operated	O
upon	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
awoke	O
next	O
morning	O
perfectly	O
composed	O
and	O
well	O
.	O

The	O
younger	O
priest	O
behaved	O
with	O
great	O
command	O
of	O
his	O
passions	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
really	O
an	O
example	O
of	O
a	O
serious	O
,	O
well-governed	O
mind	O
.	O

At	O
his	O
first	O
coming	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
he	O
threw	O
himself	O
flat	O
on	O
his	O
face	O
,	O
prostrating	O
himself	O
in	O
thankfulness	O
for	O
his	O
deliverance	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
I	O
unhappily	O
and	O
unseasonably	O
disturbed	O
him	O
,	O
really	O
thinking	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
a	O
swoon	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
spoke	O
calmly	O
,	O
thanked	O
me	O
,	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
was	O
giving	O
God	O
thanks	O
for	O
his	O
deliverance	O
,	O
begged	O
me	O
to	O
leave	O
him	O
a	O
few	O
moments	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
next	O
to	O
his	O
Maker	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
give	O
me	O
thanks	O
also	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
heartily	O
sorry	O
that	O
I	O
disturbed	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
only	O
left	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
kept	O
others	O
from	O
interrupting	O
him	O
also	O
.	O

He	O
continued	O
in	O
that	O
posture	O
about	O
three	O
minutes	O
,	O
or	O
little	O
more	O
,	O
after	O
I	O
left	O
him	O
,	O
then	O
came	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
said	O
he	O
would	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
seriousness	O
and	O
affection	O
,	O
but	O
with	O
tears	O
in	O
his	O
eyes	O
,	O
thanked	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
had	O
,	O
under	O
God	O
,	O
given	O
him	O
and	O
so	O
many	O
miserable	O
creatures	O
their	O
lives	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
need	O
to	O
tell	O
him	O
to	O
thank	O
God	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
rather	O
than	O
me	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
that	O
already	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
added	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
nothing	O
but	O
what	O
reason	O
and	O
humanity	O
dictated	O
to	O
all	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
as	O
much	O
reason	O
as	O
he	O
to	O
give	O
thanks	O
to	O
God	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
blessed	O
us	O
so	O
far	O
as	O
to	O
make	O
us	O
the	O
instruments	O
of	O
His	O
mercy	O
to	O
so	O
many	O
of	O
His	O
creatures	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
the	O
young	O
priest	O
applied	O
himself	O
to	O
his	O
countrymen	O
,	O
and	O
laboured	O
to	O
compose	O
them	O
:	O
he	O
persuaded	O
,	O
entreated	O
,	O
argued	O
,	O
reasoned	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
his	O
utmost	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
within	O
the	O
exercise	O
of	O
their	O
reason	O
;	O
and	O
with	O
some	O
he	O
had	O
success	O
,	O
though	O
others	O
were	O
for	O
a	O
time	O
out	O
of	O
all	O
government	O
of	O
themselves	O
.	O

I	O
can	O
not	O
help	O
committing	O
this	O
to	O
writing	O
,	O
as	O
perhaps	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
useful	O
to	O
those	O
into	O
whose	O
hands	O
it	O
may	O
fall	O
,	O
for	O
guiding	O
themselves	O
in	O
the	O
extravagances	O
of	O
their	O
passions	O
;	O
for	O
if	O
an	O
excess	O
of	O
joy	O
can	O
carry	O
men	O
out	O
to	O
such	O
a	O
length	O
beyond	O
the	O
reach	O
of	O
their	O
reason	O
,	O
what	O
will	O
not	O
the	O
extravagances	O
of	O
anger	O
,	O
rage	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
provoked	O
mind	O
carry	O
us	O
to	O
?	O

And	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
here	O
I	O
saw	O
reason	O
for	O
keeping	O
an	O
exceeding	O
watch	O
over	O
our	O
passions	O
of	O
every	O
kind	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
those	O
of	O
joy	O
and	O
satisfaction	O
as	O
those	O
of	O
sorrow	O
and	O
anger	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
somewhat	O
disordered	O
by	O
these	O
extravagances	O
among	O
our	O
new	O
guests	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
day	O
;	O
but	O
after	O
they	O
had	O
retired	O
to	O
lodgings	O
provided	O
for	O
them	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
our	O
ship	O
would	O
allow	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
slept	O
heartily	O
--	O
as	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
did	O
,	O
being	O
fatigued	O
and	O
frightened	O
--	O
they	O
were	O
quite	O
another	O
sort	O
of	O
people	O
the	O
next	O
day	O

Nothing	O
of	O
good	O
manners	O

civil	O
acknowledgments	O
for	O
the	O

them	O

the	O

The	O
captain	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
priests	O
came	O
to	O
me	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
to	O
speak	O
with	O
me	O
and	O
my	O
nephew	O
;	O
the	O
commander	O
began	O
to	O
consult	O
with	O
us	O
what	O
should	O
be	O
done	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
first	O
,	O
they	O
told	O
us	O
we	O
had	O
saved	O
their	O
lives	O
,	O
so	O
all	O
they	O
had	O
was	O
little	O
enough	O
for	O
a	O
return	O
to	O
us	O
for	O
that	O
kindness	O
received	O
.	O

The	O
captain	O
said	O
they	O
had	O
saved	O
some	O
money	O
and	O
some	O
things	O
of	O
value	O
in	O
their	O
boats	O
,	O
caught	O
hastily	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
flames	O

and	O
if	O
we	O
would	O
accept	O
it	O
they	O
were	O
ordered	O
to	O
make	O
an	O
offer	O
of	O
it	O
all	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
they	O
only	O
desired	O
to	O

on	O
shore	O
somewhere	O
in	O
our	O
way	O

where	O
,	O
if	O

they	O
might	O
get	O
a	O
passage	O
to	O
France	PNM

My	O

wished	O
to	O
accept	O
their	O
money	O
at	O
first	O
word	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
consider	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
them	O
afterwards	O
;	O

I	O
overruled	O
him	O
in	O
that	O

I	O

what	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
be	O

in	O
a	O

if	O
the	O

captain	O
that	O
took	O
me	O
up	O
at	O

deliverance	O
,	O
I	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
starved	O
,	O
or	O
have	O
been	O
as	O
much	O
a	O
slave	O
at	O
the	O
Brazils	PNM
as	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
at	O
Barbary	PNM
,	O
the	O
mere	O
being	O
sold	O
to	O
a	O
Mahometan	O
excepted	O
;	O
and	O
perhaps	O
a	O
Portuguese	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
much	O
better	O
master	O
than	O
a	O
Turk	O
,	O
if	O
not	O
in	O
some	O
cases	O
much	O
worse	O
.	O

I	O
therefore	O
told	O
the	O
French	O
captain	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
taken	O
them	O
up	O
in	O
their	O
distress	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
true	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
our	O
duty	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
fellow-creatures	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
would	O
desire	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
delivered	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
like	O
or	O
any	O
other	O
extremity	O
;	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
done	O
nothing	O
for	O
them	O
but	O
what	O
we	O
believed	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
done	O
for	O
us	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
their	O
case	O
and	O
they	O
in	O
ours	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
we	O
took	O
them	O
up	O
to	O
save	O
them	O
,	O
not	O
to	O
plunder	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
most	O
barbarous	O
thing	O
to	O
take	O
that	O
little	O
from	O
them	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
saved	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
fire	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
set	O
them	O
on	O
shore	O
and	O
leave	O
them	O
;	O
that	O
this	O
would	O
be	O
first	O
to	O
save	O
them	O
from	O
death	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
kill	O
them	O
ourselves	O
:	O
save	O
them	O
from	O
drowning	O
,	O
and	O
abandon	O
them	O
to	O
starving	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
let	O
the	O
least	O
thing	O
be	O
taken	O
from	O
them	O
.	O

As	O
to	O
setting	O
them	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
indeed	O
that	O
was	O
an	O
exceeding	O
difficulty	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
bound	O
to	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
;	O
and	O
though	O
we	O
were	O
driven	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
course	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
were	O
directed	O
by	O
Heaven	O
on	O
purpose	O
for	O
their	O
deliverance	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
us	O
wilfully	O
to	O
change	O
our	O
voyage	O
on	O
their	O
particular	O
account	O
;	O
nor	O
could	O
my	O
nephew	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
answer	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
freighters	O
,	O
with	O
whom	O
he	O
was	O
under	O
charter	O
to	O
pursue	O
his	O
voyage	O
by	O
way	O
of	O
Brazil	PNM
;	O
and	O
all	O
I	O
knew	O
we	O
could	O
do	O
for	O
them	O
was	O
to	O
put	O
ourselves	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
meeting	O
with	O
other	O
ships	O
homeward	O
bound	O
from	O
the	O
West	PNM
Indies	PNM
,	O
and	O
get	O
them	O
a	O
passage	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
to	O
England	PNM
or	O
France	PNM
.	O

The	O
first	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
proposal	O
was	O
so	O
generous	O
and	O
kind	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
but	O
be	O
very	O
thankful	O
for	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
very	O
great	O
consternation	O
,	O
especially	O
the	O
passengers	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
notion	O
of	O
being	O
carried	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
;	O
they	O
then	O
entreated	O
me	O
that	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
driven	O
so	O
far	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
before	O
I	O
met	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
at	O
least	O
keep	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
course	O
to	O
the	O
banks	O
of	O
Newfoundland	PNM
,	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
probable	O
I	O
might	O
meet	O
with	O
some	O
ship	O
or	O
sloop	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
hire	O
to	O
carry	O
them	O
back	O
to	O
Canada	PNM
.	O

I	O
thought	O
this	O
was	O
but	O
a	O
reasonable	O
request	O
on	O
their	O
part	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
I	O
inclined	O
to	O
agree	O
to	O
it	O
;	O
for	O
indeed	O
I	O
considered	O
that	O
to	O
carry	O
this	O
whole	O
company	O
to	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
would	O
not	O
only	O
be	O
an	O
intolerable	O
severity	O
upon	O
the	O
poor	O
people	O
,	O
but	O
would	O
be	O
ruining	O
our	O
whole	O
voyage	O
by	O
devouring	O
all	O
our	O
provisions	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
no	O
breach	O
of	O
charter-party	O
,	O
but	O
what	O
an	O
unforeseen	O
accident	O
made	O
absolutely	O
necessary	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
which	O
no	O
one	O
could	O
say	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
blame	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
laws	O
of	O
God	O
and	O
nature	O
would	O
have	O
forbid	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
refuse	O
to	O
take	O
up	O
two	O
boats	O
full	O
of	O
people	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
distressed	O
condition	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
thing	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
respecting	O
ourselves	O
as	O
the	O
poor	O
people	O
,	O
obliged	O
us	O
to	O
set	O
them	O
on	O
shore	O
somewhere	O
or	O
other	O
for	O
their	O
deliverance	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
consented	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
carry	O
them	O
to	O
Newfoundland	PNM
,	O
if	O
wind	O
and	O
weather	O
would	O
permit	O
:	O
and	O
if	O
not	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
carry	O
them	O
to	O
Martinico	PNM
,	O
in	O
the	O
West	PNM
Indies	PNM
.	O

The	O
wind	O
continued	O
fresh	O
easterly	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
weather	O
pretty	O
good	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
the	O
winds	O
had	O
continued	O
in	O
the	O
points	O
between	O
NE	O
.	O

and	O
SE	O
.	O

a	O
long	O
time	O
,	O
we	O
missed	O
several	O
opportunities	O
of	O
sending	O
them	O
to	O
France	PNM
;	O
for	O
we	O
met	O
several	O
ships	O
bound	O
to	O
Europe	PNM
,	O
whereof	O
two	O
were	O
French	O
,	O
from	O
St.	PNM
Christopher	PNM
's	PNM
,	O
but	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
long	O
beating	O
up	O
against	O
the	O
wind	O
that	O
they	O
durst	O
take	O
in	O
no	O
passengers	O
,	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
wanting	O
provisions	O
for	O
the	O
voyage	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
for	O
themselves	O
as	O
for	O
those	O
they	O
should	O
take	O
in	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
about	O
a	O
week	O
after	O
this	O
that	O
we	O
made	O
the	O
banks	O
of	O
Newfoundland	PNM
;	O
where	O
,	O
to	O
shorten	O
my	O
story	O
,	O
we	O
put	O
all	O
our	O
French	O
people	O
on	O
board	O
a	O
bark	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
hired	O
at	O
sea	O
there	O
,	O
to	O
put	O
them	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
afterwards	O
to	O
carry	O
them	O
to	O
France	PNM
,	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
get	O
provisions	O
to	O
victual	O
themselves	O
with	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
say	O
all	O
the	O
French	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
remember	O
that	O
the	O
young	O
priest	O
I	O
spoke	O
of	O
,	O
hearing	O
we	O
were	O
bound	O
to	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
,	O
desired	O
to	O
go	O
the	O
voyage	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
be	O
set	O
on	O
shore	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Coromandel	PNM
;	O
which	O
I	O
readily	O
agreed	O
to	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
wonderfully	O
liked	O
the	O
man	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
very	O
good	O
reason	O
,	O
as	O
will	O
appear	O
afterwards	O
;	O
also	O
four	O
of	O
the	O
seamen	O
entered	O
themselves	O
on	O
our	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
proved	O
very	O
useful	O
fellows	O
.	O

From	O
hence	O
we	O
directed	O
our	O
course	O
for	O
the	O
West	PNM

steering	O
away	O

CHAPTER	O

INTERVENING	O
HISTORY	O
OF	O
COLONY	O
It	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
27	O
degrees	O

N.	O

on	O
the	O
19th	O
day	O
of	O
March	O
1694-95	O

when	O
we	O
spied	O
a	O
sail	O
,	O
our	O
course	O
SE	O
.	O

and	O
by	O
S	O
.	O

We	O
soon	O
perceived	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
large	O
vessel	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
she	O
bore	O
up	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
not	O
at	O
first	O
know	O
what	O
to	O
make	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
till	O
,	O
after	O
coming	O
a	O
little	O
nearer	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
she	O
had	O
lost	O
her	O
main-topmast	O
,	O
fore-mast	O
,	O
and	O
bowsprit	O
;	O
and	O
presently	O
she	O
fired	O
a	O
gun	O
as	O
a	O
signal	O
of	O
distress	O
.	O

The	O
weather	O
was	O
pretty	O
good	O
,	O
wind	O
at	O
NNW	O

a	O
fresh	O
gale	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
soon	O
came	O
to	O
speak	O
with	O
her	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
her	O
a	O
ship	O
of	O
Bristol	PNM
,	O
bound	O
home	O
from	O
Barbadoes	PNM
,	O
but	O
had	O
been	O
blown	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
road	O
at	O
Barbadoes	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
before	O
she	O
was	O
ready	O
to	O
sail	O
,	O
by	O
a	O
terrible	O
hurricane	O
,	O
while	O
the	O
captain	O
and	O
chief	O
mate	O
were	O
both	O
gone	O
on	O
shore	O
;	O
so	O
that	O

besides	O
the	O
terror	O
of	O
the	O

they	O
were	O
in	O
an	O
indifferent	O
case	O
for	O
good	O
mariners	O
to	O
bring	O
the	O
ship	O
home	O

They	O
had	O
been	O
already	O
nine	O
weeks	O
at	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
another	O
terrible	O
storm	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
hurricane	O
was	O
over	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
blown	O
them	O
quite	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
knowledge	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O

and	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
lost	O
their	O
masts	O

They	O
told	O
us	O
they	O
expected	O
to	O
have	O
seen	O
the	O
Bahama	PNM
Islands	PNM

but	O
were	O
then	O
driven	O
away	O
again	O
to	O
the	O
south-east	O

by	O
a	O
strong	O
gale	O
of	O
wind	O
at	O

the	O

that	O
blew	O
now	O

no	O

the	O
ship	O
with	O

a	O

and	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
square	O

upon	O
a	O

were	O

the	O
Canaries	PNM

But	O
that	O
which	O
was	O
worst	O
of	O
all	O
was	O

that	O
they	O
were	O
almost	O
starved	O
for	O

besides	O
the	O
fatigues	O
they	O

the	O

The	O

relief	O
they	O
had	O
was	O

their	O
water	O
was	O
not	O

and	O
they	O
had	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
barrel	O

they	O
had	O
sugar	O

at	O

they	O

was	O
afraid	O
to	O
inquire	O
after	O
them	O
,	O
''	O
said	O
he	O
,	O
``	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
relieve	O
them	O
with	O
.	O
''	O

We	O
immediately	O
applied	O
ourselves	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
what	O
relief	O
we	O
could	O
spare	O
;	O
and	O
indeed	O
I	O
had	O
so	O
far	O
overruled	O
things	O
with	O
my	O
nephew	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
victualled	O
them	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
gone	O
away	O
to	O
Virginia	PNM
,	O
or	O
any	O
other	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
America	PNM
,	O
to	O
have	O
supplied	O
ourselves	O
;	O
but	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
necessity	O
for	O
that	O
.	O

But	O
now	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
a	O
new	O
danger	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
afraid	O
of	O
eating	O
too	O
much	O
,	O
even	O
of	O
that	O
little	O
we	O
gave	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
mate	O
,	O
or	O
commander	O
,	O
brought	O
six	O
men	O
with	O
him	O
in	O
his	O
boat	O
;	O
but	O
these	O
poor	O
wretches	O
looked	O
like	O
skeletons	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
so	O
weak	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
hardly	O
sit	O
to	O
their	O
oars	O
.	O

The	O
mate	O
himself	O
was	O
very	O
ill	O
,	O
and	O
half	O
starved	O
;	O
for	O
he	O
declared	O
he	O
had	O
reserved	O
nothing	O
from	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
share	O
and	O
share	O
alike	O
with	O
them	O
in	O
every	O
bit	O
they	O
ate	O
.	O

I	O
cautioned	O
him	O
to	O
eat	O
sparingly	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
meat	O
before	O
him	O
immediately	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
eaten	O
three	O
mouthfuls	O
before	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
sick	O
and	O
out	O
of	O
order	O
;	O
so	O
he	O
stopped	O
a	O
while	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
surgeon	O
mixed	O
him	O
up	O
something	O
with	O
some	O
broth	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
said	O
would	O
be	O
to	O
him	O
both	O
food	O
and	O
physic	O
;	O
and	O
after	O
he	O
had	O
taken	O
it	O
he	O
grew	O
better	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
meantime	O
I	O
forgot	O
not	O
the	O
men	O
.	O

I	O
ordered	O
victuals	O
to	O
be	O
given	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
poor	O
creatures	O
rather	O
devoured	O
than	O
ate	O
it	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
exceedingly	O
hungry	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
a	O
manner	O
ravenous	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
no	O
command	O
of	O
themselves	O
;	O
and	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
ate	O
with	O
so	O
much	O
greediness	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
danger	O
of	O
their	O
lives	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
.	O

The	O
sight	O
of	O
these	O
people	O
's	O
distress	O
was	O
very	O
moving	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
to	O
mind	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
terrible	O
prospect	O
of	O
at	O
my	O
first	O
coming	O
on	O
shore	O
in	O
my	O
island	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
the	O
least	O
mouthful	O
of	O
food	O
,	O
or	O
any	O
prospect	O
of	O
procuring	O
any	O
;	O
besides	O
the	O
hourly	O
apprehensions	O
I	O
had	O
of	O
being	O
made	O
the	O
food	O
of	O
other	O
creatures	O
.	O

But	O
all	O
the	O
while	O
the	O
mate	O
was	O
thus	O
relating	O
to	O
me	O
the	O
miserable	O
condition	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
put	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
thought	O
the	O
story	O
he	O
had	O
told	O
me	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
poor	O
creatures	O
in	O
the	O
great	O
cabin	O
,	O
viz.	O
the	O
mother	O
,	O
her	O
son	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
maid-servant	O
,	O
whom	O
he	O
had	O
heard	O
nothing	O
of	O
for	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
,	O
and	O
whom	O
,	O
he	O
seemed	O
to	O
confess	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
wholly	O
neglected	O
,	O
their	O
own	O
extremities	O
being	O
so	O
great	O
;	O
by	O
which	O
I	O
understood	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
really	O
given	O
them	O
no	O
food	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
therefore	O
they	O
must	O
be	O
perished	O
,	O
and	O
be	O
all	O
lying	O
dead	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
floor	O
or	O
deck	O
of	O
the	O
cabin	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
therefore	O
kept	O
the	O
mate	O
,	O
whom	O
we	O
then	O
called	O
captain	O
,	O
on	O
board	O
with	O
his	O
men	O
,	O
to	O
refresh	O
them	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
also	O
forgot	O
not	O
the	O
starving	O
crew	O
that	O
were	O
left	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
but	O
ordered	O
my	O
own	O
boat	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
with	O
my	O
mate	O
and	O
twelve	O
men	O
,	O
to	O
carry	O
them	O
a	O
sack	O
of	O
bread	O
,	O
and	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
pieces	O
of	O
beef	O
to	O
boil	O
.	O

Our	O
surgeon	O
charged	O
the	O
men	O
to	O
cause	O
the	O
meat	O
to	O
be	O
boiled	O
while	O
they	O
stayed	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
keep	O
guard	O
in	O
the	O
cook-room	O
,	O
to	O
prevent	O
the	O
men	O
taking	O
it	O
to	O
eat	O
raw	O
,	O
or	O
taking	O
it	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
pot	O
before	O
it	O
was	O
well	O
boiled	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
to	O
give	O
every	O
man	O
but	O
a	O
very	O
little	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
:	O
and	O
by	O
this	O
caution	O
he	O
preserved	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
would	O
otherwise	O
have	O
killed	O
themselves	O
with	O
that	O
very	O
food	O
that	O
was	O
given	O
them	O
on	O
purpose	O
to	O
save	O
their	O
lives	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
mate	O
to	O
go	O
into	O
the	O
great	O
cabin	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
what	O
condition	O
the	O
poor	O
passengers	O
were	O
in	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
alive	O
,	O
to	O
comfort	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
give	O
them	O
what	O
refreshment	O
was	O
proper	O
:	O
and	O
the	O
surgeon	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
large	O
pitcher	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
prepared	O
broth	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
given	O
the	O
mate	O
that	O
was	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
question	O
would	O
restore	O
them	O
gradually	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
not	O
satisfied	O
with	O
this	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
above	O
,	O
having	O
a	O
great	O
mind	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
scene	O
of	O
misery	O
which	O
I	O
knew	O
the	O
ship	O
itself	O
would	O
present	O
me	O
with	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
more	O
lively	O
manner	O
than	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
it	O
by	O
report	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
the	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
now	O
called	O
him	O
,	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
myself	O
,	O
a	O
little	O
after	O
,	O
in	O
their	O
boat	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
the	O
poor	O
men	O
on	O
board	O
almost	O
in	O
a	O
tumult	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
victuals	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
boiler	O
before	O
it	O
was	O
ready	O
;	O
but	O
my	O
mate	O
observed	O
his	O
orders	O
,	O
and	O
kept	O
a	O
good	O
guard	O
at	O
the	O
cook-room	O
door	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
man	O
he	O
placed	O
there	O
,	O
after	O
using	O
all	O
possible	O
persuasion	O
to	O
have	O
patience	O
,	O
kept	O
them	O
off	O
by	O
force	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
he	O
caused	O
some	O
biscuit-cakes	O
to	O
be	O
dipped	O
in	O
the	O
pot	O
,	O
and	O
softened	O
with	O
the	O
liquor	O
of	O
the	O
meat	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
called	O
brewis	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
them	O
every	O
one	O
some	O
to	O
stay	O
their	O
stomachs	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
them	O
it	O
was	O
for	O
their	O
own	O
safety	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
but	O
little	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
was	O
all	O
in	O
vain	O
;	O
and	O
had	O
I	O
not	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
own	O
commander	O
and	O
officers	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
good	O
words	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
threats	O
also	O
of	O
giving	O
them	O
no	O
more	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
broken	O
into	O
the	O
cook-room	O
by	O
force	O
,	O
and	O
torn	O
the	O
meat	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
furnace	O
--	O
for	O
words	O
are	O
indeed	O
of	O
very	O
small	O
force	O
to	O
a	O
hungry	O
belly	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
we	O
pacified	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
fed	O
them	O
gradually	O
and	O
cautiously	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
time	O
gave	O
them	O
more	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
filled	O
their	O
bellies	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
men	O
did	O
well	O
enough	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
misery	O
of	O
the	O
poor	O
passengers	O
in	O
the	O
cabin	O
was	O
of	O
another	O
nature	O
,	O
and	O
far	O
beyond	O
the	O
rest	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O
had	O
so	O
little	O
for	O
themselves	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
but	O
too	O
true	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
at	O
first	O
kept	O
them	O
very	O
low	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
totally	O
neglected	O
them	O
:	O
so	O
that	O
for	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
days	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
said	O
they	O
had	O
really	O
no	O
food	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
several	O
days	O
before	O
very	O
little	O

The	O
poor	O
mother	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
men	O
reported	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
woman	O
of	O
sense	O
and	O
good	O
breeding	O
,	O
had	O
spared	O
all	O
she	O
could	O
so	O
affectionately	O
for	O
her	O
son	O
,	O
that	O
at	O
last	O
she	O
entirely	O
sank	O
under	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
the	O
mate	O
of	O
our	O
ship	O
went	O
in	O
,	O
she	O
sat	O
upon	O
the	O
floor	O
on	O

with	O
her	O
back	O
up	O

the	O
sides	O

between	O
two	O

which	O
were	O

and	O
her	O
head	O
sunk	O
between	O
her	O
shoulders	O
like	O
a	O
corpse	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
quite	O
dead	O

My	O
mate	O
said	O
all	O
he	O
could	O
to	O
revive	O
and	O
encourage	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
a	O
spoon	O
put	O
some	O
broth	O
into	O
her	O
mouth	O
.	O

She	O
opened	O
her	O
lips	O
,	O
and	O
lifted	O
up	O
one	O
hand	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
not	O
speak	O
:	O
yet	O
she	O
understood	O
what	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
intimating	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
late	O
for	O
her	O

pointed	O
to	O
her	O
child	O

as	O
if	O
she	O
would	O
have	O
said	O
they	O
should	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
him	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
mate	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
exceedingly	O
moved	O
at	O
the	O
sight	O
,	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
broth	O
into	O
her	O
mouth	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
said	O

got	O
two	O

three	O
spoonfuls	O
down	O
--	O
though	O
I	O
question	O
whether	O
he	O

it	O

but	O
it	O
was	O
too	O

the	O

The	O
youth	O

who	O
was	O
preserved	O
at	O
the	O
price	O
of	O
his	O
most	O
affectionate	O
mother	O
's	O
life	O

was	O
not	O
so	O

he	O
lay	O
in	O
a	O
cabin	O

as	O
one	O
stretched	O
out	O

with	O
hardly	O
any	O
life	O
left	O
in	O
him	O

He	O
had	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
an	O
old	O
glove	O
in	O
his	O
mouth	O
,	O
having	O
eaten	O
up	O
the	O

it	O

however	O
,	O
being	O
young	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
more	O
strength	O
than	O
his	O
mother	O
,	O
the	O
mate	O
got	O
something	O
down	O
his	O
throat	O

and	O
he	O
began	O
sensibly	O
to	O
revive	O
;	O

by	O
giving	O
him	O

some	O
time	O
after	O

two	O

three	O
spoonfuls	O
extraordinary	O

he	O
was	O
very	O
sick	O

and	O
brought	O
it	O
up	O
again	O

But	O
the	O
next	O
care	O
was	O
the	O
poor	O
maid	O
:	O
she	O
lay	O
all	O
along	O
upon	O
the	O
deck	O

hard	O
by	O
her	O

and	O
just	O

down	O
in	O
a	O
fit	O
of	O
apoplexy	O

and	O
struggled	O
for	O

Her	O
limbs	O

not	O

The	O

was	O
about	O
seventeen	O

a	O
pretty	O

a	O

at	O

He	O
begged	O
of	O
the	O
surgeon	O
to	O
speak	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
take	O
him	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
for	O
he	O
said	O
the	O
cruel	O
fellows	O
had	O
murdered	O
his	O
mother	O
:	O
and	O
indeed	O
so	O
they	O
had	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
passively	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
spared	O
a	O
small	O
sustenance	O
to	O
the	O
poor	O
helpless	O
widow	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
but	O
just	O
enough	O
to	O
keep	O
her	O
alive	O
;	O
but	O
hunger	O
knows	O
no	O
friend	O
,	O
no	O

,	O
no	O
justice	O
,	O
no	O

,	O
and	O
therefore	O
is	O
remorseless	O
,	O
and	O
capable	O
of	O
no	O
compassion	O
.	O

The	O
surgeon	O
told	O
him	O
how	O
far	O
we	O
were	O
going	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
carry	O
him	O
away	O
from	O
all	O
his	O
friends	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
him	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
in	O
as	O
bad	O
circumstances	O
almost	O
as	O
those	O
we	O
found	O
him	O
in	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
starving	O
in	O
the	O
world	O

He	O
said	O
it	O
mattered	O
not	O
whither	O
he	O
went	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
was	O
but	O
delivered	O
from	O
the	O
terrible	O
crew	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
among	O
;	O
that	O
the	O
captain	O
-LRB-	O
by	O
which	O
he	O
meant	O
me	O

for	O
he	O
could	O
know	O
nothing	O
of	O
my	O
nephew	O
-RRB-	O
had	O
saved	O
his	O
life	O

and	O
he	O
was	O
sure	O
would	O
not	O
hurt	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
for	O
the	O
maid	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
sure	O
,	O
if	O
she	O
came	O
to	O
herself	O
,	O
she	O
would	O
be	O
very	O
thankful	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
let	O
us	O

them	O
where	O
we	O
would	O

The	O
surgeon	O
represented	O
the	O
case	O
so	O
affectionately	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
I	O
yielded	O

we	O
took	O
them	O
both	O
on	O

eleven	O

as	O
the	O

had	O
a	O

I	O
made	O

which	O

I	O
suppose	O

was	O
not	O

for	O
I	O
could	O
never	O
learn	O
that	O
the	O

came	O
to	O
Bristol	PNM

but	O
was	O

as	O
is	O

but	O
to	O
shorten	O
my	O
story	O

shall	O
observe	O
that	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
my	O
old	O
habitation	O
,	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
10th	O
of	O
April	O
1695	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
with	O
no	O
small	O
difficulty	O
that	O
I	O
found	O
the	O
place	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
it	O
and	O
went	O
to	O
it	O
before	O
on	O
the	O
south	O
and	O
east	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
coming	O
from	O
the	O
Brazils	PNM
,	O
so	O
now	O
,	O
coming	O
in	O
between	O
the	O
main	O
and	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
no	O
chart	O
for	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
nor	O
any	O
landmark	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
it	O
when	O
I	O
saw	O
it	O

or	O

whether	O
I	O

We	O
beat	O
about	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
on	O
several	O
islands	O
in	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
great	O
river	O
Orinoco	PNM
,	O
but	O
none	O
for	O
my	O
purpose	O
;	O
only	O
this	O
I	O
learned	O
by	O
my	O
coasting	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
under	O
one	O
great	O
mistake	O
before	O
,	O
viz.	O
that	O
the	O
continent	O
which	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O
saw	O
from	O
the	O
island	O
I	O
lived	O
in	O
was	O
really	O
no	O
continent	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
long	O
island	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
a	O
ridge	O
of	O
islands	O
,	O
reaching	O
from	O
one	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
extended	O
mouth	O
of	O
that	O
great	O
river	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
savages	O
who	O
came	O
to	O
my	O
island	O
were	O
not	O
properly	O
those	O
which	O
we	O
call	O
Caribbees	O
,	O
but	O
islanders	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
barbarians	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
kind	O
,	O
who	O
inhabited	O
nearer	O
to	O
our	O
side	O
than	O
the	O
rest	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
I	O
visited	O
several	O
of	O
these	O
islands	O
to	O
no	O
purpose	O
;	O
some	O
I	O
found	O
were	O
inhabited	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
were	O
not	O
;	O
on	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
I	O
found	O
some	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
and	O
thought	O
they	O
had	O
lived	O
there	O
;	O
but	O
speaking	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
found	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
sloop	O
lying	O
in	O
a	O
small	O
creek	O
hard	O
by	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
thither	O
to	O
make	O
salt	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
catch	O
some	O
pearl-mussels	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
belonged	O
to	O
the	O
Isle	PNM
de	PNM
Trinidad	PNM
,	O
which	O
lay	O
farther	O
north	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
10	O
and	O
11	O
degrees	O

Thus	O
coasting	O
from	O
one	O
island	O
to	O
another	O
,	O
sometimes	O
with	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
sometimes	O
with	O
the	O
Frenchman	O
's	O
shallop	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
found	O
a	O
convenient	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
kept	O
her	O
with	O
their	O
very	O
good	O
will	O
,	O
at	O
length	O
I	O
came	O
fair	O
on	O
the	O
south	O
side	O
of	O
my	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
presently	O
knew	O
the	O
very	O
countenance	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
:	O
so	O
I	O
brought	O
the	O
ship	O
safe	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O

broadside	O
with	O
the	O
little	O

I	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
hit	O
the	O
place	O
:	O
for	O
the	O
fellow	O
was	O
right	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
found	O
upon	O
inquiry	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
;	O
and	O
there	O
were	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
men	O
all	O
together	O
,	O
who	O
stood	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
not	O
knowing	O
what	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
us	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
Friday	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
saw	O
people	O
,	O
I	O
caused	O
the	O
English	O
ancient	O
to	O
be	O
spread	O
,	O
and	O
fired	O
three	O
guns	O
,	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
notice	O
we	O
were	O
friends	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
about	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
after	O
we	O
perceived	O
a	O
smoke	O
arise	O
from	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
creek	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
immediately	O
ordered	O
the	O
boat	O
out	O
,	O
taking	O
Friday	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
hanging	O
out	O
a	O
white	O
flag	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
directly	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
taking	O
with	O
me	O
the	O
young	O
friar	O
I	O
mentioned	O
,	O
to	O
whom	O
I	O
had	O
told	O
the	O
story	O
of	O
my	O
living	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
every	O
particular	O
both	O
of	O
myself	O
and	O
those	O
I	O
left	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
was	O
on	O
that	O
account	O
extremely	O
desirous	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
me	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
,	O
besides	O
,	O
about	O
sixteen	O
men	O
well	O
armed	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
found	O
any	O
new	O
guests	O
there	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
of	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
need	O
of	O
weapons	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
upon	O
the	O
tide	O
of	O
flood	O
,	O
near	O
high	O
water	O
,	O
we	O
rowed	O
directly	O
into	O
the	O
creek	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
first	O
man	O
I	O
fixed	O
my	O
eye	O
upon	O
was	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
whose	O
life	O
I	O
had	O
saved	O
,	O
and	O
whom	O
I	O
knew	O
by	O
his	O
face	O
perfectly	O
well	O
:	O
as	O
to	O
his	O
habit	O
,	O
I	O
shall	O
describe	O
it	O
afterwards	O
.	O

I	O
ordered	O
nobody	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
at	O
first	O
but	O
myself	O
;	O
but	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
keeping	O
Friday	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
affectionate	O
creature	O
had	O
spied	O
his	O
father	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
off	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
I	O
saw	O
nothing	O
of	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
not	O
let	O
him	O
go	O
ashore	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
jumped	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
no	O
sooner	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
flew	O
away	O
to	O
his	O
father	O
like	O
an	O
arrow	O
out	O
of	O
a	O
bow	O
.	O

It	O
would	O
have	O
made	O
any	O
man	O
shed	O
tears	O
,	O
in	O
spite	O
of	O
the	O
firmest	O
resolution	O
,	O
to	O
have	O
seen	O
the	O
first	O
transports	O
of	O
this	O
poor	O
fellow	O
's	O
joy	O
when	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
his	O
father	O
:	O
how	O
he	O
embraced	O
him	O
,	O
kissed	O
him	O
,	O
stroked	O
his	O
face	O
,	O
took	O
him	O
up	O
in	O
his	O
arms	O
,	O
set	O
him	O
down	O
upon	O
a	O
tree	O
,	O
and	O
lay	O
down	O
by	O
him	O
;	O
then	O
stood	O
and	O
looked	O
at	O
him	O
,	O
as	O
any	O
one	O
would	O
look	O
at	O
a	O
strange	O
picture	O
,	O
for	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
together	O
;	O
then	O
lay	O
down	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
stroked	O
his	O
legs	O
,	O
and	O
kissed	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
got	O
up	O
again	O
and	O
stared	O
at	O
him	O
;	O
one	O
would	O
have	O
thought	O
the	O
fellow	O
bewitched	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
made	O
a	O
dog	O
laugh	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
to	O
see	O
how	O
his	O
passion	O
ran	O
out	O
another	O
way	O
:	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
he	O
walked	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
with	O
his	O
father	O
several	O
hours	O
,	O
always	O
leading	O
him	O
by	O
the	O
hand	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
lady	O
;	O
and	O
every	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
he	O
would	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
to	O
fetch	O
something	O
or	O
other	O
for	O
him	O
,	O
either	O
a	O
lump	O
of	O
sugar	O
,	O
a	O
dram	O
,	O
a	O
biscuit	O
,	O
or	O
something	O
or	O
other	O
that	O
was	O
good	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
his	O
frolics	O
ran	O
another	O
way	O
;	O
for	O
then	O
he	O
would	O
set	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
down	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
dance	O
about	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
a	O
thousand	O
antic	O
gestures	O
;	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
while	O
he	O
did	O
this	O
he	O
would	O
be	O
talking	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
telling	O
him	O
one	O
story	O
or	O
another	O
of	O
his	O
travels	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
what	O
had	O
happened	O
to	O
him	O
abroad	O
to	O
divert	O
him	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
same	O
filial	O
affection	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
in	O
Christians	O
to	O
their	O
parents	O
in	O
our	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
one	O
would	O
be	O
tempted	O
to	O
say	O
there	O
would	O
hardly	O
have	O
been	O
any	O
need	O
of	O
the	O
fifth	O
commandment	O

But	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
digression	O
:	O
I	O
return	O
to	O
my	O
landing	O
.	O

It	O
would	O
be	O
needless	O
to	O
take	O
notice	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
ceremonies	O
and	O
civilities	O
that	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
received	O
me	O
with	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
Spaniard	O
,	O
whom	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
I	O
knew	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
was	O
he	O
whose	O
life	O
I	O
had	O
saved	O
.	O

He	O
came	O
towards	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
attended	O
by	O
one	O
more	O
,	O
carrying	O
a	O
flag	O
of	O
truce	O
also	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
not	O
only	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
me	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
thoughts	O
,	O
no	O
notion	O
of	O
its	O
being	O
me	O
that	O
was	O
come	O
,	O
till	O
I	O
spoke	O
to	O
him	O
.	O

``	O
Seignior	O
,	O
''	O
said	O
I	O
,	O
in	O
Portuguese	O
,	O
``	O
do	O
you	O
not	O
know	O
me	O
?	O
''	O

At	O
which	O
he	O
spoke	O
not	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
but	O
giving	O
his	O
musket	O
to	O
the	O
man	O
that	O
was	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
threw	O
his	O
arms	O
abroad	O
,	O
saying	O
something	O
in	O
Spanish	O
that	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
perfectly	O
hear	O
,	O
came	O
forward	O
and	O
embraced	O
me	O
,	O
telling	O
me	O
he	O
was	O
inexcusable	O
not	O
to	O
know	O
that	O
face	O
again	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
once	O
seen	O
,	O
as	O
of	O
an	O
angel	O
from	O
heaven	O
sent	O
to	O
save	O
his	O
life	O
;	O
he	O
said	O
abundance	O
of	O
very	O
handsome	O
things	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
well-bred	O
Spaniard	O
always	O
knows	O
how	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
beckoning	O
to	O
the	O
person	O
that	O
attended	O
him	O
,	O
bade	O
him	O
go	O
and	O
call	O
out	O
his	O
comrades	O
.	O

He	O
then	O
asked	O
me	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
walk	O
to	O
my	O
old	O
habitation	O
,	O
where	O
he	O
would	O
give	O
me	O
possession	O
of	O
my	O
own	O
house	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
I	O
should	O
see	O
they	O
had	O
made	O
but	O
mean	O
improvements	O

I	O
walked	O
along	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
alas	O
!	O

I	O
could	O
no	O
more	O
find	O
the	O
place	O
than	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
never	O
been	O
there	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
planted	O
so	O
many	O
trees	O

placed	O
them	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
position	O

so	O
thick	O
and	O
close	O
to	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
ten	O
years	O
'	O
time	O
they	O
were	O
grown	O
so	O
big	O

that	O
the	O
place	O
was	O
inaccessible	O

except	O
by	O
such	O

they	O
themselves	O
only	O

who	O

them	O

I	O
asked	O
them	O
what	O
put	O
them	O
upon	O
all	O
these	O
fortifications	O
;	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
I	O
would	O
say	O
there	O
was	O
need	O
enough	O
of	O
it	O
when	O
they	O
had	O
given	O
me	O
an	O
account	O
how	O
they	O
had	O
passed	O
their	O
time	O
since	O
their	O

after	O
they	O
had	O
the	O
misfortune	O
to	O

that	O
I	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
could	O
not	O

have	O
some	O
pleasure	O
in	O
my	O
good	O
fortune	O

when	O

that	O

was	O
gone	O
in	O
a	O
good	O
ship	O

and	O
to	O
my	O
satisfaction	O

and	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
oftentimes	O
a	O
strong	O
persuasion	O
that	O
one	O
time	O

other	O
he	O
should	O
see	O
me	O
again	O

nothing	O
that	O
ever	O
befell	O
him	O
in	O
his	O

so	O

nothing	O

me	O

in	O

they	O
had	O
so	O

more	O

I	O

The	O

,	O
and	O
conduct	O
in	O

the	O
island	O
after	O
my	O
going	O
away	O
is	O
so	O
very	O
remarkable	O

and	O
has	O
so	O
many	O
incidents	O
which	O
the	O
former	O
part	O
of	O
my	O
relation	O
will	O
help	O
to	O
understand	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
will	O
in	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
particulars	O
,	O
refer	O
to	O
the	O
account	O
I	O
have	O
already	O
given	O

that	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
but	O
commit	O
them	O

with	O
great	O
delight	O

to	O
the	O
reading	O
of	O
those	O
that	O
come	O
after	O

In	O
order	O
to	O
do	O
this	O
as	O
intelligibly	O
as	O
I	O
can	O
,	O
I	O
must	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
circumstances	O
in	O
which	O
I	O
left	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
persons	O
on	O
it	O

of	O
whom	O
I	O
am	O
to	O
speak	O
.	O

And	O
first	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
necessary	O
to	O
repeat	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
sent	O
away	O
Friday	O
's	O
father	O
and	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
-LRB-	O
the	O
two	O
whose	O
lives	O
I	O
had	O
rescued	O
from	O
the	O
savages	O
-RRB-	O
in	O
a	O
large	O
canoe	O
to	O
the	O
main	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
then	O
thought	O
it	O
,	O
to	O
fetch	O
over	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
's	O
companions	O
that	O
he	O
left	O
behind	O
him	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
save	O
them	O
from	O
the	O
like	O
calamity	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
succour	O
them	O
for	O
the	O
present	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
together	O
find	O
some	O
way	O
for	O
our	O
deliverance	O
afterwards	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
sent	O
them	O
away	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
visible	O
appearance	O
of	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
least	O
room	O
to	O
hope	O
for	O
,	O
my	O
own	O
deliverance	O
,	O
any	O
more	O
than	O
I	O
had	O
twenty	O
years	O
before	O
--	O
much	O
less	O
had	O
I	O
any	O
foreknowledge	O
of	O
what	O
afterwards	O
happened	O
,	O
I	O
mean	O
,	O
of	O
an	O
English	O
ship	O
coming	O
on	O
shore	O
there	O
to	O
fetch	O
me	O
off	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
but	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
surprise	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
back	O
,	O
not	O
only	O
to	O
find	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
gone	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
find	O
three	O
strangers	O
left	O
on	O
the	O
spot	O
,	O
possessed	O
of	O
all	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
left	O
behind	O
me	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
otherwise	O
have	O
been	O
their	O
own	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
thing	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
inquired	O
into	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
begin	O
where	O
I	O
left	O
off	O
,	O
was	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
part	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
desired	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
would	O
give	O
me	O
a	O
particular	O
account	O
of	O
his	O
voyage	O
back	O
to	O
his	O
countrymen	O
with	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
sent	O
him	O
to	O
fetch	O
them	O
over	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
there	O
was	O
little	O
variety	O
in	O
that	O
part	O
,	O
for	O
nothing	O
remarkable	O
happened	O
to	O
them	O
on	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
having	O
had	O
very	O
calm	O
weather	O
and	O
a	O
smooth	O
sea	O
.	O

As	O
for	O
his	O
countrymen	O
,	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
doubted	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
overjoyed	O
to	O
see	O
him	O
-LRB-	O
it	O
seems	O
he	O
was	O
the	O
principal	O
man	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
vessel	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
shipwrecked	O
in	O
having	O
been	O
dead	O
some	O
time	O
-RRB-	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
the	O
more	O
surprised	O
to	O
see	O
him	O
,	O
because	O
they	O
knew	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
fallen	O
into	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
satisfied	O
,	O
would	O
devour	O
him	O
as	O
they	O
did	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
their	O
prisoners	O
;	O
that	O
when	O
he	O
told	O
them	O
the	O
story	O
of	O
his	O
deliverance	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
what	O
manner	O
he	O
was	O
furnished	O
for	O
carrying	O
them	O
away	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
like	O
a	O
dream	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
astonishment	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
was	O
somewhat	O
like	O
that	O
of	O
Joseph	O
's	O
brethren	O
when	O
he	O
told	O
them	O
who	O
he	O
was	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
story	O
of	O
his	O
exaltation	O
in	O
Pharaoh	O
's	O
court	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
he	O
showed	O
them	O
the	O
arms	O
,	O
the	O
powder	O
,	O
the	O
ball	O
,	O
the	O
provisions	O
that	O
he	O
brought	O
them	O
for	O
their	O
journey	O
or	O
voyage	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
restored	O
to	O
themselves	O
,	O
took	O
a	O
just	O
share	O
of	O
the	O
joy	O
of	O
their	O
deliverance	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
prepared	O
to	O
come	O
away	O
with	O
him	O
.	O

Their	O
first	O
business	O
was	O
to	O
get	O
canoes	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
this	O
they	O
were	O
obliged	O
not	O
to	O
stick	O
so	O
much	O
upon	O
the	O
honesty	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
trespass	O
upon	O
their	O
friendly	O
savages	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
borrow	O
two	O
large	O
canoes	O
,	O
or	O
periaguas	O
,	O
on	O
pretence	O
of	O
going	O
out	O
a-fishing	O
,	O
or	O
for	O
pleasure	O
.	O

In	O
these	O
they	O
came	O
away	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
.	O

It	O
seems	O
they	O
wanted	O
no	O
time	O
to	O
get	O
themselves	O
ready	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
neither	O
clothes	O
nor	O
provisions	O
,	O
nor	O
anything	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
but	O
what	O
they	O
had	O
on	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
few	O
roots	O
to	O
eat	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
used	O
to	O
make	O
their	O
bread	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
in	O
all	O
three	O
weeks	O
absent	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
unluckily	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
occasion	O
offered	O
for	O
my	O
escape	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
mentioned	O
in	O
the	O
other	O
part	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
get	O
off	O
from	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
leaving	O
three	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
impudent	O
,	O
hardened	O
,	O
ungoverned	O
,	O
disagreeable	O
villains	O
behind	O
me	O
that	O
any	O
man	O
could	O
desire	O
to	O
meet	O
with	O
--	O
to	O
the	O
poor	O
Spaniards	O
'	O
great	O
grief	O
and	O
disappointment	O
.	O

The	O
only	O
just	O
thing	O
the	O
rogues	O
did	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
when	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
came	O
ashore	O
,	O
they	O
gave	O
my	O
letter	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
them	O
provisions	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
relief	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
ordered	O
them	O
to	O
do	O
;	O
also	O
they	O
gave	O
them	O
the	O
long	O
paper	O
of	O
directions	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
left	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
containing	O
the	O
particular	O
methods	O
which	O
I	O
took	O
for	O
managing	O
every	O
part	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
there	O
;	O
the	O
way	O
I	O
baked	O
my	O
bread	O
,	O
bred	O
up	O
tame	O
goats	O
,	O
and	O
planted	O
my	O
corn	O
;	O
how	O
I	O
cured	O
my	O
grapes	O
,	O
made	O
my	O
pots	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
everything	O
I	O
did	O
.	O

All	O
this	O
being	O
written	O
down	O
,	O
they	O
gave	O
to	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
-LRB-	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
understood	O
English	O
well	O
enough	O
-RRB-	O
:	O
nor	O
did	O
they	O
refuse	O
to	O
accommodate	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
with	O
anything	O
else	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
agreed	O
very	O
well	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
.	O

They	O
gave	O
them	O
an	O
equal	O
admission	O
into	O
the	O
house	O
or	O
cave	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
began	O
to	O
live	O
very	O
sociably	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
head	O
Spaniard	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
seen	O
pretty	O
much	O
of	O
my	O
methods	O
,	O
together	O
with	O
Friday	O
's	O
father	O
,	O
managed	O
all	O
their	O
affairs	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
for	O
the	O
Englishmen	O
,	O
they	O
did	O
nothing	O
but	O
ramble	O
about	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
shoot	O
parrots	O
,	O
and	O
catch	O
tortoises	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
home	O
at	O
night	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
provided	O
their	O
suppers	O
for	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
satisfied	O
with	O
this	O
had	O
the	O
others	O
but	O
let	O
them	O
alone	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
find	O
in	O
their	O
hearts	O
to	O
do	O
long	O
:	O
but	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
dog	O
in	O
the	O
manger	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
eat	O
themselves	O
,	O
neither	O
would	O
they	O
let	O
the	O
others	O
eat	O
.	O

The	O
differences	O
,	O
nevertheless	O
,	O
were	O
at	O
first	O
but	O
trivial	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
as	O
are	O
not	O
worth	O
relating	O
,	O
but	O
at	O
last	O
it	O
broke	O
out	O
into	O
open	O
war	O
:	O
and	O
it	O
began	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
rudeness	O
and	O
insolence	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
imagined	O
--	O
without	O
reason	O
,	O
without	O
provocation	O
,	O
contrary	O
to	O
nature	O

and	O
indeed	O
to	O
common	O
sense	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
true	O
,	O
the	O
first	O
relation	O
of	O
it	O
came	O
from	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
themselves	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
may	O
call	O
the	O
accusers	O
,	O
yet	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
examine	O
the	O
fellows	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
deny	O
a	O
word	O
of	O
it	O

But	O
before	O
I	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
particulars	O
of	O
this	O
part	O
,	O
I	O
must	O
supply	O
a	O
defect	O
in	O
my	O
former	O

;	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
,	O
I	O
forgot	O
to	O
set	O
down	O
among	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
that	O
just	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
weighing	O
the	O
anchor	O
to	O
set	O
sail	O
,	O
there	O
happened	O
a	O
little	O
quarrel	O
on	O
board	O
of	O
our	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
once	O
afraid	O
would	O
have	O
turned	O
to	O
a	O
second	O
mutiny	O
;	O
nor	O
was	O
it	O
appeased	O
till	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
rousing	O
up	O
his	O
courage	O
,	O
and	O
taking	O
us	O
all	O
to	O
his	O
assistance	O

parted	O
them	O
by	O
force	O
,	O
and	O
making	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
refractory	O
fellows	O
prisoners	O
,	O
he	O
laid	O
them	O
in	O

and	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
active	O
in	O
the	O
former	O
disorders	O

and	O
let	O
fall	O
some	O
ugly	O
,	O
dangerous	O
words	O
the	O
second	O
time	O
,	O
he	O
threatened	O
to	O
carry	O
them	O
in	O

to	O
England	PNM
,	O
and	O
have	O
them	O
hanged	O
there	O
for	O
mutiny	O
and	O
running	O
away	O
with	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

This	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
captain	O
did	O
not	O
intend	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
,	O
frightened	O
some	O
other	O
men	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
put	O
it	O
into	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
the	O
rest	O
that	O
the	O
captain	O
only	O
gave	O
them	O
good	O
words	O
for	O
the	O
present	O
,	O
till	O
they	O
should	O
come	O
to	O
same	O
English	O
port	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
then	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
all	O
put	O
into	O
gaol	O
,	O
and	O
tried	O
for	O
their	O
lives	O

The	O
mate	O
got	O
intelligence	O
of	O
this	O
,	O
and	O
acquainted	O
us	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
it	O
was	O
desired	O
that	O
I	O
,	O
who	O
still	O
passed	O
for	O
a	O
great	O
man	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
should	O
go	O
down	O
with	O
the	O
mate	O
and	O
satisfy	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
tell	O
them	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
assured	O

if	O
they	O
behaved	O
well	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
voyage	O

all	O
they	O
had	O
done	O
for	O
the	O

So	O
I	O
went	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
passing	O
my	O
honour	O
's	O
word	O
to	O
them	O
they	O
appeared	O
easy	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
more	O
so	O
when	O
I	O
caused	O
the	O
two	O

that	O

to	O
be	O
released	O

But	O
this	O

for	O
that	O
night	O
;	O
the	O
wind	O
also	O
falling	O

we	O
found	O
that	O

that	O
after	O

a	O

to	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
of	O
the	O
barbarous	O
usage	O
they	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
from	O

that	O

the	O

interposed	O
here	O

told	O
them	O
that	O

this	O
very	O
awkwardly	O

with	O
great	O
reluctance	O

the	O

protested	O

However	O
,	O
the	O

told	O
them	O
plainly	O
that	O

live	O
sociably	O

together	O

lived	O
pretty	O
well	O
together	O
for	O
a	O
month	O
or	O
two	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
let	O
them	O
have	O

gave	O
them	O
liberty	O

It	O
was	O

had	O
these	O

an	O

endangered	O

look	O
to	O
the	O

It	O
happened	O
one	O
night	O
that	O
the	O

the	O

whose	O
life	O

had	O
saved	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
now	O
the	O
governor	O
of	O
the	O

found	O
himself	O
very	O
uneasy	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
get	O
any	O
sleep	O
:	O
he	O
was	O
perfectly	O
well	O
in	O
body	O
,	O
only	O
found	O
his	O
thoughts	O
tumultuous	O
;	O
his	O
mind	O
ran	O
upon	O
men	O
fighting	O
and	O
killing	O
one	O
another	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
broad	O
awake	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
not	O
by	O
any	O

get	O
any	O
sleep	O
;	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
he	O
lay	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
,	O
but	O
growing	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
uneasy	O
,	O
he	O
resolved	O
to	O
rise	O
.	O

As	O
they	O
lay	O
,	O
being	O
so	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
on	O
goat-skins	O
laid	O
thick	O
upon	O
such	O
couches	O
and	O
pads	O
as	O
they	O
made	O
for	O
themselves	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
had	O
little	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
willing	O
to	O
rise	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
get	O
upon	O
their	O
feet	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
put	O
on	O
a	O
coat	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
pumps	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
ready	O
for	O
going	O
any	O
way	O
that	O
their	O
thoughts	O
guided	O
them	O
.	O

Being	O
thus	O
got	O
up	O
,	O
he	O
looked	O
out	O
;	O
but	O
being	O
dark	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
see	O
little	O
or	O
nothing	O
,	O
and	O
besides	O
,	O
the	O
trees	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
planted	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
were	O
now	O
grown	O
tall	O
,	O
intercepted	O
his	O
sight	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
only	O
look	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
starlight	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
hearing	O
no	O
noise	O
,	O
he	O
returned	O
and	O
lay	O
down	O
again	O
;	O
but	O
to	O
no	O
purpose	O
;	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
compose	O
himself	O
to	O
anything	O
like	O
rest	O
;	O
but	O
his	O
thoughts	O
were	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
degree	O
uneasy	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
knew	O
not	O
for	O
what	O
.	O

Having	O
made	O
some	O
noise	O
with	O
rising	O
and	O
walking	O
about	O
,	O
going	O
out	O
and	O
coming	O
in	O
,	O
another	O
of	O
them	O
waked	O
,	O
and	O
asked	O
who	O
it	O
was	O
that	O
was	O
up	O

The	O
governor	O
told	O
him	O
how	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
with	O
him	O

``	O

the	O

had	O
kept	O
possession	O

on	O

the	O

could	O
not	O

whatever	O

was	O

it	O
was	O
their	O

not	O
a	O

of	O

should	O
have	O
escaped	O
,	O
which	O
could	O
only	O
have	O
been	O
by	O
getting	O
in	O
between	O
them	O
and	O
their	O
boats	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
presence	O
of	O
mind	O
was	O
wanting	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
ruin	O
of	O
their	O
tranquillity	O
for	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
.	O

We	O
need	O
not	O
doubt	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
governor	O
and	O
the	O
man	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
surprised	O
with	O
this	O
sight	O
,	O
ran	O
back	O
immediately	O
and	O
raised	O
their	O
fellows	O
,	O
giving	O
them	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
imminent	O
danger	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
again	O
as	O
readily	O
took	O
the	O
alarm	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O
persuade	O
them	O
to	O
stay	O
close	O
within	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
must	O
all	O
run	O
out	O
to	O
see	O
how	O
things	O
stood	O
.	O

While	O
it	O
was	O
dark	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
safe	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
had	O
opportunity	O
enough	O
for	O
some	O
hours	O
to	O
view	O
the	O
savages	O
by	O
the	O
light	O
of	O
three	O
fires	O
they	O
had	O
made	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
from	O
one	O
another	O
;	O
what	O
they	O
were	O
doing	O
they	O
knew	O
not	O
,	O
neither	O
did	O
they	O
know	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
themselves	O
.	O

For	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
the	O
enemy	O
were	O
too	O
many	O
;	O
and	O
secondly	O
,	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
keep	O
together	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
divided	O
into	O
several	O
parties	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
on	O
shore	O
in	O
several	O
places	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
were	O
in	O
no	O
small	O
consternation	O
at	O
this	O
sight	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
fellows	O
went	O
straggling	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
they	O
made	O
no	O
doubt	O
but	O
,	O
first	O
or	O
last	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
would	O
chop	O
in	O
upon	O
their	O
habitation	O
,	O
or	O
upon	O
some	O
other	O
place	O
where	O
they	O
would	O
see	O
the	O
token	O
of	O
inhabitants	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
great	O
perplexity	O
also	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
their	O
flock	O
of	O
goats	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
destroyed	O
,	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
little	O
less	O
than	O
starving	O
them	O
.	O

So	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
they	O
resolved	O
upon	O
was	O
to	O
despatch	O
three	O
men	O
away	O
before	O
it	O
was	O
light	O
,	O
two	O
Spaniards	O
and	O
one	O
Englishman	O
,	O
to	O
drive	O
away	O
all	O
the	O
goats	O
to	O
the	O
great	O
valley	O
where	O
the	O
cave	O
was	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
need	O
were	O
,	O
to	O
drive	O
them	O
into	O
the	O
very	O
cave	O
itself	O
.	O

Could	O
they	O
have	O
seen	O
the	O
savages	O
all	O
together	O
in	O
one	O
body	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
from	O
their	O
canoes	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
resolved	O
,	O
if	O
there	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
hundred	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
attack	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
done	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
two	O
miles	O
off	O
from	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
appeared	O
afterwards	O
,	O
were	O
of	O
two	O
different	O
nations	O
.	O

After	O
having	O
mused	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
on	O
the	O
course	O
they	O
should	O
take	O
,	O
they	O
resolved	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
while	O
it	O
was	O
still	O
dark	O
,	O
to	O
send	O
the	O
old	O
savage	O
,	O
Friday	O
's	O
father	O
,	O
out	O
as	O
a	O
spy	O
,	O
to	O
learn	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
something	O
concerning	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
what	O
they	O
came	O
for	O
,	O
what	O
they	O
intended	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
like	O
.	O

The	O
old	O
man	O
readily	O
undertook	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
stripping	O
himself	O
quite	O
naked	O
,	O
as	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
were	O
,	O
away	O
he	O
went	O
.	O

After	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
gone	O
an	O
hour	O
or	O
two	O
,	O
he	O
brings	O
word	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
among	O
them	O
undiscovered	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
found	O
they	O
were	O
two	O
parties	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
two	O
several	O
nations	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
war	O
with	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
battle	O
in	O
their	O
own	O
country	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
both	O
sides	O
having	O
had	O
several	O
prisoners	O
taken	O
in	O
the	O
fight	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
by	O
mere	O
chance	O
,	O
landed	O
all	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
island	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
devouring	O
their	O
prisoners	O
and	O
making	O
merry	O
;	O
but	O
their	O
coming	O
so	O
by	O
chance	O
to	O
the	O
same	O
place	O
had	O
spoiled	O
all	O
their	O
mirth	O
--	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
rage	O
at	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
so	O
near	O
that	O
he	O
believed	O
they	O
would	O
fight	O
again	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
daylight	O
began	O
to	O
appear	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
perceive	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
any	O
notion	O
of	O
anybody	O
being	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
but	O
themselves	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
hardly	O
made	O
an	O
end	O
of	O
telling	O
his	O
story	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
could	O
perceive	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
unusual	O
noise	O
they	O
made	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
two	O
little	O
armies	O
were	O
engaged	O
in	O
a	O
bloody	O
fight	O
.	O

Friday	O
's	O
father	O
used	O
all	O
the	O
arguments	O
he	O
could	O
to	O
persuade	O
our	O
people	O
to	O
lie	O
close	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
be	O
seen	O
;	O
he	O
told	O
them	O
their	O
safety	O
consisted	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
but	O
lie	O
still	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
savages	O
would	O
kill	O
one	O
another	O
to	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
rest	O
would	O
go	O
away	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
to	O
a	O
tittle	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O
prevail	O
,	O
especially	O
upon	O
the	O
Englishmen	O
;	O
their	O
curiosity	O
was	O
so	O
importunate	O
that	O
they	O
must	O
run	O
out	O
and	O
see	O
the	O
battle	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
they	O
used	O
some	O
caution	O
too	O
:	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
go	O
openly	O
,	O
just	O
by	O
their	O
own	O
dwelling	O
,	O
but	O
went	O
farther	O
into	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
and	O
placed	O
themselves	O
to	O
advantage	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
might	O
securely	O
see	O
them	O
manage	O
the	O
fight	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
thought	O
,	O
not	O
be	O
seen	O
by	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
savages	O
did	O
see	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
shall	O
find	O
hereafter	O
.	O

The	O
battle	O
was	O
very	O
fierce	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
might	O
believe	O
the	O
Englishmen	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
said	O
he	O
could	O
perceive	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
men	O
of	O
great	O
bravery	O
,	O
of	O
invincible	O
spirit	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
great	O
policy	O
in	O
guiding	O
the	O
fight	O
.	O

The	O
battle	O
,	O
they	O
said	O
,	O
held	O
two	O
hours	O
before	O
they	O
could	O
guess	O
which	O
party	O
would	O
be	O
beaten	O
;	O
but	O
then	O
that	O
party	O
which	O
was	O
nearest	O
our	O
people	O
's	O
habitation	O
began	O
to	O
appear	O
weakest	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
some	O
time	O
more	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
began	O
to	O
fly	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
put	O
our	O
men	O
again	O
into	O
a	O
great	O
consternation	O
,	O
lest	O
any	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
that	O
fled	O
should	O
run	O
into	O
the	O
grove	O
before	O
their	O
dwelling	O
for	O
shelter	O
,	O
and	O
thereby	O
involuntarily	O
discover	O
the	O
place	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
by	O
consequence	O
,	O
the	O
pursuers	O
would	O
also	O
do	O
the	O
like	O
in	O
search	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
,	O
they	O
resolved	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
stand	O
armed	O
within	O
the	O
wall	O
,	O
and	O
whoever	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
grove	O
,	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
sally	O
out	O
over	O
the	O
wall	O
and	O
kill	O
them	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
not	O
one	O
should	O
return	O
to	O
give	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
they	O
ordered	O
also	O
that	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
done	O
with	O
their	O
swords	O
,	O
or	O
by	O
knocking	O
them	O
down	O
with	O
the	O
stocks	O
of	O
their	O
muskets	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
by	O
shooting	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
raising	O
an	O
alarm	O
by	O
the	O
noise	O
.	O

As	O
they	O
expected	O
it	O
fell	O
out	O
;	O
three	O
of	O
the	O
routed	O
army	O
fled	O
for	O
life	O
,	O
and	O
crossing	O
the	O
creek	O
,	O
ran	O
directly	O
into	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
not	O
in	O
the	O
least	O
knowing	O
whither	O
they	O
went	O
,	O
but	O
running	O
as	O
into	O
a	O
thick	O
wood	O
for	O
shelter	O
.	O

The	O
scout	O
they	O
kept	O
to	O
look	O
abroad	O
gave	O
notice	O
of	O
this	O
within	O
,	O
with	O
this	O
comforting	O
addition	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
conquerors	O
had	O
not	O
pursued	O
them	O
,	O
or	O
seen	O
which	O
way	O
they	O
were	O
gone	O
;	O
upon	O
this	O
the	O
Spanish	O
governor	O
,	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
humanity	O
,	O
would	O
not	O
suffer	O
them	O
to	O
kill	O
the	O
three	O
fugitives	O
,	O
but	O
sending	O
three	O
men	O
out	O
by	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
,	O
ordered	O
them	O
to	O
go	O
round	O
,	O
come	O
in	O
behind	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
surprise	O
and	O
take	O
them	O
prisoners	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
done	O
.	O

The	O
residue	O
of	O
the	O
conquered	O
people	O
fled	O
to	O
their	O
canoes	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
off	O
to	O
sea	O
;	O
the	O
victors	O
retired	O
,	O
made	O
no	O
pursuit	O
,	O
or	O
very	O
little	O
,	O
but	O
drawing	O
themselves	O
into	O
a	O
body	O
together	O
,	O
gave	O
two	O
great	O
screaming	O
shouts	O
,	O
most	O
likely	O
by	O
way	O
of	O
triumph	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
the	O
fight	O
ended	O
;	O
the	O
same	O
day	O
,	O
about	O
three	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
they	O
also	O
marched	O
to	O
their	O
canoes	O
.	O

And	O
thus	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
had	O
the	O
island	O
again	O
free	O
to	O
themselves	O
,	O
their	O
fright	O
was	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
saw	O
no	O
savages	O
for	O
several	O
years	O
after	O
.	O

After	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
gone	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
came	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
den	O
,	O
and	O
viewing	O
the	O
field	O
of	O
battle	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
about	O
two-and-thirty	O
men	O
dead	O
on	O
the	O
spot	O
;	O
some	O
were	O
killed	O
with	O
long	O
arrows	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
found	O
sticking	O
in	O
their	O
bodies	O
;	O
but	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
killed	O
with	O
great	O
wooden	O
swords	O
,	O
sixteen	O
or	O
seventeen	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
field	O
of	O
battle	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
many	O
bows	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
arrows	O
.	O

These	O
swords	O
were	O
strange	O
,	O
unwieldy	O
things	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
must	O
be	O
very	O
strong	O
men	O
that	O
used	O
them	O
;	O
most	O
of	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
killed	O
with	O
them	O
had	O
their	O
heads	O
smashed	O
to	O
pieces	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
may	O
say	O
,	O
or	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
call	O
it	O
in	O
English	O
,	O
their	O
brains	O
knocked	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
several	O
their	O
arms	O
and	O
legs	O
broken	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
evident	O
they	O
fight	O
with	O
inexpressible	O
rage	O
and	O
fury	O

We	O
found	O
not	O
one	O
man	O
that	O
was	O
not	O

either	O

This	O

tamed	O
our	O
ill-disposed	O
Englishmen	O
for	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
;	O
the	O
sight	O
had	O
filled	O
them	O
with	O
horror	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
consequences	O
appeared	O
terrible	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
degree	O
,	O
especially	O
upon	O
supposing	O
that	O
some	O
time	O
or	O
other	O
they	O
should	O
fall	O
into	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
those	O
creatures	O

who	O
would	O
not	O
only	O
kill	O
them	O
as	O
enemies	O
,	O
but	O
for	O
food	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
kill	O
our	O
cattle	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
professed	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
the	O
thoughts	O
of	O
being	O
eaten	O
up	O
like	O
beef	O
and	O
mutton	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
supposed	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
till	O
they	O
were	O
dead	O
,	O
had	O
something	O
in	O
it	O
so	O
horrible	O
that	O
it	O
nauseated	O
their	O
very	O
stomachs	O
,	O
made	O
them	O
sick	O
when	O
they	O
thought	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
filled	O
their	O
minds	O
with	O
such	O
unusual	O
terror	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
themselves	O
for	O
some	O
weeks	O
after	O
.	O

This	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
tamed	O
even	O
the	O
three	O
English	O
brutes	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
speaking	O
of	O
;	O
and	O
for	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
after	O
they	O
were	O
tractable	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
about	O
the	O
common	O
business	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
society	O
well	O
enough	O
--	O
planted	O

,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
all	O
naturalised	O
to	O
the	O
country	O
.	O

But	O
some	O
time	O
after	O
this	O
they	O
fell	O
into	O
such	O
simple	O
measures	O
again	O
as	O
brought	O
them	O
into	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
trouble	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
taken	O
three	O
prisoners	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
observed	O
;	O
and	O
these	O
three	O
being	O
stout	O
young	O
fellows	O
,	O
they	O
made	O
them	O
servants	O
,	O
and	O
taught	O
them	O
to	O
work	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
slaves	O
they	O
did	O
well	O
enough	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
take	O
their	O
measures	O
as	O
I	O
did	O
by	O
my	O
man	O
Friday	O
,	O
viz.	O
to	O
begin	O
with	O
them	O
upon	O
the	O
principle	O
of	O
having	O
saved	O
their	O
lives	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
instruct	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
rational	O
principles	O
of	O
life	O
;	O
much	O
less	O
did	O
they	O
think	O
of	O
teaching	O
them	O
religion	O
,	O
or	O
attempt	O
civilising	O
and	O
reducing	O
them	O
by	O
kind	O
usage	O
and	O
affectionate	O
arguments	O
.	O

As	O
they	O
gave	O
them	O
their	O
food	O
every	O
day	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
gave	O
them	O
their	O
work	O
too	O
,	O
and	O
kept	O
them	O
fully	O
employed	O
in	O
drudgery	O
enough	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
failed	O
in	O
this	O
by	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
never	O
had	O
them	O
to	O
assist	O
them	O
and	O
fight	O
for	O
them	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
my	O
man	O
Friday	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
as	O
true	O
to	O
me	O
as	O
the	O
very	O

But	O

Being	O
all	O
now	O
good	O
friends	O
--	O
for	O
common	O
danger	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
above	O
,	O
had	O
effectually	O
reconciled	O
them	O
--	O
they	O
began	O
to	O
consider	O
their	O
general	O
circumstances	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
that	O
came	O
under	O
consideration	O
was	O
whether	O
,	O
seeing	O
the	O
savages	O
particularly	O
haunted	O
that	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
more	O
remote	O
and	O
retired	O
parts	O
of	O
it	O
equally	O
adapted	O
to	O
their	O
way	O
of	O
living	O
,	O
and	O
manifestly	O
to	O
their	O
advantage	O
,	O
they	O
should	O
not	O
rather	O
move	O
their	O
habitation	O
,	O
and	O
plant	O
in	O
some	O
more	O
proper	O
place	O
for	O
their	O
safety	O
,	O
and	O
especially	O
for	O
the	O
security	O
of	O
their	O
cattle	O
and	O
corn	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
,	O
after	O
long	O
debate	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
concluded	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
remove	O
their	O
habitation	O
;	O
because	O
that	O
,	O
some	O
time	O
or	O
other	O
,	O
they	O
thought	O
they	O
might	O
hear	O
from	O
their	O
governor	O
again	O
,	O
meaning	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
I	O
should	O
send	O
any	O
one	O
to	O
seek	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
sure	O
to	O
direct	O
them	O
to	O
that	O
side	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
should	O
find	O
the	O
place	O
demolished	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
conclude	O
the	O
savages	O
had	O
killed	O
us	O
all	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
gone	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
our	O
supply	O
would	O
go	O
too	O
.	O

But	O
as	O
to	O
their	O
corn	O
and	O
cattle	O
,	O
they	O
agreed	O
to	O
remove	O
them	O
into	O
the	O
valley	O
where	O
my	O
cave	O
was	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
land	O
was	O
as	O
proper	O
for	O
both	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
indeed	O
there	O
was	O
land	O
enough	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
upon	O
second	O
thoughts	O
they	O
altered	O
one	O
part	O
of	O
their	O
resolution	O
too	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
only	O
to	O
remove	O
part	O
of	O
their	O
cattle	O
thither	O
,	O
and	O
part	O
of	O
their	O
corn	O
there	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
if	O
one	O
part	O
was	O
destroyed	O
the	O
other	O
might	O
be	O
saved	O
.	O

And	O
one	O
part	O
of	O
prudence	O
they	O
luckily	O
used	O
:	O
they	O
never	O
trusted	O
those	O
three	O
savages	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
taken	O
prisoners	O
with	O
knowing	O
anything	O
of	O
the	O
plantation	O
they	O
had	O
made	O
in	O
that	O
valley	O
,	O
or	O
of	O
any	O
cattle	O
they	O
had	O
there	O
,	O
much	O
less	O
of	O
the	O
cave	O
at	O
that	O
place	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
kept	O
,	O
in	O
case	O
of	O
necessity	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
safe	O
retreat	O
;	O
and	O
thither	O
they	O
carried	O
also	O
the	O
two	O
barrels	O
of	O
powder	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
sent	O
them	O
at	O
my	O
coming	O
away	O
.	O

They	O
resolved	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
not	O
to	O
change	O
their	O
habitation	O
;	O
yet	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
carefully	O
covered	O
it	O
first	O
with	O
a	O
wall	O
or	O
fortification	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
with	O
a	O
grove	O
of	O
trees	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
now	O
fully	O
convinced	O
their	O
safety	O
consisted	O
entirely	O
in	O
their	O
being	O
concealed	O
,	O
they	O
set	O
to	O
work	O
to	O
cover	O
and	O
conceal	O
the	O
place	O
yet	O
more	O
effectually	O
than	O
before	O
.	O

For	O
this	O
purpose	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
planted	O
trees	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
thrust	O
in	O
stakes	O
,	O
which	O
in	O
time	O
all	O
grew	O
up	O
to	O
be	O
trees	O
,	O
for	O
some	O
good	O
distance	O
before	O
the	O
entrance	O
into	O
my	O
apartments	O
,	O
they	O
went	O
on	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
manner	O
,	O
and	O
filled	O
up	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
that	O
whole	O
space	O
of	O
ground	O
from	O
the	O
trees	O
I	O
had	O
set	O
quite	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
creek	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
landed	O
my	O
floats	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
into	O
the	O
very	O
ooze	O
where	O
the	O
tide	O
flowed	O
,	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
leaving	O
any	O
place	O
to	O
land	O
,	O
or	O
any	O
sign	O
that	O
there	O
had	O
been	O
any	O
landing	O
thereabouts	O
:	O
these	O
stakes	O
also	O
being	O
of	O
a	O
wood	O
very	O
forward	O
to	O
grow	O
,	O
they	O
took	O
care	O
to	O
have	O
them	O
generally	O
much	O
larger	O
and	O
taller	O
than	O
those	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
planted	O
.	O

As	O
they	O
grew	O
apace	O
,	O
they	O
planted	O
them	O
so	O
very	O
thick	O
and	O
close	O
together	O
,	O
that	O
when	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
years	O
grown	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
piercing	O
with	O
the	O
eye	O
any	O
considerable	O
way	O
into	O
the	O
plantation	O
.	O

As	O
for	O
that	O
part	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
planted	O
,	O
the	O
trees	O
were	O
grown	O
as	O
thick	O
as	O
a	O
man	O
's	O
thigh	O
,	O
and	O
among	O
them	O
they	O
had	O
placed	O
so	O
many	O
other	O
short	O
ones	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
thick	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
stood	O
like	O
a	O
palisado	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
thick	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
next	O
to	O
impossible	O
to	O
penetrate	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
a	O
little	O
dog	O
could	O
hardly	O
get	O
between	O
the	O
trees	O

they	O
stood	O
so	O
close	O

But	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
all	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
did	O
the	O
same	O
by	O
all	O
the	O
ground	O
to	O
the	O
right	O
hand	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
left	O

no	O

not	O
so	O

as	O
for	O

to	O

by	O
the	O

placed	O
up	O

the	O

than	O
what	O

him	O

the	O

the	O

the	O

down	O

then	O
two	O

came	O
in	O
to	O
help	O
their	O
man	O

and	O
a	O
third	O

coming	O
in	O
they	O

the	O

The	O
next	O
question	O
was	O
,	O
what	O
should	O
be	O
done	O
with	O
them	O
?	O

They	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
often	O
mutinous	O

and	O
were	O
so	O
very	O
furious	O
,	O
so	O
desperate	O

so	O
idle	O
withal	O
,	O
they	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
course	O
to	O
take	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
mischievous	O
to	O
the	O

and	O
cared	O
not	O
what	O
hurt	O
they	O
did	O
to	O
any	O
man	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
safe	O
to	O
live	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniard	O
who	O
was	O
governor	O
told	O
them	O
,	O
in	O
so	O
many	O
words	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
of	O

to	O
preserve	O

those	O
who	O
were	O
dangerous	O
to	O
the	O

to	O
be	O
expelled	O
out	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
Englishmen	O

and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
the	O
generous	O
kindness	O
of	O
an	O
Englishman	O
that	O
they	O
all	O
owed	O
their	O
preservation	O
and	O
deliverance	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
use	O
them	O
with	O
all	O
possible	O
lenity	O

and	O
would	O
leave	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
judgment	O

two	O

The	O
two	O
Englishmen	O
and	O
the	O

who	O
saved	O
the	O

were	O
of	O

there	O
was	O

it	O

for	O
the	O
poor	O

was	O
in	O

with	O

he	O
had	O
received	O
that	O
it	O

But	O
the	O
governor	O

still	O
said	O
No	O

it	O
was	O
an	O
Englishman	O
that	O

This	O
was	O
so	O
positively	O
insisted	O
on	O
by	O
the	O
governor	O

that	O
there	O

it	O

to	O
keep	O
them	O

that	O

After	O
a	O

it	O
was	O

that	O

that	O

cattle	O
belonging	O

they	O

they	O

The	O
humane	O
governor	O
,	O
musing	O
upon	O
the	O
sentence	O
,	O
considered	O
a	O
little	O
upon	O
it	O
;	O

turning	O
to	O
the	O
two	O
honest	O

So	O
he	O
caused	O

that	O

eight	O

for	O

as	O
for	O
a	O
store	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
have	O
tools	O
given	O
them	O
for	O
their	O
work	O
in	O
the	O
fields	O

but	O
they	O
should	O
have	O
none	O

Thus	O
they	O
dismissed	O
them	O
the	O

turned	O
them	O
out	O

again	O

marked	O

out	O

it	O
was	O

This	O
humbled	O
them	O
much	O
:	O
so	O
they	O
came	O
and	O
begged	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
to	O
help	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
very	O
readily	O
did	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
four	O
days	O
worked	O
a	O
great	O
hole	O
in	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
big	O
enough	O
to	O
secure	O
their	O
corn	O
and	O
other	O
things	O
from	O
the	O
rain	O
:	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
poor	O
place	O
at	O
best	O
compared	O
to	O
mine	O
,	O
and	O
especially	O
as	O
mine	O
was	O
then	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
had	O
greatly	O
enlarged	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
several	O
new	O
apartments	O
in	O
it	O
.	O

About	O
three	O
quarters	O
of	O
a	O
year	O
after	O
this	O
separation	O
,	O
a	O
new	O
frolic	O
took	O
these	O
rogues	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
together	O
with	O
the	O
former	O
villainy	O
they	O
had	O
committed	O
,	O
brought	O
mischief	O
enough	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
very	O
near	O
been	O
the	O
ruin	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
colony	O
.	O

The	O
three	O
new	O
associates	O
began	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
weary	O
of	O
the	O
laborious	O
life	O
they	O
led	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
without	O
hope	O
of	O
bettering	O
their	O
circumstances	O
:	O
and	O
a	O
whim	O
took	O
them	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
make	O
a	O
voyage	O
to	O
the	O
continent	O
,	O
from	O
whence	O
the	O
savages	O
came	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
try	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
seize	O
upon	O
some	O
prisoners	O
among	O
the	O
natives	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
bring	O
them	O
home	O
,	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
do	O
the	O
laborious	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
work	O
for	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
project	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
preposterous	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
gone	O
no	O
further	O
.	O

But	O
they	O
did	O
nothing	O
,	O
and	O
proposed	O
nothing	O
,	O
but	O
had	O
either	O
mischief	O
in	O
the	O
design	O
,	O
or	O
mischief	O
in	O
the	O
event	O
.	O

And	O
if	O
I	O
may	O
give	O
my	O
opinion	O
,	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
under	O
a	O
blast	O
from	O
Heaven	O
:	O
for	O
if	O
we	O
will	O
not	O
allow	O
a	O
visible	O
curse	O
to	O
pursue	O
visible	O
crimes	O
,	O
how	O
shall	O
we	O
reconcile	O
the	O
events	O
of	O
things	O
with	O
the	O
divine	O
justice	O
?	O

It	O
was	O
certainly	O
an	O
apparent	O
vengeance	O
on	O
their	O
crime	O
of	O
mutiny	O
and	O
piracy	O
that	O
brought	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
state	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
showed	O
not	O
the	O
least	O
remorse	O
for	O
the	O
crime	O
,	O
but	O
added	O
new	O
villanies	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
piece	O
of	O
monstrous	O
cruelty	O
of	O
wounding	O
a	O
poor	O
slave	O
because	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
,	O
or	O
perhaps	O
could	O
not	O
,	O
understand	O
to	O
do	O
what	O
he	O
was	O
directed	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
wound	O
him	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
manner	O
as	O
made	O
him	O
a	O
cripple	O
all	O
his	O
life	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
place	O
where	O
no	O
surgeon	O
or	O
medicine	O
could	O
be	O
had	O
for	O
his	O
cure	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
what	O
was	O
still	O
worse	O
,	O
the	O
intentional	O
murder	O
,	O
for	O
such	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
as	O
was	O
afterwards	O
the	O

all	O
laid	O
to	O
murder	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
in	O
cold	O
blood	O

and	O
in	O
their	O
sleep	O

The	O
three	O
fellows	O
came	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
one	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
very	O
humble	O
terms	O
desired	O
to	O
be	O
admitted	O
to	O
speak	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
very	O
readily	O
heard	O
what	O
they	O
had	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
this	O
:	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
tired	O
of	O
living	O
in	O
the	O
manner	O
they	O
did	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
handy	O
enough	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
necessaries	O
they	O
wanted	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
having	O
no	O
help	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
starved	O
;	O
but	O
if	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
would	O
give	O
them	O
leave	O
to	O
take	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
canoes	O
which	O
they	O
came	O
over	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
give	O
them	O
arms	O
and	O
ammunition	O
proportioned	O
to	O
their	O
defence	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
go	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
main	O
,	O
and	O
seek	O
their	O
fortunes	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
deliver	O
them	O
from	O
the	O
trouble	O
of	O
supplying	O
them	O
with	O
any	O
other	O
provisions	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
were	O
glad	O
enough	O
to	O
get	O
rid	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
very	O
honestly	O
represented	O
to	O
them	O
the	O
certain	O
destruction	O
they	O
were	O
running	O
into	O
;	O
told	O
them	O
they	O
had	O
suffered	O
such	O
hardships	O
upon	O
that	O
very	O
spot	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
,	O
without	O
any	O
spirit	O
of	O
prophecy	O
,	O
tell	O
them	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
starved	O
or	O
murdered	O
,	O
and	O
bade	O
them	O
consider	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
men	O
replied	O
audaciously	O
,	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
starved	O
if	O
they	O
stayed	O
here	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
work	O

and	O
would	O
not	O
work	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
could	O
but	O
be	O
starved	O
abroad	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
murdered	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
an	O
end	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
wives	O
or	O
children	O
to	O
cry	O
after	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
insisted	O
importunately	O
upon	O
their	O
demand	O
,	O
declaring	O
they	O
would	O
go	O
,	O
whether	O
they	O
gave	O
them	O
any	O
arms	O
or	O
not	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
told	O
them	O
,	O
with	O
great	O
kindness	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
they	O
should	O
not	O
go	O
like	O
naked	O
men	O

and	O
be	O
in	O
no	O
condition	O
to	O
defend	O
themselves	O

and	O
that	O
though	O
they	O
could	O
ill	O
spare	O
firearms	O
,	O
not	O
having	O
enough	O
for	O
themselves	O

yet	O
they	O
would	O

them	O
have	O
two	O
muskets	O

a	O
pistol	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
cutlass	O

and	O
each	O
man	O
a	O
hatchet	O

which	O
they	O
thought	O
was	O
sufficient	O
for	O
them	O

In	O
a	O
word	O

they	O
accepted	O
the	O
offer	O
;	O
and	O

baked	O
bread	O
enough	O
to	O
serve	O
them	O
a	O
month	O

as	O

a	O

they	O
boldly	O
set	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
canoe	O
for	O
a	O
voyage	O
over	O
the	O
sea	O

where	O
it	O
was	O
at	O

forty	O

The	O
boat	O

indeed	O

was	O
a	O
large	O

and	O
would	O
very	O
well	O
have	O
carried	O
fifteen	O
or	O
twenty	O
men	O

and	O
therefore	O
was	O
rather	O
too	O
big	O
for	O
them	O
to	O

as	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
fair	O

with	O
them	O

they	O
did	O
well	O
enough	O

They	O
had	O
made	O
a	O
mast	O
of	O
a	O
long	O
pole	O

a	O

of	O
four	O

away	O
they	O
went	O
merrily	O

The	O

called	O

''	O

and	O
no	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
were	O
often	O

to	O

to	O
the	O
two	O

Englishmen	O
who	O

how	O
quietly	O

now	O
these	O

As	O
for	O

Away	O
runs	O
the	O
Englishman	O

frightened	O

amazed	O

as	O

to	O
the	O

The	O
Spaniard	O

pausing	O

what	O

It	O
was	O

feast	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
told	O
them	O
about	O
two	O
moons	O
ago	O
,	O
pointing	O
to	O
the	O
moon	O
and	O
to	O
two	O
fingers	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
their	O
great	O
king	O
had	O
two	O
hundred	O
prisoners	O
now	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
taken	O
in	O
his	O
war	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
feeding	O
them	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
fat	O
for	O
the	O
next	O
feast	O
.	O

The	O
Englishmen	O
seemed	O
mighty	O
desirous	O
of	O
seeing	O
those	O
prisoners	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
others	O
mistaking	O
them	O
,	O
thought	O
they	O
were	O
desirous	O
to	O
have	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
to	O
carry	O
away	O
for	O
their	O
own	O
eating	O
.	O

So	O
they	O
beckoned	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
pointing	O
to	O
the	O
setting	O
of	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
to	O
the	O
rising	O
;	O
which	O
was	O
to	O
signify	O
that	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
at	O
sunrising	O
they	O
would	O
bring	O
some	O
for	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
accordingly	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
they	O
brought	O
down	O
five	O
women	O
and	O
eleven	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
Englishmen	O
to	O
carry	O
with	O
them	O
on	O
their	O
voyage	O
,	O
just	O
as	O
we	O
would	O
bring	O
so	O
many	O
cows	O
and	O
oxen	O
down	O
to	O
a	O
seaport	O
town	O
to	O
victual	O
a	O
ship	O
.	O

As	O
brutish	O
and	O
barbarous	O
as	O
these	O
fellows	O
were	O
at	O
home	O
,	O
their	O
stomachs	O
turned	O
at	O
this	O
sight	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
.	O

To	O
refuse	O
the	O
prisoners	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
the	O
highest	O
affront	O
to	O
the	O
savage	O
gentry	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
offered	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
them	O
they	O
knew	O
not	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
after	O
some	O
debate	O
,	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
accept	O
of	O
them	O
:	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
return	O
,	O
they	O
gave	O
the	O
savages	O
that	O
brought	O
them	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
hatchets	O
,	O
an	O
old	O
key	O
,	O
a	O
knife	O
,	O
and	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
of	O
their	O
bullets	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
their	O
use	O
,	O
they	O
seemed	O
particularly	O
pleased	O
with	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
tying	O
the	O
poor	O
creatures	O
'	O
hands	O
behind	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
dragged	O
the	O
prisoners	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
for	O
our	O
men	O
.	O

The	O
Englishmen	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
come	O
away	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
them	O
,	O
or	O
else	O
they	O
that	O
gave	O
them	O
this	O
noble	O
present	O
would	O
certainly	O
have	O
expected	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
have	O
gone	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
have	O
killed	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
of	O
them	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
have	O
invited	O
the	O
donors	O
to	O
dinner	O
.	O

But	O
having	O
taken	O
their	O
leave	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
respect	O
and	O
thanks	O
that	O
could	O
well	O
pass	O
between	O
people	O
,	O
where	O
on	O
either	O
side	O
they	O
understood	O
not	O
one	O
word	O
they	O
could	O
say	O
,	O
they	O
put	O
off	O
with	O
their	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
back	O
towards	O
the	O
first	O
island	O
;	O
where	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
arrived	O
,	O
they	O
set	O
eight	O
of	O
their	O
prisoners	O
at	O
liberty	O
,	O
there	O
being	O
too	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
for	O
their	O
occasion	O
.	O

In	O
their	O
voyage	O
they	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
have	O
some	O
communication	O
with	O
their	O
prisoners	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
understand	O
anything	O
.	O

Nothing	O
they	O
could	O
say	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
or	O
give	O
them	O
,	O
or	O
do	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
looked	O
upon	O
as	O
going	O
to	O
murder	O
them	O
.	O

They	O
first	O
of	O
all	O
unbound	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
poor	O
creatures	O
screamed	O
at	O
that	O
,	O
especially	O
the	O
women	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
just	O
felt	O
the	O
knife	O
at	O
their	O
throats	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
immediately	O
concluded	O
they	O
were	O
unbound	O
on	O
purpose	O
to	O
be	O
killed	O
.	O

If	O
they	O
gave	O
them	O
thing	O
to	O
eat	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
;	O
they	O
then	O
concluded	O
it	O
was	O
for	O
fear	O
they	O
should	O
sink	O
in	O
flesh	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
not	O
be	O
fat	O
enough	O
to	O
kill	O
.	O

If	O
they	O
looked	O
at	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
more	O
particularly	O
,	O
the	O
party	O
presently	O
concluded	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
see	O
whether	O
he	O
or	O
she	O
was	O
fattest	O
,	O
and	O
fittest	O
to	O
kill	O
first	O
;	O
nay	O
,	O
after	O
they	O
had	O
brought	O
them	O
quite	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
use	O
them	O
kindly	O
,	O
and	O
treat	O
them	O
well	O
,	O
still	O
they	O
expected	O
every	O
day	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
dinner	O
or	O
supper	O
for	O
their	O
new	O
masters	O

When	O
the	O
three	O
wanderers	O
had	O
give	O
this	O
unaccountable	O
history	O
or	O
journal	O
of	O
their	O
voyage	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
asked	O
them	O
where	O
their	O
new	O
family	O
was	O
;	O
and	O
being	O
told	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
brought	O
them	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
them	O
into	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
huts	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
come	O
up	O
to	O
beg	O
some	O
victuals	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
-LRB-	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
-RRB-	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
Englishmen	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
the	O
whole	O
colony	O
,	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
all	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
and	O
see	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
did	O
so	O
,	O
and	O
Friday	O
's	O
father	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
hut	O
,	O
there	O
they	O
sat	O
,	O
all	O
bound	O
;	O
for	O
when	O
they	O
had	O
brought	O
them	O
on	O
shore	O
they	O
bound	O
their	O
hands	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
not	O
take	O
the	O
boat	O
and	O
make	O
their	O
escape	O
;	O
there	O
,	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
they	O
sat	O
,	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
stark	O
naked	O
.	O

First	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
three	O
comely	O
fellows	O
,	O
well	O
shaped	O
,	O
with	O
straight	O
limbs	O
,	O
about	O
thirty	O
to	O
thirty-five	O
years	O
of	O
age	O
;	O
and	O
five	O
women	O
,	O
whereof	O
two	O
might	O
be	O
from	O
thirty	O
to	O
forty	O
,	O
two	O
more	O
about	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
and	O
twenty	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
fifth	O
,	O
a	O
tall	O
,	O
comely	O
maiden	O
,	O
about	O
seventeen	O
.	O

The	O
women	O
were	O
well-favoured	O
,	O
agreeable	O
persons	O
,	O
both	O
in	O
shape	O
and	O
features	O
,	O
only	O
tawny	O
;	O
and	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
had	O
they	O
been	O
perfect	O
white	O
,	O
would	O
have	O
passed	O
for	O
very	O
handsome	O
women	O
,	O
even	O
in	O
London	PNM
,	O
having	O
pleasant	O
countenances	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
modest	O
behaviour	O
;	O
especially	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
afterwards	O
to	O
be	O
clothed	O
and	O
dressed	O
,	O
though	O
that	O
dress	O
was	O
very	O
indifferent	O
,	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
confessed	O
.	O

The	O
sight	O
,	O
you	O
may	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
was	O
something	O
uncouth	O
to	O
our	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
,	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
a	O
just	O
character	O
,	O
men	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
calm	O
,	O
sedate	O
tempers	O
,	O
and	O
perfect	O
good	O
humour	O
,	O
that	O
ever	O
I	O
met	O
with	O
:	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
particular	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
utmost	O
modesty	O
:	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
the	O
sight	O
was	O
very	O
uncouth	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
three	O
naked	O
men	O
and	O
five	O
naked	O
women	O
,	O
all	O
together	O
bound	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
miserable	O
circumstances	O
that	O
human	O
nature	O
could	O
be	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
,	O
viz.	O
to	O
be	O
expecting	O
every	O
moment	O
to	O
be	O
dragged	O
out	O
and	O
have	O
their	O
brains	O
knocked	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
to	O
be	O
eaten	O
up	O
like	O
a	O
calf	O
that	O
is	O
killed	O
for	O
a	O
dainty	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
thing	O
they	O
did	O
was	O
to	O
cause	O
the	O
old	O
Indian	O
,	O
Friday	O
's	O
father	O
,	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
first	O
if	O
he	O
knew	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
if	O
he	O
understood	O
any	O
of	O
their	O
speech	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
came	O
in	O
,	O
he	O
looked	O
seriously	O
at	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
knew	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
neither	O
could	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
understand	O
a	O
word	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
or	O
a	O
sign	O
he	O
could	O
make	O
,	O
except	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
women	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
this	O
was	O
enough	O
to	O
answer	O
the	O
end	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
to	O
satisfy	O
them	O
that	O
the	O
men	O
into	O
whose	O
hands	O
they	O
were	O
fallen	O
were	O
Christians	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
abhorred	O
eating	O
men	O
or	O
women	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
sure	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
killed	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
assured	O
of	O
this	O
,	O
they	O
discovered	O
such	O
a	O
joy	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
such	O
awkward	O
gestures	O
,	O
several	O
ways	O
,	O
as	O
is	O
hard	O
to	O
describe	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
seems	O
they	O
were	O
of	O
several	O
nations	O
.	O

The	O
woman	O
who	O
was	O
their	O
interpreter	O
was	O
bid	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
place	O
,	O
to	O
ask	O
them	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
willing	O
to	O
be	O
servants	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
work	O
for	O
the	O
men	O
who	O
had	O
brought	O
them	O
away	O
,	O
to	O
save	O
their	O
lives	O
;	O
at	O
which	O
they	O
all	O
fell	O
a-dancing	O
;	O
and	O
presently	O
one	O
fell	O
to	O
taking	O
up	O
this	O
,	O
and	O
another	O
that	O
,	O
anything	O
that	O
lay	O
next	O
,	O
to	O
carry	O
on	O
their	O
shoulders	O
,	O
to	O
intimate	O
they	O
were	O
willing	O
to	O
work	O

The	O
governor	O
,	O
who	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
having	O
women	O
among	O
them	O
would	O
presently	O
be	O
attended	O
with	O
some	O
inconvenience	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
occasion	O
some	O
strife	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
blood	O
,	O
asked	O
the	O
three	O
men	O
what	O
they	O
intended	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
these	O
women	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
they	O
intended	O
to	O
use	O
them	O
,	O
whether	O
as	O
servants	O
or	O
as	O
wives	O
?	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
Englishmen	O
answered	O
,	O
very	O
boldly	O
and	O
readily	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
use	O
them	O
as	O
both	O
;	O
to	O
which	O
the	O
governor	O
said	O

this	O

just	O

for	O
avoiding	O

I	O

so	O
just	O

that	O
every	O

agreed	O
to	O
it	O
without	O

the	O

On	O
the	O

hand	O

the	O
five	O
Englishmen	O
took	O
them	O
every	O
one	O
a	O
wife	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
a	O
temporary	O
wife	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
they	O
set	O
up	O
a	O
new	O
form	O
of	O
living	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
and	O
Friday	O
's	O
father	O
lived	O
in	O
my	O
old	O
habitation	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
enlarged	O
exceedingly	O
within	O

The	O
three	O
servants	O
which	O
were	O
taken	O
in	O
the	O
last	O
battle	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
lived	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
these	O
carried	O
on	O
the	O
main	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
colony	O
,	O
supplied	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
with	O
food	O
,	O
and	O
assisted	O
them	O
in	O
anything	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
,	O
or	O
as	O
they	O
found	O
necessity	O
required	O

But	O
the	O
wonder	O
of	O
the	O
story	O
was	O
,	O
how	O
five	O
such	O
refractory	O
,	O
ill-matched	O
fellows	O
should	O
agree	O
about	O
these	O
women	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
some	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
should	O
not	O
choose	O
the	O
same	O
woman	O
,	O
especially	O
seeing	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
,	O
without	O
comparison	O
,	O
more	O
agreeable	O
than	O
the	O
others	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
took	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
enough	O
to	O
prevent	O
quarrelling	O
among	O
themselves	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
set	O
the	O
five	O
women	O
by	O
themselves	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
huts	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
went	O
all	O
into	O
the	O
other	O
hut	O
,	O
and	O
drew	O
lots	O
among	O
them	O
who	O
should	O
choose	O
first	O
.	O

Him	O
that	O
drew	O
to	O
choose	O
first	O
went	O
away	O
by	O
himself	O
to	O
the	O
hut	O
where	O
the	O
poor	O
naked	O
creatures	O
were	O
,	O
and	O
fetched	O
out	O
her	O
he	O
chose	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
worth	O
observing	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
that	O
chose	O
first	O
took	O
her	O
that	O
was	O
reckoned	O
the	O
homeliest	O
and	O
oldest	O
of	O
the	O
five	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
mirth	O
enough	O
amongst	O
the	O
rest	O
;	O
and	O
even	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
laughed	O
at	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
fellow	O
considered	O
better	O
than	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
application	O
and	O
business	O
they	O
were	O
to	O
expect	O
assistance	O
in	O
,	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
in	O
anything	O
else	O
;	O
and	O
she	O
proved	O
the	O
best	O
wife	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
parcel	O

When	O
the	O
poor	O
women	O
saw	O
themselves	O
set	O
in	O
a	O
row	O
thus	O

and	O
fetched	O
out	O

the	O
terrors	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
when	O

out	O

up	O

hung	O
about	O

took	O
their	O

of	O
her	O
with	O
such	O
agonies	O

as	O
would	O
have	O

the	O
hardest	O
heart	O
in	O
the	O

:	O
nor	O
was	O
it	O
possible	O
for	O
the	O

that	O
they	O

When	O
they	O

and	O
the	O

the	O
Spaniards	O
came	O

helped	O
them	O
:	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
hours	O
they	O
had	O
built	O
them	O
every	O
one	O
a	O

hut	O

for	O

The	O

the	O
two	O

both	O
on	O
the	O

so	O

Another	O
observation	O

to	O
the	O
honour	O
of	O
a	O

canoes	O
of	O
Indians	O

savages	O
,	O
call	O
them	O
which	O
you	O
please	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
room	O
to	O
doubt	O
they	O
came	O
upon	O
the	O
old	O
errand	O
of	O
feeding	O
upon	O
their	O
slaves	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
part	O
was	O
now	O
so	O
familiar	O
to	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
our	O
men	O
too	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
concern	O
themselves	O
about	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
did	O
:	O
but	O
having	O
been	O
made	O
sensible	O
,	O
by	O
their	O
experience	O
,	O
that	O
their	O
only	O
business	O
was	O
to	O
lie	O
concealed	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
seen	O
by	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
they	O
would	O
go	O
off	O
again	O
quietly	O
,	O
when	O
their	O
business	O
was	O
done	O
,	O
having	O
as	O
yet	O
not	O
the	O
least	O
notion	O
of	O
there	O
being	O
any	O
inhabitants	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
made	O
sensible	O
of	O
this	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
but	O
to	O
give	O
notice	O
to	O
all	O
the	O
three	O
plantations	O
to	O
keep	O
within	O
doors	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
show	O
themselves	O
,	O
only	O
placing	O
a	O
scout	O
in	O
a	O
proper	O
place	O
,	O
to	O
give	O
notice	O
when	O
the	O
boats	O
went	O
to	O
sea	O
again	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
,	O
without	O
doubt	O
,	O
very	O
right	O
;	O
but	O
a	O
disaster	O
spoiled	O
all	O
these	O
measures	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
it	O
known	O
among	O
the	O
savages	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
inhabitants	O
there	O
;	O
which	O
was	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
end	O
,	O
the	O
desolation	O
of	O
almost	O
the	O
whole	O
colony	O
.	O

After	O
the	O
canoes	O
with	O
the	O
savages	O
were	O
gone	O
off	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
peeped	O
abroad	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
the	O
curiosity	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
doing	O
.	O

Here	O
,	O
to	O
their	O
great	O
surprise	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
three	O
savages	O
left	O
behind	O
,	O
and	O
lying	O
fast	O
asleep	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
supposed	O
they	O
had	O
either	O
been	O
so	O
gorged	O
with	O
their	O
inhuman	O
feast	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
like	O
beasts	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
fallen	O
asleep	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
not	O
stir	O
when	O
the	O
others	O
went	O
,	O
or	O
they	O
had	O
wandered	O
into	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
come	O
back	O
in	O
time	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
in	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
were	O
greatly	O
surprised	O
at	O
this	O
sight	O
and	O
perfectly	O
at	O
a	O
loss	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniard	O
governor	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
happened	O
,	O
was	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
advice	O
was	O
asked	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
professed	O
he	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
.	O

As	O
for	O
slaves	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
enough	O
already	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
to	O
killing	O
them	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
inclined	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
:	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
governor	O
told	O
me	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
think	O
of	O
shedding	O
innocent	O
blood	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
the	O
poor	O
creatures	O
had	O
done	O
them	O
no	O
wrong	O
,	O
invaded	O
none	O
of	O
their	O
property	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
thought	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
just	O
quarrel	O
against	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
take	O
away	O
their	O
lives	O
.	O

And	O
here	O
I	O
must	O
,	O
in	O
justice	O
to	O
these	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
observe	O
that	O
,	O
let	O
the	O
accounts	O
of	O
Spanish	PNM
cruelty	O
in	O
Mexico	PNM
and	O
Peru	PNM
be	O
what	O
they	O
will	O
,	O
I	O
never	O
met	O
with	O
seventeen	O
men	O
of	O
any	O
nation	O
whatsoever	O
,	O
in	O
any	O
foreign	O
country	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
so	O
universally	O
modest	O
,	O
temperate	O
,	O
virtuous	O
,	O
so	O
very	O
good-humoured	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
courteous	O
,	O
as	O
these	O
Spaniards	O
:	O
and	O
as	O
to	O
cruelty	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
nothing	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
their	O
very	O
nature	O
;	O
no	O
inhumanity	O
,	O
no	O
barbarity	O
,	O
no	O
outrageous	O
passions	O
;	O
and	O
yet	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
men	O
of	O
great	O
courage	O
and	O
spirit	O
.	O

Their	O
temper	O
and	O
calmness	O
had	O
appeared	O
in	O
their	O
bearing	O
the	O
insufferable	O
usage	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
Englishmen	O
;	O
and	O
their	O
justice	O
and	O
humanity	O
appeared	O
now	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
above	O
.	O

After	O
some	O
consultation	O
they	O
resolved	O
upon	O
this	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
lie	O
still	O
a	O
while	O
longer	O
,	O
till	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
these	O
three	O
men	O
might	O
be	O
gone	O
.	O

But	O
then	O
the	O
governor	O
recollected	O
that	O
the	O
three	O
savages	O
had	O
no	O
boat	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
left	O
to	O
rove	O
about	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
certainly	O
discover	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
inhabitants	O
in	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
undone	O
that	O
way	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
,	O
they	O
went	O
back	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
lay	O
the	O
fellows	O
fast	O
asleep	O
still	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
awaken	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
take	O
them	O
prisoners	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
did	O
so	O
.	O

The	O
poor	O
fellows	O
were	O
strangely	O
frightened	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
seized	O
upon	O
and	O
bound	O
;	O
and	O
afraid	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
women	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
murdered	O
and	O
eaten	O
:	O
for	O
it	O
seems	O
those	O
people	O
think	O
all	O
the	O
world	O
does	O
as	O
they	O
do	O
,	O
in	O
eating	O
men	O
's	O
flesh	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
soon	O
made	O
easy	O
as	O
to	O
that	O
,	O
and	O
away	O
they	O
carried	O
them	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
very	O
happy	O
for	O
them	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
carry	O
them	O
home	O
to	O
the	O
castle	O
,	O
I	O
mean	O
to	O
my	O
palace	O
under	O
the	O
hill	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
carried	O
them	O
first	O
to	O
the	O
bower	O
,	O
where	O
was	O
the	O
chief	O
of	O
their	O
country	O
work	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
keeping	O
the	O
goats	O
,	O
the	O
planting	O
the	O
corn	O
,	O
&	O
c.	O
;	O
and	O
afterward	O
they	O
carried	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
habitation	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
Englishmen	O
.	O

Here	O
they	O
were	O
set	O
to	O
work	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
much	O
they	O
had	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
do	O
;	O
and	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
by	O
negligence	O
in	O
guarding	O
them	O
,	O
or	O
that	O
they	O
thought	O
the	O
fellows	O
could	O
not	O
mend	O
themselves	O
,	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
,	O
but	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
ran	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
taking	O
to	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
never	O
hear	O
of	O
him	O
any	O
more	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
good	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
he	O
got	O
home	O
again	O
soon	O
after	O
in	O
some	O
other	O
boats	O
or	O
canoes	O
of	O
savages	O
who	O
came	O
on	O
shore	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
weeks	O
afterwards	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
,	O
carrying	O
on	O
their	O
revels	O
as	O
usual	O
,	O
went	O
off	O
in	O
two	O
days	O
'	O
time	O
.	O

This	O
thought	O
terrified	O
them	O
exceedingly	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
concluded	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
not	O
without	O
good	O
cause	O
indeed	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
this	O
fellow	O
came	O
home	O
safe	O
among	O
his	O
comrades	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
certainly	O
give	O
them	O
an	O
account	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
also	O
how	O
few	O
and	O
weak	O
they	O
were	O
;	O
for	O
this	O
savage	O
,	O
as	O
observed	O
before	O
,	O
had	O
never	O
been	O
told	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
happy	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
,	O
how	O
many	O
there	O
were	O
or	O
where	O
they	O
lived	O
;	O
nor	O
had	O
he	O
ever	O
seen	O
or	O
heard	O
the	O
fire	O
of	O
any	O
of	O
their	O
guns	O
,	O
much	O
less	O
had	O
they	O
shown	O
him	O
any	O
of	O
their	O
other	O
retired	O
places	O
;	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
cave	O
in	O
the	O
valley	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
new	O
retreat	O
which	O
the	O
two	O
Englishmen	O
had	O
made	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
like	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
testimony	O
they	O
had	O
that	O
this	O
fellow	O
had	O
given	O
intelligence	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
about	O
two	O
months	O
after	O
this	O
six	O
canoes	O
of	O
savages	O
,	O
with	O
about	O
seven	O
,	O
eight	O
,	O
or	O
ten	O
men	O
in	O
a	O
canoe	O
,	O
came	O
rowing	O
along	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
never	O
used	O
to	O
come	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
landed	O
,	O
about	O
an	O
hour	O
after	O
sunrise	O
,	O
at	O
a	O
convenient	O
place	O
,	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
habitation	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
Englishmen	O
,	O
where	O
this	O
escaped	O
man	O
had	O
been	O
kept	O
.	O

As	O
the	O
chief	O
Spaniard	O
said	O
,	O
had	O
they	O
been	O
all	O
there	O
the	O
damage	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
so	O
much	O
,	O
for	O
not	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
them	O
would	O
have	O
escaped	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
case	O
differed	O
now	O
very	O
much	O
,	O
for	O
two	O
men	O
to	O
fifty	O
was	O
too	O
much	O
odds	O
.	O

The	O
two	O
men	O
had	O
the	O
happiness	O
to	O
discover	O
them	O
about	O
a	O
league	O
off	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
above	O
an	O
hour	O
before	O
they	O
landed	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
they	O
landed	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
their	O
huts	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
some	O
time	O
before	O
they	O
could	O
come	O
at	O
them	O
.	O

Now	O
,	O
having	O
great	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
betrayed	O
,	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
they	O
did	O
was	O
to	O
bind	O
the	O
two	O
slaves	O
which	O
were	O
left	O
,	O
and	O
cause	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
men	O
whom	O
they	O
brought	O
with	O
the	O
women	O
-LRB-	O
who	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
proved	O
very	O
faithful	O
to	O
them	O
-RRB-	O
to	O
lead	O
them	O
,	O
with	O
their	O
two	O
wives	O
,	O
and	O
whatever	O
they	O
could	O
carry	O
away	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
their	O
retired	O
places	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
have	O
spoken	O
of	O
above	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
to	O
bind	O
the	O
two	O
fellows	O
hand	O
and	O
foot	O
,	O
till	O
they	O
heard	O
farther	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
next	O
place	O
,	O
seeing	O
the	O
savages	O
were	O
all	O
come	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
bent	O
their	O
course	O
directly	O
that	O
way	O
,	O
they	O
opened	O
the	O
fences	O
where	O
the	O
milch	O
cows	O
were	O
kept	O
,	O
and	O
drove	O
them	O
all	O
out	O
;	O
leaving	O
their	O
goats	O
to	O
straggle	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
whither	O
they	O
pleased	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
savages	O
might	O
think	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
bred	O
wild	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
rogue	O
who	O
came	O
with	O
them	O
was	O
too	O
cunning	O
for	O
that	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
them	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
it	O
all	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
went	O
directly	O
to	O
the	O
place	O

When	O
the	O
two	O
poor	O

had	O
secured	O
their	O
wives	O

in	O

they	O
took	O
their	O

what	O

retreated	O
towards	O
the	O
place	O

indeed	O

for	O
some	O
time	O

They	O
kept	O
their	O
station	O
for	O
a	O
while	O

till	O
they	O
found	O
the	O
savages	O
,	O
like	O

beasts	O
,	O
spread	O
themselves	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
place	O

rummaging	O
every	O
way	O

every	O

they	O
could	O

in	O

in	O

for	O
the	O
people	O

of	O
whom	O
now	O
it	O
plainly	O
appeared	O
they	O
had	O
intelligence	O

The	O
two	O
Englishmen	O
seeing	O
this	O
,	O
thinking	O
themselves	O
not	O
secure	O
where	O
they	O
stood	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
likely	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
wild	O
people	O
might	O
come	O
that	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
might	O
come	O
too	O
many	O
together	O
,	O
thought	O
it	O
proper	O
to	O
make	O
another	O
retreat	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
farther	O
;	O
believing	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
afterwards	O
happened	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
further	O
they	O
strolled	O
,	O
the	O
fewer	O
would	O
be	O
together	O
.	O

Their	O
next	O
halt	O
was	O
at	O
the	O
entrance	O
into	O
a	O
very	O
thick-grown	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
an	O
old	O
trunk	O
of	O
a	O
tree	O
stood	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
hollow	O
and	O
very	O
large	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
this	O
tree	O
they	O
both	O
took	O
their	O
standing	O
,	O
resolving	O
to	O
see	O
there	O
what	O
might	O
offer	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
not	O
stood	O
there	O
long	O
before	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
appeared	O
running	O
directly	O
that	O
way	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
already	O
had	O
notice	O
where	O
they	O
stood	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
coming	O
up	O
to	O
attack	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
farther	O
they	O
espied	O
three	O
more	O
coming	O
after	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
five	O
more	O
beyond	O
them	O
,	O
all	O
coming	O
the	O
same	O
way	O
;	O
besides	O
which	O
,	O
they	O
saw	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
more	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
running	O
another	O
way	O
;	O
for	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
they	O
ran	O
every	O
way	O
,	O
like	O
sportsmen	O
beating	O
for	O
their	O
game	O
.	O

The	O
poor	O
men	O
were	O
now	O
in	O
great	O
perplexity	O
whether	O
they	O
should	O
stand	O
and	O
keep	O
their	O
posture	O
or	O
fly	O
;	O
but	O
after	O
a	O
very	O
short	O
debate	O
with	O
themselves	O
,	O
they	O
considered	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
savages	O
ranged	O
the	O
country	O
thus	O
before	O
help	O
came	O
,	O
they	O
might	O
perhaps	O
find	O
their	O
retreat	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
all	O
would	O
be	O
lost	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
stand	O
them	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
too	O
many	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
,	O
then	O
they	O
would	O
get	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
from	O
whence	O
they	O
doubted	O
not	O
to	O
defend	O
themselves	O
,	O
fire	O
excepted	O
,	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
their	O
ammunition	O
lasted	O
,	O
though	O
all	O
the	O
savages	O
that	O
were	O
landed	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
near	O
fifty	O
,	O
were	O
to	O
attack	O
them	O
.	O

Having	O
resolved	O
upon	O
this	O
,	O
they	O
next	O
considered	O
whether	O
they	O
should	O
fire	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
two	O
,	O
or	O
wait	O
for	O
the	O
three	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
take	O
the	O
middle	O
party	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
the	O
two	O
and	O
the	O
five	O
that	O
followed	O
would	O
be	O
separated	O
;	O
at	O
length	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
let	O
the	O
first	O
two	O
pass	O
by	O
,	O
unless	O
they	O
should	O
spy	O
them	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
and	O
come	O
to	O
attack	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
two	O
savages	O
confirmed	O
them	O
also	O
in	O
this	O
resolution	O
,	O
by	O
turning	O
a	O
little	O
from	O
them	O
towards	O
another	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
wood	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
three	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
five	O
after	O
them	O
,	O
came	O
forward	O
directly	O
to	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
known	O
the	O
Englishmen	O
were	O
there	O
.	O

Seeing	O
them	O
come	O
so	O
straight	O
towards	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
take	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
line	O
as	O
they	O
came	O
:	O
and	O
as	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
fire	O
but	O
one	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
,	O
perhaps	O
the	O
first	O
shot	O
might	O
hit	O
them	O
all	O
three	O
;	O
for	O
which	O
purpose	O
the	O
man	O
who	O
was	O
to	O
fire	O
put	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
small	O
bullets	O
into	O
his	O
piece	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
a	O
fair	O
loophole	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
from	O
a	O
broken	O
hole	O
in	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
he	O
took	O
a	O
sure	O
aim	O
,	O
without	O
being	O
seen	O
,	O
waiting	O
till	O
they	O
were	O
within	O
about	O
thirty	O
yards	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
miss	O
.	O

While	O
they	O
were	O
thus	O
waiting	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
savages	O
came	O
on	O
,	O
they	O
plainly	O
saw	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
was	O
the	O
runaway	O
savage	O
that	O
had	O
escaped	O
from	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
both	O
knew	O
him	O
distinctly	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
he	O
should	O
not	O
escape	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
should	O
both	O
fire	O
;	O
so	O
the	O
other	O
stood	O
ready	O
with	O
his	O
piece	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
drop	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
shot	O
,	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
sure	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
second	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
first	O
was	O
too	O
good	O
a	O
marksman	O
to	O
miss	O
his	O
aim	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
the	O
savages	O
kept	O
near	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
a	O
little	O
behind	O
in	O
a	O
line	O
,	O
he	O
fired	O
,	O
and	O
hit	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
directly	O
;	O
the	O
foremost	O
was	O
killed	O
outright	O
,	O
being	O
shot	O
in	O
the	O
head	O
;	O
the	O
second	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
runaway	O
Indian	O
,	O
was	O
shot	O
through	O
the	O
body	O
,	O
and	O
fell	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
not	O
quite	O
dead	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
third	O
had	O
a	O
little	O
scratch	O
in	O
the	O
shoulder	O
,	O
perhaps	O
by	O
the	O
same	O
ball	O
that	O
went	O
through	O
the	O
body	O
of	O
the	O
second	O
;	O
and	O
being	O
dreadfully	O
frightened	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
hurt	O
,	O
sat	O
down	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
screaming	O
and	O
yelling	O
in	O
a	O
hideous	O
manner	O
.	O

The	O
five	O
that	O
were	O
behind	O
,	O
more	O
frightened	O
with	O
the	O
noise	O
than	O
sensible	O
of	O
the	O
danger	O
,	O
stood	O
still	O
at	O
first	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
woods	O
made	O
the	O
sound	O
a	O
thousand	O
times	O
bigger	O
than	O
it	O
really	O
was	O
,	O
the	O
echoes	O
rattling	O
from	O
one	O
side	O
to	O
another	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
fowls	O
rising	O
from	O
all	O
parts	O
,	O
screaming	O
,	O
and	O
every	O
sort	O
making	O
a	O
different	O
noise	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
their	O
kind	O
;	O
just	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
when	O
I	O
fired	O
the	O
first	O
gun	O
that	O
perhaps	O
was	O
ever	O
shot	O
off	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
all	O
being	O
silent	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
not	O
knowing	O
what	O
the	O
matter	O
was	O

came	O
on	O

till	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
their	O

in	O
a	O

enough	O

Here	O
the	O

not	O

that	O
they	O
were	O
within	O

,	O
as	O
may	O

supposed	O

inquiring	O

him	O
how	O
he	O
came	O
to	O

hurt	O
;	O
and	O
who	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
rational	O
to	O
believe	O

told	O
them	O
that	O
a	O

fire	O
first	O

immediately	O

that	O
thunder	O
from	O

him	O

This	O
,	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
is	O
rational	O
;	O
for	O
nothing	O
is	O
more	O
certain	O
than	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
saw	O
no	O

all	O

nor	O
so	O
much	O

heard	O
of	O

anything	O
of	O
killing	O

at	O

if	O

the	O

Our	O

The	O
belief	O
that	O

our	O

,	O
for	O
he	O
was	O
gone	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
two	O
pieces	O
of	O
rope-yarn	O
with	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
bound	O
him	O
lay	O
just	O
at	O
the	O
foot	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
now	O
in	O
as	O
great	O
concern	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
not	O
knowing	O
what	O
course	O
to	O
take	O
,	O
or	O
how	O
near	O
the	O
enemy	O
might	O
be	O
,	O
or	O
in	O
what	O
number	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
their	O
wives	O
were	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
all	O
was	O
well	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
easy	O
.	O

These	O
were	O
in	O
fright	O
enough	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
the	O
savages	O
were	O
their	O
own	O
countrymen	O
,	O
yet	O
they	O
were	O
most	O
terribly	O
afraid	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
the	O
more	O
for	O
the	O
knowledge	O
they	O
had	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
came	O
there	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
the	O
savages	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
the	O
wood	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
near	O
that	O
place	O
,	O
but	O
had	O
not	O
found	O
it	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
indeed	O
inaccessible	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
trees	O
standing	O
so	O
thick	O
,	O
unless	O
the	O
persons	O
seeking	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
directed	O
by	O
those	O
that	O
knew	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
these	O
did	O
not	O
:	O
they	O
found	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
everything	O
very	O
safe	O
,	O
only	O
the	O
women	O
in	O
a	O
terrible	O
fright	O
.	O

While	O
they	O
were	O
here	O
they	O
had	O
the	O
comfort	O
to	O
have	O
seven	O
of	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
come	O
to	O
their	O
assistance	O
;	O
the	O
other	O
ten	O
,	O
with	O
their	O
servants	O
,	O
and	O
Friday	O
's	O
father	O
,	O
were	O
gone	O
in	O
a	O
body	O
to	O
defend	O
their	O
bower	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
corn	O
and	O
cattle	O
that	O
were	O
kept	O
there	O
,	O
in	O
case	O
the	O
savages	O
should	O
have	O
roved	O
over	O
to	O
that	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
spread	O
so	O
far	O
.	O

With	O
the	O
seven	O
Spaniards	O
came	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
savages	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
were	O
their	O
prisoners	O
formerly	O
;	O
and	O
with	O
them	O
also	O
came	O
the	O
savage	O
whom	O
the	O
Englishmen	O
had	O
left	O
bound	O
hand	O
and	O
foot	O
at	O
the	O
tree	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
seems	O
they	O
came	O
that	O
way	O
,	O
saw	O
the	O
slaughter	O
of	O
the	O
seven	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
unbound	O
the	O
eighth	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
him	O
along	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
where	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
bind	O
again	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
the	O
two	O
others	O
who	O
were	O
left	O
when	O
the	O
third	O
ran	O
away	O
.	O

The	O
prisoners	O
now	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
burden	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
afraid	O
of	O
their	O
escaping	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
once	O
resolving	O
to	O
kill	O
them	O
all	O
,	O
believing	O
they	O
were	O
under	O
an	O
absolute	O
necessity	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
for	O
their	O
own	O
preservation	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
chief	O
of	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
would	O
not	O
consent	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
ordered	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
present	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
sent	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
my	O
old	O
cave	O
in	O
the	O
valley	O
,	O
and	O
be	O
kept	O
there	O
,	O
with	O
two	O
Spaniards	O
to	O
guard	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
have	O
food	O
for	O
their	O
subsistence	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
done	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
bound	O
there	O
hand	O
and	O
foot	O
for	O
that	O
night	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
came	O
,	O
the	O
two	O
Englishmen	O
were	O
so	O
encouraged	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
satisfy	O
themselves	O
to	O
stay	O
any	O
longer	O
there	O
;	O
but	O
taking	O
five	O
of	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
and	O
themselves	O
,	O
with	O
four	O
muskets	O
and	O
a	O
pistol	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
stout	O
quarter-staves	O
,	O
away	O
they	O
went	O
in	O
quest	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
.	O

And	O
first	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
tree	O
where	O
the	O
men	O
lay	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
killed	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
easy	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
some	O
more	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
had	O
been	O
there	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
attempted	O
to	O
carry	O
their	O
dead	O
men	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
dragged	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
,	O
but	O
had	O
given	O
it	O
over	O
.	O

From	O
thence	O
they	O
advanced	O
to	O
the	O
first	O
rising	O
ground	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
stood	O
and	O
seen	O
their	O
camp	O
destroyed	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
the	O
mortification	O
still	O
to	O
see	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
smoke	O
;	O
but	O
neither	O
could	O
they	O
here	O
see	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
.	O

They	O
then	O
resolved	O
,	O
though	O
with	O
all	O
possible	O
caution	O
,	O
to	O
go	O
forward	O
towards	O
their	O
ruined	O
plantation	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
a	O
little	O
before	O
they	O
came	O
thither	O
,	O
coming	O
in	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
sea-shore	O
,	O
they	O
saw	O
plainly	O
the	O
savages	O
all	O
embarked	O
again	O
in	O
their	O
canoes	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
be	O
gone	O
.	O

They	O
seemed	O
sorry	O
at	O
first	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
way	O
to	O
come	O
at	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
a	O
parting	O
blow	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
upon	O
the	O
whole	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
well	O
satisfied	O
to	O
be	O
rid	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
poor	O
Englishmen	O

now	O
twice	O
ruined	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
their	O
improvements	O
destroyed	O
,	O
the	O

to	O

and	O
help	O
them	O
to	O
rebuild	O
,	O
and	O
assist	O
them	O
with	O
needful	O
supplies	O

Their	O
three	O
countrymen	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
not	O
yet	O
noted	O
for	O
having	O
the	O
least	O
inclination	O
to	O
do	O
any	O
good	O
,	O
yet	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
heard	O
of	O
it	O

for	O
they	O

living	O

came	O

offered	O
their	O

and	O
did	O
,	O
very	O
friendly	O

work	O
for	O
several	O
days	O
to	O
restore	O
their	O
habitation	O
and	O

And	O
thus	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
time	O
they	O
were	O
set	O
upon	O
their	O
legs	O
again	O

About	O
two	O
days	O
after	O
this	O
they	O
had	O
the	O
farther	O
satisfaction	O
of	O
seeing	O
three	O
of	O

driving	O
on	O

at	O
some	O
distance	O
from	O
them	O

two	O
drowned	O
men	O

by	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O

that	O
they	O

met	O
with	O
a	O

at	O

A	O
GREAT	O
VICTORY	O
It	O
was	O
five	O

six	O
months	O
after	O

of	O

our	O

;	O
when	O

on	O
a	O
sudden	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
invaded	O
with	O
a	O
most	O
formidable	O
fleet	O
of	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
eight-and-twenty	O
canoes	O
,	O
full	O
of	O
savages	O

armed	O
with	O
bows	O

such	O

in	O
short	O

it	O
put	O
all	O
our	O
people	O
into	O
the	O
utmost	O
consternation	O

As	O
they	O
came	O
on	O
shore	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
easternmost	O
side	O
of	O
the	O

our	O

had	O
that	O
night	O
to	O

In	O
the	O
first	O
place	O

knowing	O
that	O
their	O
being	O
entirely	O

was	O
their	O
only	O
safety	O
before	O
and	O
would	O
be	O
much	O
more	O
so	O
now	O
,	O
while	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
their	O
enemies	O
would	O
be	O
so	O
great	O
,	O
they	O
resolved	O
,	O
first	O
of	O
all	O
,	O
to	O
take	O
down	O
the	O
huts	O
which	O
were	O
built	O
for	O
the	O
two	O
Englishmen	O
,	O
and	O
drive	O
away	O
their	O
goats	O
to	O
the	O
old	O
cave	O
;	O
because	O
they	O
supposed	O
the	O
savages	O
would	O
go	O
directly	O
thither	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
day	O

to	O

In	O
the	O
next	O
place	O

the	O

at	O
the	O

and	O
the	O
next	O

themselves	O

all	O
their	O
force	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
plantation	O
of	O
the	O

the	O

Will	O
Atkins	O

who	O

a	O

fellow	O
for	O

,	O
was	O
a	O
most	O
daring	O
,	O
bold	O
fellow	O
,	O
commanded	O
under	O
him	O
.	O

The	O
savages	O
came	O
forward	O
like	O
lions	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
worst	O
of	O
their	O
fate	O

had	O
no	O
advantage	O
in	O
their	O
situation	O
;	O
only	O
that	O
Will	O
Atkins	O
,	O
who	O
now	O
proved	O
a	O
most	O
useful	O
fellow	O
,	O
with	O
six	O
men	O
,	O
was	O
planted	O
just	O
behind	O

with	O

fire	O
into	O
the	O

of	O
them	O

and	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
had	O

to	O
make	O
his	O
retreat	O
as	O
nimbly	O
as	O
he	O
could	O
round	O
a	O

of	O
the	O

and	O
so	O
come	O
in	O
behind	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
stood	O
,	O
having	O
a	O
thicket	O
of	O
trees	O
before	O
them	O

When	O
the	O
savages	O
came	O
on	O
,	O
they	O
ran	O
straggling	O
about	O
every	O

in	O

How	O

they	O
knew	O
not	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
consternation	O

surprise	O
was	O
inexpressible	O
among	O
the	O
savages	O
;	O
they	O
were	O
frightened	O
to	O
the	O

to	O

Had	O

his	O

been	O
effectually	O

;	O
for	O
the	O
terror	O
that	O
was	O
among	O

principally	O
from	O
this	O

that	O

But	O
Will	O
Atkins	O
,	O
staying	O
to	O

again	O
,	O
discovered	O
the	O
cheat	O

some	O
of	O
the	O

who	O
were	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O

came	O
upon	O

also	O
,	O
two	O

retiring	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
,	O
yet	O
they	O
wounded	O
Atkins	O
himself	O

and	O
killed	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
fellow-Englishmen	O
with	O
their	O
arrows	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
did	O
afterwards	O
one	O
Spaniard	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Indian	O
slaves	O
who	O
came	O
with	O
the	O
women	O

This	O
slave	O
was	O
a	O
most	O
gallant	O
fellow	O
,	O
and	O
fought	O
most	O
desperately	O
,	O
killing	O
five	O
of	O
them	O
with	O
his	O

Our	O

;	O
and	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
after	O
firing	O
three	O
volleys	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
retreated	O
also	O
;	O
for	O
their	O
number	O
was	O
so	O
great	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
desperate	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
above	O
fifty	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
killed	O
,	O
and	O
more	O
than	O
as	O
many	O
wounded	O
,	O
yet	O
they	O
came	O
on	O
in	O
the	O
teeth	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
fearless	O
of	O
danger	O
,	O
and	O
shot	O
their	O
arrows	O
like	O
a	O
cloud	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
observed	O
that	O
their	O
wounded	O
men	O

who	O
were	O
not	O
quite	O
disabled	O
,	O
were	O
made	O
outrageous	O
by	O
their	O
wounds	O

fought	O
like	O
madmen	O

When	O
our	O

they	O
left	O
the	O

the	O

that	O

and	O
the	O

when	O
they	O

up	O
to	O
them	O

killed	O
them	O
over	O

in	O
a	O

their	O

with	O
their	O

finding	O

gone	O
,	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
seem	O

to	O

them	O

drew	O
themselves	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
ring	O

which	O
is	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
their	O
custom	O

and	O
shouted	O
twice	O

in	O
token	O
of	O
their	O
victory	O
;	O
after	O
which	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
the	O
mortification	O
to	O

several	O
of	O

men	O
fall	O

dying	O
with	O
the	O

The	O
Spaniard	O

up	O

upon	O
a	O
rising	O
ground	O
,	O
Atkins	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
was	O

would	O

had	O
them	O
march	O

charge	O
again	O
all	O
together	O
at	O
once	O
:	O
but	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
replied	O
,	O
``	O
Seignior	O

you	O
see	O

This	O
advice	O
was	O
good	O

``	O

But	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
clear	O

one	O

they	O
had	O
a	O

the	O

in	O

round	O

the	O

westward	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
turning	O
short	O
south	O

they	O
came	O
so	O

the	O

eight	O

The	O

charged	O
again	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
expedition	O

then	O
divided	O
themselves	O
into	O
three	O
bodies	O

resolved	O

out	O

up	O

;	O
but	O
having	O
refreshed	O
themselves	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
,	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
march	O
to	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
where	O
the	O
savages	O
were	O
fled	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
what	O
posture	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
.	O

This	O
necessarily	O
led	O
them	O
over	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
the	O
fight	O
had	O
been	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
they	O
found	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
poor	O
creatures	O
not	O
quite	O
dead	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
past	O
recovering	O
life	O
;	O
a	O
sight	O
disagreeable	O
enough	O
to	O
generous	O
minds	O

for	O
a	O
truly	O
great	O
man	O
though	O
obliged	O
by	O
the	O
law	O
of	O
battle	O
to	O
destroy	O
his	O
enemy	O
,	O
takes	O
no	O
delight	O
in	O
his	O
misery	O

However	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
need	O
to	O
give	O
any	O
orders	O
in	O
this	O
case	O
;	O
for	O
their	O
own	O
savages	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
their	O
servants	O
,	O
despatched	O
these	O
poor	O
creatures	O
with	O
their	O
hatchets	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
they	O
came	O
in	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
the	O
more	O
miserable	O
remains	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
'	O
army	O
lay	O
,	O
where	O
there	O
appeared	O
about	O
a	O
hundred	O
still	O
;	O
their	O
posture	O
was	O
generally	O
sitting	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
with	O
their	O
knees	O
up	O
towards	O
their	O
mouth	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
head	O
put	O
between	O
the	O
two	O
hands	O
,	O
leaning	O
down	O
upon	O
the	O
knees	O

When	O
our	O
men	O
came	O
within	O
two	O
musket-shots	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
governor	O
ordered	O
two	O
muskets	O
to	O
be	O
fired	O
without	O
ball	O
,	O
to	O
alarm	O
them	O
;	O
this	O
he	O
did	O
,	O
that	O
by	O
their	O
countenance	O
he	O
might	O
know	O
what	O
to	O
expect	O
,	O
whether	O
they	O
were	O
still	O
in	O
heart	O
to	O
fight	O
,	O
or	O
were	O
so	O
heartily	O
beaten	O
as	O
to	O
be	O
discouraged	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
he	O
might	O
manage	O
accordingly	O
.	O

This	O
stratagem	O
took	O
:	O
for	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
savages	O
heard	O
the	O
first	O
gun	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
the	O
flash	O
of	O
the	O
second	O
,	O
they	O
started	O
up	O
upon	O
their	O
feet	O
in	O
the	O
greatest	O
consternation	O
imaginable	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
our	O
men	O
advanced	O
swiftly	O
towards	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
all	O
ran	O
screaming	O
and	O
yelling	O
away	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
howling	O
noise	O
,	O
which	O
our	O
men	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
never	O
heard	O
before	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
they	O
ran	O
up	O
the	O
hills	O
into	O
the	O
country	O

At	O
first	O
our	O
men	O
had	O
much	O
rather	O
the	O
weather	O
had	O
been	O
calm	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
had	O
all	O
gone	O
away	O
to	O
sea	O
:	O
but	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
then	O
consider	O
that	O
this	O
might	O
probably	O
have	O
been	O
the	O
occasion	O
of	O
their	O
coming	O
again	O
in	O
such	O
multitudes	O
as	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
resisted	O
,	O
or	O
,	O
at	O

,	O
to	O
come	O
so	O
many	O
and	O
so	O
often	O
as	O
would	O
quite	O
desolate	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
starve	O
them	O
.	O

Will	O
Atkins	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
who	O
notwithstanding	O
his	O
wound	O
kept	O
always	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
proved	O
the	O
best	O
counsellor	O
in	O
this	O
case	O
:	O
his	O
advice	O
was	O
,	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
advantage	O
that	O
offered	O
,	O
and	O
step	O
in	O
between	O
them	O
and	O
their	O
boats	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
deprive	O
them	O
of	O
the	O
capacity	O
of	O
ever	O
returning	O
any	O
more	O
to	O
plague	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

They	O
consulted	O
long	O
about	O
this	O
;	O
and	O
some	O
were	O
against	O
it	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
making	O
the	O
wretches	O
fly	O
to	O
the	O
woods	O
and	O
live	O
there	O
desperate	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
they	O
should	O
have	O
them	O
to	O
hunt	O
like	O
wild	O
beasts	O
,	O
be	O
afraid	O
to	O
stir	O
out	O
about	O

and	O
have	O
their	O
plantations	O
continually	O
rifled	O

all	O
their	O

and	O
,	O
in	O

reduced	O
to	O
a	O
life	O
of	O
continual	O
distress	O

Will	O
Atkins	O
told	O
them	O
they	O
had	O
better	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
a	O
hundred	O

than	O
with	O
a	O
hundred	O
nations	O
;	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
must	O
destroy	O
their	O

so	O
they	O
must	O
destroy	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
or	O
be	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
destroyed	O
themselves	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
he	O
showed	O
them	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
it	O
so	O
plainly	O
that	O
they	O
all	O
came	O
into	O
it	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
immediately	O
with	O
the	O
boats	O
,	O
and	O
getting	O
some	O
dry	O
wood	O
together	O
from	O
a	O
dead	O
tree	O
,	O
they	O
tried	O
to	O
set	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
on	O
fire	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
wet	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
burn	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
the	O
fire	O
so	O
burned	O
the	O
upper	O
part	O
that	O
it	O
soon	O
made	O
them	O
unfit	O
for	O

at	O

When	O
the	O
Indians	O
saw	O
what	O
they	O
were	O
about	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
came	O
running	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
and	O
coming	O
as	O
near	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
to	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
kneeled	O
down	O
and	O
cried	O
,	O
``	O
Oa	O

Waramokoa	O

''	O
and	O
some	O
other	O
words	O
of	O
their	O
language	O
,	O
which	O
none	O
of	O
the	O
others	O
understood	O
anything	O
of	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
they	O
made	O
pitiful	O
gestures	O
and	O
strange	O
noises	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
easy	O
to	O
understand	O
they	O
begged	O
to	O
have	O
their	O

and	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
be	O

never	O

But	O
our	O

were	O

no	O

they	O

at	O
the	O

raised	O
a	O

in	O
the	O

which	O
our	O

heard	O
plain	O
enough	O

after	O

The	O
extremity	O

was	O
great	O

indeed	O

,	O
at	O
the	O

time	O

our	O

just	O
under	O

so	O
that	O
he	O
never	O
spoke	O
more	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
remarkable	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
same	O
barbarous	O
fellow	O
that	O
cut	O
the	O
poor	O
savage	O
slave	O
with	O
his	O
hatchet	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
afterwards	O
intended	O
to	O
have	O
murdered	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
.	O

I	O
looked	O
upon	O
their	O
case	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
worse	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
than	O
mine	O
was	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
,	O
after	O
I	O
first	O
discovered	O
the	O
grains	O
of	O
barley	O
and	O
rice	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
into	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
planting	O

raising	O
my	O
corn	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
tame	O
cattle	O
;	O
for	O
now	O
they	O
had	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
may	O
say	O
,	O
a	O
hundred	O
wolves	O
upon	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
devour	O
everything	O
they	O
could	O
come	O
at	O
,	O
yet	O
could	O
be	O
hardly	O
come	O
at	O
themselves	O

When	O
they	O
saw	O
what	O
their	O
circumstances	O
were	O
,	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
they	O
concluded	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
drive	O
the	O
savages	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
farther	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
south-west	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
any	O
more	O
came	O
on	O
shore	O
they	O
might	O
not	O
find	O
one	O
another	O
;	O
then	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
daily	O
hunt	O
and	O
harass	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
kill	O
as	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
come	O
at	O
,	O
till	O
they	O
had	O
reduced	O
their	O
number	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
at	O
last	O
tame	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
bring	O
them	O
to	O
anything	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
give	O
them	O
corn	O
,	O
and	O
teach	O
them	O
how	O
to	O
plant	O
,	O
and	O
live	O
upon	O
their	O
daily	O
labour	O
.	O

In	O
order	O
to	O
do	O
this	O
,	O
they	O
so	O
followed	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
terrified	O
them	O
with	O
their	O
guns	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
,	O
if	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
fired	O
a	O

at	O
an	O
Indian	O

if	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
hit	O
him	O

he	O
would	O
fall	O
down	O
for	O
fear	O

So	O
dreadfully	O
frightened	O
were	O
they	O
that	O
they	O

out	O

farther	O
and	O

at	O

every	O

killing	O

some	O
of	O

it	O
reduced	O
them	O
to	O
the	O

and	O
many	O
were	O

in	O
the	O

When	O
our	O

found	O
this	O

their	O

and	O

moved	O
them	O

especially	O
the	O
generous-minded	O
Spaniard	O
governor	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
proposed	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O

to	O
take	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
alive	O

bring	O
him	O

so	O

to	O
be	O

and	O
go	O
among	O

might	O
be	O

to	O
some	O

that	O
might	O

depended	O
upon	O

to	O

It	O
was	O
some	O
while	O
before	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
could	O
be	O
taken	O
;	O
but	O
being	O
weak	O
and	O
half-starved	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
at	O

surprised	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
prisoner	O

He	O
was	O
sullen	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
neither	O
eat	O
nor	O

;	O
but	O
finding	O
himself	O
kindly	O
used	O

and	O
victuals	O
given	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
no	O

him	O
,	O
he	O
at	O

grew	O
tractable	O

and	O
came	O
to	O
himself	O

They	O
often	O
brought	O
old	O
Friday	O
to	O
talk	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
who	O
always	O
told	O
him	O
how	O

all	O
;	O
that	O
they	O

that	O

not	O

that	O

it	O

some	O

bade	O
the	O

go	O

talk	O
with	O
the	O

of	O
his	O

they	O

The	O
poor	O

reduced	O
in	O

to	O
about	O
thirty-seven	O
,	O
closed	O
with	O
the	O
proposal	O
at	O
the	O
first	O

,	O
and	O
begged	O
to	O
have	O
some	O
food	O
given	O
them	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
twelve	O
Spaniards	O

two	O

,	O
well	O

with	O
three	O

slaves	O
and	O
old	O
Friday	O
,	O
marched	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
.	O

The	O
three	O
Indian	O
slaves	O
carried	O
them	O
a	O
large	O
quantity	O
of	O
bread	O

some	O
rice	O
boiled	O
up	O
to	O
cakes	O
and	O
dried	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
and	O
three	O
live	O
goats	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
ordered	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
a	O
hill	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
sat	O
down	O
,	O
ate	O
their	O
provisions	O
very	O
thankfully	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
the	O
most	O
faithful	O
fellows	O
to	O
their	O
words	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
thought	O
of	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
except	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
beg	O
victuals	O
and	O
directions	O
,	O
they	O
never	O
came	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
bounds	O
;	O
and	O
there	O
they	O
lived	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
and	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
see	O
them	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
taught	O
them	O
both	O
to	O
plant	O
corn	O
,	O
make	O
bread	O
,	O
breed	O
tame	O
goats	O
,	O
and	O
milk	O
them	O
:	O
they	O
wanted	O
nothing	O
but	O
wives	O
in	O
order	O
for	O
them	O
soon	O
to	O
become	O
a	O
nation	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
confined	O
to	O
a	O
neck	O
of	O
land	O
,	O
surrounded	O
with	O
high	O
rocks	O
behind	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
lying	O
plain	O
towards	O
the	O
sea	O
before	O
them	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
south-east	O
corner	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
land	O
enough	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
and	O
fruitful	O
;	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
broad	O
,	O
and	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
miles	O
in	O
length	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
taught	O
them	O
to	O
make	O
wooden	O
spades	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
I	O
made	O
for	O
myself	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
among	O
them	O
twelve	O
hatchets	O
and	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
knives	O
;	O
and	O
there	O
they	O
lived	O
,	O
the	O
most	O
subjected	O
,	O
innocent	O
creatures	O
that	O
ever	O
were	O
heard	O
of	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
the	O
colony	O
enjoyed	O
a	O
perfect	O
tranquillity	O
with	O
respect	O
to	O
the	O
savages	O
,	O
till	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
revisit	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
about	O
two	O
years	O
after	O
;	O
not	O
but	O
that	O
,	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
some	O
canoes	O
of	O
savages	O
came	O
on	O
shore	O
for	O
their	O
triumphal	O
,	O
unnatural	O
feasts	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
of	O
several	O
nations	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
had	O
never	O
heard	O
of	O
those	O
that	O
came	O
before	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
reason	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
make	O
any	O
search	O
or	O
inquiry	O
after	O
their	O
countrymen	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
hard	O
to	O
have	O
found	O
them	O
out	O
.	O

Thus	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
given	O
a	O
full	O
account	O
of	O
all	O
that	O
happened	O
to	O
them	O
till	O
my	O
return	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
that	O
was	O
worth	O
notice	O
.	O

The	O
Indians	O
were	O
wonderfully	O
civilised	O
by	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
frequently	O
went	O
among	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
forbid	O
,	O
on	O
pain	O
of	O
death	O
,	O
any	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
coming	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
because	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
their	O
settlement	O
betrayed	O
again	O
.	O

One	O
thing	O
was	O
very	O
remarkable	O
,	O
viz.	O
that	O
they	O
taught	O
the	O
savages	O
to	O
make	O
wicker	O
-	O
work	O
,	O
or	O
baskets	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
soon	O
outdid	O
their	O
masters	O
:	O
for	O
they	O
made	O
abundance	O
of	O
ingenious	O
things	O
in	O
wicker-work	O
,	O
particularly	O
baskets	O
,	O
sieves	O
,	O
bird-cages	O
,	O
cupboards	O
,	O
&	O
c.	O
;	O
as	O
also	O
chairs	O
,	O
stools	O
,	O
beds	O
,	O
couches	O
,	O
being	O
very	O
ingenious	O
at	O
such	O
work	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
once	O
put	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

My	O
coming	O
was	O
a	O
particular	O
relief	O
to	O
these	O
people	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
furnished	O
them	O
with	O
knives	O
,	O
scissors	O
,	O
spades	O
,	O
shovels	O
,	O
pick-axes	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
things	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
which	O
they	O
could	O
want	O
.	O

With	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
those	O
tools	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
very	O
handy	O
that	O
they	O
came	O
at	O
last	O
to	O
build	O
up	O
their	O
huts	O
or	O
houses	O
very	O
handsomely	O
,	O
raddling	O
or	O
working	O
it	O
up	O
like	O
basket-work	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
round	O
.	O

This	O
piece	O
of	O
ingenuity	O
,	O
although	O
it	O
looked	O
very	O
odd	O
,	O
was	O
an	O
exceeding	O
good	O
fence	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
against	O
heat	O
as	O
against	O
all	O
sorts	O
of	O
vermin	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
were	O
so	O
taken	O
with	O
it	O
that	O
they	O
got	O
the	O
Indians	O
to	O
come	O
and	O
do	O
the	O
like	O
for	O
them	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
two	O
Englishmen	O
's	O
colonies	O
,	O
they	O
looked	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
all	O
lived	O
like	O
bees	O
in	O
a	O
hive	O
.	O

As	O
for	O
Will	O
Atkins	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
now	O
become	O
a	O
very	O
industrious	O
,	O
useful	O
,	O
and	O
sober	O
fellow	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
made	O
himself	O
such	O
a	O
tent	O
of	O
basket-work	O
as	O
I	O
believe	O
was	O
never	O
seen	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
one	O
hundred	O
and	O
twenty	O
paces	O
round	O
on	O
the	O
outside	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
measured	O
by	O
my	O
steps	O
;	O
the	O
walls	O
were	O
as	O
close	O
worked	O
as	O
a	O
basket	O
,	O
in	O
panels	O
or	O
squares	O
of	O
thirty-two	O
in	O
number	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
strong	O
,	O
standing	O
about	O
seven	O
feet	O
high	O
;	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
was	O
another	O
not	O
above	O
twenty-two	O
paces	O
round	O
,	O
but	O
built	O
stronger	O
,	O
being	O
octagon	O
in	O
its	O
form	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
eight	O
corners	O
stood	O
eight	O
very	O
strong	O
posts	O
;	O
round	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
which	O
he	O
laid	O
strong	O
pieces	O
,	O
knit	O
together	O
with	O
wooden	O
pins	O
,	O
from	O
which	O
he	O
raised	O
a	O
pyramid	O
for	O
a	O
handsome	O
roof	O
of	O
eight	O
rafters	O
,	O
joined	O
together	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
nails	O
,	O
and	O
only	O
a	O
few	O
iron	O
spikes	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
made	O
himself	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
old	O
iron	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
left	O
there	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
this	O
fellow	O
showed	O
abundance	O
of	O
ingenuity	O
in	O
several	O
things	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
knowledge	O
of	O
:	O
he	O
made	O
him	O
a	O
forge	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
wooden	O
bellows	O
to	O
blow	O
the	O
fire	O
;	O
he	O
made	O
himself	O
charcoal	O
for	O
his	O
work	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
formed	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
iron	O
crows	O
a	O
middling	O
good	O
anvil	O
to	O
hammer	O
upon	O
:	O
in	O
this	O
manner	O
he	O
made	O
many	O
things	O
,	O
but	O
especially	O
hooks	O
,	O
staples	O
,	O
and	O
spikes	O
,	O
bolts	O
and	O
hinges	O
.	O

But	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
the	O
house	O
:	O
after	O
he	O
had	O
pitched	O
the	O
roof	O
of	O
his	O
innermost	O
tent	O
,	O
he	O
worked	O
it	O
up	O
between	O
the	O
rafters	O
with	O
basket-work	O
,	O
so	O
firm	O
,	O
and	O
thatched	O
that	O
over	O
again	O
so	O
ingeniously	O
with	O
rice-straw	O
,	O
and	O
over	O
that	O
a	O
large	O
leaf	O
of	O
a	O
tree	O
,	O
which	O
covered	O
the	O
top	O
,	O
that	O
his	O
house	O
was	O
as	O
dry	O
as	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
tiled	O
or	O
slated	O
.	O

He	O
owned	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
savages	O
had	O
made	O
the	O
basket-work	O
for	O
him	O
.	O

The	O
outer	O
circuit	O
was	O
covered	O
as	O
a	O
lean-to	O
all	O
round	O
this	O
inner	O
apartment	O
,	O
and	O
long	O
rafters	O
lay	O
from	O
the	O
thirty-two	O
angles	O
to	O
the	O
top	O
posts	O
of	O
the	O
inner	O
house	O
,	O
being	O
about	O
twenty	O
feet	O
distant	O

so	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O

without	O
the	O
inner	O

twenty	O

The	O
inner	O
place	O
he	O
partitioned	O
off	O
with	O
the	O

wickerwork	O
,	O
but	O
much	O
fairer	O
,	O
and	O
divided	O
into	O
six	O
apartments	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
six	O
rooms	O
on	O
a	O

out	O

THE	O

CLERGYMAN	O

COUNSEL	O
Having	O
thus	O
given	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
colony	O
in	O
general	O
,	O
and	O
pretty	O
much	O
of	O
my	O
runagate	O
Englishmen	O
,	O
I	O
must	O
say	O
something	O
of	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
the	O
main	O
body	O
of	O
the	O
family	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
whose	O
story	O
there	O
are	O
some	O
incidents	O
also	O
remarkable	O
enough	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
discourses	O
with	O
them	O
about	O
their	O
circumstances	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
among	O
the	O
savages	O
.	O

They	O
told	O
me	O
readily	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
instances	O
to	O
give	O
of	O
their	O
application	O
or	O
ingenuity	O
in	O
that	O
country	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
a	O
poor	O
,	O
miserable	O
,	O
dejected	O
handful	O
of	O
people	O
;	O
that	O
even	O
if	O
means	O
had	O
been	O
put	O
into	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
yet	O
they	O
had	O
so	O
abandoned	O
themselves	O
to	O
despair	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
so	O
sunk	O
under	O
the	O
weight	O
of	O
their	O
misfortune	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
thought	O
of	O
nothing	O
but	O
starving	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
a	O
grave	O
and	O
sensible	O
man	O
,	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
was	O
convinced	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
wrong	O
;	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
wise	O
men	O
to	O
give	O
themselves	O
up	O
to	O
their	O
misery	O
,	O
but	O
always	O
to	O
take	O
hold	O
of	O
the	O
helps	O
which	O
reason	O
offered	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
for	O
present	O
support	O
as	O
for	O
future	O
deliverance	O
:	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
grief	O
was	O
the	O
most	O
senseless	O
,	O
insignificant	O
passion	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
it	O
regarded	O
only	O
things	O
past	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
generally	O
impossible	O
to	O
be	O
recalled	O
or	O
to	O
be	O
remedied	O
,	O
but	O
had	O
no	O
views	O
of	O
things	O
to	O
come	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
no	O
share	O
in	O
anything	O
that	O
looked	O
like	O
deliverance	O
,	O
but	O
rather	O
added	O
to	O
the	O
affliction	O
than	O
proposed	O
a	O
remedy	O
;	O
and	O
upon	O
this	O
he	O
repeated	O
a	O
Spanish	O
proverb	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
repeat	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
words	O
that	O
he	O
spoke	O
it	O
in	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
remember	O
I	O
made	O
it	O
into	O
an	O
English	O
proverb	O
of	O
my	O
own	O
,	O
thus	O
:	O
--	O
``	O
In	O
trouble	O

troubled	O

''	O

He	O
then	O
ran	O
on	O
in	O
remarks	O
upon	O
all	O
the	O
little	O
improvements	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
in	O
my	O
solitude	O

my	O
unwearied	O
application	O

he	O
called	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
how	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
a	O
condition	O

which	O
in	O
its	O

was	O
at	O

much	O
worse	O

than	O
theirs	O
was	O
,	O
even	O
now	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
together	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
it	O
was	O
remarkable	O
that	O
Englishmen	O
had	O
a	O
greater	O
presence	O
of	O
mind	O
in	O
their	O
distress	O
than	O
any	O
people	O
that	O
ever	O
he	O
met	O
with	O
;	O
that	O
their	O
unhappy	O
nation	O
and	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
were	O
the	O
worst	O
men	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
to	O
struggle	O
with	O
misfortunes	O
;	O
for	O
that	O
their	O
first	O
step	O
in	O
dangers	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
common	O
efforts	O
were	O
over	O

was	O
to	O
despair	O

lie	O
down	O
under	O
it	O

,	O
without	O
rousing	O
their	O

up	O
to	O

I	O

that	O

them	O
by	O

They	O
then	O
gave	O
me	O
an	O
account	O
how	O
the	O
savages	O
whom	O
they	O
lived	O
amongst	O
expected	O
them	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
with	O
them	O
into	O
their	O
wars	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
true	O
,	O
that	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
firearms	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
had	O
they	O
not	O
had	O
the	O
disaster	O
to	O
lose	O
their	O
ammunition	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
serviceable	O
not	O
only	O
to	O
their	O
friends	O
,	O
but	O
have	O
made	O
themselves	O
terrible	O
both	O
to	O
friends	O
and	O
enemies	O
;	O
but	O
being	O
without	O
powder	O
and	O
shot	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
in	O
a	O
condition	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
in	O
reason	O
decline	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
with	O
their	O
landlords	O
to	O
their	O
wars	O
;	O
so	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
field	O
of	O
battle	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
a	O
worse	O
condition	O
than	O
the	O
savages	O
themselves	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
neither	O
bows	O
nor	O
arrows	O
,	O
nor	O
could	O
they	O
use	O
those	O
the	O
savages	O
gave	O
them	O
.	O

So	O
they	O
could	O
do	O
nothing	O
but	O
stand	O
still	O
and	O
be	O
wounded	O
with	O
arrows	O
,	O
till	O
they	O
came	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
teeth	O
of	O
the	O
enemy	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
the	O
three	O
halberds	O
they	O
had	O
were	O
of	O
use	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
would	O
often	O
drive	O
a	O
whole	O
little	O
army	O
before	O
them	O
with	O
those	O
halberds	O
,	O
and	O
sharpened	O
sticks	O
put	O
into	O
the	O
muzzles	O
of	O
their	O
muskets	O
.	O

But	O
for	O
all	O
this	O
they	O
were	O
sometimes	O
surrounded	O
with	O
multitudes	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
great	O
danger	O
from	O
their	O
arrows	O
,	O
till	O
at	O
last	O
they	O
found	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
make	O
themselves	O
large	O
targets	O
of	O
wood	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
covered	O
with	O
skins	O
of	O
wild	O
beasts	O
,	O
whose	O
names	O
they	O
knew	O
not	O
,	O
and	O
these	O
covered	O
them	O
from	O
the	O
arrows	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
:	O
that	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
these	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
sometimes	O
in	O
great	O
danger	O
;	O
and	O
five	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
once	O
knocked	O
down	O
together	O
with	O
the	O
clubs	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
time	O
when	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
taken	O
prisoner	O
--	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
whom	O
I	O
relieved	O
.	O

At	O
first	O
they	O
thought	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
killed	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
they	O
afterwards	O
heard	O
he	O
was	O
taken	O
prisoner	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
under	O
the	O
greatest	O
grief	O
imaginable	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
willingly	O
have	O
all	O
ventured	O
their	O
lives	O
to	O
have	O
rescued	O
him	O

They	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
knocked	O
down	O
,	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
their	O
company	O
rescued	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
over	O
them	O
fighting	O
till	O
they	O
were	O
come	O
to	O
themselves	O
,	O
all	O
but	O
him	O
whom	O
they	O
thought	O
had	O
been	O
dead	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
they	O
made	O
their	O
way	O
with	O
their	O
halberds	O
and	O
pieces	O
,	O
standing	O
close	O
together	O
in	O
a	O
line	O
,	O
through	O
a	O
body	O
of	O
above	O
a	O
thousand	O
savages	O
,	O
beating	O
down	O
all	O
that	O
came	O
in	O
their	O
way	O
,	O
got	O
the	O
victory	O
over	O
their	O
enemies	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
their	O
great	O
sorrow	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
with	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
their	O
friend	O

whom	O
the	O

carried	O
off	O
with	O
some	O

as	O
I	O
gave	O
an	O
account	O
before	O

They	O
described	O
,	O
most	O
affectionately	O
,	O
how	O
they	O
were	O
surprised	O
with	O
joy	O
at	O
the	O
return	O
of	O
their	O
friend	O
and	O
companion	O
in	O
misery	O
,	O
who	O
they	O
thought	O
had	O
been	O
devoured	O
by	O
wild	O
beasts	O
of	O
the	O
worst	O
kind	O
--	O
wild	O
men	O
;	O
and	O
yet	O
,	O
how	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
they	O
were	O
surprised	O
with	O
the	O
account	O
he	O
gave	O
them	O
of	O
his	O
errand	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
Christian	O
in	O
any	O
place	O
near	O
,	O
much	O
more	O
one	O
that	O
was	O
able	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
humanity	O
enough	O
,	O
to	O
contribute	O
to	O
their	O
deliverance	O
.	O

They	O
described	O
how	O
they	O
were	O
astonished	O
at	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
relief	O
I	O
sent	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
loaves	O
of	O
bread	O
--	O
things	O
they	O
had	O
not	O
seen	O
since	O
their	O
coming	O
to	O
that	O
miserable	O
place	O
;	O
how	O
often	O
they	O
crossed	O
it	O
and	O
blessed	O
it	O
as	O
bread	O
sent	O
from	O
heaven	O
;	O
and	O
what	O
a	O
reviving	O
cordial	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
their	O
spirits	O
to	O
taste	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
also	O
the	O
other	O
things	O
I	O
had	O
sent	O
for	O
their	O
supply	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
after	O
all	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
told	O
me	O
something	O
of	O
the	O
joy	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
at	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
a	O
boat	O
and	O
pilots	O
,	O
to	O
carry	O
them	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
person	O
and	O
place	O
from	O
whence	O
all	O
these	O
new	O
comforts	O
came	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O
express	O
it	O
by	O
words	O
,	O
for	O
their	O
excessive	O
joy	O
naturally	O
driving	O
them	O
to	O
unbecoming	O
extravagances	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
way	O
to	O
describe	O
them	O
but	O
by	O
telling	O
me	O
they	O
bordered	O
upon	O
lunacy	O
,	O
having	O
no	O
way	O
to	O
give	O
vent	O
to	O
their	O
passions	O
suitable	O
to	O
the	O
sense	O
that	O
was	O
upon	O
them	O
;	O
that	O
in	O
some	O
it	O
worked	O
one	O
way	O
and	O
in	O
some	O
another	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
through	O
a	O
surprise	O
of	O
joy	O
,	O
would	O
burst	O
into	O
tears	O
,	O
others	O
be	O
stark	O
mad	O
,	O
and	O
others	O
immediately	O
faint	O
.	O

This	O
discourse	O
extremely	O
affected	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
called	O
to	O
my	O
mind	O
Friday	O
's	O
ecstasy	O
when	O
he	O
met	O
his	O
father	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
poor	O
people	O
's	O
ecstasy	O
when	O
I	O
took	O
them	O
up	O
at	O
sea	O
after	O
their	O
ship	O
was	O
on	O
fire	O
;	O
the	O
joy	O
of	O
the	O
mate	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
when	O
he	O
found	O
himself	O
delivered	O
in	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
he	O
expected	O
to	O
perish	O
;	O
and	O
my	O
own	O
joy	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
after	O
twenty	O
-	O
eight	O
years	O
'	O
captivity	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
good	O
ship	O
ready	O
to	O
carry	O
me	O
to	O
my	O
own	O
country	O
.	O

All	O
these	O
things	O
made	O
me	O
more	O
sensible	O
of	O
the	O
relation	O
of	O
these	O
poor	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
more	O
affected	O
with	O
it	O
.	O

Having	O
thus	O
given	O
a	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
of	O
things	O
as	O
I	O
found	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
must	O
relate	O
the	O
heads	O
of	O
what	O
I	O
did	O
for	O
these	O
people	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
condition	O
in	O
which	O
I	O
left	O
them	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
their	O
opinion	O
,	O
and	O
mine	O
too	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
troubled	O
no	O
more	O
with	O
the	O
savages	O
,	O
or	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
cut	O
them	O
off	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
twice	O
as	O
many	O
as	O
before	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
concern	O
about	O
that	O
.	O

Then	O
I	O
entered	O
into	O
a	O
serious	O
discourse	O
with	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
call	O
governor	O
,	O
about	O
their	O
stay	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
come	O
to	O
carry	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
off	O
,	O
so	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
just	O
to	O
carry	O
off	O
some	O
and	O
leave	O
others	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
would	O
be	O
unwilling	O
to	O
stay	O
if	O
their	O
strength	O
was	O
diminished	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
establish	O
them	O
there	O
,	O
not	O
to	O
remove	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
let	O
them	O
know	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
brought	O
with	O
me	O
relief	O
of	O
sundry	O
kinds	O
for	O
them	O
;	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
charge	O
to	O
supply	O
them	O
with	O
all	O
things	O
necessary	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
for	O
their	O
convenience	O
as	O
their	O
defence	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
such	O
and	O
such	O
particular	O
persons	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
to	O
increase	O
and	O
recruit	O
their	O
number	O
,	O
as	O
by	O
the	O
particular	O
necessary	O
employments	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
bred	O
to	O
,	O
being	O
artificers	O
,	O
to	O
assist	O
them	O
in	O
those	O
things	O
in	O
which	O
at	O
present	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
want	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
all	O
together	O
when	O
I	O
talked	O
thus	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
before	O
I	O
delivered	O
to	O
them	O
the	O
stores	O
I	O
had	O
brought	O
,	O
I	O
asked	O
them	O
,	O
one	O
by	O
one	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
entirely	O
forgot	O
and	O
buried	O
the	O
first	O
animosities	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
shake	O
hands	O
with	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
and	O
engage	O
in	O
a	O
strict	O
friendship	O
and	O
union	O
of	O
interest	O
,	O
that	O
so	O
there	O
might	O
be	O
no	O
more	O
misunderstandings	O
and	O
jealousies	O
.	O

Will	O
Atkins	O
,	O
with	O
abundance	O
of	O
frankness	O
and	O
good	O
humour	O
,	O
said	O
they	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
affliction	O
enough	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
all	O
sober	O
,	O
and	O
enemies	O
enough	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
all	O
friends	O
;	O
that	O
,	O
for	O
his	O
part	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
live	O
and	O
die	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
so	O
far	O
from	O
designing	O
anything	O
against	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
owned	O
they	O
had	O
done	O
nothing	O
to	O
him	O
but	O
what	O
his	O
own	O
mad	O
humour	O
made	O
necessary	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
done	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
worse	O
,	O
in	O
their	O
case	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
ask	O
them	O
pardon	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
desired	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
foolish	O
and	O
brutish	O
things	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
very	O
willing	O
and	O
desirous	O
of	O
living	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
entire	O
friendship	O
and	O
union	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
do	O
anything	O
that	O
lay	O
in	O
his	O
power	O
to	O
convince	O
them	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
for	O
going	O
to	O
England	PNM

he	O
cared	O
not	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
not	O

these	O
twenty	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
said	O
they	O
had	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
at	O
first	O
disarmed	O
and	O
excluded	O
Will	O
Atkins	O

his	O
two	O
countrymen	O
for	O
their	O
ill	O

,	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
let	O
me	O
know	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
appealed	O
to	O
me	O
for	O
the	O
necessity	O
they	O
were	O
under	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
Will	O
Atkins	O
had	O
behaved	O
himself	O
so	O
bravely	O
in	O
the	O
great	O
fight	O
they	O
had	O
with	O
the	O
savages	O
,	O
and	O
on	O
several	O
occasions	O
since	O

had	O
showed	O
himself	O
so	O
faithful	O
to	O

and	O
concerned	O
for	O

the	O
general	O
interest	O
of	O
them	O
all	O

that	O
they	O
had	O
forgotten	O
all	O

merited	O

supplied	O
with	O

so	O

that	O

Upon	O
these	O
frank	O

open	O
declarations	O
of	O

we	O
appointed	O
the	O
next	O

to	O
dine	O
all	O
together	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
a	O
splendid	O
feast	O

I	O
caused	O
the	O
ship	O

his	O

to	O
come	O
on	O
shore	O
and	O

our	O

and	O
the	O
old	O
cook	O

had	O
on	O
shore	O
assisted	O

We	O
brought	O
on	O

six	O
pieces	O

with	O
our	O

it	O

in	O

I	O
gave	O
them	O
ten	O
bottles	O
of	O
French	O
claret	O
,	O
and	O
ten	O
bottles	O
of	O
English	PNM

;	O
things	O
that	O
neither	O
the	O

nor	O
the	O
English	O
had	O
tasted	O
for	O
many	O
years	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
supposed	O
they	O
were	O
very	O

of	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
added	O
to	O
our	O
feast	O
five	O
whole	O
kids	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
cooks	O
roasted	O
;	O
and	O
three	O

them	O
were	O
sent	O

covered	O
up	O
close	O

on	O

the	O

to	O
the	O

that	O
they	O
might	O
feast	O
on	O
fresh	O
meat	O
from	O

as	O
we	O
did	O
with	O
their	O

After	O
this	O
feast	O
,	O
at	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
innocently	O
merry	O
,	O
I	O
brought	O
my	O

wherein	O

that	O
there	O
might	O
be	O
no	O

I	O
showed	O
them	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O

desiring	O
that	O

,	O
at	O
the	O
Spaniard	O

made	O
them	O
up	O
six	O

these	O
were	O

the	O

what	O
it	O
was	O
to	O

I	O
allotted	O

I	O

to	O

every	O

and	O
ordered	O
that	O

I	O
can	O
not	O
express	O
what	O
pleasure	O
sat	O
upon	O
the	O
countenances	O
of	O
all	O
these	O

when	O
they	O

the	O

I	O
had	O
taken	O
of	O
them	O

and	O
how	O
well	O
I	O
had	O

them	O

They	O
told	O
me	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
father	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
having	O
such	O
a	O

as	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
so	O
remote	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
make	O
them	O

that	O

were	O
left	O
in	O
a	O

they	O

Then	O
I	O

the	O

to	O

As	O
to	O
the	O

I	O
scarce	O

I	O
agreed	O
to	O
this	O
readily	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
little	O
plot	O
of	O

where	O
they	O
had	O

a	O

families	O
of	O
Englishmen	O
,	O
I	O
mean	O
those	O
I	O
had	O
left	O
there	O
,	O
with	O
their	O
wives	O
and	O
children	O
;	O
three	O
savages	O
that	O
were	O
slaves	O

the	O
widow	O

children	O
of	O
the	O
Englishman	O
that	O
was	O
killed	O

the	O
young	O
man	O
and	O
the	O
maid	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
a	O
wife	O
of	O
her	O
before	O
we	O
went	O
away	O

There	O
were	O
besides	O
the	O
two	O
carpenters	O
and	O
the	O
tailor	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
brought	O
with	O
me	O
for	O
them	O
:	O
also	O
the	O
smith	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
necessary	O
man	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
especially	O
as	O
a	O
gunsmith	O
,	O
to	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
their	O
arms	O
;	O
and	O
my	O
other	O
man	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
called	O
Jack-of-all-trades	PNM
,	O
who	O
was	O
in	O
himself	O
as	O
good	O
almost	O
as	O
twenty	O
men	O
;	O
for	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
only	O
a	O
very	O
ingenious	O
fellow	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
very	O
merry	O
fellow	O
,	O
and	O
before	O
I	O
went	O
away	O
we	O
married	O
him	O
to	O
the	O
honest	O
maid	O
that	O
came	O
with	O
the	O
youth	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
I	O
mentioned	O
before	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
I	O
speak	O
of	O
marrying	O
,	O
it	O
brings	O
me	O
naturally	O
to	O
say	O
something	O
of	O
the	O
French	O
ecclesiastic	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
brought	O
with	O
me	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
crew	O
whom	O
I	O
took	O
up	O
at	O
sea	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
true	O
this	O
man	O
was	O
a	O
Roman	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
it	O
may	O
give	O
offence	O
to	O
some	O
hereafter	O
if	O
I	O
leave	O
anything	O
extraordinary	O
upon	O
record	O
of	O
a	O
man	O
whom	O
,	O
before	O
I	O
begin	O
,	O
I	O
must	O
-LRB-	O
to	O
set	O
him	O
out	O
in	O
just	O
colours	O
-RRB-	O
represent	O
in	O
terms	O
very	O
much	O
to	O
his	O
disadvantage	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
account	O
of	O
Protestants	O
;	O
as	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
Papist	O
;	O
secondly	O
,	O
a	O
Popish	O
priest	O
;	O
and	O
thirdly	O
,	O
a	O
French	O
Popish	O
priest	O
.	O

But	O
justice	O
demands	O
of	O
me	O
to	O
give	O
him	O
a	O
due	O
character	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
must	O
say	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
grave	O
,	O
sober	O
,	O
pious	O
,	O
and	O
most	O
religious	O
person	O
;	O
exact	O
in	O
his	O
life	O

extensive	O
in	O
his	O
charity	O
,	O
and	O
exemplary	O
in	O
almost	O
everything	O
he	O
did	O
.	O

What	O
then	O
can	O
any	O
one	O
say	O
against	O
being	O
very	O
sensible	O
of	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
such	O
a	O

notwithstanding	O
his	O

exceedingly	O
in	O

he	O

began	O
with	O

about	O

the	O

never	O

Martinico	PNM

that	O

went	O
on	O

bound	O
thither	O
at	O
St.	PNM

;	O
but	O
being	O
forced	O
into	O
Lisbon	PNM
by	O
bad	O
weather	O
,	O
the	O
ship	O
received	O
some	O
damage	O
by	O
running	O
aground	O
in	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
Tagus	PNM
,	O
and	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
unload	O
her	O
cargo	O
there	O
;	O

finding	O
a	O
Portuguese	O
ship	O
there	O
bound	O
for	O
the	O
Madeiras	O

ready	O
to	O

meet	O

ship	O
there	O

on	O
board	O

the	O
master	O

an	O
indifferent	O
mariner	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
reckoning	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
drove	O
to	O
Fayal	PNM
;	O
where	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
he	O
happened	O
to	O
find	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
market	O
for	O
his	O
cargo	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
corn	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
resolved	O
not	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O

to	O
load	O
salt	O
at	O
the	O
Isle	PNM
of	PNM

,	O
and	O
to	O
go	O
away	O
to	O
Newfoundland	PNM

He	O
had	O
no	O
remedy	O
in	O
this	O
exigence	O
but	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
the	O
ship	O

and	O
had	O
a	O
pretty	O
good	O
voyage	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
the	O

so	O
they	O

from	O

to	O
Quebec	PNM
,	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
to	O
Martinico	PNM
,	O
to	O
carry	O
provisions	O

he	O
thought	O
he	O
should	O
have	O
an	O
opportunity	O
to	O
complete	O
his	O
first	O
design	O

but	O
when	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
Quebec	PNM
,	O
the	O
master	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
died	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
vessel	O
proceeded	O
no	O
further	O
;	O
so	O
the	O
next	O
voyage	O
he	O
shipped	O
himself	O
for	O
France	PNM
,	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
that	O
was	O
burned	O
when	O
we	O
took	O
them	O
up	O
at	O

and	O
then	O
shipped	O
with	O
us	O
for	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
already	O
said	O

Thus	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
disappointed	O
in	O
five	O
voyages	O
;	O
all	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
may	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
in	O
one	O

besides	O
what	O
I	O
shall	O
have	O
occasion	O
to	O
mention	O

of	O
him	O

But	O
I	O
shall	O
not	O
make	O
digression	O
into	O
other	O
men	O

no	O

so	O
I	O
return	O
to	O
what	O
concerns	O
our	O
affair	O
in	O
the	O

He	O
came	O
to	O
me	O
one	O
morning	O
-LRB-	O

lodged	O
among	O

at	O
the	O

part	O
of	O

I	O
say	O
,	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
very	O
grave	O
countenance	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
for	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
desired	O
an	O
opportunity	O
of	O
some	O
discourse	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
hoped	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
displeasing	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
because	O
he	O
thought	O
it	O
might	O
in	O
some	O
measure	O
correspond	O
with	O
my	O
general	O
design	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
prosperity	O
of	O
my	O
new	O
colony	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
might	O
put	O
it	O
,	O
at	O

more	O
than	O
he	O
yet	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
God	O
's	O
blessing	O

I	O
looked	O
a	O
little	O
surprised	O
at	O
the	O
last	O
of	O
his	O
discourse	O

and	O
turning	O
a	O
little	O
short	O
,	O
``	O

could	O
tell	O
what	O
to	O

was	O

find	O
a	O
man	O

him	O

I	O
was	O

touched	O
at	O
his	O

because	O

could	O
not	O

with	O
him	O

and	O
that	O
for	O
many	O
reasons	O
:	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
the	O
companion	O
of	O
my	O
travels	O
;	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
only	O
faithful	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
but	O
sincerely	O
affectionate	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
degree	O

and	O
I	O
had	O
resolved	O
to	O
do	O
something	O
considerable	O
for	O
him	O
if	O
he	O
out-lived	O
me	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
probable	O
he	O
would	O

Then	O
I	O
knew	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
bred	O
Friday	O
up	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
Protestant	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
quite	O
confound	O
him	O
to	O
bring	O
him	O
to	O
embrace	O
another	O
religion	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
would	O
never	O
,	O
while	O
his	O
eyes	O
were	O
open	O
,	O
believe	O
that	O
his	O
old	O
master	O
was	O
a	O
heretic	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
be	O
damned	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
might	O
in	O
the	O
end	O
ruin	O
the	O
poor	O
fellow	O

principles	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
turn	O
him	O
back	O
again	O
to	O
his	O
first	O
idolatry	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
a	O
sudden	O
thought	O
relieved	O
me	O
in	O
this	O
strait	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
this	O
:	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
say	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
willing	O
to	O
part	O
with	O
Friday	O
on	O
any	O
account	O
whatever	O
,	O
though	O
a	O
work	O
that	O
to	O
him	O
was	O
of	O
more	O
value	O
than	O
his	O
life	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
of	O
much	O
more	O
value	O
than	O
the	O
keeping	O
or	O
parting	O
with	O
a	O
servant	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
persuaded	O
that	O
Friday	O
would	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
agree	O
to	O
part	O
with	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
force	O
him	O
to	O
it	O
without	O
his	O
consent	O
,	O
without	O
manifest	O
injustice	O
;	O
because	O
I	O
had	O
promised	O
I	O
would	O
never	O
send	O
him	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
had	O
promised	O
and	O
engaged	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
never	O
leave	O
me	O
,	O
unless	O
I	O
sent	O
him	O
away	O
.	O

He	O
seemed	O
very	O
much	O
concerned	O
at	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
rational	O
access	O
to	O
these	O
poor	O
people	O
,	O
seeing	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
one	O
word	O
of	O
their	O
language	O
,	O
nor	O
they	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
.	O

To	O
remove	O
this	O
difficulty	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
Friday	O
's	O
father	O
had	O
learned	O
Spanish	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
found	O
he	O
also	O
understood	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
should	O
serve	O
him	O
as	O
an	O
interpreter	O
.	O

So	O
he	O
was	O
much	O
better	O
satisfied	O
,	O
and	O
nothing	O
could	O
persuade	O
him	O
but	O
he	O
would	O
stay	O
and	O
endeavour	O
to	O
convert	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
Providence	O
gave	O
another	O
very	O
happy	O
turn	O
to	O
all	O
this	O
.	O

I	O
come	O
back	O
now	O
to	O
the	O
first	O
part	O
of	O
his	O
objections	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
Englishmen	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
for	O
them	O
all	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
some	O
account	O
given	O
them	O
of	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
viz.	O
what	O
necessary	O
things	O
I	O
had	O
provided	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
they	O
were	O
distributed	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
sensible	O
of	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
thankful	O
for	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
talk	O
to	O
them	O
of	O
the	O
scandalous	O
life	O
they	O
led	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
them	O
a	O
full	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
notice	O
the	O
clergyman	O
had	O
taken	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
arguing	O
how	O
unchristian	O
and	O
irreligious	O
a	O
life	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
I	O
first	O
asked	O
them	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
married	O
men	O
or	O
bachelors	O
?	O

They	O
soon	O
explained	O
their	O
condition	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
showed	O
that	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
widowers	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
three	O
were	O
single	O
men	O
,	O
or	O
bachelors	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
them	O
with	O
what	O
conscience	O
they	O
could	O
take	O
these	O
women	O
,	O
and	O
call	O
them	O
their	O
wives	O
,	O
and	O
have	O
so	O
many	O
children	O
by	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
be	O
lawfully	O
married	O
to	O
them	O
?	O

They	O
all	O
gave	O
me	O
the	O
answer	O
I	O
expected	O
,	O
viz.	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
nobody	O
to	O
marry	O
them	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
agreed	O
before	O
the	O
governor	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
as	O
their	O
wives	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
maintain	O
them	O
and	O
own	O
them	O
as	O
their	O
wives	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
thought	O
,	O
as	O
things	O
stood	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
as	O
legally	O
married	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
married	O
by	O
a	O
parson	O
and	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
formalities	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
no	O
doubt	O
they	O
were	O
married	O
in	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
God	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
bound	O
in	O
conscience	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
as	O
their	O
wives	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
laws	O
of	O
men	O
being	O
otherwise	O
,	O
they	O
might	O
desert	O
the	O
poor	O
women	O
and	O
children	O
hereafter	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
their	O
wives	O
,	O
being	O
poor	O
desolate	O
women	O
,	O
friendless	O
and	O
moneyless	O
,	O
would	O
have	O
no	O
way	O
to	O
help	O
themselves	O
.	O

I	O
therefore	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
unless	O
I	O
was	O
assured	O
of	O
their	O
honest	O
intent	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
do	O
nothing	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
would	O
take	O
care	O
that	O
what	O
I	O
did	O
should	O
be	O
for	O
the	O
women	O
and	O
children	O
without	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
unless	O
they	O
would	O
give	O
me	O
some	O
assurances	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
marry	O
the	O
women	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
convenient	O
they	O
should	O
continue	O
together	O
as	O
man	O
and	O
wife	O
;	O
for	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
both	O
scandalous	O
to	O
men	O
and	O
offensive	O
to	O
God	O
,	O
who	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
think	O
would	O
bless	O
them	O
if	O
they	O
went	O
on	O
thus	O
.	O

All	O
this	O
went	O
on	O
as	O
I	O
expected	O

they	O
told	O
me	O

Will	O
Atkins	O

now	O
seemed	O
to	O
speak	O

loved	O
their	O

and	O
would	O
not	O
leave	O
them	O
on	O
any	O

believe	O

their	O

were	O
as	O
virtuous	O

as	O
modest	O

and	O
did	O

to	O
the	O

as	O
much	O
for	O
them	O

for	O

offer	O
to	O
carry	O
him	O

make	O
him	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
man-of-war	O
in	O

he	O

was	O

was	O
not	O

him	O

believed	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
all	O
willing	O
also	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
my	O
friend	O
,	O
the	O
minister	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
Frenchman	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
not	O
speak	O
English	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
would	O
act	O
the	O
clerk	O
between	O
them	O
.	O

He	O
never	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
asked	O
me	O
whether	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
Papist	O
or	O
Protestant	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
what	O
I	O
was	O
afraid	O
of	O
.	O

We	O
then	O
parted	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
went	O
back	O
to	O
my	O
clergyman	O
,	O
and	O
Will	O
Atkins	O
went	O
in	O
to	O
talk	O
with	O
his	O
companions	O
.	O

I	O
desired	O
the	O
French	O
gentleman	O
not	O
to	O
say	O
anything	O
to	O
them	O
till	O
the	O
business	O
was	O
thoroughly	O
ripe	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
what	O
answer	O
the	O
men	O
had	O
given	O
me	O
.	O

Before	O
I	O
went	O
from	O
their	O
quarter	O
they	O
all	O
came	O
to	O
me	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
considering	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
said	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
glad	O
to	O
hear	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
clergyman	O
in	O
my	O
company	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
willing	O
to	O
give	O
me	O
the	O
satisfaction	O
I	O
desired	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
be	O
formally	O
married	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
pleased	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
far	O
from	O
desiring	O
to	O
part	O
with	O
their	O
wives	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
meant	O
nothing	O
but	O
what	O
was	O
very	O
honest	O
when	O
they	O
chose	O
them	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
appointed	O
them	O
to	O
meet	O
me	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
meantime	O
,	O
they	O
should	O
let	O
their	O
wives	O
know	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
the	O
marriage	O
law	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
only	O
to	O
prevent	O
any	O
scandal	O
,	O
but	O
also	O
to	O
oblige	O
them	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
not	O
forsake	O
them	O
,	O
whatever	O
might	O
happen	O
.	O

The	O
women	O
were	O
easily	O
made	O
sensible	O
of	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
the	O
thing	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
very	O
well	O
satisfied	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
be	O
:	O
so	O
they	O
failed	O
not	O
to	O
attend	O
all	O
together	O
at	O
my	O
apartment	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
brought	O
out	O
my	O
clergyman	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
on	O
a	O
minister	O

gown	O

after	O
the	O

,	O
after	O
the	O

of	O

,	O
yet	O
having	O
a	O
black	O
vest	O
something	O
like	O
a	O
cassock	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
sash	O
round	O
it	O
,	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
look	O
very	O
unlike	O
a	O
minister	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
for	O
his	O
language	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
his	O
interpreter	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
seriousness	O
of	O
his	O
behaviour	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
scruples	O
he	O
made	O
of	O
marrying	O
the	O
women	O
,	O
because	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
baptized	O
and	O
professed	O
Christians	O
,	O
gave	O
them	O
an	O
exceeding	O
reverence	O
for	O
his	O
person	O
;	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
need	O
,	O
after	O
that	O
,	O
to	O
inquire	O
whether	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
clergyman	O
or	O
not	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
afraid	O

have	O
been	O
carried	O
so	O
far	O

with	O
himself	O
for	O
a	O

was	O
in	O

was	O

was	O

might	O
be	O
all	O
Catholic	O
Christians	O

whatever	O
Church	O
or	O
particular	O
profession	O
we	O
joined	O
in	O
;	O
that	O
a	O
spirit	O
of	O
charity	O
would	O
soon	O
work	O
us	O
all	O
up	O
into	O
right	O
principles	O

as	O
he	O
thought	O

would	O

I	O
asked	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
frankly	O
enough	O

despised	O

by	O

out	O

had	O
caused	O

had	O
a	O

he	O
desired	O
might	O
be	O
finished	O
before	O
I	O
went	O

between	O
two	O
Christians	O

I	O
knew	O

must	O
be	O
the	O
young	O

for	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
other	O
Christian	O
woman	O
on	O
the	O
island	O

so	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
persuade	O
him	O
not	O
to	O
do	O
anything	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
rashly	O
,	O

because	O
he	O
found	O
himself	O
in	O
this	O
solitary	O
circumstance	O

I	O
represented	O

substance	O

was	O
unequal	O

him	O

she	O
being	O
six	O

seven	O

twenty	O
years	O
old	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
not	O
above	O
seventeen	O

eighteen	O

that	O
he	O
might	O
very	O
probably	O
,	O
with	O
my	O
assistance	O
,	O
make	O
a	O
remove	O
from	O
this	O
wilderness	O
,	O
and	O
come	O
into	O
his	O
own	O
country	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
then	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
thousand	O
to	O
one	O
but	O
he	O
would	O
repent	O
his	O
choice	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
dislike	O
of	O
that	O
circumstance	O
might	O
be	O
disadvantageous	O
to	O
both	O

I	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
say	O
more	O
,	O

he	O
interrupted	O
me	O

smiling	O

told	O
me	O

with	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
modesty	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
mistook	O
in	O
my	O

that	O
he	O
had	O
nothing	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
in	O
his	O

he	O
was	O
very	O
glad	O
to	O
hear	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
an	O
intent	O
of	O
putting	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
way	O
to	O
see	O
their	O
own	O
country	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
nothing	O
should	O
have	O
made	O
him	O
think	O
of	O
staying	O
there	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
voyage	O
I	O
was	O
going	O
was	O
so	O
exceeding	O
long	O
and	O
hazardous	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
carry	O
him	O
quite	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
reach	O
of	O
all	O
his	O
friends	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O

me	O

that	O
I	O
would	O
settle	O
him	O
in	O
some	O
little	O
property	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
where	O
he	O
was	O

give	O
him	O
a	O
servant	O
or	O
two	O

some	O
few	O
necessaries	O

and	O
he	O
would	O
live	O

I	O
would	O

He	O
hoped	O

would	O
not	O
be	O
unmindful	O
of	O
him	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O

that	O

His	O

very	O
prettily	O
delivered	O

considering	O
his	O

was	O
the	O
more	O

had	O
left	O
him	O

But	O
still	O
I	O
was	O
impatient	O
to	O
know	O
who	O
was	O
the	O
person	O
to	O
be	O
married	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O

me	O
it	O

my	O
Jack-of-all	O

trades	O
and	O
his	O
maid	O
Susan	O

I	O
was	O
most	O
agreeably	O
surprised	O
when	O
he	O
named	O
the	O
match	O
;	O
for	O

indeed	O

I	O
thought	O
it	O
very	O

character	O

I	O
have	O

already	O

as	O
for	O
the	O

she	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
honest	O

modest	O
,	O
sober	O
,	O
and	O
religious	O
young	O
woman	O
:	O
had	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
share	O
of	O
sense	O

was	O
agreeable	O
enough	O
in	O
her	O
person	O
,	O
spoke	O
very	O
handsomely	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
purpose	O
,	O
always	O
with	O
decency	O
and	O
good	O
manners	O

and	O
was	O
neither	O

backward	O
to	O

nor	O
impertinently	O
forward	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
her	O

very	O

The	O
match	O
being	O
proposed	O
in	O

we	O
married	O
them	O
the	O

I	O
was	O
father	O
at	O
the	O

gave	O

I	O
gave	O
her	O

this	O

made	O
to	O
give	O
him	O

with	O

;	O
and	O
so	O
I	O
prepared	O
to	O
leave	O
them	O

One	O
thing	O
I	O
must	O
not	O
omit	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
that	O
being	O
now	O
settled	O
in	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
commonwealth	O
among	O
themselves	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
much	O
business	O
in	O
hand	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
odd	O
to	O
have	O
seven-and-thirty	O
Indians	O
live	O
in	O
a	O
nook	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
independent	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O

they	O

sometimes	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
manner	O
of	O

or	O

to	O

.	O

I	O
proposed	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
governor	O
Spaniard	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
go	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
with	O
Friday	O
's	O
father	O
,	O
and	O
propose	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
remove	O
,	O
and	O
either	O
plant	O
for	O
themselves	O
,	O
or	O
be	O
taken	O
into	O
their	O
several	O
families	O
as	O
servants	O
to	O
be	O
maintained	O
for	O
their	O
labour	O
,	O
but	O
without	O
being	O
absolute	O
slaves	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
permit	O
them	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
slaves	O
by	O
force	O
,	O
by	O
any	O
means	O
;	O
because	O
they	O
had	O
their	O
liberty	O
given	O
them	O
by	O
capitulation	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
articles	O
of	O
surrender	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
ought	O
not	O
to	O
break	O
.	O

They	O
most	O
willingly	O
embraced	O
the	O
proposal	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
all	O
very	O
cheerfully	O
along	O
with	O
him	O
:	O
so	O
we	O
allotted	O
them	O
land	O
and	O
plantations	O
,	O
which	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
accepted	O
of	O
,	O
but	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
chose	O
to	O
be	O
employed	O
as	O
servants	O
in	O
the	O
several	O
families	O
we	O
had	O
settled	O
.	O

Thus	O
my	O
colony	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
manner	O
settled	O
as	O
follows	O
:	O
The	O
Spaniards	O
possessed	O
my	O
original	O
habitation	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
capital	O
city	O
,	O
and	O
extended	O
their	O
plantations	O
all	O
along	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
brook	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
the	O
creek	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
so	O
often	O
described	O
,	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
my	O
bower	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
they	O
increased	O
their	O
culture	O
,	O
it	O
went	O
always	O
eastward	O
.	O

The	O
English	O
lived	O
in	O
the	O
north-east	O
part	O
,	O
where	O
Will	O
Atkins	O
and	O
his	O
comrades	O
began	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
on	O
southward	O
and	O
south-west	O
,	O
towards	O
the	O
back	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
;	O
and	O
every	O
plantation	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
addition	O
of	O
land	O
to	O
take	O
in	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
found	O
occasion	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
need	O
not	O
jostle	O
one	O
another	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
room	O
.	O

All	O
the	O
east	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
was	O
left	O
uninhabited	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
should	O
come	O
on	O
shore	O
there	O
only	O
for	O
their	O
customary	O
barbarities	O

nobody	O
would	O

them	O

and	O
no	O
doubt	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
often	O
ashore	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
away	O
again	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
never	O

CHAPTER	O

--	O
SAILS	O
FROM	O
THE	O
ISLAND	O
FOR	O
THE	O
BRAZILS	O
It	O
now	O
came	O
into	O
my	O
thoughts	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
hinted	O
to	O
my	O
friend	O
the	O
clergyman	O
that	O
the	O
work	O
of	O
converting	O
the	O
savages	O
might	O
perhaps	O
be	O
set	O
on	O
foot	O
in	O
his	O
absence	O
to	O
his	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
now	O
I	O
thought	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
put	O
in	O
a	O
fair	O
way	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
savages	O
,	O
being	O
thus	O
divided	O
among	O
the	O
Christians	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
but	O
every	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
do	O
their	O
part	O
with	O
those	O
which	O
came	O
under	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
I	O
hoped	O
it	O
might	O
have	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
effect	O
.	O

He	O
agreed	O
presently	O
in	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
did	O
their	O
part	O
.	O

``	O
But	O
how	O
,	O
''	O
says	O
he	O
,	O
``	O
shall	O
we	O
obtain	O
that	O
of	O
them	O
?	O
''	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
we	O
would	O
call	O
them	O
all	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
leave	O
it	O
in	O
charge	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
or	O
go	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
one	O
by	O
one	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
thought	O
best	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
divided	O
it	O
--	O
he	O
to	O
speak	O
to	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
all	O
Papists	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
to	O
speak	O
to	O
the	O
English	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
all	O
Protestants	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
recommended	O
it	O
earnestly	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
them	O
promise	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
never	O
make	O
any	O
distinction	O
of	O
Papist	PNM
or	O
Protestant	O
in	O
their	O
exhorting	O
the	O
savages	O
to	O
turn	O
Christians	O
,	O
but	O
teach	O
them	O
the	O
general	O
knowledge	O
of	O
the	O
true	O
God	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
their	O
Saviour	O
Jesus	O
Christ	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
likewise	O
promised	O
us	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
never	O
have	O
any	O
differences	O
or	O
disputes	O
one	O
with	O
another	O
about	O
religion	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
Will	O
Atkins	O
's	O
house	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
young	O
woman	O
I	O
have	O
mentioned	O
above	O
,	O
and	O
Will	O
Atkins	O
's	O
wife	O
,	O
were	O
become	O
intimates	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
prudent	O
,	O
religious	O
young	O
woman	O
had	O
perfected	O
the	O
work	O
Will	O
Atkins	O
had	O
begun	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
above	O
four	O
days	O
after	O
what	O
I	O
have	O
related	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
new-baptized	O
savage	O
woman	O
was	O
made	O
such	O
a	O
Christian	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
seldom	O
heard	O
of	O
in	O
all	O
my	O
observation	O
or	O
conversation	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

It	O
came	O
next	O
into	O
my	O
mind	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
before	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
amongst	O
all	O
the	O
needful	O
things	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
leave	O
with	O
them	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
left	O
them	O
a	O
Bible	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
I	O
showed	O
myself	O
less	O
considering	O
for	O
them	O
than	O
my	O
good	O
friend	O
the	O
widow	O
was	O
for	O
me	O
when	O
she	O
sent	O
me	O
the	O
cargo	O
of	O
a	O
hundred	O
pounds	O
from	O
Lisbon	PNM
,	O
where	O
she	O
packed	O
up	O
three	O
Bibles	O
and	O
a	O
Prayer-book	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
good	O
woman	O
's	O
charity	O
had	O
a	O
greater	O
extent	O
than	O
ever	O
she	O
imagined	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
reserved	O
for	O
the	O
comfort	O
and	O
instruction	O
of	O
those	O
that	O
made	O
much	O
better	O
use	O
of	O
them	O
than	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
.	O

I	O
took	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Bibles	O
in	O
my	O
pocket	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
Will	O
Atkins	O
's	O
tent	O

house	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
the	O

had	O
been	O
discoursing	O
of	O

together	O

for	O
Will	O
Atkins	O
told	O
it	O
me	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
joy	O

I	O
asked	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
together	O
now	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
said	O

``	O
Yes	O

I	O
went	O
into	O
the	O

he	O
with	O
me	O

we	O
found	O

might	O

I	O
turned	O

the	O

up	O

I	O
thought	O

for	O
I	O
found	O
,	O
at	O

at	O
my	O
first	O
coming	O
,	O
such	O
seeds	O
of	O
division	O
among	O

set	O

perhaps	O
have	O
turned	O
pirates	O

so	O
made	O
the	O

in	O
the	O
end	O
,	O
would	O
only	O
bring	O
ruin	O

upon	O
them	O

I	O
reserved	O
the	O

I	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
surprised	O
then	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
was	O
my	O
nephew	O
the	O
captain	O
;	O
for	O
he	O
had	O
heard	O
such	O
terrible	O
stories	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
never	O
been	O
in	O
those	O
seas	O
before	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
what	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
said	O
,	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
times	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
all	O
be	O
devoured	O

I	O
must	O
confess	O
,	O
considering	O
we	O
were	O
becalmed	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
current	O
set	O
strong	O
towards	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
I	O
liked	O
it	O
the	O
worse	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
bade	O
them	O
not	O
be	O
afraid	O
,	O
but	O
bring	O
the	O
ship	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
came	O
so	O
near	O
as	O
to	O
know	O
that	O
we	O
must	O

The	O
weather	O
continued	O
calm	O

and	O
they	O
came	O
on	O
apace	O
towards	O
us	O

so	O
I	O
gave	O
orders	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
,	O
and	O
furl	O
all	O
our	O
sails	O
;	O
as	O
for	O
the	O
savages	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
they	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
fear	O
but	O
fire	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
they	O
should	O
get	O
their	O
boats	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
fasten	O
them	O
,	O
one	O
close	O
by	O
the	O
head	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
by	O
the	O
stern	O
,	O
and	O
man	O
them	O
both	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
wait	O
the	O
issue	O
in	O
that	O
posture	O
:	O
this	O
I	O
did	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
men	O
in	O
the	O
boats	O
might	O
he	O
ready	O
with	O
sheets	O
and	O
buckets	O
to	O
put	O
out	O
any	O
fire	O
these	O
savages	O
might	O
endeavour	O
to	O
fix	O
to	O
the	O
outside	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
posture	O
we	O
lay	O
by	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
while	O
they	O
came	O
up	O
with	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
never	O
was	O
such	O
a	O
horrid	O
sight	O
seen	O
by	O
Christians	O
;	O
though	O
my	O
mate	O
was	O
much	O
mistaken	O
in	O
his	O
calculation	O
of	O
their	O
number	O
,	O
yet	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
up	O
we	O
reckoned	O
about	O
a	O
hundred	O
and	O
twenty-six	O
canoes	O
;	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
sixteen	O
or	O
seventeen	O
men	O
in	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
more	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
least	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
came	O
nearer	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
struck	O
with	O
wonder	O
and	O
astonishment	O
,	O
as	O
at	O
a	O
sight	O
which	O
doubtless	O
they	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
before	O
;	O
nor	O
could	O
they	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
afterwards	O
understood	O
,	O
know	O
what	O
to	O
make	O
of	O
us	O
;	O
they	O
came	O
boldly	O
up	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
very	O
near	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
seemed	O
to	O
go	O
about	O
to	O
row	O
round	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
called	O
to	O
our	O
men	O
in	O
the	O
boats	O
not	O
to	O
let	O
them	O
come	O
too	O
near	O
them	O
.	O

This	O
very	O
order	O
brought	O
us	O
to	O
an	O
engagement	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
without	O
our	O
designing	O
it	O
;	O
for	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
of	O
the	O
large	O
canoes	O
came	O
so	O
near	O
our	O
long-boat	O
,	O
that	O
our	O
men	O
beckoned	O
with	O
their	O
hands	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
back	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
understood	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
back	O
:	O
but	O
at	O
their	O
retreat	O
about	O
fifty	O
arrows	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
us	O
from	O
those	O
boats	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
in	O
the	O
long-boat	O
was	O
very	O
much	O
wounded	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
called	O
to	O
them	O
not	O
to	O
fire	O
by	O
any	O
means	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
handed	O
down	O
some	O
deal	O
boards	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
carpenter	O
presently	O
set	O
up	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
fence	O
,	O
like	O
waste	O
boards	O
,	O
to	O
cover	O
them	O
from	O
the	O
arrows	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
should	O
shoot	O
again	O
.	O

About	O
half-an-hour	O
afterwards	O
they	O
all	O
came	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
body	O
astern	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
near	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
easily	O
discern	O
what	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
their	O
design	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
easily	O
found	O
they	O
were	O
some	O
of	O
my	O
old	O
friends	O
,	O
the	O
same	O
sort	O
of	O
savages	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
used	O
to	O
engage	O
with	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
more	O
they	O
rowed	O
a	O
little	O
farther	O
out	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
till	O
they	O
came	O
directly	O
broadside	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
rowed	O
down	O
straight	O
upon	O
us	O
,	O
till	O
they	O
came	O
so	O
near	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
hear	O
us	O
speak	O
;	O
upon	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
all	O
my	O
men	O
to	O
keep	O
close	O
,	O
lest	O
they	O
should	O
shoot	O
any	O
more	O
arrows	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
all	O
our	O
guns	O
ready	O
;	O
but	O
being	O
so	O
near	O
as	O
to	O
be	O
within	O
hearing	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
Friday	O
go	O
out	O
upon	O
the	O
deck	O
,	O
and	O
call	O
out	O
aloud	O
to	O
them	O
in	O
his	O
language	O
,	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
they	O
meant	O
.	O

Whether	O
they	O
understood	O
him	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
called	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
six	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
foremost	O
or	O
nighest	O
boat	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
turned	O
their	O
canoes	O
from	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
stooping	O
down	O
,	O
showed	O
us	O
their	O
naked	O
backs	O
;	O
whether	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
defiance	O
or	O
challenge	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
,	O
or	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
done	O
in	O
mere	O
contempt	O
,	O
or	O
as	O
a	O
signal	O
to	O
the	O
rest	O
;	O
but	O
immediately	O
Friday	O
cried	O
out	O
they	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
shoot	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
unhappily	O
for	O
him	O
,	O
poor	O
fellow	O
,	O
they	O
let	O
fly	O
about	O
three	O
hundred	O
of	O
their	O
arrows	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
my	O
inexpressible	O
grief	O
,	O
killed	O
poor	O
Friday	O
,	O
no	O
other	O
man	O
being	O
in	O
their	O
sight	O
.	O

The	O
poor	O
fellow	O
was	O
shot	O
with	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
three	O
arrows	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
three	O
more	O
fell	O
very	O
near	O
him	O
;	O
such	O
unlucky	O
marksmen	O
they	O
were	O
!	O

I	O
was	O
so	O
annoyed	O
at	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
my	O
old	O
trusty	O
servant	O
and	O
companion	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
immediately	O
ordered	O
five	O
guns	O
to	O
be	O
loaded	O
with	O
small	O
shot	O
,	O
and	O
four	O
with	O
great	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
them	O
such	O
a	O
broadside	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
never	O
heard	O
in	O
their	O
lives	O
before	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
not	O
above	O
half	O
a	O
cable	O
's	O
length	O
off	O
when	O
we	O
fired	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
gunners	O
took	O
their	O
aim	O
so	O
well	O
,	O
that	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
of	O
their	O
canoes	O
were	O
overset	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
,	O
by	O
one	O
shot	O
only	O
.	O

The	O
ill	O
manners	O
of	O
turning	O
up	O
their	O
bare	O
backs	O
to	O
us	O
gave	O
us	O
no	O
great	O
offence	O
;	O
neither	O
did	O
I	O
know	O
for	O
certain	O
whether	O
that	O
which	O
would	O
pass	O
for	O
the	O
greatest	O
contempt	O
among	O
us	O
might	O
be	O
understood	O
so	O
by	O
them	O
or	O
not	O
;	O
therefore	O
,	O
in	O
return	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
only	O
resolved	O
to	O
have	O
fired	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
guns	O
at	O
them	O
with	O
powder	O
only	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
knew	O
would	O
frighten	O
them	O
sufficiently	O
:	O
but	O
when	O
they	O
shot	O
at	O
us	O
directly	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
fury	O
they	O
were	O
capable	O
of	O
,	O
and	O
especially	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
killed	O
my	O
poor	O
Friday	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
so	O
entirely	O
loved	O
and	O
valued	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
so	O
well	O
deserved	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
myself	O
not	O
only	O
justifiable	O
before	O
God	O
and	O
man	O
,	O
but	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
glad	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
overset	O
every	O
canoe	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
drowned	O
every	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
can	O
neither	O
tell	O
how	O
many	O
we	O
killed	O
nor	O
how	O
many	O
we	O
wounded	O
at	O
this	O
broadside	O
,	O
but	O
sure	O
such	O
a	O
fright	O
and	O
hurry	O
never	O
were	O
seen	O
among	O
such	O
a	O
multitude	O
;	O
there	O
were	O
thirteen	O
or	O
fourteen	O
of	O
their	O
canoes	O
split	O
and	O
overset	O
in	O
all	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
men	O
all	O
set	O
a-swimming	O
:	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
frightened	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
wits	O
,	O
scoured	O
away	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
,	O
taking	O
but	O
little	O
care	O
to	O
save	O
those	O
whose	O
boats	O
were	O
split	O
or	O
spoiled	O
with	O
our	O
shot	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
suppose	O
that	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
lost	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
took	O
up	O
one	O
poor	O
fellow	O
swimming	O
for	O
his	O
life	O
,	O
above	O
an	O
hour	O
after	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
gone	O
.	O

The	O
small	O
shot	O
from	O
our	O
cannon	O
must	O
needs	O
kill	O
and	O
wound	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
we	O
never	O
knew	O
how	O
it	O
went	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
fled	O
so	O
fast	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
three	O
hours	O
or	O
thereabouts	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
see	O
above	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
straggling	O
canoes	O
,	O
nor	O
did	O
we	O
ever	O
see	O
the	O
rest	O
any	O
more	O
;	O
for	O
a	O
breeze	O
of	O
wind	O
springing	O
up	O
the	O
same	O
evening	O
,	O
we	O
weighed	O
and	O
set	O
sail	O
for	O
the	O
Brazils	PNM
.	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
prisoner	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
creature	O
was	O
so	O
sullen	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
neither	O
cat	O
nor	O
speak	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
all	O
fancied	O
he	O
would	O
starve	O
himself	O
to	O
death	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
took	O
a	O
way	O
to	O
cure	O
him	O
:	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
them	O
take	O
him	O
and	O
turn	O
him	O
into	O
the	O
long-boat	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
him	O
believe	O
they	O
would	O
toss	O
him	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
leave	O
him	O
where	O
they	O
found	O
him	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
speak	O
;	O
nor	O
would	O
that	O
do	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
really	O
did	O
throw	O
him	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
away	O
from	O
him	O
.	O

Then	O
he	O
followed	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
swam	O
like	O
a	O
cork	O
,	O
and	O
called	O
to	O
them	O
in	O
his	O
tongue	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
knew	O
not	O
one	O
word	O
of	O
what	O
he	O
said	O
;	O
however	O
at	O
last	O
they	O
took	O
him	O
in	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
tractable	O
:	O
nor	O
did	O
I	O
ever	O
design	O
they	O
should	O
drown	O
him	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
now	O
under	O
sail	O
again	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
the	O
most	O
disconsolate	O
creature	O
alive	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
my	O
man	O
Friday	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
glad	O
to	O
have	O
gone	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
to	O
have	O
taken	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
rest	O
from	O
thence	O
for	O
my	O
occasion	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
:	O
so	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
one	O
prisoner	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
before	O
we	O
could	O
make	O
him	O
understand	O
anything	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
time	O
our	O
men	O
taught	O
him	O
some	O
English	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
tractable	O
.	O

Afterwards	O
,	O
we	O
inquired	O
what	O
country	O
he	O
came	O
from	O
;	O
but	O
could	O
make	O
nothing	O
of	O
what	O
he	O
said	O
;	O
for	O
his	O
speech	O
was	O
so	O
odd	O
,	O
all	O
gutturals	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
spoke	O
in	O
the	O
throat	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
hollow	O
,	O
odd	O
manner	O
,	O
that	O

some	O

When	O

nothing	O

Had	O

had	O
at	O

I	O
was	O

all	O
the	O

It	O
happened	O
one	O
evening	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
that	O
a	O
greater	O
number	O
of	O
their	O
people	O
came	O
down	O
than	O
usual	O
,	O
but	O
all	O
very	O
friendly	O
and	O
civil	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
brought	O
several	O
kinds	O
of	O
provisions	O
,	O
for	O
which	O
we	O
satisfied	O
them	O
with	O
such	O
toys	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
;	O
the	O
women	O
also	O
brought	O
us	O
milk	O
and	O
roots	O
,	O
and	O
several	O
things	O
very	O
acceptable	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
was	O
quiet	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
made	O
us	O
a	O
little	O
tent	O
or	O
hut	O
of	O
some	O
boughs	O
or	O
trees	O
,	O
and	O
lay	O
on	O
shore	O
all	O
night	O
.	O

I	O
know	O
not	O
what	O
was	O
the	O
occasion	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
well	O
satisfied	O
to	O
lie	O
on	O
shore	O
as	O
the	O
rest	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
boat	O
riding	O
at	O
an	O
anchor	O
at	O
about	O
a	O
stone	O
's	O
cast	O
from	O

,	O
with	O
two	O
men	O
in	O
her	O
to	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
come	O
on	O
shore	O
;	O
and	O
getting	O
some	O
boughs	O
of	O
trees	O
to	O
cover	O
us	O
also	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
I	O
spread	O
the	O

on	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

and	O
lay	O
under	O

of	O

all	O
night	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
.	O

About	O
two	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
we	O
heard	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
making	O
a	O
terrible	O
noise	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
calling	O
out	O
,	O
for	O
God	O
's	O
sake	O
,	O
to	O
bring	O
the	O
boat	O
in	O
and	O
come	O
and	O
help	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
like	O
to	O
be	O
murdered	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
I	O
heard	O
the	O
fire	O
of	O
five	O
muskets	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
guns	O
they	O
had	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
three	O
times	O
over	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
seems	O
the	O
natives	O
here	O
were	O
not	O
so	O
easily	O
frightened	O
with	O
guns	O
as	O
the	O
savages	O
were	O
in	O
America	PNM
,	O
where	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

All	O
this	O
while	O
,	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
was	O
the	O
matter	O
,	O
but	O
rousing	O
immediately	O
from	O
sleep	O
with	O
the	O
noise	O
,	O
I	O
caused	O
the	O
boat	O
to	O
be	O
thrust	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
with	O
three	O
fusees	O
we	O
had	O
on	O
board	O
to	O
land	O
and	O
assist	O
our	O
men	O
.	O

We	O
got	O
the	O
boat	O
soon	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
but	O
our	O
men	O
were	O
in	O
too	O
much	O
haste	O
;	O
for	O
being	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
they	O
plunged	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
to	O
get	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
expedition	O
they	O
could	O
,	O
being	O
pursued	O
by	O
between	O
three	O
and	O
four	O
hundred	O
men	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
were	O
but	O
nine	O
in	O
all	O
,	O
and	O
only	O
five	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
fusees	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
the	O
rest	O
had	O
pistols	O
and	O
swords	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
of	O
small	O
use	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
took	O
up	O
seven	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
difficulty	O
enough	O
too	O
,	O
three	O
of	O
them	O
being	O
very	O
ill	O
wounded	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
which	O
was	O
still	O
worse	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
while	O
we	O
stood	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
to	O
take	O
our	O
men	O
in	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
as	O
much	O
danger	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
on	O
shore	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
poured	O
their	O
arrows	O
in	O
upon	O
us	O
so	O
thick	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
glad	O
to	O
barricade	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
up	O
with	O
the	O
benches	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
loose	O
boards	O
which	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
by	O
mere	O
accident	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
.	O

And	O
yet	O
,	O
had	O
it	O
been	O
daylight	O
,	O
they	O
are	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
such	O
exact	O
marksmen	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
have	O
seen	O
but	O
the	O
least	O
part	O
of	O
any	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
sure	O
of	O
us	O

We	O
had	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
light	O
of	O
the	O
moon	O
,	O
a	O
little	O
sight	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
stood	O
pelting	O
us	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
with	O
darts	O
and	O
arrows	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
got	O
ready	O
our	O
firearms	O
,	O
we	O
gave	O
them	O
a	O
volley	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
hear	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
cries	O
of	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
had	O
wounded	O
several	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
they	O
stood	O
thus	O
in	O
battle	O
array	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
till	O
break	O
of	O
day	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
supposed	O
was	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
see	O
the	O
better	O
to	O
take	O
their	O
aim	O
at	O
us	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
condition	O
we	O
lay	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
how	O
to	O
weigh	O
our	O
anchor	O
,	O
or	O
set	O
up	O
our	O
sail	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
must	O
needs	O
stand	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
as	O
sure	O
to	O
hit	O
us	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
hit	O
a	O
bird	O
in	O
a	O
tree	O
with	O
small	O
shot	O
.	O

We	O
made	O
signals	O
of	O
distress	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
though	O
she	O
rode	O
a	O
league	O
off	O

yet	O
my	O

the	O

by	O
glasses	O
perceiving	O
the	O
posture	O
we	O
lay	O
in	O

and	O
that	O
we	O
fired	O
towards	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
pretty	O
well	O
understood	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
weighing	O
anchor	O
with	O
all	O
speed	O
,	O
he	O
stood	O
as	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
as	O
he	O
durst	O
with	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
sent	O
another	O
boat	O
with	O
ten	O
hands	O
in	O
her	O
,	O
to	O
assist	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
called	O
to	O
them	O
not	O
to	O
come	O
too	O
near	O
,	O
telling	O
them	O
what	O
condition	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
they	O
stood	O
in	O
near	O
to	O
us	O

and	O
one	O
of	O
the	O

taking	O
the	O

of	O
a	O
tow-line	O
in	O
his	O

and	O
keeping	O
our	O

between	O

so	O
that	O
they	O
could	O

him	O

swam	O
on	O

and	O
made	O
fast	O
the	O
line	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
:	O
upon	O
which	O
we	O
slipped	O
out	O
a	O
little	O
cable	O
,	O
and	O
leaving	O
our	O
anchor	O
behind	O
,	O
they	O
towed	O
us	O
out	O
of	O
reach	O
of	O
the	O
arrows	O
;	O
we	O
all	O
the	O
while	O
lying	O

As	O

as	O
we	O
were	O

from	O

the	O

that	O
we	O

she	O
ran	O
along	O

such	O

besides	O
the	O

which	O

When	O
we	O
were	O
got	O
on	O
board	O
and	O
out	O
of	O
danger	O

we	O
had	O
time	O
to	O

of	O
this	O

indeed	O
our	O

for	O
he	O

the	O

us	O
after	O
we	O

a	O

At	O

it	O
came	O
out	O
that	O
an	O
old	O
woman	O

who	O
had	O
come	O

the	O

the	O

went	O
away	O

,	O
as	O
we	O

made	O
an	O

upon	O

three	O

it	O

One	O
of	O

at	O
the	O

the	O

I	O
was	O
careful	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
dark	O
,	O
lest	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
attacked	O
again	O
:	O
but	O
I	O
ought	O
indeed	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
sure	O
that	O
the	O
men	O
I	O
went	O
with	O
had	O
been	O
under	O
my	O
command	O
,	O
before	O
I	O
engaged	O
in	O
a	O
thing	O
so	O
hazardous	O
and	O
mischievous	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
brought	O
into	O
by	O
it	O
,	O
without	O
design	O

We	O
took	O
twenty	O
as	O
stout	O
fellows	O
with	O
us	O
as	O
any	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
besides	O
the	O
supercargo	O
and	O
myself	O

and	O
we	O
landed	O
two	O
hours	O
before	O
midnight	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
place	O
where	O
the	O
Indians	O
stood	O
drawn	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
before	O
.	O

I	O
landed	O
here	O
,	O
because	O
my	O
design	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
was	O
chiefly	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
quitted	O
the	O
field	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
left	O
any	O
marks	O
behind	O
them	O
of	O
the	O
mischief	O
we	O
had	O
done	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
thought	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
surprise	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
perhaps	O
we	O
might	O
get	O
our	O
man	O
again	O
,	O
by	O
way	O
of	O
exchange	O
.	O

We	O
landed	O
without	O
any	O
noise	O
,	O
and	O
divided	O
our	O
men	O
into	O
two	O
bodies	O
,	O
whereof	O
the	O
boatswain	O
commanded	O
one	O
and	O
I	O
the	O
other	O
.	O

We	O
neither	O
saw	O
nor	O
heard	O
anybody	O
stir	O
when	O
we	O
landed	O
:	O
and	O
we	O
marched	O
up	O
,	O
one	O
body	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
from	O
another	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
.	O

At	O
first	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
nothing	O
,	O
it	O
being	O
very	O
dark	O
;	O
till	O
by-and-by	O
our	O
boatswain	O
,	O
who	O
led	O
the	O
first	O
party	O
,	O
stumbled	O
and	O
fell	O
over	O
a	O
dead	O
body	O
.	O

This	O
made	O
them	O
halt	O
a	O
while	O
;	O
for	O
knowing	O
by	O
the	O
circumstances	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
at	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
the	O
Indians	O
had	O
stood	O
,	O
they	O
waited	O
for	O
my	O
coming	O
up	O
there	O
.	O

We	O
concluded	O
to	O
halt	O
till	O
the	O
moon	O
began	O
to	O
rise	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
knew	O
would	O
be	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
could	O
easily	O
discern	O
the	O
havoc	O
we	O
had	O
made	O
among	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
told	O
thirty-two	O
bodies	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
whereof	O
two	O
were	O
not	O
quite	O
dead	O
;	O
some	O
had	O
an	O
arm	O
and	O
some	O
a	O
leg	O
shot	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
his	O
head	O
;	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
wounded	O
,	O
we	O
supposed	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
carried	O
away	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
made	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
a	O
full	O
discovery	O
of	O
all	O
we	O
could	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
knowledge	O
of	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
on	O
going	O
on	O
board	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
boatswain	O
and	O
his	O
party	O
sent	O
me	O
word	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
resolved	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
visit	O
to	O
the	O
Indian	O
town	O

where	O
these	O
dogs	O

as	O
they	O
called	O
them	O
,	O
dwelt	O

and	O
asked	O
me	O
to	O
go	O
along	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
find	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
still	O
fancied	O
they	O
should	O
,	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
doubt	O
of	O
getting	O
a	O
good	O
booty	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
they	O
might	O
find	O
Tom	O

there	O
:	O
that	O
was	O
the	O

my	O

I	O
knew	O
well	O
enough	O
what	O
answer	O

them	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
should	O
have	O

them	O
instantly	O
on	O

knowing	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
hazard	O
fit	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
run	O

who	O
had	O
a	O
ship	O
and	O
ship	O
-	O
loading	O
in	O
our	O

and	O
a	O
voyage	O
to	O
make	O
which	O
depended	O
very	O
much	O
upon	O
the	O
lives	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
they	O
sent	O
me	O
word	O
they	O
were	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
,	O
and	O
only	O
asked	O
me	O
and	O
my	O
company	O
to	O
go	O
along	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
positively	O
refused	O
it	O

rose	O
up	O

for	O
I	O
was	O
sitting	O
on	O
the	O

in	O

to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O

One	O
or	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
began	O
to	O
importune	O
me	O
to	O
go	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
refused	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
grumble	O
,	O
and	O
say	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
under	O
my	O
command	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
would	O
go	O

``	O

says	O
one	O
of	O
the	O

``	O

I	O

Jack	O
said	O
he	O
would	O

then	O
another	O

and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O

,	O
they	O
all	O
left	O
me	O
but	O
one	O

whom	O
I	O
persuaded	O
to	O
stay	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
boy	O
left	O
in	O
the	O

So	O
the	O
supercargo	O
and	O
I	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
third	O
man	O
,	O
went	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O

where	O
we	O
told	O
them	O
we	O
would	O
stay	O
for	O
them	O

and	O
take	O
care	O
to	O
take	O
in	O
as	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
as	O
should	O
be	O
left	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
mad	O
thing	O
they	O
were	O
going	O
about	O
,	O
and	O
supposed	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
would	O
have	O
the	O
fate	O
of	O
Tom	PNM
Jeffry	PNM
.	O

They	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
like	O
seamen	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
warrant	O
it	O
they	O
would	O
come	O
off	O
again	O

and	O
they	O
would	O
take	O
care	O
,	O
&	O
c.	O
;	O
so	O
away	O
they	O
went	O
.	O

I	O
entreated	O
them	O
to	O
consider	O
the	O
ship	O
and	O
the	O
voyage	O
,	O
that	O
their	O
lives	O
were	O
not	O
their	O
own	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
entrusted	O
with	O
the	O
voyage	O
,	O
in	O
some	O
measure	O
;	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
miscarried	O
,	O
the	O
ship	O
might	O
be	O
lost	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
their	O
help	O

and	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
answer	O
for	O
it	O
to	O
God	O
or	O
man	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
might	O
as	O
well	O
have	O
talked	O
to	O
the	O
mainmast	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
mad	O
upon	O
their	O
journey	O
;	O
only	O
they	O
gave	O
me	O
good	O
words	O
,	O
and	O
begged	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
angry	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
doubt	O
but	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
back	O
again	O
in	O
about	O
an	O
hour	O
at	O
furthest	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
Indian	O
town	O
,	O
they	O
said	O
,	O
was	O
not	O
above	O
half-a	O
mile	O
off	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
found	O
it	O
above	O
two	O
miles	O
before	O
they	O
got	O
to	O
it	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
they	O
all	O
went	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
though	O
the	O
attempt	O
was	O
desperate	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
as	O
none	O
but	O
madmen	O
would	O
have	O
gone	O
about	O
,	O
yet	O
,	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
their	O
due	O
,	O
they	O
went	O
about	O
it	O
as	O
warily	O
as	O
boldly	O
;	O
they	O
were	O
gallantly	O
armed	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
every	O
man	O
a	O
fusee	O
or	O
musket	O
,	O
a	O
bayonet	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
pistol	O
;	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
broad	O
cutlasses	O

some	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
hangers	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
boatswain	O
and	O
two	O
more	O
had	O
poleaxes	O
;	O
besides	O
all	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
among	O
them	O
thirteen	O
hand	O
grenadoes	O

Bolder	O
fellows	O

and	O
better	O
provided	O
,	O
never	O
went	O
about	O
any	O
wicked	O
work	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
went	O
out	O
their	O
chief	O
design	O
was	O
plunder	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
mighty	O
hopes	O
of	O
finding	O
gold	O
there	O
;	O
but	O
a	O
circumstance	O
which	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
aware	O
of	O
set	O
them	O
on	O
fire	O
with	O
revenge	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
devils	O
of	O
them	O
all	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
few	O
Indian	O
houses	O
which	O
they	O
thought	O
had	O
been	O
the	O
town	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
not	O
above	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
off	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
under	O
great	O
disappointment	O
,	O
for	O
there	O
were	O
not	O
above	O
twelve	O
or	O
thirteen	O
houses	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
the	O
town	O
was	O
,	O
or	O
how	O
big	O
,	O
they	O
knew	O
not	O
.	O

They	O
consulted	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
some	O
time	O
before	O
they	O
could	O
resolve	O
;	O
for	O
if	O
they	O
fell	O
upon	O
these	O
,	O
they	O
must	O
cut	O
all	O
their	O
throats	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
ten	O
to	O
one	O
but	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
might	O
escape	O
,	O
it	O
being	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
moon	O
was	O
up	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
one	O
escaped	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
run	O
and	O
raise	O
all	O
the	O
town	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
should	O
have	O
a	O
whole	O
army	O
upon	O
them	O
;	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
went	O
away	O
and	O
left	O
those	O
untouched	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
people	O
were	O
all	O
asleep	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
which	O
way	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
the	O
town	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
the	O
last	O
was	O
the	O
best	O
advice	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
leave	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
look	O
for	O
the	O
town	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
.	O

They	O
went	O
on	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
a	O
cow	O
tied	O
to	O
a	O
tree	O
;	O
this	O
,	O
they	O
presently	O
concluded	O
,	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
good	O
guide	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
they	O
said	O
,	O
the	O
cow	O
certainly	O
belonged	O
to	O
the	O
town	O
before	O
them	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
town	O
behind	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
they	O
untied	O
her	O
,	O
they	O
should	O
see	O
which	O
way	O
she	O
went	O
:	O
if	O
she	O
went	O
back	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
say	O
to	O
her	O
;	O
but	O
if	O
she	O
went	O
forward	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
follow	O
her	O
.	O

So	O
they	O
cut	O
the	O
cord	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
made	O
of	O
twisted	O
flags	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
cow	O
went	O
on	O
before	O
them	O
,	O
directly	O
to	O
the	O
town	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
reported	O
,	O
consisted	O
of	O
above	O
two	O
hundred	O
houses	O
or	O
huts	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
they	O
found	O
several	O
families	O
living	O
together	O
.	O

Here	O
they	O
found	O
all	O
in	O
silence	O
,	O
as	O
profoundly	O
secure	O
as	O
sleep	O
could	O
make	O
them	O
:	O
and	O
first	O
,	O
they	O
called	O
another	O
council	O
,	O
to	O
consider	O
what	O
they	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
;	O
and	O
presently	O
resolved	O
to	O
divide	O
themselves	O
into	O
three	O
bodies	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
set	O
three	O
houses	O
on	O
fire	O
in	O
three	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
town	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
the	O

came	O
out	O

to	O
seize	O
them	O

bind	O
them	O
-LRB-	O
if	O
any	O
resisted	O

they	O
need	O
not	O
be	O

what	O
to	O

then	O
-RRB-	O

and	O
so	O
to	O
search	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
houses	O
for	O
plunder	O
:	O
but	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
march	O
silently	O
first	O
through	O
the	O
town	O

and	O
see	O
what	O
dimensions	O
it	O
was	O
of	O

and	O
if	O
they	O
might	O
venture	O
upon	O
it	O
or	O
no	O

They	O
did	O
so	O
,	O
and	O
desperately	O
resolved	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
venture	O
upon	O
them	O
:	O
but	O
while	O
they	O
were	O
animating	O
one	O

to	O
the	O

three	O
of	O
them	O

who	O
were	O
a	O
little	O
before	O
the	O

called	O
out	O
aloud	O
to	O

told	O

Tom	O

they	O
all	O
ran	O

they	O
found	O
the	O
poor	O
fellow	O
hanging	O
up	O
naked	O
by	O
one	O
arm	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
throat	O
cut	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
an	O
Indian	O
house	O
just	O
by	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
found	O
sixteen	O
or	O
seventeen	O
of	O
the	O
principal	O
Indians	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
concerned	O
in	O
the	O
fray	O
with	O
us	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
of	O
them	O
wounded	O
with	O
our	O
shot	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
found	O
they	O
were	O
awake	O
,	O
and	O
talking	O
one	O
to	O
another	O
in	O
that	O
house	O
,	O
but	O
knew	O
not	O
their	O
number	O
.	O

The	O
sight	O
of	O
their	O
poor	O
mangled	O
comrade	O
so	O
enraged	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
swore	O
to	O
one	O
another	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
revenged	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
not	O
an	O
Indian	O
that	O
came	O
into	O
their	O
hands	O
should	O
have	O
any	O
quarter	O
;	O
and	O
to	O
work	O
they	O
went	O
immediately	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
not	O
so	O
madly	O
as	O
might	O
be	O
expected	O
from	O
the	O
rage	O
and	O
fury	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
.	O

Their	O
first	O
care	O
was	O
to	O
get	O
something	O
that	O
would	O
soon	O
take	O
fire	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
after	O
a	O
little	O
search	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
to	O
no	O
purpose	O
;	O
for	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
houses	O
were	O
low	O
,	O
and	O
thatched	O
with	O
flags	O
and	O
rushes	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
the	O
country	O
is	O
full	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
presently	O
made	O
some	O
wildfire	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
by	O
wetting	O
a	O
little	O
powder	O
in	O
the	O
palm	O
of	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
they	O
set	O
the	O
town	O
on	O
fire	O
in	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
places	O
,	O
and	O
particularly	O
that	O
house	O
where	O
the	O
Indians	O
were	O
not	O
gone	O
to	O
bed	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
fire	O
begun	O
to	O
blaze	O
,	O
the	O
poor	O
frightened	O
creatures	O
began	O
to	O
rush	O
out	O
to	O
save	O
their	O
lives	O
,	O
but	O
met	O
with	O
their	O
fate	O
in	O
the	O
attempt	O
;	O
and	O
especially	O
at	O
the	O
door	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
drove	O
them	O
back	O
,	O
the	O
boatswain	O
himself	O
killing	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
with	O
his	O
poleaxe	O
.	O

The	O
house	O
being	O
large	O
,	O
and	O
many	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
care	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
,	O
but	O
called	O
for	O
a	O
hand	O
grenado	O
,	O
and	O
threw	O
it	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
at	O
first	O
frightened	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
when	O
it	O
burst	O
,	O
made	O
such	O
havoc	O
among	O
them	O
that	O
they	O
cried	O
out	O
in	O
a	O
hideous	O
manner	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
who	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
open	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
were	O
killed	O
or	O
hurt	O
with	O
the	O
grenado	O
,	O
except	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
more	O
who	O
pressed	O
to	O
the	O
door	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
boatswain	O
and	O
two	O
more	O
kept	O
,	O
with	O
their	O
bayonets	O
on	O
the	O
muzzles	O
of	O
their	O
pieces	O
,	O
and	O
despatched	O
all	O
that	O
came	O
in	O
their	O
way	O
;	O
but	O
there	O
was	O
another	O
apartment	O
in	O
the	O
house	O

where	O
the	O
prince	O

king	O

or	O
whatever	O
he	O
was	O
,	O
and	O
several	O
others	O

these	O
were	O
kept	O
in	O

the	O
house	O

which	O
was	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
all	O
in	O
a	O
light	O
flame	O

fell	O
in	O
upon	O
them	O

they	O
were	O
smothered	O
together	O

All	O
this	O
while	O
they	O
fired	O
not	O
a	O
gun	O

because	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
waken	O
the	O
people	O
faster	O
than	O
they	O
could	O

them	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
fire	O
began	O
to	O
waken	O
them	O
fast	O
enough	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
fellows	O
were	O
glad	O
to	O
keep	O
a	O
little	O
together	O
in	O
bodies	O

for	O
the	O
fire	O
grew	O
so	O
raging	O

all	O
the	O
houses	O

made	O
of	O
light	O

that	O
they	O
could	O
hardly	O
bear	O
the	O
street	O
between	O

Their	O
business	O
was	O
to	O
follow	O
the	O
fire	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
surer	O
execution	O
:	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
the	O
fire	O
either	O
forced	O
the	O
people	O
out	O
of	O
those	O
houses	O
which	O
were	O
burning	O

or	O
frightened	O
them	O
out	O

at	O

While	O
this	O
was	O

I	O
must	O
confess	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
uneasy	O
,	O
and	O
especially	O
when	O
I	O
saw	O
the	O
flames	O
of	O
the	O

a	O

ten	O

in	O

his	O

I	O
was	O
no	O

than	O
I	O
was	O
to	O
persuade	O
them	O
not	O
to	O
go	O
;	O
so	O
the	O
captain	O
ordered	O
two	O

to	O
row	O
back	O
the	O
pinnace	O
,	O
and	O
fetch	O
twelve	O
men	O

,	O
leaving	O
the	O
long-boat	O
at	O
an	O
anchor	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
back	O
,	O
six	O
men	O
should	O
keep	O
the	O
two	O
boats	O

and	O
six	O
more	O
come	O
after	O
us	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
he	O
left	O
only	O
sixteen	O
men	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
:	O
for	O
the	O
whole	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O
consisted	O
of	O
sixty-five	O

whereof	O
two	O
were	O
lost	O
in	O
the	O
late	O
quarrel	O
which	O
brought	O
this	O
mischief	O
on	O
.	O

Being	O
now	O
on	O
the	O
march	O
,	O
we	O
felt	O
little	O
of	O
the	O
ground	O
we	O
trod	O
on	O
;	O
and	O
being	O
guided	O
by	O
the	O
fire	O
,	O
we	O
kept	O
no	O
path	O
,	O
but	O
went	O
directly	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
of	O
the	O
flame	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
noise	O
of	O
the	O
guns	O
was	O
surprising	O
to	O
us	O
before	O
,	O
the	O
cries	O
of	O
the	O
poor	O
people	O
were	O
now	O
quite	O
of	O
another	O
nature	O
,	O
and	O
filled	O
us	O
with	O
horror	O
.	O

I	O
must	O
confess	O
I	O
was	O
never	O
at	O
the	O
sacking	O
a	O
city	O
,	O
or	O
at	O
the	O
taking	O
a	O
town	O
by	O
storm	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
heard	O
of	O
Oliver	O
Cromwell	O
taking	O
Drogheda	O
,	O
in	O
Ireland	O
,	O
and	O
killing	O
man	O
,	O
woman	O
,	O
and	O
child	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
read	O
of	O
Count	O
Tilly	O
sacking	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Magdeburg	PNM
and	O
cutting	O
the	O
throats	O
of	O
twenty-two	O
thousand	O
of	O
all	O
sexes	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
never	O
had	O
an	O
idea	O
of	O
the	O
thing	O
itself	O
before	O
,	O
nor	O
is	O
it	O
possible	O
to	O
describe	O
it	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
horror	O
that	O
was	O
upon	O
our	O
minds	O
at	O
hearing	O
it	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
length	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
town	O
,	O
though	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
entering	O
the	O
streets	O
of	O
it	O
for	O
the	O
fire	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
object	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
was	O
the	O
ruins	O
of	O
a	O
hut	O
or	O
house	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
the	O
ashes	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
house	O
was	O
consumed	O
;	O
and	O
just	O
before	O
it	O
,	O
plainly	O
now	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
by	O
the	O
light	O
of	O
the	O
fire	O
,	O
lay	O
four	O
men	O
and	O
three	O
women	O
,	O
killed	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
thought	O
,	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
more	O
lay	O
in	O
the	O
heap	O
among	O
the	O
fire	O
;	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
such	O
instances	O
of	O
rage	O
,	O
altogether	O
barbarous	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
a	O
fury	O
something	O
beyond	O
what	O
was	O
human	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
thought	O
it	O
impossible	O
our	O
men	O
could	O
be	O
guilty	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
or	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
the	O
authors	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
we	O
thought	O
they	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
every	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
put	O
to	O
the	O
worst	O
of	O
deaths	O

But	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
all	O
:	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
fire	O
increase	O
forward	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
cry	O
went	O
on	O
just	O
as	O
the	O
fire	O
went	O
on	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
utmost	O
confusion	O
.	O

We	O
advanced	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
farther	O
,	O
and	O
behold	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
astonishment	O
,	O
three	O
naked	O
women	O
,	O
and	O
crying	O
in	O
a	O
most	O
dreadful	O
manner	O
,	O
came	O
flying	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
wings	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
them	O
sixteen	O
or	O
seventeen	O
men	O

natives	O
,	O
in	O
the	O

terror	O
and	O
consternation	O

with	O
three	O
of	O
our	O
English	O
butchers	O
in	O
the	O

when	O
they	O

one	O
that	O

down	O
in	O
our	O
sight	O

their	O

them	O

them	O

up	O
a	O
most	O

shriek	O

My	O

my	O
blood	O

in	O

I	O
saw	O
this	O

I	O

had	O
the	O
three	O

sailors	O
that	O

I	O
had	O
made	O
our	O

kill	O
them	O
all	O

however	O
,	O
we	O
took	O
some	O
means	O
to	O
let	O
the	O
poor	O
flying	O
creatures	O
know	O
that	O
we	O

up	O

and	O
kneeling	O
down	O
,	O
with	O
their	O
hands	O
lifted	O
up	O

piteous	O

which	O
we	O

them	O

together	O
in	O
a	O

for	O

I	O
left	O
my	O

drawn	O
up	O
together	O

,	O
charging	O
them	O
to	O
hurt	O
nobody	O

,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
to	O
get	O
at	O

what	O

was	O

what	O
they	O
intended	O
to	O

assuring	O
them	O
that	O
if	O

they	O
would	O
have	O
a	O
hundred	O

about	O

I	O

I	O
left	O

went	O
among	O

taking	O
only	O
two	O

our	O

with	O
me	O

and	O
there	O
was	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
a	O
piteous	O
spectacle	O
among	O
them	O

Some	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
their	O
feet	O
terribly	O
burned	O
with	O
trampling	O
and	O
running	O
through	O
the	O
fire	O
;	O

burned	O
;	O
one	O
of	O
the	O

had	O
fallen	O
down	O
in	O
the	O
fire	O

and	O
was	O
very	O
much	O
burned	O
before	O

could	O
get	O
out	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
two	O

three	O
of	O
the	O

cuts	O
in	O

I	O
would	O
fain	O
have	O
learned	O
what	O
the	O

of	O
all	O
this	O
was	O

I	O
could	O
not	O

I	O
was	O
so	O
terrified	O
in	O
my	O
thoughts	O
at	O
this	O
outrageous	O
attempt	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
stay	O

went	O
back	O

whatever	O

all	O

with	O

took	O

in	O

observed	O

about	O

that	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
boat-side	O

that	O

out	O

in	O
about	O
half-an-hour	O
after	O
I	O
got	O
on	O

I	O
heard	O
a	O
volley	O
of	O
our	O

saw	O
a	O
great	O

sixteen	O

By	O
the	O

the	O
men	O
got	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
again	O
with	O
the	O
pinnace	O
our	O

began	O
to	O
appear	O

they	O
came	O
dropping	O
in	O

not	O
in	O
two	O
bodies	O

they	O
went	O

there	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
manner	O

that	O
a	O
small	O

off	O

But	O
the	O
dread	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
upon	O
the	O

the	O

so	O

the	O

He	O

it	O

that	O
we	O
seemed	O
to	O
break	O
the	O

but	O
really	O

one	O

without	O
any	O

that	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
a	O
capacity	O

them	O
now	O

we	O
might	O
also	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
capacity	O
to	O
do	O
ourselves	O
justice	O
upon	O

in	O
an	O

that	O

the	O

had	O
taken	O
a	O
little	O
liberty	O
with	O
the	O

that	O
in	O

that	O
they	O

nothing	O

what	O
was	O

what	O
the	O

One	O

it	O
is	O

mankind	O

at	O
their	O

The	O

on	O

just	O

I	O
began	O

with	O
the	O
just	O

of	O

in	O

the	O

very	O

I	O
could	O
show	O
any	O

in	O

were	O
not	O

that	O
which	O
put	O
me	O
to	O

in	O
the	O

that	O
not	O

of	O
these	O

the	O

my	O

the	O
boatswain	O

who	O

came	O
up	O

upon	O
the	O

that	O
I	O
made	O

and	O
had	O
used	O
the	O

very	O
ill	O
on	O

it	O

that	O
they	O

I	O
might	O

some	O
ill-design	O
in	O

perhaps	O
to	O

them	O

us	O

what	O

He	O
told	O

I	O
immediately	O
found	O
out	O
the	O

repeating	O
all	O

that	O
as	O
I	O

My	O

though	O
he	O

to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
how	O
I	O
might	O
take	O
it	O
.	O

So	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
talk	O
smartly	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
considerable	O
owner	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
if	O
ever	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
England	PNM
again	O
it	O
would	O
cost	O
them	O
very	O
dear	O
;	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
mine	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
put	O
me	O
out	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
rather	O
lose	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
voyage	O
too	O
,	O
than	O
disoblige	O
me	O
so	O
much	O
:	O
so	O
they	O
might	O
do	O
as	O
they	O
pleased	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
and	O
talk	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
invited	O
the	O
boatswain	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
they	O
might	O
accommodate	O
the	O
matter	O
with	O
me	O
.	O

But	O
they	O
all	O
rejected	O
the	O
proposal	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
me	O
any	O
more	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
I	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
they	O
would	O
all	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

``	O
Well	O
,	O
''	O
said	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
``	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
all	O
of	O
this	O

let	O
me	O
go	O

and	O
talk	O
with	O
him	O
.	O
''	O

So	O
away	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
me	O
with	O
this	O
account	O
,	O
a	O
little	O
after	O
the	O
message	O
had	O
been	O
brought	O
to	O
me	O
from	O
the	O
coxswain	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
very	O
glad	O
to	O
see	O
my	O
nephew	O
,	O
I	O
must	O
confess	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
without	O
apprehensions	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
confine	O
him	O
by	O
violence	O
,	O
set	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
run	O
away	O
with	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
stripped	O
naked	O
in	O
a	O
remote	O
country	O
,	O
having	O
nothing	O
to	O
help	O
myself	O
;	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
a	O
worse	O
case	O
than	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
alone	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

But	O
they	O
had	O
not	O
come	O
to	O
that	O
length	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
to	O
my	O
satisfaction	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
my	O
nephew	O
told	O
me	O
what	O
they	O
had	O
said	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
they	O
had	O
sworn	O
and	O
shook	O
hands	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
,	O
one	O
and	O
all	O
,	O
leave	O
the	O
ship	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
suffered	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
he	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
concerned	O
at	O
it	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
would	O
stay	O
on	O
shore	O

I	O
only	O
desired	O
he	O
would	O
take	O
care	O
and	O
send	O
me	O
all	O
my	O
necessary	O
things	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
leave	O
me	O
a	O
sufficient	O
sum	O
of	O

,	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
find	O
my	O
way	O
to	O
England	PNM
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
heavy	O
piece	O
of	O
news	O
to	O
my	O
nephew	O
,	O
but	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
way	O
to	O
help	O
it	O
but	O
to	O
comply	O
;	O
so	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
he	O
went	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
satisfied	O
the	O
men	O
that	O
his	O
uncle	O
had	O
yielded	O
to	O
their	O
importunity	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
sent	O
for	O
his	O
goods	O
from	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
matter	O
was	O
over	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
hours	O
,	O
the	O
men	O
returned	O
to	O
their	O
duty	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
consider	O
what	O
course	O
I	O
should	O
steer	O

I	O
was	O
now	O
alone	O
in	O
a	O
most	O
remote	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
near	O
three	O
thousand	O
leagues	O
by	O
sea	O
farther	O
off	O
from	O
England	PNM
than	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
my	O
island	O
;	O
only	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
true	O
,	O
I	O
might	O
travel	O
here	O
by	O
land	O
over	O
the	O
Great	O
Mogul	O
's	O
country	O
to	O
Surat	PNM
,	O
might	O
go	O
from	O
thence	O
to	O
Bassora	PNM
by	O
sea	O
,	O
up	O
the	O
Gulf	PNM
of	PNM
Persia	PNM
,	O
and	O
take	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
the	O
caravans	O
,	O
over	O
the	O
desert	O
of	O
Arabia	PNM

to	O
Aleppo	PNM
and	O

;	O
from	O
thence	O
by	O
sea	O
again	O
to	O
Italy	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
overland	O
into	O
France	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
another	O
way	O
before	O
me	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
some	O
English	O
ships	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
coming	O
to	O
Bengal	PNM
from	O
Achin	PNM
,	O
on	O
the	O

of	O
Sumatra	PNM
,	O
and	O
get	O
passage	O
on	O
board	O
them	O
from	O
England	PNM

But	O
as	O
I	O
came	O
hither	O
without	O
any	O
concern	O
with	O
the	O
East	O
Indian	O
Company	O
,	O
so	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
difficult	O
to	O
go	O
from	O
hence	O
without	O
their	O
licence	O
,	O
unless	O
with	O
great	O
favour	O
of	O
the	O
captains	O
of	O
the	O
ships	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
company	O
's	O
factors	O
:	O
and	O
to	O
both	O
I	O
was	O
an	O
utter	O
stranger	O
.	O

Here	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
mortification	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
ship	O
set	O
sail	O
without	O
me	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
my	O
nephew	O
left	O
me	O
two	O
servants	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
one	O
companion	O
and	O
one	O
servant	O
;	O
the	O
first	O
was	O
clerk	O
to	O
the	O
purser	O
,	O
whom	O
he	O
engaged	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
was	O
his	O
own	O
servant	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
took	O
a	O
good	O
lodging	O
in	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
an	O
Englishwoman	O
,	O
where	O
several	O

lodged	O
,	O
some	O
French	O
,	O
two	O
Italians	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
Jews	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
Englishman	O
.	O

Here	O
I	O
stayed	O
above	O
nine	O
months	O
,	O
considering	O
what	O
course	O
to	O
take	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
some	O
English	O
goods	O
with	O
me	O
of	O
value	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
considerable	O
sum	O
of	O
money	O
;	O
my	O

furnishing	O
me	O
with	O
a	O
thousand	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O

and	O
a	O
letter	O
of	O
credit	O
for	O
more	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
occasion	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
straitened	O
,	O
whatever	O
might	O
happen	O
.	O

I	O
quickly	O
disposed	O
of	O
my	O
goods	O
to	O
advantage	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
originally	O
intended	O
,	O
I	O
bought	O
here	O
some	O
very	O
good	O
diamonds	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
of	O
all	O
other	O
things	O
,	O
were	O
the	O
most	O
proper	O
for	O
me	O
in	O
my	O

circumstances	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
could	O
always	O
carry	O
my	O

During	O
my	O
stay	O
here	O
many	O
proposals	O
were	O
made	O
for	O
my	O

to	O
England	PNM

none	O
falling	O
out	O
to	O
my	O

was	O

when	O

this	O
gain	O
to	O
me	O
?	O

I	O
was	O
rich	O
enough	O
already	O
,	O
nor	O
had	O
I	O
any	O
uneasy	O
desires	O
about	O
getting	O
more	O
money	O
;	O
therefore	O
the	O
profit	O
of	O
the	O
voyage	O
to	O
me	O
was	O
of	O
no	O
great	O
force	O
for	O
the	O
prompting	O
me	O
forward	O
to	O
further	O
undertakings	O
.	O

Hence	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
that	O
by	O
this	O
voyage	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
no	O
progress	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
was	O
come	O
back	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
might	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
from	O
whence	O
I	O
came	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
a	O
home	O
:	O
whereas	O
,	O
my	O
eye	O
,	O
like	O
that	O
which	O
Solomon	O
speaks	O
of	O
,	O
was	O
never	O
satisfied	O
with	O
seeing	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
come	O
into	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
never	O
in	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
part	O
,	O
in	O
particular	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
heard	O
much	O
of	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
resolved	O
to	O
see	O
as	O
much	O
of	O
it	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
:	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O
might	O
say	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
all	O
the	O
world	O
that	O
was	O
worth	O
seeing	O
.	O

But	O
my	O
fellow-traveller	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
different	O
notions	O
:	O
I	O
acknowledge	O
his	O
were	O
the	O
more	O
suited	O
to	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
a	O
merchant	O
's	O
life	O
:	O
who	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
is	O
abroad	O
upon	O
adventures	O
,	O
is	O
wise	O
to	O
stick	O
to	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
best	O
thing	O
for	O
him	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
is	O
likely	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
most	O
money	O
by	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
mine	O
was	O
the	O
notion	O
of	O
a	O
mad	O
,	O
rambling	O
boy	O
,	O
that	O
never	O
cares	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
thing	O
twice	O
over	O
.	O

But	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
all	O
:	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
impatience	O
upon	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
nearer	O
home	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
an	O
unsettled	O
resolution	O
which	O
way	O
to	O
go	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
interval	O
of	O
these	O
consultations	O
,	O
my	O
friend	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
always	O
upon	O
the	O
search	O
for	O
business	O
,	O
proposed	O
another	O
voyage	O
among	O
the	O
Spice	O
Islands	O
,	O
to	O
bring	O
home	O
a	O
loading	O
of	O
cloves	O
from	O
the	O
Manillas	O
,	O
or	O
thereabouts	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
not	O
long	O
in	O
preparing	O
for	O
this	O
voyage	O
;	O
the	O
chief	O
difficulty	O
was	O
in	O
bringing	O
me	O
to	O
come	O
into	O
it	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
at	O

,	O
nothing	O

the	O

of	O

I	O
resolved	O
on	O
this	O

we	O

very	O
successfully	O

at	O

several	O

came	O
home	O
in	O
about	O
five	O

when	O
we	O

our	O

with	O
very	O
great	O

to	O
the	O

A	O
COUNTRYMAN	O
A	O
little	O
while	O
after	O

came	O
in	O
a	O
Dutch	O
ship	O
from	O
Batavia	PNM
;	O
she	O
was	O
a	O
coaster	O
,	O
not	O
an	O
European	O
trader	O
,	O
of	O
about	O
two	O
hundred	O
tons	O
burden	O
;	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
pretended	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
so	O
sickly	O
that	O
the	O
captain	O
had	O
not	O
hands	O
enough	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
sea	O
with	O
,	O
so	O
he	O
lay	O
by	O
at	O
Bengal	PNM
;	O
and	O
having	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
got	O
money	O
enough	O
,	O
or	O
being	O
willing	O
,	O
for	O
other	O
reasons	O
,	O
to	O
go	O
for	O
Europe	PNM
,	O
he	O
gave	O
public	O
notice	O
he	O
would	O
sell	O
his	O
ship	O
.	O

This	O
came	O
to	O
my	O
ears	O
before	O
my	O
new	O
partner	O
heard	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
mind	O
to	O
buy	O
it	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
him	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

He	O
considered	O
a	O
while	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
was	O
no	O
rash	O
man	O
neither	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
replied	O
,	O
``	O
She	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
too	O
big	O
--	O
however	O
,	O
we	O
will	O
have	O
her	O
.	O
''	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
we	O
bought	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
agreeing	O
with	O
the	O
master	O
,	O
we	O
paid	O
for	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
possession	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
done	O
so	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
engage	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
to	O
join	O
with	O
those	O
we	O
had	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
pursuing	O
our	O
business	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
,	O
they	O
having	O
received	O
not	O
their	O
wages	O
,	O
but	O
their	O
share	O
of	O
the	O
money	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
afterwards	O
learned	O
,	O
not	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
;	O
we	O
inquired	O
much	O
about	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
length	O
were	O
told	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
gone	O
together	O
by	O
land	O
to	O
Agra	PNM
,	O
the	O
great	O
city	O
of	O
the	O
Mogul	O
's	O
residence	O
,	O
to	O
proceed	O
from	O
thence	O
to	O
Surat	PNM
,	O
and	O
then	O
go	O
by	O
sea	O
to	O
the	O
Gulf	PNM
of	PNM
Persia	PNM
.	O

Nothing	O
had	O
so	O
much	O
troubled	O
me	O
a	O
good	O
while	O
as	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
miss	O
the	O
opportunity	O
of	O
going	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
for	O
such	O
a	O
ramble	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O

in	O
such	O
company	O
as	O
would	O
both	O
have	O
guarded	O
and	O
diverted	O
me	O
,	O
would	O
have	O
suited	O
mightily	O
with	O
my	O
great	O
design	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
both	O
seen	O
the	O
world	O
and	O
gone	O
homeward	O
too	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
was	O
much	O
better	O
satisfied	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
after	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
sort	O
of	O
fellows	O
they	O
were	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
their	O
history	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
man	O
they	O
called	O
captain	O
was	O
the	O
gunner	O
only	O
,	O
not	O
the	O
commander	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
trading	O
voyage	O

in	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
attacked	O
on	O
shore	O
by	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
Malays	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
killed	O
the	O
captain	O

three	O
of	O
his	O
men	O

that	O
after	O
the	O

was	O
killed	O
,	O
these	O
men	O
,	O
eleven	O
in	O

,	O
having	O
resolved	O
to	O
run	O
away	O

Well	O

let	O
them	O
get	O
the	O
ship	O
how	O
they	O
would	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
honestly	O
by	O
her	O

as	O
we	O
thought	O

though	O
we	O
did	O
not	O

I	O
confess	O

examine	O
into	O
things	O
so	O
exactly	O

we	O

for	O
we	O
never	O

anything	O

faltered	O

their	O

Somehow	O

them	O

the	O

a	O

it	O
was	O
all	O
a	O

called	O
himself	O
by	O
that	O

we	O

not	O

him	O
:	O
and	O
withal	O
,	O
having	O
no	O
suspicion	O
of	O
the	O
thing	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
through	O
with	O
our	O
bargain	O

We	O
picked	O
up	O
some	O
more	O
English	O
sailors	O
here	O
after	O
this	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
Dutch	O
,	O
and	O
now	O

we	O
put	O
out	O
a	O
flag	O
of	O
truce	O

as	O
a	O
signal	O
for	O
parley	O

they	O
came	O
crowding	O
after	O
us	O
till	O
within	O
shot	O

when	O
we	O
took	O
in	O
our	O
white	O
flag	O

they	O
having	O
made	O
no	O

it	O

hung	O
out	O
a	O
red	O
flag	O

and	O
fired	O
at	O
them	O
with	O
a	O
shot	O

Notwithstanding	O
this	O
,	O
they	O
came	O
on	O
till	O
they	O
were	O
near	O
enough	O
to	O
call	O
to	O
them	O
with	O
a	O
speaking-trumpet	O
,	O
bidding	O
them	O
keep	O
off	O
at	O
their	O
peril	O

It	O
was	O
all	O
one	O
;	O
they	O
crowded	O
after	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
come	O
under	O
our	O
stern	O
,	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
board	O
us	O
on	O
our	O
quarter	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
,	O
seeing	O
they	O
were	O
resolute	O
for	O
mischief	O
,	O
and	O
depended	O
upon	O
the	O
strength	O
that	O
followed	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
to	O
bring	O
the	O
ship	O
to	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
lay	O
upon	O
our	O
broadside	O
;	O
when	O
immediately	O
we	O
fired	O
five	O
guns	O
at	O
them	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
levelled	O
so	O
true	O
as	O
to	O
carry	O
away	O
the	O
stern	O
of	O
the	O
hindermost	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
then	O
forced	O
them	O
to	O
take	O
down	O
their	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
run	O
all	O
to	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
to	O
keep	O
her	O
from	O
sinking	O
;	O
so	O
she	O
lay	O
by	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
enough	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
seeing	O
the	O
foremost	O
boat	O
crowd	O
on	O
after	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
ready	O
to	O
fire	O
at	O
her	O
in	O
particular	O
.	O

While	O
this	O
was	O
doing	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
boats	O
that	O
followed	O
made	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
disabled	O
,	O
to	O
relieve	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
her	O
take	O
out	O
the	O
men	O
.	O

We	O
then	O
called	O
again	O
to	O
the	O
foremost	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
offered	O
a	O
truce	O
,	O
to	O
parley	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
her	O
business	O
was	O
with	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
had	O
no	O
answer	O
,	O
only	O
she	O
crowded	O
close	O
under	O
our	O
stern	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
,	O
our	O
gunner	O
who	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
dexterous	O
fellow	O
ran	O
out	O
his	O
two	O
case	O
-	O
guns	O
,	O
and	O
fired	O
again	O
at	O
her	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
shot	O
missing	O
,	O
the	O
men	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
shouted	O
,	O
waved	O
their	O
caps	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
on	O
.	O

The	O
gunner	O
,	O
getting	O
quickly	O
ready	O
again	O
,	O
fired	O
among	O
them	O
a	O
second	O
time	O
,	O
one	O
shot	O
of	O
which	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
missed	O
the	O
boat	O
itself	O
,	O
yet	O
fell	O
in	O
among	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
could	O
easily	O
see	O
did	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
mischief	O
among	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
now	O
wore	O
the	O
ship	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
our	O
quarter	O
to	O
bear	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
firing	O
three	O
guns	O
more	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
boat	O
was	O
almost	O
split	O
to	O
pieces	O
;	O
in	O
particular	O
,	O
her	O
rudder	O
and	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
her	O
stern	O
were	O
shot	O
quite	O
away	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
handed	O
her	O
sail	O
immediately	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
in	O
great	O
disorder	O
.	O

To	O
complete	O
their	O
misfortune	O
,	O
our	O
gunner	O
let	O
fly	O
two	O
guns	O
at	O
them	O
again	O
;	O
where	O
he	O
hit	O
them	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
boat	O
was	O
sinking	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
already	O
in	O
the	O
water	O
:	O
upon	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
immediately	O
manned	O
out	O
our	O
pinnace	O
,	O
with	O
orders	O
to	O
pick	O
up	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
,	O
and	O
save	O
them	O
from	O
drowning	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
ship	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
boats	O
began	O
to	O
come	O
up	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
in	O
the	O
pinnace	O
followed	O
their	O
orders	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
up	O
three	O
men	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
whom	O
was	O
just	O
drowning	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
while	O
before	O
we	O
could	O
recover	O
him	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
on	O
board	O
we	O
crowded	O
all	O
the	O
sail	O
we	O
could	O
make	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
farther	O
out	O
to	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
when	O
the	O
other	O
boats	O
came	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
first	O
,	O
they	O
gave	O
over	O
their	O
chase	O
.	O

Being	O
thus	O
delivered	O
from	O
a	O
danger	O
which	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
the	O
reason	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
yet	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
much	O
greater	O
than	O
I	O
apprehended	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
change	O
our	O
course	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
let	O
any	O
one	O
know	O
whither	O
we	O
were	O
going	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
stood	O
out	O
to	O
sea	O
eastward	O
,	O
quite	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
all	O
European	O
ships	O
,	O
whether	O
they	O
were	O
bound	O
to	O
China	PNM
or	O
anywhere	O
else	O
,	O
within	O
the	O
commerce	O
of	O
the	O
European	O
nations	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
sea	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
consult	O
with	O
the	O
two	O
seamen	O
,	O
and	O
inquire	O
what	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
all	O
this	O
should	O
be	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
Dutchman	O
confirmed	O
the	O
gunner	O
's	O
story	O
about	O
the	O
false	O
sale	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
murder	O
of	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
and	O
also	O
how	O
that	O
he	O
,	O
this	O
Dutchman	O
,	O
and	O
four	O
more	O
got	O
into	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
wandered	O
about	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
,	O
till	O
at	O
length	O
he	O
made	O
his	O
escape	O
,	O
and	O
swam	O
off	O
to	O
a	O
Dutch	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
sailing	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
in	O
its	O
way	O
from	O
China	PNM
.	O

He	O
then	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
he	O
went	O
to	O
Batavia	PNM
,	O
where	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
seamen	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
arrived	O
,	O
having	O
deserted	O
the	O
rest	O
in	O
their	O
travels	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
an	O
account	O
that	O
the	O
fellow	O
who	O
had	O
run	O
away	O
with	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
sold	O
her	O
at	O
Bengal	PNM
to	O
a	O
set	O
of	O
pirates	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
gone	O
a-cruising	O
in	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
already	O
taken	O
an	O
English	O
ship	O
and	O
two	O
Dutch	O
ships	O
very	O
richly	O
laden	O
.	O

This	O
latter	O
part	O
we	O
found	O
to	O
concern	O
us	O
directly	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
knew	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
false	O
;	O
yet	O
,	O
as	O
my	O
partner	O
said	O
,	O
very	O
justly	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
fallen	O
into	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
had	O
had	O
such	O
a	O
prepossession	O
against	O
us	O
beforehand	O
,	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
vain	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
have	O
defended	O
ourselves	O
,	O
or	O
to	O
hope	O
for	O
any	O
good	O
quarter	O
at	O
their	O
hands	O
;	O
especially	O
considering	O
that	O
our	O
accusers	O
had	O
been	O
our	O
judges	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
have	O
expected	O
nothing	O
from	O
them	O
but	O
what	O
rage	O
would	O
have	O
dictated	O
,	O
and	O
an	O
ungoverned	O
passion	O
have	O
executed	O
.	O

Therefore	O
it	O
was	O
his	O
opinion	O
we	O
should	O
go	O
directly	O
back	O
to	O
Bengal	PNM
,	O
from	O
whence	O
we	O
came	O
,	O
without	O
putting	O
in	O
at	O
any	O
port	O
whatever	O
--	O
because	O
where	O
we	O
could	O
give	O
a	O
good	O
account	O
of	O
ourselves	O
,	O
could	O
prove	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
when	O
the	O
ship	O
put	O
in	O
,	O
of	O
whom	O
we	O
bought	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
like	O
;	O
and	O
what	O
was	O
more	O
than	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
put	O
upon	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
bringing	O
it	O
before	O
the	O
proper	O
judges	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
sure	O
to	O
have	O
some	O
justice	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
hanged	O
first	O
and	O
judged	O
afterwards	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
some	O
time	O
of	O
my	O
partner	O
's	O
opinion	O
;	O
but	O
after	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
serious	O
thinking	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
hazard	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
attempt	O
returning	O
to	O
Bengal	PNM
,	O
for	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
on	O
the	O
wrong	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
Straits	O
of	O
Malacca	PNM
,	O
and	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
alarm	O
was	O
given	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
sure	O
to	O
be	O
waylaid	O
on	O
every	O
side	O
--	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
taken	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
running	O
away	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
even	O
condemn	O
ourselves	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
would	O
want	O
no	O
more	O
evidence	O
to	O
destroy	O
us	O
.	O

I	O
also	O
asked	O
the	O
English	O
sailor	O
's	O
opinion	O
,	O
who	O
said	O
he	O
was	O
of	O
my	O
mind	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
certainly	O
should	O
be	O
taken	O
.	O

This	O
danger	O
a	O
little	O
startled	O
my	O
partner	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
immediately	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Tonquin	PNM
,	O
and	O
so	O
on	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
China	PNM
--	O
and	O
pursuing	O
the	O
first	O
design	O
as	O
to	O
trade	O
,	O
find	O
some	O
way	O
or	O
other	O
to	O
dispose	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O

and	O
come	O
back	O
in	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
vessels	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
such	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
get	O

This	O
was	O
approved	O
of	O
as	O
the	O
best	O
method	O
for	O
our	O
security	O
,	O
and	O
accordingly	O
we	O
steered	O
away	O
NNE.	O
,	O
keeping	O
above	O
fifty	O
leagues	O
off	O
from	O
the	O
usual	O
course	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
.	O

This	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
put	O
us	O
to	O
some	O
inconvenience	O
:	O
for	O

first	O

the	O
winds	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
that	O

from	O
the	O

seemed	O
to	O

more	O
steadily	O
against	O

almost	O

as	O
we	O
call	O
it	O

from	O
the	O
E.	O

ENE.	O

so	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
a	O
long	O

upon	O
our	O
voyage	O

we	O
were	O

ill	O

for	O
so	O
long	O
a	O
run	O
;	O
and	O
what	O
was	O
still	O
worse	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
some	O
danger	O
that	O
those	O
English	O

Dutch	O
ships	O
whose	O

pursued	O
us	O

whereof	O

with	O

I	O
must	O
confess	O
I	O
was	O
now	O
very	O
uneasy	O

and	O
thought	O
myself	O
,	O
including	O
the	O
late	O
escape	O
from	O
the	O
longboats	O
,	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
dangerous	O
condition	O
that	O
ever	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
through	O
my	O
past	O
life	O
;	O
for	O
whatever	O
ill	O
circumstances	O
I	O
had	O

I	O

never	O

nor	O
had	O
I	O
ever	O
done	O
anything	O

the	O

much	O

I	O
had	O
chiefly	O
been	O
my	O
own	O
enemy	O

or	O

as	O
I	O
may	O
rightly	O
say	O

I	O
had	O
been	O
nobody	O

enemy	O
but	O
my	O
own	O
;	O
but	O
now	O
I	O
was	O
woefully	O
embarrassed	O
:	O
for	O
though	O
I	O
was	O
perfectly	O
innocent	O

I	O
was	O
in	O
no	O

an	O

to	O

it	O
I	O
knew	O

what	O

place	O
we	O
could	O
go	O
to	O

My	O
partner	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
encourage	O
me	O
by	O
describing	O
the	O
several	O
ports	O
of	O
that	O
coast	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
would	O
put	O
in	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Cochin	PNM
China	PNM
,	O
or	O
the	O
bay	O
of	O
Tonquin	PNM
,	O
intending	O
afterwards	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Macao	PNM
,	O
where	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
European	O
families	O
resided	O
,	O
and	O
particularly	O
the	O
missionary	O
priests	O
,	O
who	O
usually	O
went	O
thither	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
their	O
going	O
forward	O
to	O
China	PNM
.	O

Hither	O
then	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
accordingly	O
,	O
though	O
after	O
a	O
tedious	O
course	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
much	O
straitened	O
for	O
provisions	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
within	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
coast	O
very	O
early	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
;	O
and	O
upon	O
reflection	O
on	O
the	O
past	O
circumstances	O
of	O
danger	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
,	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
put	O
into	O
a	O
small	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
had	O
depth	O
enough	O
of	O
water	O
for	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
either	O
overland	O
or	O
by	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O

,	O
come	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
ships	O
were	O
in	O
any	O
port	O
thereabouts	O

This	O
happy	O
step	O
was	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
our	O
deliverance	O
:	O
for	O
though	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
immediately	O
see	O
any	O
European	O
ships	O
in	O
the	O
bay	O
of	O
Tonquin	PNM
,	O
yet	O
the	O
next	O

there	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
bay	O
two	O
Dutch	O
ships	O
;	O
and	O
a	O
third	O
without	O
any	O

spread	O
out	O

but	O
which	O
we	O
believed	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
Dutchman	O
,	O
passed	O
by	O
at	O
about	O
two	O
leagues	O

,	O
steering	O
for	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
China	PNM
;	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
went	O
by	O
two	O
English	O
ships	O
steering	O
the	O
same	O
course	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
we	O
thought	O
we	O
saw	O
ourselves	O
beset	O
with	O
enemies	O
both	O
one	O
way	O
and	O
the	O
other	O

The	O
place	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
was	O
wild	O

barbarous	O
,	O
the	O
people	O
thieves	O
by	O
occupation	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
it	O
is	O
true	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
much	O
to	O
seek	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
except	O
getting	O
a	O
few	O
provisions	O
,	O
cared	O
not	O
how	O
little	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
was	O
with	O
much	O
difficulty	O
that	O
we	O
kept	O
ourselves	O
from	O
being	O
insulted	O
by	O
them	O
several	O
ways	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
in	O
a	O
small	O
river	O
of	O
this	O
country	O
,	O
within	O
a	O
few	O
leagues	O
of	O
its	O

;	O
and	O
by	O
our	O

we	O
coasted	O
north	O

to	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
land	O
which	O
opens	O
the	O
great	O
bay	PNM
of	PNM
Tonquin	PNM
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
this	O
beating	O
up	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
that	O
we	O
discovered	O
we	O
were	O
surrounded	O
with	O
enemies	O

The	O
people	O
we	O
were	O

the	O

it	O
was	O

on	O
the	O

I	O
have	O
observed	O
above	O
that	O
our	O
ship	O
sprung	O
a	O
leak	O
at	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
find	O
it	O
out	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
happened	O
that	O

as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O

it	O
was	O
stopped	O
unexpectedly	O

on	O
the	O

of	O

being	O
pursued	O
by	O
the	O

English	O
ships	O
in	O
the	O
bay	O
of	O
Siam	PNM
;	O
yet	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
find	O
the	O
ship	O
so	O
perfectly	O
tight	O
and	O
sound	O
as	O
we	O
desired	O

we	O
resolved	O
while	O
we	O

THE	O

WHIMSICAL	O
CONTRIVANCE	O
The	O
inhabitants	O
came	O
wondering	O
down	O
the	O
shore	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
seeing	O
the	O
ship	O
lie	O
down	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
manner	O
,	O
and	O
heeling	O
in	O
towards	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
seeing	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
at	O
work	O
on	O
her	O
bottom	O
with	O
stages	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
their	O
boats	O
on	O
the	O
off-side	O
,	O
they	O
presently	O
concluded	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
cast	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
lay	O
fast	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
.	O

On	O
this	O
supposition	O
they	O
came	O
about	O
us	O
in	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
hours	O
'	O
time	O
with	O
ten	O
or	O
twelve	O
large	O
boats	O
,	O
having	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
eight	O
,	O
some	O
ten	O
men	O
in	O
a	O
boat	O
,	O
intending	O
,	O
no	O
doubt	O
,	O
to	O
have	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
and	O
plundered	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
they	O
found	O
us	O
there	O
,	O
to	O
have	O
carried	O
us	O
away	O
for	O
slaves	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
came	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
row	O
round	O
her	O
,	O
they	O
discovered	O
us	O
all	O
hard	O
at	O
work	O
on	O
the	O
outside	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
bottom	O

graving	O
,	O
and	O
stopping	O

as	O
every	O
seafaring	O
man	O
knows	O
how	O

They	O
stood	O
for	O
a	O
while	O
gazing	O
at	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
a	O
little	O
surprised	O
,	O
could	O
not	O
imagine	O
what	O
their	O
design	O
was	O
;	O
but	O
being	O
willing	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
we	O
took	O
this	O
opportunity	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
of	O
us	O
into	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
others	O
to	O
hand	O
down	O
arms	O
and	O
ammunition	O
to	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
at	O
work	O

to	O
defend	O
themselves	O
with	O
if	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
occasion	O

And	O
it	O
was	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
need	O
:	O
for	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
's	O
consultation	O
,	O
they	O
agreed	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
really	O
a	O
wreck	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
at	O
work	O
endeavouring	O
to	O
save	O
her	O
,	O
or	O
to	O
save	O
our	O
lives	O
by	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
our	O
boats	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
we	O
handed	O
our	O
arms	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
they	O
concluded	O
,	O
by	O
that	O
act	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
endeavouring	O
to	O
save	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
goods	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
,	O
they	O
took	O
it	O
for	O
granted	O
we	O
all	O
belonged	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
away	O
they	O
came	O
directly	O
upon	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
a	O
line-of-battle	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
,	O
seeing	O
so	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
frightened	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
lay	O
but	O
in	O
an	O
ill	O
posture	O
to	O
fight	O
,	O
and	O
cried	O
out	O
to	O
us	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
they	O
should	O
do	O
.	O

I	O
immediately	O
called	O
to	O
the	O
men	O
that	O
worked	O
upon	O
the	O
stages	O
to	O
slip	O
them	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
get	O
up	O
the	O
side	O
into	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
bade	O
those	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
to	O
row	O
round	O
and	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

The	O
few	O
who	O
were	O
on	O
board	O
worked	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
strength	O
and	O
hands	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
bring	O
the	O
ship	O
to	O
rights	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
neither	O
the	O
men	O
upon	O
the	O
stages	O
nor	O
those	O
in	O
the	O
boats	O
could	O
do	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
ordered	O
before	O
the	O
Cochin	O
Chinese	O
were	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
when	O
two	O
of	O
their	O
boats	O
boarded	O
our	O
longboat	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
lay	O
hold	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
as	O
their	O
prisoners	O

The	O
first	O
man	O
they	O
laid	O

of	O
was	O
an	O
English	O
seaman	O

a	O
stout	O

who	O
having	O
a	O

in	O
his	O

never	O
offered	O
to	O
fire	O
it	O

laid	O
it	O
down	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
fool	O

as	O
I	O
thought	O

but	O
he	O
understood	O
his	O
business	O
better	O
than	O
I	O
could	O
teach	O
him	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
grappled	O
the	O
Pagan	O

dragged	O
him	O
by	O
main	O

out	O
of	O

boat	O
into	O
ours	O

where	O
,	O
taking	O
him	O
by	O
the	O

he	O
beat	O
his	O
head	O
so	O
against	O
the	O
boat	O

gunnel	O
that	O
the	O

died	O
in	O

In	O
the	O

a	O
Dutchman	O

who	O
stood	O
next	O

took	O
up	O
the	O

with	O
the	O

it	O
so	O
laid	O

of	O
life	O

when	O

,	O
indeed	O

I	O

so	O

I	O
would	O
even	O

suffer	O
a	O

take	O
away	O
the	O
life	O
even	O
of	O
the	O

believe	O
all	O

people	O

who	O
know	O
the	O
value	O
of	O

would	O
be	O
of	O
my	O
opinion	O

if	O
they	O
entered	O
seriously	O

the	O

All	O
the	O
while	O
this	O
was	O

my	O

I	O
,	O
who	O
managed	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O

on	O

had	O
with	O
great	O

brought	O
the	O
ship	O
almost	O
to	O
rights	O

and	O
having	O
got	O
the	O
guns	O
into	O
their	O
places	O
again	O
,	O
the	O
gunner	O
called	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
bid	O
our	O
boat	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
would	O
let	O
fly	O
among	O
them	O

I	O
called	O
back	O
again	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
bid	O
him	O
not	O
offer	O
to	O
fire	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
carpenter	O
would	O
do	O
the	O
work	O
without	O
him	O
;	O
but	O
bid	O
him	O
heat	O
another	O
pitch-kettle	O
,	O
which	O
our	O
cook	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
on	O
broad	O
,	O
took	O
care	O
of	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
enemy	O
was	O
so	O
terrified	O
with	O
what	O
they	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
in	O
their	O
first	O
attack	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
come	O
on	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
who	O
were	O
farthest	O
off	O
,	O
seeing	O
the	O
ship	O
swim	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
upright	O
,	O
began	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
suppose	O

to	O
see	O
their	O
mistake	O

and	O
gave	O
over	O
the	O
enterprise	O
,	O
finding	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
as	O
they	O
expected	O

Thus	O
we	O
got	O
clear	O
of	O
this	O
merry	O
fight	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
got	O
some	O
rice	O

with	O
about	O
sixteen	O

go	O
forward	O

whatever	O
came	O
of	O

for	O
we	O
made	O
no	O

we	O
should	O
be	O
surrounded	O
the	O

with	O
rogues	O
enough	O

perhaps	O
more	O
than	O
our	O
pitch	O
-	O

would	O
dispose	O

We	O
therefore	O

on	O

the	O

and	O
the	O
next	O

lying	O
at	O

at	O

in	O

in	O

if	O

The	O
next	O

,	O
having	O
finished	O
our	O
work	O
within	O

,	O
and	O
finding	O
our	O
ship	O
was	O
perfectly	O
healed	O
of	O
all	O
her	O

,	O
we	O
set	O
sail	O

We	O
would	O
have	O
gone	O
into	O
the	O
bay	PNM
of	PNM
Tonquin	PNM
,	O
for	O
we	O
wanted	O
to	O
inform	O
ourselves	O
of	O
what	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
known	O
concerning	O
the	O
Dutch	O
ships	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
there	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
durst	O
not	O
stand	O
in	O
there	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
several	O
ships	O
go	O
in	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
supposed	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
before	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
kept	O
on	O
NE	O
.	O

towards	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Formosa	PNM
,	O
as	O
much	O
afraid	O
of	O
being	O
seen	O
by	O
a	O
Dutch	O
or	O
English	O
merchant	O
ship	O
as	O

English	O
merchant	O
ship	O
in	O
the	O
Mediterranean	O

of	O
an	O
Algerine	O

When	O
we	O
were	O
thus	O
got	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
we	O
kept	O
on	O
NE.	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
we	O
would	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
Manillas	O
or	O
the	O
Philippine	PNM
Islands	PNM
;	O
and	O
this	O
we	O
did	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
not	O
fall	O
into	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
European	O
ships	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
steered	O
north	O
,	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
22	O
degrees	O
30	O
seconds	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
means	O
we	O
made	O
the	O
island	O

directly	O

where	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O

in	O
order	O
to	O
get	O
water	O
and	O
fresh	O
provisions	O

which	O
the	O
people	O
there	O
,	O
who	O
are	O
very	O
courteous	O
in	O
their	O
manners	O

supplied	O
us	O
with	O
willingly	O

very	O
fairly	O
and	O
punctually	O
with	O
us	O
in	O
all	O
their	O
agreements	O
and	O
bargains	O

This	O
is	O
what	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
find	O
among	O
other	O
people	O
,	O
and	O
may	O
be	O
owing	O
to	O
the	O
remains	O
of	O
Christianity	O
which	O
was	O
once	O
planted	O
here	O
by	O
a	O
Dutch	O
missionary	O
of	O
Protestants	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
testimony	O
of	O
what	O
I	O
have	O
often	O
observed	O
,	O
viz.	O
that	O
the	O
Christian	O
religion	O
always	O
civilises	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
and	O
reforms	O
their	O
manners	O
,	O
where	O
it	O
is	O
received	O
,	O
whether	O
it	O
works	O
saving	O
effects	O
upon	O
them	O
or	O
no	O
.	O

From	O
thence	O
we	O
sailed	O
still	O
north	O
,	O
keeping	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
China	PNM
at	O
an	O
equal	O
distance	O
,	O
till	O
we	O
knew	O
we	O
were	O
beyond	O
all	O
the	O
ports	O
of	O
China	PNM
where	O
our	O
European	O
ships	O
usually	O
come	O

being	O
resolved	O

if	O
possible	O

not	O
to	O
fall	O
into	O
any	O
of	O
their	O
hands	O

in	O
this	O
country	O

where	O
,	O
as	O
our	O
circumstances	O
were	O

we	O
could	O
not	O

of	O
being	O
entirely	O

Being	O
now	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
30	O

we	O
resolved	O
to	O

into	O
the	O
first	O

should	O
come	O
at	O
;	O
and	O
standing	O
in	O
for	O
the	O
shore	O

a	O
boat	O
came	O
of	O
two	O

to	O
us	O
with	O
an	O
old	O
Portuguese	O
pilot	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
knowing	O
us	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
European	O
ship	O
,	O
came	O
to	O
offer	O
his	O
service	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
glad	O
of	O
and	O
took	O
him	O
on	O
board	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
,	O
without	O
asking	O
us	O
whither	O
we	O
would	O
go	O
,	O
he	O
dismissed	O
the	O
boat	O
he	O
came	O
in	O

sent	O
it	O
back	O

I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
now	O
so	O
much	O
in	O
our	O
choice	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
carry	O
us	O
whither	O
we	O
would	O

that	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
talk	O
to	O
him	O
about	O
carrying	O
us	O
to	O
the	O
Gulf	PNM

which	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
northern	O

he	O
knew	O
the	O

of	O
Nankin	O
very	O
well	O
;	O

smiling	O
,	O
asked	O
us	O
what	O
we	O
would	O
do	O
there	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
we	O
would	O
sell	O

so	O
we	O
would	O

the	O

told	O
us	O
our	O

to	O
put	O
in	O
at	O

failed	O
of	O
a	O

he	O
was	O

I	O
might	O

be	O
in	O
no	O

told	O
me	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
sail	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
about	O
forty-two	O
leagues	O

there	O
was	O
a	O

this	O
I	O
remember	O

that	O
the	O

it	O

we	O

it	O
bewildered	O
our	O

set	O
the	O

to	O
form	O
a	O
thousand	O
terrible	O
things	O
that	O
perhaps	O
might	O
never	O

We	O
first	O
supposed	O
,	O
as	O
indeed	O
everybody	O
had	O
related	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
seamen	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
English	O
and	O
Dutch	O
ships	O
,	O
but	O
especially	O
the	O
Dutch	O
,	O
were	O
so	O
enraged	O
at	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
a	O
pirate	O
,	O
and	O
especially	O
at	O
our	O
beating	O
off	O
their	O
boats	O
and	O
escaping	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
give	O
themselves	O
leave	O
to	O
inquire	O
whether	O
we	O
were	O
pirates	O
or	O
no	O
,	O
but	O
would	O
execute	O
us	O
off	O
-	O
hand	O
,	O
without	O
giving	O
us	O
any	O
room	O
for	O
a	O
defence	O
.	O

We	O
reflected	O
that	O
there	O
really	O
was	O
so	O
much	O
apparent	O
evidence	O
before	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
scarce	O
inquire	O
after	O
any	O
more	O
;	O
as	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
certainly	O
the	O
same	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
seamen	O
among	O
them	O
knew	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
been	O
on	O
board	O
her	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
secondly	O
,	O
that	O
when	O
we	O
had	O
intelligence	O
at	O
the	O
river	PNM
of	PNM
Cambodia	PNM
that	O
they	O
were	O
coming	O
down	O
to	O
examine	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
fought	O
their	O
boats	O
and	O
fled	O
.	O

Therefore	O
we	O
made	O
no	O
doubt	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
as	O
fully	O
satisfied	O
of	O
our	O
being	O
pirates	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
satisfied	O
of	O
the	O
contrary	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
often	O
said	O
,	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
but	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
apt	O
to	O
have	O
taken	O
those	O
circumstances	O
for	O
evidence	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
tables	O
were	O
turned	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
case	O
was	O
theirs	O
;	O
and	O
have	O
made	O
no	O
scruple	O
of	O
cutting	O
all	O
the	O
crew	O
to	O
pieces	O
,	O
without	O
believing	O

or	O
perhaps	O
considering	O

what	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
to	O

in	O
their	O
defence	O

let	O
that	O
be	O
how	O

I	O
was	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
fury	O
in	O
my	O
dream	O
,	O
fancying	O
the	O
Dutchmen	O
had	O
boarded	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
knocking	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
seamen	O
down	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
struck	O
my	O
doubled	O
fist	O
against	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
cabin	O
I	O
lay	O
in	O
with	O
such	O
a	O
force	O
as	O
wounded	O
my	O
hand	O
grievously	O
,	O
broke	O
my	O
knuckles	O
,	O
and	O
cut	O
and	O
bruised	O
the	O
flesh	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
awaked	O
me	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
sleep	O
.	O

Another	O
apprehension	O
I	O
had	O
was	O
,	O
the	O
cruel	O
usage	O
we	O
might	O
meet	O
with	O
from	O
them	O
if	O
we	O
fell	O
into	O
their	O
hands	O
;	O
then	O
the	O
story	O
of	O
Amboyna	PNM
came	O
into	O
my	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
the	O
Dutch	O
might	O
perhaps	O
torture	O
us	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
did	O
our	O
countrymen	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
by	O
extremity	O
of	O
torture	O
,	O
confess	O
to	O
crimes	O
they	O
never	O
were	O
guilty	O
of	O
,	O
or	O
own	O
themselves	O
and	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
to	O
be	O
pirates	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
they	O
would	O
put	O
us	O
to	O
death	O
with	O
a	O
formal	O
appearance	O
of	O
justice	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
tempted	O
to	O
do	O
this	O
for	O
the	O
gain	O
of	O
our	O
ship	O
and	O
cargo	O
,	O
worth	O
altogether	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
thousand	O
pounds	O
.	O

We	O
did	O
not	O
consider	O
that	O
the	O
captains	O
of	O
ships	O
have	O
no	O
authority	O
to	O
act	O
thus	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
surrendered	O
prisoners	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
answer	O
the	O
destroying	O
us	O
,	O
or	O
torturing	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
would	O
be	O
accountable	O
for	O
it	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
their	O
country	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
to	O
act	O
thus	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
what	O
advantage	O
would	O
it	O
be	O
to	O
us	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
called	O
to	O
an	O
account	O
for	O
it	O
?	O

--	O
or	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
first	O
to	O
be	O
murdered	O
,	O
what	O
satisfaction	O
would	O
it	O
be	O
to	O
us	O
to	O
have	O
them	O
punished	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
home	O
?	O

I	O
can	O
not	O
refrain	O
taking	O
notice	O
here	O
what	O
reflections	O
I	O
now	O
had	O
upon	O
the	O
vast	O
variety	O
of	O
my	O
particular	O
circumstances	O
;	O
how	O
hard	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
that	O
I	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
spent	O
forty	O
years	O
in	O
a	O
life	O
of	O
continual	O
difficulties	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
at	O
last	O
come	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
port	O
or	O
haven	O
which	O
all	O
men	O
drive	O
at	O
,	O
viz.	O
to	O
have	O
rest	O
and	O
plenty	O
,	O
should	O
be	O
a	O
volunteer	O
in	O
new	O
sorrows	O
by	O
my	O
own	O
unhappy	O
choice	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
escaped	O
so	O
many	O
dangers	O
in	O
my	O
youth	O
,	O
should	O
now	O
come	O
to	O
be	O
hanged	O
in	O
my	O
old	O
age	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
so	O
remote	O
a	O
place	O
,	O
for	O
a	O
crime	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
in	O
the	O
least	O
inclined	O
to	O
,	O
much	O
less	O
guilty	O
of	O
.	O

After	O
these	O
thoughts	O
something	O
of	O
religion	O
would	O
come	O
in	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
considering	O
that	O
this	O
seemed	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
disposition	O
of	O
immediate	O
Providence	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
ought	O
to	O
look	O
upon	O
it	O
and	O
submit	O
to	O
it	O
as	O
such	O
.	O

For	O
,	O
although	O
I	O
was	O
innocent	O
as	O
to	O
men	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
far	O
from	O
being	O
innocent	O
as	O
to	O
my	O
Maker	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
ought	O
to	O
look	O
in	O
and	O
examine	O
what	O
other	O
crimes	O
in	O
my	O
life	O
were	O
most	O
obvious	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
which	O
Providence	O
might	O
justly	O
inflict	O
this	O
punishment	O
as	O
a	O
retribution	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
I	O
ought	O
to	O
submit	O
to	O
this	O
,	O
just	O
as	O
I	O
would	O
to	O
a	O
shipwreck	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
pleased	O
God	O
to	O
have	O
brought	O
such	O
a	O
disaster	O
upon	O
me	O
.	O

In	O
its	O
turn	O
natural	O
courage	O
would	O
sometimes	O
take	O
its	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
talking	O
myself	O
up	O
to	O
vigorous	O
resolutions	O
;	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
taken	O
to	O
be	O
barbarously	O
used	O
by	O
a	O
parcel	O
of	O
merciless	O
wretches	O
in	O
cold	O
blood	O
;	O
that	O
it	O
were	O
much	O
better	O
to	O
have	O
fallen	O
into	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
were	O
sure	O
they	O
would	O
feast	O
upon	O
me	O
when	O
they	O
had	O
taken	O
me	O
,	O
than	O
those	O
who	O
would	O
perhaps	O
glut	O
their	O
rage	O
upon	O
me	O
by	O
inhuman	O
tortures	O
and	O
barbarities	O
;	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
,	O
I	O
always	O
resolved	O
to	O
die	O
fighting	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
gasp	O
,	O
and	O
why	O
should	O
I	O
not	O
do	O
so	O
now	O
?	O

Whenever	O
these	O
thoughts	O
prevailed	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
sure	O
to	O
put	O
myself	O
into	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
fever	O
with	O
the	O
agitation	O
of	O
a	O
supposed	O
fight	O
;	O
my	O
blood	O
would	O
boil	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
eyes	O
sparkle	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
engaged	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
always	O
resolved	O
to	O
take	O
no	O
quarter	O
at	O
their	O
hands	O

even	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
resist	O
no	O

I	O
would	O

up	O
the	O

CHAPTER	O

--	O
ARRIVAL	O
IN	O
CHINA	O
The	O
greater	O
weight	O
the	O
anxieties	O
and	O
perplexities	O
of	O
these	O
things	O
were	O
to	O
our	O
thoughts	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
sea	O
,	O
the	O
greater	O
was	O
our	O
satisfaction	O
when	O
we	O
saw	O
ourselves	O
on	O
shore	O
;	O
and	O
my	O
partner	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
dreamed	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
very	O
heavy	O
load	O
upon	O
his	O
back	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
to	O
carry	O
up	O
a	O
hill	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
stand	O
longer	O
under	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
pilot	O
came	O
and	O
took	O
it	O
off	O
his	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
hill	O
disappeared	O
,	O
the	O
ground	O
before	O
him	O
appearing	O
all	O
smooth	O
and	O
plain	O
:	O
and	O
truly	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
;	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
like	O
men	O
who	O
had	O
a	O
load	O
taken	O
off	O
their	O
backs	O
.	O

For	O
my	O
part	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
weight	O
taken	O
off	O
from	O
my	O
heart	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
able	O
any	O
longer	O
to	O
bear	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
above	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
no	O
more	O
to	O
sea	O
in	O
that	O
ship	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
the	O
old	O
pilot	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
now	O
our	O
friend	O
,	O
got	O
us	O
a	O
lodging	O
,	O
together	O
with	O
a	O
warehouse	O
for	O
our	O
goods	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
hut	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
larger	O
house	O
adjoining	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
built	O
and	O
also	O
palisadoed	O
round	O
with	O
canes	O
,	O
to	O
keep	O
out	O
pilferers	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
there	O
were	O
not	O
a	O
few	O
in	O
that	O
country	O
:	O
however	O
,	O
the	O
magistrates	O
allowed	O
us	O
a	O
little	O
guard	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
soldier	O
with	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
half-pike	O
,	O
who	O
stood	O
sentinel	O
at	O
our	O
door	O
,	O
to	O
whom	O
we	O
allowed	O
a	O
pint	O
of	O
rice	O
and	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
money	O
about	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
three-pence	O
per	O
day	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
our	O
goods	O
were	O
kept	O
very	O
safe	O
.	O

The	O
fair	O
or	O
mart	O
usually	O
kept	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
had	O
been	O
over	O
some	O
time	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
junks	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
ships	O
from	O
Japan	PNM
,	O
with	O
goods	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
bought	O
in	O
China	PNM
,	O
and	O
were	O
not	O
gone	O
away	O
,	O
having	O
some	O
Japanese	O
merchants	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
thing	O
our	O
old	O
Portuguese	O
pilot	O
did	O
for	O
us	O
was	O
to	O
get	O
us	O
acquainted	O
with	O
three	O
missionary	O
Romish	O
priests	O
who	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
town	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
there	O
some	O
time	O
converting	O
the	O
people	O
to	O
Christianity	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
thought	O
they	O
made	O
but	O
poor	O
work	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
them	O
but	O
sorry	O
Christians	O
when	O
they	O
had	O
done	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
these	O
was	O
a	O
Frenchman	O
,	O
whom	O
they	O
called	O
Father	PNM
Simon	PNM
;	O
another	O
was	O
a	O
Portuguese	O
;	O
and	O
a	O
third	O
a	O
Genoese	O
.	O

Father	O
Simon	O
was	O
courteous	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
agreeable	O
company	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
were	O
more	O
reserved	O
,	O
seemed	O
rigid	O
and	O
austere	O
,	O
and	O
applied	O
seriously	O
to	O
the	O
work	O
they	O
came	O
about	O
,	O
viz.	O
to	O
talk	O
with	O
and	O
insinuate	O
themselves	O
among	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
wherever	O
they	O
had	O
opportunity	O
.	O

We	O
often	O
ate	O
and	O
drank	O
with	O
those	O
men	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
I	O
must	O
confess	O
the	O
conversion	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
to	O
Christianity	PNM
is	O
so	O
far	O
from	O
the	O
true	O
conversion	O
required	O
to	O
bring	O
heathen	O
people	O
to	O
the	O
faith	O
of	O
Christ	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
amount	O
to	O
little	O
more	O
than	O
letting	O
them	O
know	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
Christ	O
,	O
and	O
say	O
some	O
prayers	O
to	O
the	O
Virgin	O
Mary	O
and	O
her	O
Son	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
tongue	O
which	O
they	O
understood	O
not	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
cross	O
themselves	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
like	O
;	O
yet	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
confessed	O
that	O
the	O
religionists	O
,	O
whom	O
we	O
call	O
missionaries	O
,	O
have	O
a	O
firm	O
belief	O
that	O
these	O
people	O
will	O
be	O
saved	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
the	O
instruments	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
on	O
this	O
account	O
they	O
undergo	O
not	O
only	O
the	O
fatigue	O
of	O
the	O
voyage	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
hazards	O
of	O
living	O
in	O
such	O
places	O
,	O
but	O
oftentimes	O
death	O
itself	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
most	O
violent	O
tortures	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
this	O
work	O
.	O

Father	O
Simon	O
was	O
appointed	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
by	O
order	O
of	O
the	O
chief	O
of	O
the	O
mission	O
,	O
to	O
go	O
up	O
to	O
Pekin	PNM
,	O
and	O
waited	O
only	O
for	O
another	O
priest	O

who	O
was	O
ordered	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
him	O
from	O
Macao	PNM
,	O
to	O
go	O
along	O
with	O
him	O
.	O

We	O
scarce	O
ever	O
met	O
together	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
inviting	O
me	O
to	O
go	O
that	O
journey	O
;	O
telling	O
me	O
how	O
he	O
would	O
show	O
me	O
all	O
the	O
glorious	O
things	O
of	O
that	O
mighty	O

to	O

were	O
now	O
in	O
a	O
place	O

little	O

Once	O
I	O
was	O
about	O
to	O
venture	O
to	O
sail	O
for	O
the	O
river	PNM
of	PNM
Kilam	PNM
,	O
and	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Nankin	PNM
;	O
but	O
Providence	O
seemed	O
now	O
more	O
visibly	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
than	O
ever	O
to	O
concern	O
itself	O
in	O
our	O
affairs	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
encouraged	O
,	O
from	O
this	O
very	O
time	O
,	O
to	O
think	O
I	O
should	O
,	O
one	O
way	O
or	O
other	O
,	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
this	O
entangled	O
circumstance	O

be	O
brought	O

again	O

I	O
had	O
not	O
the	O

view	O
of	O
the	O
manner	O

Providence	O
,	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
began	O
here	O
to	O
clear	O
up	O
our	O
way	O
a	O
little	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
that	O
offered	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
our	O
old	O
Portuguese	O
pilot	O
brought	O
a	O
Japan	O
merchant	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
who	O
inquired	O
what	O
goods	O
we	O
had	O
:	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
,	O
he	O
bought	O
all	O
our	O
opium	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
us	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
price	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
paying	O
us	O
in	O
gold	O
by	O
weight	O
,	O
some	O
in	O
small	O
pieces	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
coin	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
in	O
small	O
wedges	O
,	O
of	O
about	O
ten	O
or	O
twelves	O
ounces	O
each	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
were	O
dealing	O
with	O
him	O
for	O
our	O
opium	O
,	O
it	O
came	O
into	O
my	O
head	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
perhaps	O
deal	O
for	O
the	O
ship	O
too	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
interpreter	O
to	O
propose	O
it	O
to	O
him	O
.	O

He	O
shrunk	O
up	O
his	O
shoulders	O
at	O
it	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
first	O
proposed	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
after	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
with	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
missionary	O
priests	O
for	O
his	O
interpreter	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
proposal	O
to	O
make	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
this	O
:	O
he	O
had	O
bought	O
a	O
great	O
quantity	O
of	O
our	O
goods	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
thoughts	O
of	O
proposals	O
made	O
to	O
him	O
of	O
buying	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
money	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
the	O
ship	O
:	O
but	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
let	O
the	O
same	O
men	O
who	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
navigate	O
her	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
hire	O
the	O
ship	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Japan	PNM
;	O
and	O
would	O
send	O
them	O
from	O
thence	O
to	O
the	O
Philippine	PNM
Islands	PNM
with	O
another	O
loading	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
would	O
pay	O
the	O
freight	O
of	O
before	O
they	O
went	O
from	O
Japan	PNM
:	O
and	O
that	O
at	O
their	O
return	O
he	O
would	O
buy	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

I	O
began	O
to	O
listen	O
to	O
his	O
proposal	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
eager	O
did	O
my	O
head	O
still	O
run	O
upon	O
rambling	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
but	O
begin	O
to	O
entertain	O
a	O
notion	O
of	O
going	O
myself	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
to	O
set	O
sail	O
from	O
the	O
Philippine	PNM
Islands	PNM
away	O
to	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
;	O
accordingly	O
,	O
I	O
asked	O
the	O
Japanese	O
merchant	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
hire	O
us	O
to	O
the	O
Philippine	PNM
Islands	PNM
and	O
discharge	O
us	O
there	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
No	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
do	O
that	O
,	O
for	O
then	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
the	O
return	O
of	O
his	O
cargo	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
would	O
discharge	O
us	O
in	O
Japan	PNM
,	O
at	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
return	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
still	O
I	O
was	O
for	O
taking	O
him	O
at	O
that	O
proposal	O
,	O
and	O
going	O
myself	O
;	O
but	O
my	O
partner	O
,	O
wiser	O
than	O
myself	O
,	O
persuaded	O
me	O
from	O
it	O
,	O
representing	O
the	O
dangers	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
of	O
the	O
seas	O
as	O
of	O
the	O
Japanese	O
,	O
who	O
are	O
a	O
false	O
,	O
cruel	O
,	O
and	O
treacherous	O
people	O
;	O
likewise	O
those	O
of	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
at	O
the	O
Philippines	O
,	O
more	O
false	O
,	O
cruel	O
,	O
and	O
treacherous	O
than	O
they	O
.	O

But	O
to	O
bring	O
this	O
long	O
turn	O
of	O
our	O
affairs	O
to	O
a	O
conclusion	O
;	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
was	O
to	O
consult	O
with	O
the	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
his	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
know	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
willing	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Japan	PNM
.	O

While	O
I	O
was	O
doing	O
this	O
,	O
the	O
young	O
man	O
whom	O
my	O
nephew	O
had	O
left	O
with	O
me	O
as	O
my	O
companion	O
came	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
he	O
thought	O
that	O
voyage	O
promised	O
very	O
fair	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
prospect	O
of	O
advantage	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
would	O
be	O
very	O
glad	O
if	O
I	O
undertook	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
give	O
him	O
leave	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
go	O
as	O
a	O
merchant	O
,	O
or	O
as	O
I	O
pleased	O
to	O
order	O
him	O
;	O
that	O
if	O
ever	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
England	PNM
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
there	O
and	O
alive	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
render	O
me	O
a	O
faithful	O
account	O
of	O
his	O
success	O
,	O
which	O
should	O
be	O
as	O
much	O
mine	O
as	O
I	O
pleased	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
loath	O
to	O
part	O
with	O
him	O
;	O
but	O
considering	O
the	O
prospect	O
of	O
advantage	O
,	O
which	O
really	O
was	O
considerable	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
young	O
fellow	O
likely	O
to	O
do	O
well	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
inclined	O
to	O
let	O
him	O
go	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
I	O
would	O
consult	O
my	O

him	O
an	O
answer	O

they	O
believed	O
the	O

that	O
we	O

One	O

confessed	O

nothing	O

the	O
hopes	O

the	O

was	O

as	O
I	O

I	O
first	O

the	O

which	O
they	O

was	O
due	O

them	O
on	O

over	O

for	O
we	O
got	O
leave	O
to	O
travel	O
in	O
the	O
retinue	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
mandarins	O
,	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
viceroy	O
or	O
principal	O
magistrate	O
in	O
the	O
province	O
where	O
they	O
reside	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
take	O
great	O
state	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
travelling	O
with	O
great	O
attendance	O
,	O
and	O
great	O
homage	O
from	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
who	O
are	O
sometimes	O
greatly	O
impoverished	O
by	O
them	O
,	O
being	O
obliged	O
to	O
furnish	O
provisions	O
for	O
them	O
and	O
all	O
their	O
attendants	O
in	O
their	O
journeys	O
.	O

I	O
particularly	O
observed	O
in	O
our	O
travelling	O
with	O
his	O
baggage	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
we	O
received	O
sufficient	O
provisions	O
both	O
for	O
ourselves	O
and	O
our	O
horses	O
from	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
as	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
mandarin	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
everything	O
we	O
had	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
market	O
price	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
mandarin	O
's	O
steward	O
collected	O
it	O
duly	O
from	O
us	O
.	O

Thus	O
our	O
travelling	O
in	O
the	O
retinue	O
of	O
the	O
mandarin	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
act	O
of	O
kindness	O
,	O
was	O
not	O
such	O
a	O
mighty	O
favour	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
advantage	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
considering	O
there	O
were	O
above	O
thirty	O
other	O
people	O
travelled	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
manner	O
besides	O
us	O
,	O
under	O
the	O
protection	O
of	O
his	O
retinue	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
country	O
furnished	O
all	O
the	O
provisions	O
for	O
nothing	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
he	O
took	O
our	O
money	O
for	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
twenty-five	O
days	O
travelling	O
to	O
Pekin	PNM
,	O
through	O
a	O
country	O
exceeding	O
populous	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
think	O
badly	O
cultivated	O
;	O
the	O
husbandry	O
,	O
the	O
economy	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
living	O
miserable	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
boast	O
so	O
much	O
of	O
the	O
industry	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
:	O
I	O
say	O
miserable	O
,	O
if	O
compared	O
with	O
our	O
own	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
so	O
to	O
these	O
poor	O
wretches	O
,	O
who	O
know	O
no	O
other	O
.	O

The	O
pride	O
of	O
the	O
poor	O
people	O
is	O
infinitely	O
great	O
,	O
and	O
exceeded	O
by	O
nothing	O
but	O
their	O
poverty	O
,	O
in	O
some	O
parts	O
,	O
which	O
adds	O
to	O
that	O
which	O
I	O
call	O
their	O
misery	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
must	O
needs	O
think	O
the	O
savages	O
of	O
America	PNM
live	O
much	O
more	O
happy	O
than	O
the	O
poorer	O
sort	O
of	O
these	O
,	O
because	O
as	O
they	O
have	O
nothing	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
desire	O
nothing	O
;	O
whereas	O
these	O
are	O
proud	O
and	O
insolent	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
main	O
are	O
in	O
many	O
parts	O
mere	O
beggars	O
and	O
drudges	O
.	O

Their	O
ostentation	O
is	O
inexpressible	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
can	O
,	O
they	O
love	O
to	O
keep	O
multitudes	O
of	O
servants	O
or	O
slaves	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
degree	O
ridiculous	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
their	O
contempt	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
world	O
but	O
themselves	O
.	O

I	O
must	O
confess	O
I	O
travelled	O
more	O
pleasantly	O
afterwards	O
in	O
the	O
deserts	O
and	O
vast	O
wildernesses	O
of	O
Grand	PNM
Tartary	PNM
than	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
the	O
roads	O
here	O
are	O
well	O
paved	O
and	O
well	O
kept	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
convenient	O
for	O
travellers	O
;	O
but	O
nothing	O
was	O
more	O
awkward	O
to	O
me	O
than	O
to	O
see	O
such	O
a	O
haughty	O
,	O
imperious	O
,	O
insolent	O
people	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
midst	O
of	O
the	O
grossest	O
simplicity	O
and	O
ignorance	O
;	O
and	O
my	O
friend	O
Father	O
Simon	O
and	O
I	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
merry	O
upon	O
these	O
occasions	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
their	O
beggarly	O
pride	O
.	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
coming	O
by	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
a	O
country	O
gentleman	O
,	O
as	O
Father	O
Simon	O
called	O
him	O
,	O
about	O
ten	O
leagues	O
off	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Nankin	PNM
,	O
we	O
had	O
first	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
honour	O
to	O
ride	O
with	O
the	O
master	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
about	O
two	O
miles	O
;	O
the	O
state	O
he	O
rode	O
in	O
was	O
a	O
perfect	O
Don	O
Quixotism	O
,	O
being	O
a	O
mixture	O
of	O
pomp	O
and	O
poverty	O
.	O

His	O
habit	O
was	O
very	O
proper	O
for	O
a	O
merry-andrew	O
,	O
being	O
a	O
dirty	O
calico	O
,	O
with	O
hanging	O
sleeves	O
,	O
tassels	O
,	O
and	O
cuts	O
and	O
slashes	O
almost	O
on	O
every	O
side	O
:	O
it	O
covered	O
a	O
taffety	O
vest	O
,	O
so	O
greasy	O
as	O
to	O
testify	O
that	O
his	O
honour	O
must	O
be	O
a	O
most	O
exquisite	O
sloven	O
.	O

His	O
horse	O
was	O
a	O
poor	O
,	O
starved	O
,	O
hobbling	O
creature	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
slaves	O
followed	O
him	O
on	O
foot	O
to	O
drive	O
the	O
poor	O
creature	O
along	O
;	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
whip	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
belaboured	O
the	O
beast	O
as	O
fast	O
about	O
the	O
head	O
as	O
his	O
slaves	O
did	O
about	O
the	O
tail	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
he	O
rode	O
by	O
us	O
,	O
with	O
about	O
ten	O
or	O
twelve	O
servants	O
,	O
going	O
from	O
the	O
city	O
to	O
his	O
country	O
seat	O
,	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
league	O
before	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
travelled	O
on	O
gently	O
,	O
but	O
this	O
figure	O
of	O
a	O
gentleman	O
rode	O
away	O
before	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
stopped	O
at	O
a	O
village	O
about	O
an	O
hour	O
to	O
refresh	O
us	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
by	O
the	O
country	O
seat	O
of	O
this	O
great	O
man	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
him	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
place	O
before	O
his	O
door	O
,	O
eating	O
a	O
repast	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
garden	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
easy	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
given	O
to	O
understand	O
that	O
the	O
more	O
we	O
looked	O
at	O
him	O
the	O
better	O
he	O
would	O
be	O
pleased	O
.	O

He	O
sat	O
under	O
a	O
tree	O
,	O
something	O
like	O
the	O
palmetto	O
,	O
which	O
effectually	O
shaded	O
him	O
over	O
the	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
south	O
side	O
;	O
but	O
under	O
the	O
tree	O
was	O
placed	O
a	O
large	O
umbrella	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
that	O
part	O
look	O
well	O
enough	O
.	O

He	O
sat	O
lolling	O
back	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
elbow-chair	O
,	O
being	O
a	O
heavy	O
corpulent	O
man	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
his	O
meat	O
brought	O
him	O
by	O
two	O
women	O
slaves	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
two	O
more	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
whom	O
fed	O
the	O
squire	O
with	O
a	O
spoon	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
held	O
the	O
dish	O
with	O
one	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
scraped	O
off	O
what	O
he	O
let	O
fall	O
upon	O
his	O
worship	O
's	O
beard	O
and	O
taffety	O

Leaving	O
the	O
poor	O
wretch	O
to	O
please	O
himself	O
with	O
our	O
looking	O
at	O
him	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
we	O
admired	O
his	O
idle	O
pomp	O
,	O
we	O
pursued	O
our	O
journey	O
.	O

Father	O
Simon	O
had	O
the	O
curiosity	O
to	O
stay	O
to	O
inform	O
himself	O
what	O
dainties	O
the	O
country	O
justice	O
had	O
to	O
feed	O
on	O
in	O
all	O
his	O

which	O
he	O
had	O
the	O
honour	O
to	O
taste	O
of	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
was	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
a	O
mess	O
of	O
boiled	O
rice	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
piece	O
of	O
garlic	O
in	O
it	O

a	O

another	O

which	O
they	O

there	O

something	O

our	O

but	O
smelling	O
like	O
musk	O

and	O
tasting	O
like	O
mustard	O
;	O
all	O
this	O
was	O
put	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
small	O
piece	O
of	O
lean	O
mutton	O
boiled	O
in	O
it	O

and	O
this	O
was	O
his	O
worship	O

Four	O
or	O
five	O

at	O

who	O
we	O
supposed	O
were	O
to	O
eat	O
of	O
the	O

As	O
for	O
our	O
mandarin	O
with	O
whom	O
we	O
travelled	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
respected	O
as	O
a	O
king	O

surrounded	O
always	O
with	O
his	O
gentlemen	O

and	O
attended	O
in	O
all	O
his	O
appearances	O
with	O
such	O

that	O
I	O
saw	O
little	O
of	O
him	O
but	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O

I	O
observed	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
horse	O
in	O
his	O
retinue	O
but	O
that	O
our	O
carrier	O
's	O
packhorses	O
in	O
England	PNM
seemed	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
look	O
much	O
better	O
;	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
hard	O
to	O
judge	O
rightly	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
covered	O
with	O
equipage	O

mantles	O

&	O
c.	O

that	O
we	O

anything	O

their	O
feet	O
and	O
their	O
heads	O
as	O
they	O
went	O
along	O

I	O
was	O

light-hearted	O

and	O
all	O
my	O

no	O

it	O
wetted	O

two	O

the	O

I	O

famous	O
in	O

the	O

here	O

the	O
necessity	O

together	O

a	O
caravan	O

we	O
travelled	O

for	O

when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O

them	O

I	O
wondered	O
more	O
that	O
the	O
Chinese	O
empire	O

be	O
conquered	O

this	O

them	O

Our	O

for	O

for	O
about	O
sixteen	O
of	O
us	O
to	O
go	O
a	O
hunting	O
as	O
they	O
call	O
it	O

what	O
was	O
this	O

a	O

of	O
sheep	O

it	O
may	O

too	O

these	O

the	O
wildest	O

swiftest	O
of	O

that	O
ever	O
I	O
saw	O
of	O
their	O

only	O

you	O

of	O

of	O
this	O
odd	O
sort	O
of	O

it	O
was	O
our	O
hap	O
to	O
meet	O
with	O
about	O
forty	O
Tartars	O
:	O
whether	O

were	O

mutton	O

us	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
but	O
to	O
charge	O
them	O
without	O
loss	O
of	O
time	O
;	O
and	O
drawing	O
us	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
line	O
,	O
he	O
asked	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
resolved	O
.	O

We	O
told	O
him	O
we	O
were	O
ready	O
to	O
follow	O
him	O
;	O
so	O
he	O
rode	O
directly	O
towards	O
them	O
.	O

They	O
stood	O
gazing	O
at	O
us	O
like	O
a	O
mere	O
crowd	O
,	O
drawn	O
up	O
in	O
no	O
sort	O
of	O
order	O
at	O
all	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
saw	O
us	O
advance	O
,	O
they	O
let	O
fly	O
their	O
arrows	O
,	O
which	O
missed	O
us	O
,	O
very	O
happily	O
.	O

Not	O
that	O
they	O
mistook	O
their	O
aim	O
,	O
but	O
their	O
distance	O
;	O
for	O
their	O
arrows	O
all	O
fell	O
a	O
little	O
short	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
with	O
so	O
true	O
an	O
aim	O
,	O
that	O
had	O
we	O
been	O
about	O
twenty	O
yards	O
nearer	O
we	O
must	O
have	O
had	O
several	O
men	O
wounded	O
,	O
if	O
not	O
killed	O
.	O

Immediately	O
we	O
halted	O
,	O
and	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
,	O
we	O
fired	O
,	O
and	O
sent	O
them	O
leaden	O
bullets	O
for	O
wooden	O
arrows	O
,	O
following	O
our	O
shot	O
full	O
gallop	O
,	O
to	O
fall	O
in	O
among	O
them	O
sword	O
in	O
hand	O
--	O
for	O
so	O
our	O
bold	O
Scot	O
that	O
led	O
us	O
directed	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
merchant	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
behaved	O
with	O
such	O
vigour	O
and	O
bravery	O
on	O
this	O
occasion	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
with	O
such	O
cool	O
courage	O
too	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
never	O
saw	O
any	O
man	O
in	O
action	O
fitter	O
for	O
command	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
came	O
up	O
to	O
them	O
we	O
fired	O
our	O
pistols	O
in	O
their	O
faces	O
and	O
then	O
drew	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
fled	O
in	O
the	O
greatest	O
confusion	O
imaginable	O
.	O

The	O
only	O
stand	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
made	O
was	O
on	O
our	O
right	O
,	O
where	O
three	O
of	O
them	O
stood	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
by	O
signs	O
,	O
called	O
the	O
rest	O
to	O
come	O
back	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
having	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
scimitar	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
bows	O
hanging	O
to	O
their	O
backs	O

Our	O
brave	O
commander	O
,	O
without	O
asking	O
anybody	O
to	O
follow	O
him	O
,	O
gallops	O
up	O
close	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
his	O
fusee	O
knocks	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
off	O
his	O
horse	O
,	O
killed	O
the	O
second	O
with	O
his	O
pistol	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
third	O
ran	O
away	O
.	O

Thus	O
ended	O
our	O
fight	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
had	O
this	O
misfortune	O
attending	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
all	O
our	O
mutton	O
we	O
had	O
in	O
chase	O
got	O
away	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
not	O
a	O
man	O
killed	O
or	O
hurt	O
;	O
as	O
for	O
the	O
Tartars	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
about	O
five	O
of	O
them	O
killed	O
--	O
how	O
many	O
were	O
wounded	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
we	O
knew	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
other	O
party	O
were	O
so	O
frightened	O
with	O
the	O
noise	O
of	O
our	O
guns	O
that	O
they	O
fled	O
,	O
and	O
never	O
made	O
any	O
attempt	O
upon	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
all	O
this	O
while	O
in	O
the	O
Chinese	O
dominions	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
the	O
Tartars	O
were	O
not	O
so	O
bold	O
as	O
afterwards	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
about	O
five	O
days	O
we	O
entered	O
a	O
vast	O
wild	O
desert	O
,	O
which	O
held	O
us	O
three	O
days	O
'	O
and	O
nights	O
'	O
march	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
carry	O
our	O
water	O
with	O
us	O
in	O
great	O
leathern	O
bottles	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
encamp	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
just	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
heard	O
they	O
do	O
in	O
the	O
desert	O
of	O
Arabia	PNM
.	O

I	O
asked	O
our	O
guides	O
whose	O
dominion	O
this	O
was	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
told	O
me	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
border	O
that	O
might	O
be	O
called	O
no	O
man	O
's	O
land	O
,	O
being	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
Great	PNM
Karakathy	PNM
,	O
or	O
Grand	PNM
Tartary	PNM
:	O
that	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
all	O
reckoned	O
as	O
belonging	O
to	O
China	PNM
,	O
but	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
care	O
taken	O
here	O
to	O
preserve	O
it	O
from	O
the	O
inroads	O
of	O
thieves	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
it	O
was	O
reckoned	O
the	O
worst	O
desert	O
in	O
the	O
whole	O
march	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
go	O
over	O
some	O
much	O
larger	O
.	O

In	O
passing	O
this	O
frightful	O
wilderness	O
we	O
saw	O
,	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
times	O
,	O
little	O
parties	O
of	O
the	O
Tartars	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
upon	O
their	O
own	O
affairs	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
have	O
no	O
design	O
upon	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
man	O
who	O
met	O
the	O
devil	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
say	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
say	O
to	O
them	O
:	O
we	O
let	O
them	O
go	O
.	O

Once	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
a	O
party	O
of	O
them	O
came	O
so	O
near	O
as	O
to	O
stand	O
and	O
gaze	O
at	O
us	O
.	O

Whether	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
consider	O
if	O
they	O
should	O
attack	O
us	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
we	O
had	O
passed	O
at	O
some	O
distance	O
by	O
them	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
a	O
rear-guard	O
of	O
forty	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
ready	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
letting	O
the	O
caravan	O
pass	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
or	O
thereabouts	O
before	O
us	O
.	O

After	O
a	O
while	O
they	O
marched	O
off	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
saluted	O
us	O
with	O
five	O
arrows	O
at	O
their	O
parting	O
,	O
which	O
wounded	O
a	O
horse	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
disabled	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
left	O
him	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
poor	O
creature	O
,	O
in	O
great	O
need	O
of	O
a	O
good	O
farrier	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
no	O
more	O
arrows	O
or	O
Tartars	O
that	O
time	O
.	O

We	O
travelled	O
near	O
a	O
month	O
after	O
this	O
,	O
the	O
ways	O
not	O
being	O
so	O
good	O
as	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
though	O
still	O
in	O
the	O
dominions	O
of	O
the	O
Emperor	O
of	O
China	PNM
,	O
but	O
lay	O
for	O
the	O
most	O
part	O
in	O
the	O
villages	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
which	O
were	O
fortified	O
,	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
incursions	O
of	O
the	O
Tartars	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
were	O
come	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
towns	O
-LRB-	O
about	O
two	O
days	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
's	O
journey	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Naum	PNM
-RRB-	O
,	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
buy	O
a	O
camel	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
there	O
are	O
plenty	O
to	O
be	O
sold	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
upon	O
that	O
road	O
,	O
and	O
horses	O
also	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
they	O
are	O
,	O
because	O
,	O
so	O
many	O
caravans	O
coming	O
that	O
way	O
,	O
they	O
are	O
often	O
wanted	O
.	O

The	O
person	O
that	O
I	O
spoke	O
to	O
to	O
get	O
me	O
a	O
camel	O
would	O
have	O
gone	O
and	O
fetched	O
one	O
for	O
me	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
fool	O
,	O
must	O
be	O
officious	O
,	O
and	O
go	O
myself	O
along	O
with	O
him	O
;	O
the	O
place	O
was	O
about	O
two	O
miles	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
village	O
,	O
where	O
it	O
seems	O
they	O
kept	O
the	O
camels	O
and	O
horses	O
feeding	O
under	O
a	O
guard	O
.	O

I	O
walked	O
it	O
on	O
foot	O
,	O
with	O
my	O
old	O
pilot	O
and	O
a	O
Chinese	O
,	O
being	O
very	O
desirous	O
of	O
a	O
little	O
variety	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
low	O
,	O
marshy	O
ground	O
,	O
walled	O
round	O
with	O
stones	O
,	O
piled	O
up	O
dry	O
,	O
without	O
mortar	O
or	O
earth	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
park	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
little	O
guard	O
of	O
Chinese	O
soldiers	O
at	O
the	O
door	O

Having	O
bought	O
a	O
camel	O
,	O
and	O
agreed	O
for	O
the	O
price	O
,	O
I	O
came	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Chinese	O
that	O
went	O
with	O
me	O
led	O
the	O
camel	O
,	O
when	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
came	O
up	O
five	O
Tartars	O
on	O
horseback	O
.	O

Two	O
of	O
them	O
seized	O
the	O
fellow	O
and	O
took	O
the	O
camel	O
from	O
him	O
,	O
while	O
the	O
other	O
three	O
stepped	O
up	O
to	O
me	O
and	O
my	O
old	O
pilot	O
,	O
seeing	O
us	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
unarmed	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
weapon	O
about	O
me	O
but	O
my	O
sword	O
,	O
which	O
could	O
but	O
ill	O
defend	O
me	O
against	O
three	O
horsemen	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
that	O
came	O
up	O
stopped	O
short	O
upon	O
my	O
drawing	O
my	O
sword	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
are	O
arrant	O
cowards	O
;	O
but	O
a	O
second	O
,	O
coming	O
upon	O
my	O
left	O
,	O
gave	O
me	O
a	O
blow	O
on	O
the	O
head	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
never	O
felt	O
till	O
afterwards	O
,	O
and	O
wondered	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
myself	O
,	O
what	O
was	O
the	O
matter	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
laid	O
me	O
flat	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
;	O
but	O
my	O
never-failing	O
old	O
pilot	O
,	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
,	O
had	O
a	O
pistol	O
in	O
his	O
pocket	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
knew	O
nothing	O
of	O
,	O
nor	O
the	O
Tartars	O
either	O
:	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
,	O
I	O
suppose	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
attacked	O
us	O
,	O
for	O
cowards	O
are	O
always	O
boldest	O
when	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
danger	O
.	O

The	O
old	O
man	O
seeing	O
me	O
down	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
bold	O
heart	O
stepped	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
fellow	O
that	O
had	O
struck	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
laying	O
hold	O
of	O
his	O
arm	O
with	O
one	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
pulling	O
him	O
down	O
by	O
main	O
force	O
a	O
little	O
towards	O
him	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
other	O
shot	O
him	O
into	O
the	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
laid	O
him	O
dead	O
upon	O
the	O
spot	O
.	O

He	O
then	O
immediately	O
stepped	O
up	O
to	O
him	O
who	O
had	O
stopped	O
us	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
and	O
before	O
he	O
could	O
come	O
forward	O
again	O
,	O
made	O
a	O
blow	O
at	O
him	O
with	O
a	O
scimitar	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
always	O
wore	O
,	O
but	O
missing	O
the	O
man	O
,	O
struck	O
his	O
horse	O
in	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
his	O
head	O
,	O
cut	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
ears	O
off	O
by	O
the	O
root	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
slice	O
down	O
by	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
his	O
face	O
.	O

The	O
poor	O
beast	O
,	O
enraged	O
with	O
the	O
wound	O
,	O
was	O
no	O
more	O
to	O
be	O
governed	O
by	O
his	O
rider	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
fellow	O
sat	O
well	O
enough	O
too	O
,	O
but	O
away	O
he	O
flew	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
him	O
quite	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
pilot	O
's	O
reach	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
some	O
distance	O
,	O
rising	O
upon	O
his	O
hind	O
legs	O
,	O
threw	O
down	O
the	O
Tartar	O
,	O
and	O
fell	O
upon	O
him	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
interval	O
the	O
poor	O
Chinese	O
came	O
in	O
who	O
had	O
lost	O
the	O
camel	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
weapon	O
;	O
however	O

seeing	O
the	O
Tartar	O
down	O

his	O
horse	O
fallen	O
upon	O
him	O

away	O
he	O
runs	O
to	O
him	O

and	O
seizing	O
upon	O
an	O
ugly	O
weapon	O
he	O
had	O
by	O
his	O
side	O
,	O
something	O
like	O
a	O
pole-axe	O
,	O
he	O
wrenched	O
it	O
from	O
him	O

and	O
made	O
shift	O
to	O
knock	O
his	O
Tartarian	O
brains	O
out	O
with	O
it	O

But	O
my	O
old	O
man	O
had	O
the	O
third	O

to	O
deal	O
with	O
still	O

the	O

pilot	O

my	O
champion	O
I	O
called	O
him	O
afterwards	O
,	O
a	O
complete	O
victory	O
.	O

By	O
this	O
time	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
recovered	O
.	O

I	O
thought	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
first	O
began	O
to	O
wake	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
a	O
sweet	O
sleep	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
above	O
,	O
I	O
wondered	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
,	O
how	O
I	O
came	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
was	O
the	O
matter	O
.	O

A	O
few	O
moments	O
after	O
,	O
as	O
sense	O
returned	O
,	O
I	O
felt	O
pain	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
where	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
clapped	O
my	O
hand	O
to	O
my	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
it	O
away	O
bloody	O
;	O
then	O
I	O
felt	O
my	O
head	O
ache	O
:	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
moment	O
memory	O
returned	O
,	O
and	O
everything	O
was	O
present	O
to	O
me	O
again	O
.	O

I	O
jumped	O
upon	O
my	O
feet	O
instantly	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
hold	O
of	O
my	O
sword	O
,	O
but	O
no	O
enemies	O
were	O
in	O
view	O
:	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
Tartar	O
lying	O
dead	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
horse	O
standing	O
very	O
quietly	O
by	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
looking	O
further	O
,	O
I	O
saw	O
my	O
deliverer	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
the	O
Chinese	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
coming	O
back	O
with	O
his	O
hanger	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
.	O

The	O
old	O
man	O
,	O
seeing	O
me	O
on	O
my	O
feet	O
,	O
came	O
running	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
joyfully	O
embraced	O
me	O
,	O
being	O
afraid	O
before	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
killed	O
.	O

Seeing	O
me	O
bloody	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
see	O
how	O
I	O
was	O
hurt	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
much	O
,	O
only	O
what	O
we	O
call	O
a	O
broken	O
head	O
;	O
neither	O
did	O
I	O
afterwards	O
find	O
any	O
great	O
inconvenience	O
from	O
the	O
blow	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
well	O
again	O
in	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
.	O

We	O
made	O
no	O
great	O
gain	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
by	O
this	O
victory	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
lost	O
a	O
camel	O
and	O
gained	O
a	O
horse	O
.	O

I	O
paid	O
for	O
the	O
lost	O
camel	O
,	O
and	O
sent	O
for	O
another	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
go	O
to	O
fetch	O
it	O
myself	O
:	O
I	O
had	O
had	O
enough	O
of	O
that	O
.	O

The	O
city	O
of	O
Naum	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
approaching	O
,	O
is	O
a	O
frontier	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
empire	O
,	O
and	O
is	O
fortified	O
in	O
their	O
fashion	O
.	O

We	O
wanted	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
above	O
two	O
days	O
'	O
journey	O
of	O
this	O
city	O
when	O
messengers	O
were	O
sent	O
express	O
to	O
every	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
road	O
to	O
tell	O
all	O
travellers	O
and	O
caravans	O
to	O
halt	O
till	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
guard	O
sent	O
for	O
them	O
;	O
for	O
that	O
an	O
unusual	O
body	O
of	O
Tartars	O
,	O
making	O
ten	O
thousand	O
in	O
all	O
,	O
had	O
appeared	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
about	O
thirty	O
miles	O
beyond	O
the	O
city	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
very	O
bad	O
news	O
to	O
travellers	O
:	O
however	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
carefully	O
done	O
of	O
the	O
governor	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
glad	O
to	O
hear	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
a	O
guard	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
two	O
days	O
after	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
two	O
hundred	O
soldiers	O
sent	O
us	O
from	O
a	O
garrison	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
on	O
our	O
left	O
,	O
and	O
three	O
hundred	O
more	O
from	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Naum	PNM
,	O
and	O
with	O
these	O
we	O
advanced	O
boldly	O
.	O

The	O
three	O
hundred	O
soldiers	O
from	O
Naum	PNM
marched	O
in	O
our	O
front	O
,	O
the	O
two	O
hundred	O
in	O
our	O
rear	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
on	O

side	O
of	O
our	O

with	O
our	O
baggage	O
and	O
the	O
whole	O
caravan	O
in	O
the	O
centre	O
;	O
in	O
this	O
order	O
,	O
and	O
well	O
prepared	O
for	O
battle	O
,	O
we	O
thought	O
ourselves	O
a	O
match	O
for	O
the	O
whole	O
ten	O
thousand	O
Mogul	O

,	O
if	O
they	O

;	O
but	O
the	O
next	O

DESCRIPTION	O
OF	O
AN	O
IDOL	O
,	O
WHICH	O
THEY	O
DESTROY	O
Early	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
when	O
marching	O
from	O
a	O
little	O
town	O
called	O
Changu	PNM
,	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
river	O
to	O
pass	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
ferry	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
had	O
the	O
Tartars	O
had	O
any	O
intelligence	O
,	O
then	O
had	O
been	O
the	O
time	O
to	O
have	O
attacked	O
us	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
caravan	O
being	O
over	O
,	O
the	O
rear-guard	O
was	O
behind	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
appear	O
there	O
.	O

About	O
three	O
hours	O
after	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
entered	O
upon	O
a	O
desert	O
of	O
about	O
fifteen	O
or	O
sixteen	O
miles	O
over	O
,	O
we	O
knew	O
by	O
a	O
cloud	O
of	O
dust	O
they	O
raised	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
enemy	O
was	O
at	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
presently	O
they	O
came	O
on	O
upon	O
the	O
spur	O

Our	O
Chinese	O
guards	O
in	O
the	O
front	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
talked	O
so	O
big	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
stagger	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
soldiers	O
frequently	O
looked	O
behind	O
them	O
,	O
a	O
certain	O
sign	O
in	O
a	O
soldier	O
that	O
he	O
is	O
just	O
ready	O
to	O
run	O
away	O

My	O
old	O

was	O
of	O
my	O
mind	O

and	O
being	O
near	O
me	O

Immediately	O
I	O
rode	O
up	O
to	O
our	O
leader	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
exactly	O
of	O
our	O
mind	O
;	O
accordingly	O
,	O
fifty	O
of	O
us	O
marched	O
to	O
the	O
right	O
wing	O

and	O
fifty	O
to	O
the	O
left	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
rest	O
made	O
a	O
line	O
of	O

so	O
we	O
marched	O

leaving	O
the	O

two	O

men	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
body	O
of	O
themselves	O

to	O
guard	O
the	O
camels	O

only	O
that	O

if	O

,	O
they	O
should	O
send	O
a	O
hundred	O
men	O
to	O
assist	O
the	O
last	O
fifty	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
the	O
Tartars	O
came	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
an	O
innumerable	O
company	O
they	O
were	O
;	O
how	O
many	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
,	O
but	O
ten	O
thousand	O
,	O
we	O
thought	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
least	O
.	O

A	O
party	O
of	O
them	O
came	O
on	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
viewed	O
our	O
posture	O
,	O
traversing	O
the	O
ground	O
in	O
the	O
front	O
of	O
our	O
line	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
found	O
them	O
within	O
gunshot	O
,	O
our	O
leader	O
ordered	O
the	O
two	O
wings	O
to	O
advance	O
swiftly	O
,	O
and	O
give	O
them	O
a	O
salvo	O
on	O
each	O
wing	O
with	O
their	O
shot	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
done	O
.	O

They	O
then	O
went	O
off	O
,	O
I	O
suppose	O
to	O
give	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
reception	O
they	O
were	O
like	O
to	O
meet	O
with	O
;	O
indeed	O
,	O
that	O
salute	O
cloyed	O
their	O
stomachs	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
immediately	O
halted	O
,	O
stood	O
a	O
while	O
to	O
consider	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
wheeling	O
off	O
to	O
the	O
left	O
,	O
they	O
gave	O
over	O
their	O
design	O
for	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
very	O
agreeable	O
to	O
our	O
circumstances	O
.	O

Two	O
days	O
after	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Naun	PNM
,	O
or	O
Naum	O
;	O
we	O
thanked	O
the	O
governor	O
for	O
his	O
care	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
collected	O
to	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
a	O
hundred	O
crowns	O
,	O
or	O
thereabouts	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
gave	O
to	O
the	O
soldiers	O
sent	O
to	O
guard	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
here	O
we	O
rested	O
one	O
day	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
garrison	O
indeed	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
were	O
nine	O
hundred	O
soldiers	O
kept	O
here	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
reason	O
of	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
formerly	O
the	O
Muscovite	O
frontiers	O
lay	O
nearer	O
to	O
them	O
than	O
they	O
now	O
do	O
,	O
the	O
Muscovites	O
having	O
abandoned	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
which	O
lies	O
from	O
this	O
city	O
west	O
for	O
about	O
two	O
hundred	O
miles	O
,	O
as	O
desolate	O
and	O
unfit	O
for	O
use	O
;	O
and	O
more	O
especially	O
being	O
so	O
very	O
remote	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
difficult	O
to	O
send	O
troops	O
thither	O
for	O
its	O
defence	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
yet	O
above	O
two	O
thousand	O
miles	O
from	O
Muscovy	PNM
properly	O
so	O
called	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
we	O
passed	O
several	O
great	O
rivers	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
dreadful	O
deserts	O
;	O
one	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
sixteen	O
days	O
passing	O
over	O
;	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
13th	O
of	O
April	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
frontiers	O
of	O
the	O
Muscovite	O
dominions	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
the	O
first	O
town	O
or	O
fortress	O
,	O
whichever	O
it	O
may	O
he	O
called	O
,	O
that	O
belonged	O
to	O
the	O
Czar	O
,	O
was	O
called	O
Arguna	PNM
,	O
being	O
on	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
Arguna	PNM
.	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
but	O
feel	O
great	O
satisfaction	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
arrived	O
in	O
a	O
country	O
governed	O
by	O
Christians	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
the	O
Muscovites	O
do	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
,	O
but	O
just	O
deserve	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
Christians	O
,	O
yet	O
such	O
they	O
pretend	O
to	O
be	O
,	O
and	O
are	O
very	O
devout	O
in	O
their	O
way	O
.	O

It	O
would	O
certainly	O
occur	O
to	O
any	O
reflecting	O
man	O
who	O
travels	O
the	O
world	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
done	O
,	O
what	O
a	O
blessing	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
brought	O
into	O
the	O
world	O
where	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
God	O
and	O
a	O
Redeemer	O
is	O
known	O
,	O
adored	O
,	O
and	O
worshipped	O
;	O
and	O
not	O
where	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
given	O
up	O
to	O
strong	O
delusions	O
,	O
worship	O
the	O
devil	O
,	O
and	O
prostrate	O
themselves	O
to	O
monsters	O
,	O
elements	O
,	O
horrid	O

shaped	O
animals	O
,	O
and	O
monstrous	O
images	O
.	O

Not	O
a	O
town	O
or	O
city	O
we	O
passed	O
through	O
but	O
had	O
their	O
pagodas	O
,	O
their	O
idols	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
temples	O
,	O
and	O
ignorant	O
people	O
worshipping	O
even	O
the	O
works	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
hands	O

Now	O
we	O
came	O
where	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
,	O
a	O
face	O
of	O
the	O
Christian	O
worship	O
appeared	O
;	O
where	O
the	O
knee	O
was	O
bowed	O
to	O
Jesus	PNM
:	O
and	O
whether	O
ignorantly	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
Christian	O
religion	O
was	O
owned	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
the	O
true	O
God	O
was	O
called	O
upon	O
and	O
adored	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
made	O
my	O
soul	O
rejoice	O
to	O
see	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
saluted	O
the	O
brave	O
Scots	O
merchant	O
with	O
my	O
first	O
acknowledgment	O
of	O
this	O
;	O
and	O
taking	O
him	O
by	O
the	O

I	O
said	O

him	O

``	O

Some	O
instances	O
of	O
this	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
in	O

In	O
a	O
village	O
near	O
the	O
last	O
of	O
these	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
curiosity	O
to	O

their	O
way	O
of	O
living	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
most	O
brutish	O
and	O
unsufferable	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
,	O
I	O
suppose	O
,	O
a	O
great	O
sacrifice	O
that	O
day	O
;	O
for	O
there	O
stood	O
out	O
,	O
upon	O
an	O
old	O
stump	O
of	O
a	O
tree	O
,	O
a	O
diabolical	O
kind	O
of	O
idol	O
made	O
of	O
wood	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
dressed	O
up	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
filthy	O
manner	O
;	O
its	O
upper	O
garment	O
was	O
of	O
sheepskins	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
wool	O
outward	O
;	O
a	O
great	O
Tartar	O
bonnet	O
on	O
the	O
head	O
,	O
with	O
two	O
horns	O
growing	O
through	O
it	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
about	O
eight	O
feet	O
high	O

yet	O
had	O
no	O
feet	O

This	O

set	O
up	O
at	O
the	O
outer	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
village	O
;	O

when	O
I	O
came	O

it	O
there	O
were	O
sixteen	O

seventeen	O
creatures	O
all	O
lying	O
flat	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
round	O
this	O
hideous	O
block	O
of	O
wood	O
;	O
I	O
saw	O
no	O
motion	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
any	O
more	O
than	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
all	O
logs	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
idol	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
first	O
I	O
really	O
thought	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
a	O
little	O
nearer	O
,	O
they	O
started	O
up	O
upon	O
their	O
feet	O
,	O
and	O
raised	O
a	O
howl	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
many	O
deep-mouthed	O
hounds	O
,	O
and	O
walked	O
away	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
displeased	O
at	O
our	O
disturbing	O
them	O
.	O

A	O
little	O
way	O
off	O
from	O
the	O
idol	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
door	O
of	O
a	O
hut	O
,	O
made	O
of	O
sheep	O
and	O
cow	O
skins	O
dried	O
,	O
stood	O
three	O
men	O
with	O
long	O
knives	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
tent	O
appeared	O
three	O
sheep	O
killed	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
young	O
bullock	O
.	O

These	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
were	O
sacrifices	O
to	O
that	O
senseless	O
log	O
of	O
an	O
idol	O
;	O
the	O
three	O
men	O
were	O
priests	O
belonging	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
seventeen	O
prostrated	O
wretches	O
were	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
brought	O
the	O
offering	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
offering	O
their	O
prayers	O
to	O
that	O
stock	O
.	O

I	O
confess	O
I	O
was	O
more	O
moved	O
at	O
their	O
stupidity	O
and	O
brutish	O
worship	O
of	O
a	O
hobgoblin	O
than	O
ever	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
anything	O
in	O
my	O
life	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
overcome	O
with	O
rage	O
,	O
I	O
rode	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
hideous	O
idol	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
my	O
sword	O
made	O
a	O
stroke	O
at	O
the	O
bonnet	O
that	O
was	O
on	O
its	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
cut	O
it	O
in	O
two	O
;	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
that	O
was	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
taking	O
hold	O
of	O
the	O
sheepskin	O
that	O
covered	O
it	O
,	O
pulled	O
at	O
it	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
behold	O
,	O
a	O
most	O
hideous	O
outcry	O
ran	O
through	O
the	O
village	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
hundred	O
people	O
came	O
about	O
my	O
ears	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
glad	O
to	O
scour	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
some	O
had	O
bows	O
and	O
arrows	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
resolved	O
from	O
that	O
moment	O
to	O
visit	O
them	O
again	O
.	O

Our	O
caravan	O
rested	O
three	O
nights	O
at	O
the	O
town	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
about	O
four	O
miles	O
off	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
provide	O
some	O
horses	O
which	O
they	O
wanted	O
,	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
horses	O
having	O
been	O
lamed	O
and	O
jaded	O
with	O
the	O
long	O
march	O
over	O
the	O
last	O
desert	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
had	O
some	O
leisure	O
here	O
to	O
put	O
my	O
design	O
in	O
execution	O
.	O

I	O
communicated	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
Scots	O
merchant	O
,	O
of	O
whose	O
courage	O
I	O
had	O
sufficient	O
testimony	O
;	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
what	O
indignation	O
I	O
had	O
since	O
thought	O
that	O
human	O
nature	O
could	O
be	O
so	O
degenerate	O
;	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
get	O
but	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
men	O
well	O
armed	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
destroy	O
that	O
vile	O
,	O
abominable	O
idol	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
them	O
see	O
that	O
it	O
had	O
no	O
power	O
to	O
help	O
itself	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
an	O
object	O
of	O
worship	O
,	O
or	O
to	O
be	O
prayed	O
to	O
,	O
much	O
less	O
help	O
them	O
that	O
offered	O
sacrifices	O
to	O
it	O
.	O

He	O
at	O
first	O
objected	O
to	O
my	O
plan	O
as	O
useless	O
,	O
seeing	O
that	O
,	O
owing	O
to	O
the	O
gross	O
ignorance	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
brought	O
to	O
profit	O
by	O
the	O
lesson	O
I	O
meant	O
to	O
teach	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
added	O
that	O
,	O
from	O
his	O
knowledge	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
and	O
its	O
customs	O
,	O
he	O
feared	O
we	O
should	O
fall	O
into	O
great	O
peril	O
by	O
giving	O
offence	O
to	O
these	O
brutal	O
idol	O
worshippers	O
.	O

This	O
somewhat	O
stayed	O
my	O
purpose	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
still	O
uneasy	O
all	O
that	O
day	O
to	O
put	O
my	O
project	O
in	O
execution	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
evening	O
,	O
meeting	O
the	O
Scots	O
merchant	O
in	O
our	O
walk	O
about	O
the	O
town	O
,	O
I	O
again	O
called	O
upon	O
him	O
to	O
aid	O
me	O
in	O
it	O
.	O

When	O
he	O
found	O
me	O
resolute	O
he	O
said	O
that	O
,	O
on	O
further	O
thoughts	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
but	O
applaud	O
the	O
design	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
I	O
should	O
not	O
go	O
alone	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
would	O
go	O
with	O
me	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
would	O
go	O
first	O
and	O
bring	O
a	O
stout	O
fellow	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
countrymen	O
,	O
to	O
go	O
also	O
with	O
us	O
;	O
``	O
and	O
one	O
,	O
''	O
said	O
he	O
,	O
``	O
as	O
famous	O
for	O
his	O
zeal	O

you	O

any	O

against	O
such	O
devilish	O
things	O

these	O

''	O

So	O
we	O
agreed	O
to	O
go	O
,	O
only	O
we	O
three	O
and	O
my	O
man-servant	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
to	O
put	O
it	O
in	O
execution	O
the	O
following	O
night	O
about	O
midnight	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
possible	O
secrecy	O

We	O
thought	O
it	O
better	O
to	O
delay	O
it	O
till	O
the	O
next	O
night	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
caravan	O
being	O
to	O
set	O
forward	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O

we	O
suppose	O
the	O
governor	O
could	O
not	O
pretend	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
any	O
satisfaction	O
upon	O
us	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
power	O

The	O
Scots	O
merchant	O
,	O
as	O
steady	O
in	O
his	O
resolution	O
for	O
the	O
enterprise	O
as	O
bold	O
in	O
executing	O
,	O
brought	O
me	O
a	O
Tartar	O
's	O
robe	O
or	O
gown	O
of	O
sheepskins	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
bonnet	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
bow	O

arrows	O

and	O
had	O
provided	O
the	O

for	O
himself	O

his	O
countryman	O

that	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
saw	O
us	O
,	O
should	O
not	O
determine	O
who	O
we	O
were	O
.	O

All	O
the	O
first	O
night	O
we	O
spent	O
in	O
mixing	O
up	O
some	O
combustible	O
matter	O
,	O
with	O
aqua	O
vitae	O
,	O
gunpowder	O
,	O
and	O
such	O

materials	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
get	O

and	O
having	O
a	O
good	O
quantity	O
of	O
tar	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
pot	O
,	O
about	O
an	O
hour	O
after	O
night	O
we	O
set	O
out	O
upon	O
our	O
expedition	O

We	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
about	O
eleven	O
o'clock	O
at	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
had	O
not	O
the	O
least	O
suspicion	O
of	O
danger	O
attending	O
their	O
idol	O
.	O

The	O
night	O
was	O
cloudy	O
:	O
yet	O
the	O
moon	O
gave	O
us	O
light	O
enough	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
the	O
idol	O
stood	O
just	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
posture	O
and	O
place	O
that	O
it	O
did	O
before	O

The	O
people	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
all	O
at	O
their	O
rest	O
;	O
only	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
great	O
hut	O

where	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
three	O
priests	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
light	O
,	O
and	O
going	O
up	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
door	O
,	O
we	O
heard	O
people	O
talking	O
as	O
if	O
there	O
were	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
we	O
concluded	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
set	O
wildfire	O
to	O
the	O
idol	O
,	O
those	O
men	O
would	O
come	O
out	O
immediately	O

and	O
run	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
to	O
rescue	O
it	O
from	O
destruction	O
;	O
and	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
them	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O

Once	O
we	O
thought	O
of	O

it	O
away	O

and	O
setting	O
fire	O
to	O
it	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O

when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
handle	O
it	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
too	O
bulky	O
for	O
our	O
carriage	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
a	O
loss	O
again	O
.	O

The	O
second	O
Scotsman	O
was	O
for	O
setting	O
fire	O
to	O
the	O
hut	O
,	O
and	O
knocking	O
the	O
creatures	O
that	O
were	O
there	O
on	O
the	O
head	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
out	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
join	O
with	O
that	O
;	O
I	O
was	O
against	O
killing	O
them	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
were	O
possible	O
to	O
avoid	O
it	O
.	O

``	O
Well	O
,	O
then	O
,	O
''	O
said	O
the	O
Scots	O
merchant	O
,	O
``	O
I	O
will	O
tell	O
you	O
what	O
we	O
will	O
do	O

we	O
will	O
try	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
prisoners	O
,	O
tie	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
them	O
stand	O
and	O
see	O
their	O
idol	O
destroyed	O
.	O
''	O

As	O
it	O
happened	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
twine	O
or	O
packthread	O
enough	O
about	O
us	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
used	O
to	O
tie	O
our	O
firelocks	O
together	O
with	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
attack	O
these	O
people	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
as	O
little	O
noise	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
thing	O
we	O
did	O
,	O
we	O
knocked	O
at	O
the	O
door	O
,	O
when	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
priests	O
coming	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
we	O
immediately	O
seized	O
upon	O
him	O
,	O
stopped	O
his	O
mouth	O
,	O
and	O
tied	O
his	O
hands	O
behind	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
led	O
him	O
to	O
the	O
idol	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
gagged	O
him	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
not	O
make	O
a	O
noise	O
,	O
tied	O
his	O
feet	O
also	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
him	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
.	O

Two	O
of	O
us	O
then	O
waited	O
at	O
the	O
door	O
,	O
expecting	O
that	O
another	O
would	O
come	O
out	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
the	O
matter	O
was	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
waited	O
so	O
long	O
till	O
the	O
third	O
man	O
came	O
back	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
nobody	O
coming	O
out	O
,	O
we	O
knocked	O
again	O
gently	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
out	O
came	O
two	O
more	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
served	O
them	O
just	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
manner	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
go	O
all	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
lay	O
them	O
down	O
by	O
the	O
idol	O
some	O
distance	O
from	O
one	O
another	O
;	O
when	O
,	O
going	O
back	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
two	O
more	O
were	O
come	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
door	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
third	O
stood	O
behind	O
them	O
within	O
the	O
door	O
.	O

We	O
seized	O
the	O
two	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
tied	O
them	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
third	O
,	O
stepping	O
back	O
and	O
crying	O
out	O
,	O
my	O
Scots	O
merchant	O
went	O
in	O
after	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
taking	O
out	O
a	O
composition	O
we	O
had	O
made	O
that	O
would	O
only	O
smoke	O
and	O
stink	O
,	O
he	O
set	O
fire	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
threw	O
it	O
in	O
among	O
them	O
.	O

By	O
that	O
time	O
the	O
other	O
Scotsman	O
and	O
my	O
man	O
,	O
taking	O
charge	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
men	O
already	O
bound	O
,	O
and	O
tied	O
together	O
also	O
by	O
the	O
arm	O
,	O
led	O
them	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
idol	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
them	O
there	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
their	O
idol	O
would	O
relieve	O
them	O
,	O
making	O
haste	O
back	O
to	O
us	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
fuze	O
we	O
had	O
thrown	O
in	O
had	O
filled	O
the	O
hut	O
with	O
so	O
much	O
smoke	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
almost	O
suffocated	O
,	O
we	O
threw	O
in	O
a	O
small	O
leather	O
bag	O
of	O
another	O
kind	O
,	O
which	O
flamed	O
like	O
a	O
candle	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
following	O
it	O
in	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
there	O
were	O
but	O
four	O
people	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
supposed	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
about	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
diabolical	O
sacrifices	O
.	O

They	O
appeared	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
frightened	O
to	O
death	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
sit	O
trembling	O
and	O
stupid	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
speak	O
either	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
smoke	O
.	O

We	O
quickly	O
took	O
them	O
from	O
the	O
hut	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
smoke	O
soon	O
drove	O
us	O
out	O
,	O
bound	O
them	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
done	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
without	O
any	O
noise	O
.	O

Then	O
we	O
carried	O
them	O
all	O
together	O
to	O
the	O
idol	O
;	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
there	O
,	O
we	O
fell	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
him	O
.	O

First	O
,	O
we	O
daubed	O
him	O
all	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
robes	O
also	O
,	O
with	O
tar	O
,	O
and	O
tallow	O
mixed	O
with	O
brimstone	O
;	O
then	O
we	O
stopped	O
his	O
eyes	O
and	O
ears	O
and	O
mouth	O
full	O
of	O
gunpowder	O
,	O
and	O
wrapped	O
up	O
a	O
great	O
piece	O
of	O
wildfire	O
in	O
his	O
bonnet	O
;	O
then	O
sticking	O
all	O
the	O
combustibles	O
we	O
had	O
brought	O
with	O
us	O
upon	O
him	O
,	O
we	O
looked	O
about	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
find	O
anything	O
else	O
to	O
help	O
to	O
burn	O
him	O
;	O
when	O
my	O
Scotsman	O
remembered	O
that	O
by	O
the	O
hut	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
men	O
were	O
,	O
there	O
lay	O
a	O
heap	O
of	O
dry	O
forage	O
;	O
away	O
he	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
Scotsman	O
ran	O
and	O
fetched	O
their	O
arms	O
full	O
of	O
that	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
done	O
this	O
,	O
we	O
took	O
all	O
our	O
prisoners	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
them	O
,	O
having	O
untied	O
their	O
feet	O
and	O
ungagged	O
their	O
mouths	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
them	O
stand	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
them	O
before	O
their	O
monstrous	O
idol	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
set	O
fire	O
to	O
the	O
whole	O
.	O

We	O
stayed	O
by	O
it	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
or	O
thereabouts	O
,	O
till	O
the	O
powder	O
in	O
the	O
eyes	O
and	O
mouth	O
and	O
ears	O
of	O
the	O
idol	O
blew	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
perceive	O
,	O
had	O
split	O
altogether	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
till	O
we	O
saw	O
it	O
burned	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
soon	O
be	O
quite	O
consumed	O
.	O

We	O
then	O
began	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
going	O
away	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
Scotsman	O
said	O
,	O
``	O
No	O
,	O
we	O
must	O
not	O
go	O
,	O
for	O
these	O
poor	O
deluded	O
wretches	O
will	O
all	O
throw	O
themselves	O
into	O
the	O
fire	O
,	O
and	O
burn	O
themselves	O
with	O
the	O
idol	O
.	O
''	O

So	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
stay	O
till	O
the	O
forage	O
has	O
burned	O
down	O
too	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
came	O
away	O
and	O
left	O
them	O
.	O

After	O
the	O
feat	O
was	O
performed	O
,	O
we	O
appeared	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
among	O
our	O
fellow-travellers	O
,	O
exceedingly	O
busy	O
in	O
getting	O
ready	O
for	O
our	O
journey	O
;	O
nor	O
could	O
any	O
man	O
suppose	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
anywhere	O
but	O
in	O
our	O
beds	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
affair	O
did	O
not	O
end	O
so	O
;	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
came	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
people	O
to	O
the	O
town	O
gates	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
most	O
outrageous	O
manner	O
demanded	O
satisfaction	O
of	O
the	O
Russian	O
governor	O
for	O
the	O
insulting	O
their	O
priests	O
and	O
burning	O
their	O
great	O
Cham	O
Chi-Thaungu	O
.	O

The	O
people	O
of	O
Nertsinkay	O
were	O
at	O
first	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
consternation	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
said	O
the	O
Tartars	O
were	O
already	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
thirty	O
thousand	O
strong	O
.	O

The	O
Russian	O
governor	O
sent	O
out	O
messengers	O
to	O
appease	O
them	O
,	O
assuring	O
them	O
that	O
he	O
knew	O
nothing	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
had	O
not	O
a	O
soul	O
in	O
his	O
garrison	O
been	O
abroad	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
from	O
anybody	O
there	O
:	O
but	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
let	O
him	O
know	O
who	O
did	O
it	O
,	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
exemplarily	O
punished	O
.	O

They	O
returned	O
haughtily	O
,	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
country	O
reverenced	O
the	O
great	O
Cham	O
Chi-Thaungu	O
,	O
who	O
dwelt	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
and	O
no	O
mortal	O
would	O
have	O
dared	O
to	O
offer	O
violence	O
to	O
his	O
image	O
but	O
some	O
Christian	O
miscreant	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
therefore	O
resolved	O
to	O
denounce	O
war	O
against	O
him	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
Russians	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
they	O
said	O
,	O
were	O
miscreants	O
and	O
Christians	O
.	O

The	O
governor	O
,	O
unwilling	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
breach	O
,	O
or	O
to	O
have	O
any	O
cause	O
of	O
war	O
alleged	O
to	O
be	O
given	O
by	O
him	O
,	O
the	O
Czar	O
having	O
strictly	O
charged	O
him	O
to	O
treat	O
the	O
conquered	O
country	O
with	O
gentleness	O
,	O
gave	O
them	O
all	O
the	O
good	O
words	O
he	O
could	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
he	O
told	O
them	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
caravan	O
gone	O
towards	O
Russia	O
that	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
it	O
was	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
who	O
had	O
done	O
them	O
this	O
injury	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
satisfied	O
with	O
that	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
send	O
after	O
them	O
to	O
inquire	O
into	O
it	O
.	O

This	O
seemed	O
to	O
appease	O
them	O
a	O
little	O
;	O
and	O
accordingly	O
the	O
governor	O
sent	O
after	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
us	O
a	O
particular	O
account	O
how	O
the	O
thing	O
was	O
;	O
intimating	O
withal	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
any	O
in	O
our	O
caravan	O
had	O
done	O
it	O
they	O
should	O
make	O
their	O
escape	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
whether	O
we	O
had	O
done	O
it	O
or	O
no	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
make	O
all	O
the	O
haste	O
forward	O
that	O
was	O
possible	O
:	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
meantime	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
keep	O
them	O
in	O
play	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
he	O
could	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
very	O
friendly	O
in	O
the	O
governor	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
when	O
it	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
caravan	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
nobody	O
knew	O
anything	O
of	O
the	O
matter	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
for	O
us	O
that	O
were	O
guilty	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
least	O
of	O
all	O
suspected	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
caravan	O
for	O
the	O
time	O
took	O
the	O
hint	O
that	O
the	O
governor	O
gave	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
travelled	O
two	O
days	O
and	O
two	O
nights	O
without	O
any	O
considerable	O
stop	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
lay	O
at	O
a	O
village	O
called	O
Plothus	PNM
:	O
nor	O
did	O
we	O
make	O
any	O
long	O
stop	O
here	O
,	O
but	O
hastened	O
on	O
towards	O
Jarawena	PNM
,	O
another	O
Muscovite	O
colony	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
we	O
expected	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
safe	O
.	O

But	O
upon	O
the	O
second	O
day	O
's	O
march	O
from	O
Plothus	PNM
,	O
by	O
the	O
clouds	O
of	O
dust	O
behind	O
us	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
plain	O
we	O
were	O
pursued	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
entered	O
a	O
vast	O
desert	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
passed	O
by	O
a	O
great	O
lake	O
called	O
Schanks	O
Oser	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
perceived	O
a	O
large	O
body	O
of	O
horse	O
appear	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
lake	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
,	O
we	O
travelling	O
west	O
.	O

We	O
observed	O
they	O
went	O
away	O
west	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
did	O
,	O
but	O
had	O
supposed	O
we	O
would	O
have	O
taken	O
that	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
lake	O
,	O
whereas	O
we	O
very	O
happily	O
took	O
the	O
south	O
side	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
two	O
days	O
more	O
they	O
disappeared	O
again	O
:	O
for	O
they	O
,	O
believing	O
we	O
were	O
still	O
before	O
them	O
,	O
pushed	O
on	O
till	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
Udda	O
,	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
river	O
when	O
it	O
passes	O
farther	O
north	O
,	O
but	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
it	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
narrow	O
and	O
fordable	O
.	O

The	O
third	O
day	O
they	O
had	O
either	O
found	O
their	O
mistake	O
,	O
or	O
had	O
intelligence	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
pouring	O
in	O
upon	O
us	O
towards	O
dusk	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
just	O
pitched	O
upon	O
a	O
convenient	O
place	O
for	O
our	O
camp	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
just	O
entered	O
upon	O
a	O
desert	O
above	O
five	O
hundred	O
miles	O
over	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
towns	O
to	O
lodge	O
at	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
expected	O
none	O
but	O
the	O
city	O
Jarawena	PNM
,	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
yet	O
two	O
days	O
'	O
march	O
to	O
;	O
the	O
desert	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
had	O
some	O
few	O
woods	O
in	O
it	O
on	O
this	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
little	O
rivers	O
,	O
which	O
ran	O
all	O
into	O
the	O
great	O
river	O
Udda	PNM
;	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
narrow	O
strait	O
,	O
between	O
little	O
but	O
very	O
thick	O
woods	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
pitched	O
our	O
camp	O
that	O
night	O
,	O
expecting	O
to	O
be	O
attacked	O
before	O
morning	O
.	O

As	O
it	O
was	O
usual	O
for	O
the	O
Mogul	O
Tartars	O
to	O
go	O
about	O
in	O
troops	O
in	O
that	O
desert	O
,	O
so	O
the	O
caravans	O
always	O
fortify	O
themselves	O
every	O
night	O
against	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
against	O
armies	O
of	O
robbers	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
no	O
new	O
thing	O
to	O
be	O
pursued	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
had	O
this	O
night	O
a	O
most	O
advantageous	O
camp	O
:	O
for	O
as	O
we	O
lay	O
between	O
two	O
woods	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
little	O
rivulet	O
running	O
just	O
before	O
our	O
front	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
surrounded	O
,	O
or	O
attacked	O
any	O
way	O
but	O
in	O
our	O
front	O
or	O
rear	O
.	O

We	O
took	O
care	O
also	O
to	O
make	O
our	O
front	O
as	O
strong	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
by	O
placing	O
our	O
packs	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
camels	O
and	O
horses	O
,	O
all	O
in	O
a	O
line	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
inside	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
felling	O
some	O
trees	O
in	O
our	O
rear	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
posture	O
we	O
encamped	O
for	O
the	O
night	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
enemy	O
was	O
upon	O
us	O
before	O
we	O
had	O
finished	O
.	O

They	O
did	O
not	O
come	O
on	O
like	O
thieves	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
expected	O
,	O
but	O
sent	O
three	O
messengers	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
to	O
demand	O
the	O
men	O
to	O
be	O
delivered	O
to	O
them	O
that	O
had	O
abused	O
their	O
priests	O
and	O
burned	O
their	O
idol	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
burn	O
them	O
with	O
fire	O
;	O
and	O
upon	O
this	O
,	O
they	O
said	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
go	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
do	O
us	O
no	O
further	O
harm	O
,	O
otherwise	O
they	O
would	O
destroy	O
us	O
all	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
looked	O
very	O
blank	O
at	O
this	O
message	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
stare	O
at	O
one	O
another	O
to	O
see	O
who	O
looked	O
with	O
the	O
most	O
guilt	O
in	O
their	O
faces	O
;	O
but	O
nobody	O
was	O
the	O
word	O
--	O
nobody	O
did	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
leader	O
of	O
the	O
caravan	O
sent	O
word	O
he	O
was	O
well	O
assured	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
done	O
by	O
any	O
of	O
our	O
camp	O
;	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
peaceful	O
merchants	O
,	O
travelling	O
on	O
our	O
business	O
;	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
done	O
no	O
harm	O
to	O
them	O
or	O
to	O
any	O
one	O
else	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
they	O
must	O
look	O
further	O
for	O
the	O
enemies	O
who	O
had	O
injured	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
the	O
people	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
desired	O
them	O
not	O
to	O
disturb	O
us	O
,	O
for	O
if	O
they	O
did	O
we	O
should	O
defend	O
ourselves	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
far	O
from	O
being	O
satisfied	O
with	O
this	O
for	O
an	O
answer	O
:	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
crowd	O
of	O
them	O
came	O
running	O
down	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
by	O
break	O
of	O
day	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
camp	O
;	O
but	O
seeing	O
us	O
so	O
well	O
posted	O
,	O
they	O
durst	O
come	O
no	O
farther	O
than	O
the	O
brook	O
in	O
our	O
front	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
stood	O
in	O
such	O
number	O
as	O
to	O
terrify	O
us	O
very	O
much	O
;	O
indeed	O
,	O
some	O
spoke	O
of	O
ten	O
thousand	O
.	O

Here	O
they	O
stood	O
and	O
looked	O
at	O
us	O
a	O
while	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
setting	O
up	O
a	O
great	O
howl	O
,	O
let	O
fly	O
a	O
crowd	O
of	O
arrows	O
among	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
were	O
well	O
enough	O
sheltered	O
under	O
our	O
baggage	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
remember	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
us	O
was	O
hurt	O
.	O

Some	O
time	O
after	O
this	O
we	O
saw	O
them	O
move	O
a	O
little	O
to	O
our	O
right	O
,	O
and	O
expected	O
them	O
on	O
the	O
rear	O
:	O
when	O
a	O
cunning	O
fellow	O
,	O
a	O
Cossack	O
of	O
Jarawena	PNM
,	O
calling	O
to	O
the	O
leader	O
of	O
the	O
caravan	O
,	O
said	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
``	O
I	O
will	O
send	O
all	O
these	O
people	O
away	O
to	O
Sibeilka	PNM
.	O
''	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
city	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
days	O
'	O
journey	O
at	O
least	O
to	O
the	O
right	O
,	O
and	O
rather	O
behind	O
us	O
.	O

So	O
he	O
takes	O
his	O
bow	O
and	O
arrows	O
,	O
and	O
getting	O
on	O
horseback	O
,	O
he	O
rides	O
away	O
from	O
our	O
rear	O
directly	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
back	O
to	O
Nertsinskay	PNM
;	O
after	O
this	O
he	O
takes	O
a	O
great	O
circuit	O
about	O
,	O
and	O
comes	O
directly	O
on	O
the	O
army	O
of	O
the	O
Tartars	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
sent	O
express	O
to	O
tell	O
them	O
a	O
long	O
story	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
had	O
burned	O
the	O
Cham	O
Chi-Thaungu	O
were	O
gone	O
to	O
Sibeilka	PNM
,	O
with	O
a	O
caravan	O
of	O
miscreants	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
called	O
them	O
--	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
Christians	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
resolved	O
to	O
burn	O
the	O
god	O
Scal-Isar	O
,	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
Tonguses	O
.	O

As	O
this	O
fellow	O
was	O
himself	O
a	O
Tartar	O
,	O
and	O
perfectly	O
spoke	O
their	O
language	O
,	O
he	O
counterfeited	O
so	O
well	O
that	O
they	O
all	O
believed	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
away	O
they	O
drove	O
in	O
a	O
violent	O
hurry	O
to	O
Sibeilka	PNM
.	O

In	O
less	O
than	O
three	O
hours	O
they	O
were	O
entirely	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
sight	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
never	O
heard	O
any	O
more	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
nor	O
whether	O
they	O
went	O
to	O
Sibeilka	PNM
or	O
no	O
.	O

So	O
we	O
passed	O
away	O
safely	O
on	O
to	O
Jarawena	PNM
,	O
where	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
Russian	O
garrison	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
we	O
rested	O
five	O
days	O
.	O

From	O
this	O
city	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
frightful	O
desert	O
,	O
which	O
held	O
us	O
twenty-three	O
days	O
'	O
march	O
.	O

We	O
furnished	O
ourselves	O
with	O
some	O
tents	O
here	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
better	O
accommodating	O
ourselves	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
leader	O
of	O
the	O
caravan	O
procured	O
sixteen	O
waggons	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
for	O
carrying	O
our	O
water	O
or	O
provisions	O
,	O
and	O
these	O
carriages	O
were	O
our	O
defence	O
every	O
night	O
round	O
our	O
little	O
camp	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
had	O
the	O
Tartars	O
appeared	O
,	O
unless	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
very	O
numerous	O
indeed	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
hurt	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
may	O
well	O
be	O
supposed	O
to	O
have	O
wanted	O
rest	O
again	O
after	O
this	O
long	O
journey	O
;	O
for	O
in	O
this	O
desert	O
we	O
neither	O
saw	O
house	O
nor	O
tree	O
,	O
and	O
scarce	O
a	O
bush	O
;	O
though	O
we	O
saw	O
abundance	O
of	O
the	O
sable-hunters	O
,	O
who	O
are	O
all	O
Tartars	O
of	O
Mogul	PNM
Tartary	PNM
;	O
of	O
which	O
this	O
country	O
is	O
a	O
part	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
frequently	O
attack	O
small	O
caravans	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
saw	O
no	O
numbers	O
of	O
them	O
together	O
.	O

After	O
we	O
had	O
passed	O
this	O
desert	O
we	O
came	O
into	O
a	O
country	O
pretty	O
well	O
inhabited	O
--	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
towns	O
and	O
castles	O
,	O
settled	O
by	O
the	O
Czar	O
with	O
garrisons	O
of	O
stationary	O
soldiers	O
,	O
to	O
protect	O
the	O
caravans	O
and	O
defend	O
the	O
country	O
against	O
the	O
Tartars	O
,	O
who	O
would	O
otherwise	O
make	O
it	O
very	O
dangerous	O
travelling	O
;	O
and	O
his	O
czarish	O
majesty	O
has	O
given	O
such	O
strict	O
orders	O
for	O
the	O
well	O
guarding	O
the	O
caravans	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
there	O
are	O
any	O
Tartars	O
heard	O
of	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
detachments	O
of	O
the	O
garrison	O
are	O
always	O
sent	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
travellers	O
safe	O
from	O
station	O
to	O
station	O
.	O

Thus	O
the	O
governor	O
of	O
Adinskoy	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
had	O
an	O
opportunity	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
visit	O
to	O
,	O
by	O
means	O
of	O
the	O
Scots	O
merchant	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
acquainted	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
offered	O
us	O
a	O
guard	O
of	O
fifty	O
men	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
thought	O
there	O
was	O
any	O
danger	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
next	O
station	O
.	O

I	O
thought	O
,	O
long	O
before	O
this	O
,	O
that	O
as	O
we	O
came	O
nearer	O
to	O
Europe	PNM
we	O
should	O
find	O
the	O
country	O
better	O
inhabited	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
people	O
more	O
civilised	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
found	O
myself	O
mistaken	O
in	O
both	O
:	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
yet	O
the	O
nation	O
of	O
the	O
Tonguses	O
to	O
pass	O
through	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
same	O
tokens	O
of	O
paganism	O
and	O
barbarity	O
as	O
before	O
;	O
only	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
conquered	O
by	O
the	O
Muscovites	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
so	O
dangerous	O
,	O
but	O
for	O
rudeness	O
of	O
manners	O
and	O
idolatry	O
no	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
ever	O
went	O
beyond	O
them	O

They	O
are	O
all	O
clothed	O
in	O
skins	O
of	O
beasts	O

and	O
their	O
houses	O
are	O
built	O
of	O
the	O

you	O
know	O
not	O
a	O
man	O
from	O

neither	O
by	O
the	O
ruggedness	O
of	O

in	O
the	O

they	O

in	O

If	O
the	O

their	O

for	O

This	O
country	O
,	O
I	O
reckon	O
,	O
was	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
desert	O
I	O
spoke	O
of	O
last	O

at	O

four	O
hundred	O
miles	O

half	O
of	O
it	O
being	O
another	O

took	O
us	O
up	O
twelve	O
days	O
'	O
severe	O
travelling	O
,	O
without	O
house	O

After	O
we	O
were	O
out	O
of	O
this	O

and	O
had	O
travelled	O
two	O

We	O
had	O
now	O
been	O
almost	O
seven	O
months	O
on	O
our	O
journey	O
,	O
and	O
winter	O
began	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
apace	O
;	O
whereupon	O
my	O
partner	O
and	O
I	O
called	O
a	O
council	O
about	O
our	O
particular	O
affairs	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
proper	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
bound	O
for	O
England	PNM
,	O
to	O
consider	O
how	O
to	O
dispose	O
of	O
ourselves	O

They	O
told	O
us	O
of	O
sledges	O
and	O
reindeer	O
to	O
carry	O
us	O
over	O
the	O
snow	O
in	O
the	O
winter	O
time	O

by	O
which	O
means	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
the	O
Russians	O
travel	O
more	O
in	O
winter	O
than	O
they	O
can	O
in	O
summer	O
,	O
as	O
in	O
these	O
sledges	O
they	O
are	O
able	O
to	O
run	O
night	O
and	O
day	O
:	O
the	O
snow	O
,	O
being	O
frozen	O
,	O
is	O
one	O
universal	O
covering	O
to	O
nature	O

by	O
which	O
the	O

But	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
occasion	O
to	O
urge	O
a	O
winter	O
journey	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O

I	O
was	O
bound	O
to	O
England	PNM
,	O
not	O
to	O
Moscow	PNM
,	O
and	O
my	O
route	O
lay	O
two	O
ways	O
:	O
either	O
I	O
must	O
go	O
on	O
as	O
the	O
caravan	O
went	O
,	O
till	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
Jarislaw	PNM
,	O
and	O
then	O
go	O
off	O
west	O
for	O
Narva	PNM
and	O
the	O
Gulf	PNM
of	PNM
Finland	PNM
,	O
and	O
so	O
on	O
to	O
Dantzic	PNM
,	O
where	O
I	O
might	O
possibly	O
sell	O
my	O
China	PNM
cargo	O
to	O
good	O
advantage	O
;	O
or	O
I	O
must	O
leave	O
the	O
caravan	O
at	O
a	O
little	O
town	O
on	O
the	O
Dwina	PNM
,	O
from	O
whence	O
I	O
had	O
but	O
six	O
days	O
by	O
water	O
to	O
Archangel	PNM
,	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
might	O
be	O
sure	O
of	O
shipping	O
either	O
to	O
England	PNM
,	O
Holland	PNM
,	O
or	O
Hamburg	PNM
.	O

Now	O
,	O
to	O
go	O
any	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
journeys	O
in	O
the	O
winter	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
preposterous	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
to	O
Dantzic	PNM
,	O
the	O
Baltic	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
frozen	O
up	O
and	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
passage	O
;	O
and	O
to	O
go	O
by	O
land	O
in	O
those	O
countries	O
was	O
far	O
less	O
safe	O
than	O
among	O
the	O
Mogul	O
Tartars	O
;	O
likewise	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
Archangel	PNM
in	O
October	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
ships	O
would	O
be	O
gone	O
from	O
thence	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
the	O
merchants	O
who	O
dwell	O
there	O
in	O
summer	O
retire	O
south	O
to	O
Moscow	PNM
in	O
the	O
winter	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
ships	O
are	O
gone	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
nothing	O
but	O
extremity	O
of	O
cold	O
to	O
encounter	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
scarcity	O
of	O
provisions	O
,	O
and	O
must	O
lie	O
in	O
an	O
empty	O
town	O
all	O
the	O
winter	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
upon	O
the	O
whole	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
much	O
my	O
better	O
way	O
to	O
let	O
the	O
caravan	O
go	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
provision	O
to	O
winter	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
,	O
at	O
Tobolski	PNM
,	O
in	O
Siberia	PNM
,	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
about	O
sixty	O
degrees	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
sure	O
of	O
three	O
things	O
to	O
wear	O
out	O
a	O
cold	O
winter	O
with	O
,	O
viz.	O
plenty	O
of	O
provisions	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
country	O
afforded	O
,	O
a	O
warm	O
house	O
,	O
with	O
fuel	O
enough	O
,	O
and	O
excellent	O
company	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
now	O
in	O
quite	O
a	O
different	O
climate	O
from	O
my	O
beloved	O
island	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
never	O
felt	O
cold	O
,	O
except	O
when	O
I	O
had	O
my	O
ague	O
;	O
on	O
the	O
contrary	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
much	O
to	O
do	O
to	O
bear	O
any	O
clothes	O
on	O
my	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
never	O
made	O
any	O
fire	O
but	O
without	O
doors	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
necessary	O
for	O
dressing	O
my	O
food	O
,	O
&	O
c	O
.	O

Now	O
I	O
had	O
three	O
good	O
vests	O
,	O
with	O
large	O
robes	O
or	O
gowns	O
over	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
hang	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
feet	O
,	O
and	O
button	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
wrists	O
;	O
and	O
all	O
these	O
lined	O
with	O
furs	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
sufficiently	O
warm	O
.	O

As	O
to	O
a	O
warm	O
house	O
,	O
I	O
must	O
confess	O
I	O
greatly	O
dislike	O
our	O
way	O
in	O
England	PNM
of	O
making	O
fires	O
in	O
every	O
room	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
in	O
open	O
chimneys	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
fire	O
is	O
out	O
,	O
always	O
keeps	O
the	O
air	O
in	O
the	O
room	O
cold	O
as	O
the	O
climate	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
took	O
an	O
apartment	O
in	O
a	O
good	O
house	O
in	O
the	O
town	O
,	O
and	O
ordered	O
a	O
chimney	O
to	O
be	O
built	O
like	O
a	O
furnace	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
centre	O
of	O
six	O
several	O
rooms	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
stove	O
;	O
the	O
funnel	O
to	O
carry	O
the	O
smoke	O
went	O
up	O
one	O
way	O
,	O
the	O
door	O
to	O
come	O
at	O
the	O
fire	O
went	O
in	O
another	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
rooms	O
were	O
kept	O
equally	O
warm	O
,	O
but	O
no	O
fire	O
seen	O
,	O
just	O
as	O
they	O
heat	O
baths	O
in	O
England	PNM
.	O

By	O
this	O
means	O
we	O
had	O
always	O
the	O
same	O
climate	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
rooms	O
,	O
and	O
an	O
equal	O
heat	O
was	O
preserved	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
we	O
saw	O
no	O
fire	O
,	O
nor	O
were	O
ever	O
incommoded	O
with	O
smoke	O

The	O
most	O
wonderful	O
thing	O
of	O
all	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
possible	O
to	O
meet	O
with	O
good	O
company	O
here	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
country	O
so	O
barbarous	O
as	O
this	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
northerly	O
parts	O
of	O

the	O
country	O
where	O
the	O

as	O
I	O
observed	O
before	O

full	O
of	O

CHAPTER	O

--	O
SAFE	O
ARRIVAL	O
IN	O
ENGLAND	O
It	O
was	O
talking	O
one	O
night	O
with	O
a	O
certain	O
prince	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
banished	O
ministers	O
of	O
state	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
Czar	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
discourse	O
of	O
my	O
particular	O
case	O
began	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
been	O
telling	O
me	O
abundance	O
of	O
fine	O
things	O
of	O
the	O
greatness	O
,	O
the	O
magnificence	O
,	O
the	O
dominions	O

and	O
the	O
absolute	O
power	O
of	O
the	O
Emperor	O
of	O
the	O
Russians	O
:	O
I	O
interrupted	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
greater	O
and	O
more	O
powerful	O
prince	O
than	O
ever	O
the	O
Czar	O
was	O
,	O
though	O
my	O
dominion	O
were	O
not	O
so	O
large	O
,	O
or	O
my	O
people	O
so	O
many	O
.	O

The	O
Russian	O
grandee	O
looked	O
a	O
little	O
surprised	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
fixing	O
his	O
eyes	O
steadily	O
upon	O
me	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
wonder	O
what	O
I	O
meant	O
.	O

I	O
said	O
his	O
wonder	O
would	O
cease	O
when	O
I	O
had	O
explained	O
myself	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
the	O
story	O
at	O
large	O
of	O
my	O
living	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
how	O
I	O
managed	O
both	O
myself	O
and	O
the	O
people	O
that	O
were	O
under	O
me	O
,	O
just	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
since	O
minuted	O
it	O
down	O

They	O
were	O
exceedingly	O
taken	O
with	O
the	O
story	O
,	O
and	O
especially	O
the	O
prince	O
,	O
who	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
sigh	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
true	O
greatness	O
of	O
life	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
masters	O
of	O
ourselves	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
exchanged	O
such	O
a	O
state	O
of	O
life	O
as	O
mine	O
to	O
be	O
Czar	PNM
of	PNM
Muscovy	PNM
;	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
found	O
more	O
felicity	O
in	O
the	O
retirement	O
he	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
banished	O
to	O
there	O
,	O
than	O
ever	O
he	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
highest	O
authority	O
he	O
enjoyed	O
in	O
the	O
court	O
of	O
his	O
master	O
the	O
Czar	O
;	O
that	O
the	O
height	O
of	O
human	O
wisdom	O
was	O
to	O
bring	O
our	O
tempers	O
down	O
to	O
our	O
circumstances	O

and	O
to	O
make	O
a	O

the	O
weight	O
of	O
the	O

the	O
clothes	O
from	O
his	O
back	O

as	O
others	O
had	O
done	O
before	O
him	O
;	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
time	O
and	O
consideration	O
had	O
made	O
him	O
look	O
into	O
himself	O

as	O
well	O
as	O
round	O
him	O
to	O
things	O

he	O
found	O
the	O
mind	O
of	O
man	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
but	O
once	O
brought	O
to	O
reflect	O

the	O
state	O
of	O

life	O

and	O
how	O
little	O
this	O
world	O
was	O
concerned	O
in	O
its	O
true	O
felicity	O

was	O
perfectly	O
capable	O
of	O
making	O
a	O
felicity	O
for	O
itself	O

The	O

It	O
was	O
now	O

and	O
the	O
weather	O
at	O

tolerable	O
;	O
so	O
the	O
other	O
travellers	O
began	O
to	O
prepare	O
sledges	O
to	O
carry	O
them	O
over	O
the	O
snow	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
get	O
things	O
ready	O
to	O
be	O
going	O
;	O
but	O
my	O
measures	O

fixed	O

as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O

for	O
Archangel	PNM

and	O
not	O
for	O
Muscovy	O
or	O
the	O
Baltic	PNM
,	O
I	O
made	O
no	O
motion	O
;	O
knowing	O
very	O
well	O
that	O
the	O

from	O
the	O
south	O
do	O
not	O
set	O
out	O
for	O
that	O

of	O
the	O

till	O
May	O

that	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
there	O
by	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
August	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
any	O

would	O
be	O
ready	O
to	O
sail	O

Therefore	O
I	O
made	O
no	O

to	O
be	O
gone	O
,	O
as	O
others	O
did	O
:	O
in	O
a	O

I	O
saw	O

every	O

they	O
go	O
from	O
thence	O
to	O
Muscovy	PNM

on	O
the	O

to	O

In	O
the	O
month	O
of	O
May	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
make	O
all	O
ready	O

pack	O
up	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
doing	O
this	O

it	O
occurred	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
,	O
seeing	O
all	O
these	O

were	O

by	O
the	O

to	O
Siberia	PNM

and	O
yet	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
there	O
,	O
were	O
left	O
at	O
liberty	O
to	O
go	O
whither	O
they	O
would	O

why	O
they	O

not	O
then	O
go	O
away	O
to	O
any	O

the	O
world	O

wherever	O
they	O
thought	O
fit	O
:	O
and	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
examine	O
what	O
should	O
hinder	O
them	O
from	O
making	O
such	O
an	O
attempt	O

But	O
my	O
wonder	O
was	O
over	O
when	O
I	O
entered	O
upon	O
that	O

with	O
the	O

I	O
was	O
silenced	O
at	O
once	O

and	O
found	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
a	O

The	O

in	O
about	O

six	O

seven	O
horses	O

his	O

him	O

in	O

everything	O

in	O
exchange	O
for	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
goods	O
I	O
had	O
brought	O
from	O
China	PNM
;	O
in	O
particular	O
for	O
the	O
cloves	O
and	O
nutmegs	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
sold	O
the	O
greatest	O
part	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
rest	O
afterwards	O
at	O
Archangel	PNM
,	O
for	O
a	O
much	O
better	O
price	O
than	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
got	O
at	O
London	PNM
;	O
and	O
my	O
partner	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
sensible	O
of	O
the	O
profit	O

and	O
whose	O
business	O
,	O
more	O
particularly	O
than	O
mine	O
,	O
was	O
merchandise	O
,	O
was	O
mightily	O
pleased	O
with	O
our	O
stay	O
,	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
traffic	O
we	O
made	O
here	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
June	O
when	O
I	O
left	O
this	O
remote	O
place	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
now	O
reduced	O
to	O
a	O
very	O
small	O
caravan	O
,	O
having	O
only	O
thirty-two	O
horses	O
and	O
camels	O
in	O
all	O
,	O
which	O
passed	O
for	O
mine	O
,	O
though	O
my	O
new	O
guest	O
was	O
proprietor	O
of	O
eleven	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
natural	O
also	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
take	O
more	O
servants	O
with	O
me	O
than	O
I	O
had	O
before	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
young	O
lord	O
passed	O
for	O
my	O
steward	O
;	O
what	O
great	O
man	O
I	O
passed	O
for	O
myself	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
,	O
neither	O
did	O
it	O
concern	O
me	O
to	O
inquire	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
here	O
the	O
worst	O
and	O
the	O
largest	O
desert	O
to	O
pass	O
over	O
that	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
in	O
our	O
whole	O
journey	O
;	O
I	O
call	O
it	O
the	O
worst	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
way	O
was	O
very	O
deep	O
in	O
some	O
places	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
uneven	O
in	O
others	O
;	O
the	O
best	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
say	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
thought	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
troops	O
of	O
Tartars	PNM
or	O
robbers	O
to	O
fear	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
never	O
came	O
on	O
this	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
Oby	O
,	O
or	O
at	O
least	O
very	O
seldom	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
otherwise	O
.	O

My	O
young	O
lord	O
had	O
a	O
faithful	O
Siberian	O
servant	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
perfectly	O
acquainted	O
with	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
led	O
us	O
by	O
private	O
roads	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
avoided	O
coming	O
into	O
the	O
principal	O
towns	O
and	O
cities	O
upon	O
the	O
great	O
road	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
Tumen	O
,	O
Soloy	O
Kamaskoy	O
,	O
and	O
several	O
others	O
;	O
because	O
the	O
Muscovite	O
garrisons	O
which	O
are	O
kept	O
there	O
are	O
very	O
curious	O
and	O
strict	O
in	O
their	O
observation	O
upon	O
travellers	O
,	O
and	O
searching	O
lest	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
banished	O
persons	O
of	O
note	O
should	O
make	O
their	O
escape	O
that	O
way	O
into	O
Muscovy	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
by	O
this	O
means	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
kept	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
cities	O
,	O
so	O
our	O
whole	O
journey	O
was	O
a	O
desert	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
encamp	O
and	O
lie	O
in	O
our	O
tents	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
had	O
very	O
good	O
accommodation	O
in	O
the	O
cities	O
on	O
the	O
way	O
;	O
this	O
the	O
young	O
lord	O
was	O
so	O
sensible	O
of	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
allow	O
us	O
to	O
lie	O
abroad	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
several	O
cities	O
on	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
but	O
lay	O
abroad	O
himself	O
,	O
with	O
his	O
servant	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
and	O
met	O
us	O
always	O
at	O
the	O
appointed	O
places	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
just	O
entered	O
Europe	PNM
,	O
having	O
passed	O
the	O
river	O
Kama	PNM
,	O
which	O
in	O
these	O
parts	O
is	O
the	O
boundary	O
between	O
Europe	PNM
and	O
Asia	PNM
,	O
and	O
the	O
first	O
city	O
on	O
the	O
European	O
side	O
was	O
called	O
Soloy	PNM
Kamaskoy	PNM
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
the	O
great	O
city	O
on	O
the	O
river	O
Kama	PNM

And	O
here	O
we	O
thought	O
to	O
see	O
some	O
evident	O
alteration	O
in	O
the	O
people	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
were	O
mistaken	O
,	O
for	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
vast	O
desert	O
to	O
pass	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
near	O
seven	O
hundred	O
miles	O
long	O
in	O
some	O
places	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
above	O
two	O
hundred	O
miles	O
over	O
where	O
we	O
passed	O
it	O
,	O
so	O
,	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
past	O
that	O
horrible	O
place	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
very	O
little	O
difference	O
between	O
that	O
country	O
and	O
Mogul	PNM
Tartary	PNM

The	O
people	O
are	O
mostly	O
pagans	O

their	O
houses	O
and	O
towns	O
full	O
of	O

and	O
their	O
way	O

wholly	O
barbarous	O

of	O

have	O
their	O

with	O
so	O
many	O

that	O
it	O

scarce	O
to	O

they	O
were	O

they	O

were	O
at	O

about	O
forty-five	O

They	O
came	O
so	O
near	O
to	O
us	O

to	O
be	O
within	O
two	O
musket-shot	O

,	O
asking	O
no	O

surrounded	O
us	O
with	O

looked	O
very	O
earnestly	O
upon	O
us	O
twice	O

at	O
length	O

they	O
placed	O
themselves	O
just	O
in	O
our	O

upon	O

we	O
drew	O
up	O
in	O

so	O
far	O
north	O
before	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
small	O
comfort	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
remedy	O
:	O
there	O
was	O
on	O
our	O
left	O
hand	O
,	O
at	O
about	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
distance	O
,	O
a	O
little	O
grove	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
near	O
the	O
road	O
.	O

I	O
immediately	O
resolved	O
we	O
should	O
advance	O
to	O
those	O
trees	O
,	O
and	O
fortify	O
ourselves	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
there	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
I	O
considered	O
that	O
the	O
trees	O
would	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
measure	O
cover	O
us	O
from	O
their	O
arrows	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
place	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
come	O
to	O
charge	O
us	O
in	O
a	O
body	O
:	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
my	O
old	O
Portuguese	O
pilot	O
who	O
proposed	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
had	O
this	O
excellency	O
attending	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
always	O
readiest	O
and	O
most	O
apt	O
to	O
direct	O
and	O
encourage	O
us	O
in	O
cases	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
danger	O
.	O

We	O
advanced	O
immediately	O
,	O
with	O
what	O
speed	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
and	O
gained	O
that	O
little	O
wood	O
;	O
the	O
Tartars	O
,	O
or	O
thieves	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
to	O
call	O
them	O
,	O
keeping	O
their	O
stand	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
attempting	O
to	O
hinder	O
us	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
thither	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
swampy	O
piece	O
of	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
one	O
side	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
spring	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
running	O
out	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
brook	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
farther	O
joined	O
by	O
another	O
of	O
the	O
like	O
size	O
;	O
and	O
was	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
the	O
source	O
of	O
a	O
considerable	O
river	O
,	O
called	O
afterwards	O
the	O
Wirtska	O
;	O
the	O
trees	O
which	O
grew	O
about	O
this	O
spring	O
were	O
not	O
above	O
two	O
hundred	O
,	O
but	O
very	O
large	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
pretty	O
thick	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
got	O
in	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
ourselves	O
perfectly	O
safe	O
from	O
the	O
enemy	O
unless	O
they	O
attacked	O
us	O
on	O
foot	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
stayed	O
here	O
waiting	O
the	O
motion	O
of	O
the	O
enemy	O
some	O
hours	O
,	O
without	O
perceiving	O
that	O
they	O
made	O
any	O
movement	O
,	O
our	O
Portuguese	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
help	O
,	O
cut	O
several	O
arms	O
of	O
trees	O
half	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
laid	O
them	O
hanging	O
across	O
from	O
one	O
tree	O
to	O
another	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
manner	O
fenced	O
us	O
in	O
.	O

About	O
two	O
hours	O
before	O
night	O
they	O
came	O
down	O
directly	O
upon	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
perceived	O
it	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
joined	O
by	O
some	O
more	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
near	O
fourscore	O
horse	O
;	O
whereof	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
we	O
fancied	O
some	O
were	O
women	O
.	O

They	O
came	O
on	O
till	O
they	O
were	O
within	O
half-shot	O
of	O
our	O
little	O
wood	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
fired	O
one	O
musket	O
without	O
ball	O
,	O
and	O
called	O
to	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
Russian	O
tongue	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
they	O
wanted	O
,	O
and	O
bade	O
them	O
keep	O
off	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
came	O
on	O
with	O
a	O
double	O
fury	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
wood-side	O
,	O
not	O
imagining	O
we	O
were	O
so	O
barricaded	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
easily	O
break	O
in	O
.	O

Our	O
old	O
pilot	O
was	O
our	O
captain	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
our	O
engineer	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
us	O
not	O
to	O
fire	O
upon	O
them	O
till	O
they	O
came	O
within	O
pistol-shot	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
be	O
sure	O
to	O
kill	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
when	O
we	O
did	O
fire	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
sure	O
to	O
take	O
good	O
aim	O
;	O
we	O
bade	O
him	O
give	O
the	O
word	O
of	O
command	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
delayed	O
so	O
long	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
within	O
two	O
pikes	O
'	O
length	O
of	O
us	O
when	O
we	O
let	O
fly	O
.	O

We	O
aimed	O
so	O
true	O
that	O
we	O
killed	O
fourteen	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
wounded	O
several	O
others	O
,	O
as	O
also	O
several	O
of	O
their	O
horses	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
loaded	O
our	O
pieces	O
with	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
bullets	O
apiece	O
at	O
least	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
terribly	O
surprised	O
with	O
our	O
fire	O
,	O
and	O
retreated	O
immediately	O
about	O
one	O
hundred	O
rods	O
from	O
us	O
;	O
in	O
which	O
time	O
we	O
loaded	O
our	O
pieces	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
seeing	O
them	O
keep	O
that	O
distance	O
,	O
we	O
sallied	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
caught	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
of	O
their	O
horses	O
,	O
whose	O
riders	O
we	O
supposed	O
were	O
killed	O
;	O
and	O
coming	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
dead	O
,	O
we	O
judged	O
they	O
were	O
Tartars	O
,	O
but	O
knew	O
not	O
how	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
make	O
an	O
excursion	O
such	O
an	O
unusual	O
length	O
.	O

About	O
an	O
hour	O
after	O
they	O
again	O
made	O
a	O
motion	O
to	O
attack	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
rode	O
round	O
our	O
little	O
wood	O
to	O
see	O
where	O
they	O
might	O
break	O
in	O
;	O
but	O
finding	O
us	O
always	O
ready	O
to	O
face	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
went	O
off	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
resolved	O
not	O
to	O
stir	O
for	O
that	O
night	O
.	O

We	O
slept	O
little	O
,	O
but	O
spent	O
the	O
most	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
night	O
in	O
strengthening	O
our	O
situation	O
,	O
and	O
barricading	O
the	O
entrances	O
into	O
the	O
wood	O
,	O
and	O
keeping	O
a	O
strict	O
watch	O
.	O

We	O
waited	O
for	O
daylight	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
it	O
came	O
,	O
it	O
gave	O
us	O
a	O
very	O
unwelcome	O
discovery	O
indeed	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
enemy	O
,	O
who	O
we	O
thought	O
were	O
discouraged	O
with	O
the	O
reception	O
they	O
met	O
with	O
,	O
were	O
now	O
greatly	O
increased	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
set	O
up	O
eleven	O
or	O
twelve	O
huts	O
or	O
tents	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
resolved	O
to	O
besiege	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
little	O
camp	O
they	O
had	O
pitched	O
upon	O
the	O
open	O
plain	O
,	O
about	O
three-quarters	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
us	O
.	O

I	O
confess	O
I	O
now	O
gave	O
myself	O
over	O
for	O
lost	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
;	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
my	O
effects	O
did	O
not	O
lie	O
so	O
near	O
me	O
,	O
though	O
very	O
considerable	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
thoughts	O
of	O
falling	O
into	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
such	O
barbarians	O
at	O
the	O
latter	O
end	O
of	O
my	O
journey	O
,	O
after	O
so	O
many	O
difficulties	O
and	O
hazards	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
gone	O
through	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
in	O
sight	O
of	O
our	O
port	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
expected	O
safety	O
and	O
deliverance	O
.	O

As	O
to	O
my	O
partner	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
raging	O
,	O
and	O
declared	O
that	O
to	O
lose	O
his	O
goods	O
would	O
be	O
his	O
ruin	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
rather	O
die	O
than	O
be	O
starved	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
was	O
for	O
fighting	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
drop	O
.	O

The	O
young	O
lord	O
,	O
a	O
most	O
gallant	O
youth	O
,	O
was	O
for	O
fighting	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
also	O
;	O
and	O
my	O
old	O
pilot	O
was	O
of	O
opinion	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
resist	O
them	O
all	O
in	O
the	O
situation	O
we	O
were	O
then	O
in	O
.	O

Thus	O
we	O
spent	O
the	O
day	O
in	O
debates	O
of	O
what	O
we	O
should	O
do	O
;	O
but	O
towards	O
evening	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
our	O
enemies	O
still	O
increased	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
but	O
by	O
the	O
morning	O
they	O
might	O
still	O
be	O
a	O
greater	O
number	O
:	O
so	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
inquire	O
of	O
those	O
people	O
we	O
had	O
brought	O
from	O
Tobolski	PNM
if	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
private	O
ways	O
by	O
which	O
we	O
might	O
avoid	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
retreat	O
to	O
some	O
town	O
,	O
or	O
get	O
help	O
to	O
guard	O
us	O
over	O
the	O
desert	O
.	O

The	O
young	O
lord	O
's	O
Siberian	O
servant	O
told	O
us	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
designed	O
to	O
avoid	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
fight	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
engage	O
to	O
carry	O
us	O
off	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
to	O
a	O
way	O
that	O
went	O
north	O
,	O
towards	O
the	O
river	O
Petruz	PNM
,	O
by	O
which	O
he	O
made	O
no	O
question	O
but	O
we	O
might	O
get	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Tartars	O
never	O
discover	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
his	O
lord	O
had	O
told	O
him	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
retreat	O
,	O
but	O
would	O
rather	O
choose	O
to	O
fight	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
he	O
mistook	O
his	O
lord	O
:	O
for	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
too	O
wise	O
a	O
man	O
to	O
love	O
fighting	O
for	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
that	O
I	O
knew	O
he	O
was	O
brave	O
enough	O
by	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
showed	O
already	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
he	O
knew	O
better	O
than	O
to	O
desire	O
seventeen	O
or	O
eighteen	O
men	O
to	O
fight	O
five	O
hundred	O
,	O
unless	O
an	O
unavoidable	O
necessity	O
forced	O
them	O
to	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
thought	O
it	O
possible	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
escape	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
nothing	O
else	O
to	O
do	O
but	O
to	O
attempt	O
it	O
.	O

He	O
answered	O
,	O
if	O
his	O
lordship	O
gave	O
him	O
such	O
orders	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
lose	O
his	O
life	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
perform	O
it	O
;	O
we	O
soon	O
brought	O
his	O
lord	O
to	O
give	O
that	O
order	O
,	O
though	O
privately	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
immediately	O
prepared	O
for	O
putting	O
it	O
in	O
practice	O
.	O

And	O
first	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
it	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
dark	O
,	O
we	O
kindled	O
a	O
fire	O
in	O
our	O
little	O
camp	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
kept	O
burning	O
,	O
and	O
prepared	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
burn	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
Tartars	O
might	O
conclude	O
we	O
were	O
still	O
there	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
dark	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
the	O
stars	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
our	O
guide	O
would	O
not	O
stir	O
before	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
having	O
all	O
our	O
horses	O
and	O
camels	O
ready	O
loaded	O
,	O
we	O
followed	O
our	O
new	O
guide	O
,	O
who	O
I	O
soon	O
found	O
steered	O
himself	O
by	O
the	O
north	O
star	O
,	O
the	O
country	O
being	O
level	O
for	O
a	O
long	O
way	O
.	O

After	O
we	O
had	O
travelled	O
two	O
hours	O
very	O
hard	O
,	O
it	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
lighter	O
still	O
;	O
not	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
dark	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
moon	O
began	O
to	O
rise	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
rather	O
lighter	O
than	O
we	O
wished	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
;	O
but	O
by	O
six	O
o'clock	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
we	O
had	O
got	O
above	O
thirty	O
miles	O
,	O
having	O
almost	O
spoiled	O
our	O
horses	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
Russian	O
village	O
,	O
named	O
Kermazinskoy	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
rested	O
,	O
and	O
heard	O
nothing	O
of	O
the	O
Kalmuck	O
Tartars	O
that	O
day	O
.	O

About	O
two	O
hours	O
before	O
night	O
we	O
set	O
out	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
travelled	O
till	O
eight	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
quite	O
so	O
hard	O
as	O
before	O
;	O
and	O
about	O
seven	O
o'clock	O
we	O
passed	O
a	O
little	O
river	O
,	O
called	O
Kirtza	PNM
,	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
good	O
large	O
town	O
inhabited	O
by	O
Russians	O
,	O
called	O
Ozomys	O
;	O
there	O
we	O
heard	O
that	O
several	O
troops	O
of	O
Kalmucks	O
had	O
been	O
abroad	O
upon	O
the	O
desert	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
completely	O
out	O
of	O
danger	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
satisfaction	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
fresh	O
horses	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
need	O
enough	O
of	O
rest	O
,	O
we	O
stayed	O
five	O
days	O
;	O
and	O
my	O
partner	O
and	O

thither	O
the	O
value	O
of	O

In	O
five	O
days	O

we	O
came	O
to	O
Veussima	PNM
,	O
upon	O
the	O
river	O
Witzogda	PNM
,	O
and	O
running	O
into	O
the	O
Dwina	PNM
:	O
we	O
were	O
there	O
,	O
very	O
happily	O
,	O
near	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
our	O
travels	O
by	O
land	O
,	O
that	O

being	O
navigable	O
,	O
in	O
seven	O
days	O

to	O

From	O
hence	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
Lawremskoy	PNM

the	O
3rd	O
of	O
July	O
;	O
and	O
providing	O
ourselves	O
with	O
two	O
luggage	O
boats	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
barge	O
for	O
our	O
own	O
convenience	O
,	O
we	O
embarked	O
the	O
7th	O
,	O
and	O
arrived	O
all	O
safe	O
at	O
Archangel	PNM
the	O
18th	O
;	O
having	O
been	O
a	O
year	O
,	O
five	O
months	O

and	O
three	O

on	O
the	O
journey	O
,	O
including	O
our	O
stay	O
of	O
about	O
eight	O
months	O
at	O
Tobolski	PNM
.	O

We	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
stay	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
six	O
weeks	O
for	O
the	O
arrival	O
of	O
the	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
must	O
have	O
tarried	O
longer	O
,	O
had	O
not	O
a	O
Hamburgher	O
come	O
in	O
above	O
a	O
month	O
sooner	O
than	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
English	O
ships	O
;	O
when	O
,	O
after	O
some	O
consideration	O
that	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Hamburgh	PNM
might	O
happen	O
to	O
be	O
as	O
good	O
a	O
market	O
for	O
our	O
goods	O
as	O
London	PNM
,	O
we	O
all	O
took	O
freight	O
with	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
put	O
our	O
goods	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
most	O
natural	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
put	O
my	O
steward	O
on	O
board	O
to	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
by	O
which	O
means	O
my	O
young	O

had	O
a	O
sufficient	O
opportunity	O
to	O
conceal	O
himself	O
,	O
never	O
coming	O
on	O
shore	O
again	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
we	O
stayed	O
there	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
he	O
did	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
seen	O
in	O
the	O
city	O
,	O
where	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
Moscow	O
merchants	O
would	O
certainly	O
have	O
seen	O
and	O
discovered	O
him	O
.	O

We	O
then	O
set	O
sail	O
from	O
Archangel	PNM

20th	O
of	O
August	O
,	O
the	O
same	O
year	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
after	O
no	O
extraordinary	O
bad	O
voyage	O
,	O
arrived	O
safe	O
in	O
the	O
Elbe	O
the	O
18th	O
of	O
September	O
.	O

Here	O
my	O
partner	O
and	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
sale	O
for	O

those	O
of	O
China	PNM

of	O

Here	O
the	O
young	O

took	O
his	O
leave	O

up	O

,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
court	O
of	O
Vienna	PNM
,	O
where	O
he	O
resolved	O
to	O
seek	O
protection	O
and	O
could	O
correspond	O
with	O
those	O
of	O
his	O
father	O
's	O
friends	O
who	O
were	O
left	O
alive	O

He	O
did	O
not	O

him	O

To	O

:	O
having	O
stayed	O
near	O
four	O
months	O
in	O
Hamburgh	O
,	O
I	O
came	O
from	O
