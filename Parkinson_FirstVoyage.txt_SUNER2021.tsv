His	O

Sydney	O
was	O
put	O
to	O
the	O
business	O
of	O
a	O

of	O
that	O

executed	O
by	O
Sydney	O
Parkinson	O

is	O
a	O
sufficient	O
testimony	O
both	O
of	O
his	O

His	O
recommendation	O
being	O
so	O
effectually	O
confirmed	O
by	O
these	O
proofs	O
of	O
ingenuity	O

,	O
Joseph	O
Banks	O
made	O
him	O
the	O

An	O
insatiable	O
curiosity	O
for	O
such	O

prevailed	O
over	O
every	O
consideration	O
of	O
danger	O

that	O
reasonably	O
suggested	O
itself	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
necessary	O

of	O

to	O
my	O

He	O
accordingly	O
accepted	O
Joseph	O

's	O
offer	O
;	O
though	O
by	O
no	O

an	O

either	O
views	O

In	O
this	O

and	O
under	O
this	O

,	O
Sydney	O

that	O
of	O

From	O
this	O
time	O

till	O
the	O
4th	O
of	O

and	O
met	O
with	O
no	O

till	O
the	O
12th	O

then	O
we	O
discovered	O
Puerto	O

about	O
nine	O
leagues	O
off	O

soon	O
after	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O

Mr.	O

A	O
great	O

of	O
the	O

on	O
this	O

from	O
whence	O
also	O
they	O
import	O
most	O
of	O
their	O

wearing-apparel	O

so	O
that	O
many	O
of	O
the	O

bear	O
a	O
very	O

While	O
the	O
ship	O
lay	O
in	O
this	O

we	O
had	O
the	O
misfortune	O
of	O
losing	O
Mr.	O

who	O
was	O
a	O
very	O

and	O
one	O
of	O
our	O

His	O
death	O
was	O
occasioned	O
by	O
an	O

which	O
happened	O
to	O
him	O

he	O
was	O
drawn	O

before	O

on	O
the	O
19th	O
of	O

we	O
proceeded	O
on	O
our	O
voyage	O

with	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
E.	O
S.	O
E.	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
22d	O
saw	O
the	O
islands	O
of	O
Salvages	O
,	O
at	O
about	O
two	O
leagues	O

a	O
half	O

They	O
lie	O
between	O
Madeira	PNM

On	O
the	O

we	O
fell	O

with	O
the	O
trade-winds	O
at	O
N.	O
E.	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
day	O
discovered	O
the	O
peak	O
of	O
Teneriffe	PNM

On	O
the	O
24th	O
we	O
sailed	O
between	O
that	O
peak	O
and	O
the	O
grand	O
Canary	PNM
islands	PNM
.	O

In	O
our	O
passage	O
we	O
saw	O
some	O
land	O
birds	O
,	O
and	O
caught	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
very	O
much	O
like	O
our	O
water	O
wag-tail	O

On	O
the	O
29th	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Bona	PNM

,	O
at	O
about	O
four	O

occurred	O
from	O
the	O
29th	O
to	O
the	O
7th	O
of	O
October	O

then	O
we	O
had	O
variable	O
winds	O

with	O
some	O

and	O
the	O
dampness	O
of	O
the	O

greatly	O
affected	O
all	O
our	O

We	O
caught	O
two	O
sea	O

and	O
several	O
curious	O
marine	O
animals	O

of	O
the	O

such	O
as	O

and	O

On	O
the	O
21st	O

we	O
reached	O
the	O

trade	O

and	O
continued	O
our	O
course	O
without	O
any	O
remarkable	O
occurrence	O
till	O
the	O
8th	O
of	O
November	O
;	O
then	O
we	O
discovered	O
land	O
at	O
about	O
eight	O
leagues	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
spoke	O
with	O
the	O
crew	O
of	O
a	O
Portugueze	O
fishing	O
vessel	O
,	O
of	O
whom	O
Mr.	O

bought	O
a	O
great	O
quantity	O
of	O
fish	O
,	O
among	O
which	O
were	O
dolphins	O
and	O
breams	O

which	O
afforded	O
much	O
speculation	O
to	O
our	O

After	O
having	O
left	O
the	O

we	O
stood	O
in	O
for	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
which	O
proved	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
Brazils	PNM
;	O
and	O
coasted	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
till	O
the	O
13th	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
sailed	O
into	O
the	O
harbour	O
of	O

but	O
before	O
we	O
arrived	O
in	O
the	O

the	O

had	O
sent	O
Mr.	O
Hicks	O
,	O
the	O
first	O

the	O
chief	O

,	O
in	O
the	O

to	O

;	O
however	O
,	O
as	O
the	O

was	O
fair	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
ventured	O
to	O
continue	O
sailing	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
assisted	O
by	O
signals	O
from	O
the	O
forts	O

The	O
viceroy	O
detained	O
the	O
lieutenant	O
and	O
the	O
mate	O
,	O
and	O
sent	O
back	O
the	O

with	O
three	O
of	O
his	O

officers	O
in	O
it	O
-LRB-	O
of	O
which	O
one	O
was	O
a	O
colonel	O
-RRB-	O
but	O
no	O
pilot	O

The	O
colonel	O
told	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
our	O
officers	O
would	O
only	O
be	O
detained	O
till	O
the	O
ship	O
should	O
be	O
examined	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
custom	O
:	O
we	O
therefore	O
stood	O
forward	O
into	O
the	O
harbour	O
,	O
and	O
anchored	O
near	O
the	O
north	O
end	O
of	O
Ilhos	PNM

island	O

but	O
the	O
colonel	O
would	O
not	O
permit	O
any	O
of	O
us	O
to	O
go	O
ashore	O

Our	O
lieutenant	O
had	O
been	O
instructed	O
to	O
evade	O
answering	O
any	O
questions	O
the	O
Portugueze	O
might	O
ask	O
him	O
respecting	O
our	O
destination	O
;	O
or	O
at	O
least	O
to	O
answer	O
them	O
with	O
reserve	O
:	O
the	O
captain	O
thought	O
such	O
questions	O
would	O
be	O
impertinent	O
,	O
as	O
our	O
vessel	O
was	O
a	O
ship	O
of	O
war	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
lieutenant	O
observed	O
these	O
directions	O
.	O

The	O
viceroy	O
held	O
a	O
council	O
,	O
the	O
result	O
of	O
which	O
was	O
to	O
prohibit	O
any	O
person	O
coming	O
on	O
shore	O
from	O
our	O
ship	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
condescended	O
to	O
order	O
all	O
necessary	O
supplies	O
to	O
be	O
sent	O
to	O
us	O

We	O
were	O

this	O

as	O
we	O
had	O
expected	O
to	O

with	O

on	O

Mr.	O
Banks	O
and	O
Dr.	O
Solander	O
appeared	O
much	O
chagrined	O
at	O
their	O
disappointment	O
:	O
but	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
all	O
the	O
viceroy	O
's	O
precautions	O
,	O
we	O
determined	O
to	O
gratify	O
our	O
curiosity	O
,	O
in	O
some	O
measure	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
obtained	O
a	O
sufficient	O
knowledge	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
and	O
harbour	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
surveys	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
made	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
we	O
frequently	O
,	O
unknown	O
to	O
the	O
centinel	O
,	O
stole	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
cabin	O
window	O
at	O
midnight	O
,	O
letting	O
ourselves	O
down	O
into	O
a	O
boat	O
by	O
a	O
rope	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
driving	O
away	O
with	O
the	O
tide	O
till	O
we	O
were	O
out	O
of	O
hearing	O
,	O
we	O
then	O
rowed	O
to	O
some	O
unfrequented	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
landed	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
excursions	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
country	O

though	O
not	O
so	O
far	O
as	O
we	O
could	O

wished	O

The	O
morning	O
after	O
we	O
went	O
ashore	O

my	O
eyes	O
were	O
feasted	O
with	O
the	O
pleasing	O
prospects	O
that	O
opened	O
to	O
my	O
view	O
on	O
every	O
hand	O
.	O

I	O
soon	O
discovered	O
a	O
hedge	O
in	O
which	O
were	O
many	O
very	O
curious	O
plants	O
in	O
bloom	O

and	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
quite	O

There	O
were	O
so	O
many	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
even	O
loaded	O
myself	O
with	O
them	O

We	O
found	O
also	O
many	O
curious	O
plants	O
in	O
the	O
sallading	O
that	O
was	O
sent	O
to	O
us	O

desired	O
the	O
people	O
that	O
brought	O
it	O
to	O
procure	O
us	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
different	O
sorts	O
that	O
grew	O
upon	O
the	O

We	O
had	O
plenty	O
of	O

from	O
the	O

every	O
day	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
are	O
furnished	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
variety	O

We	O
often	O
picked	O
off	O
some	O
curious	O
molusca	O
from	O
the	O
surface	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O

This	O
day	O
we	O
also	O
discovered	O
another	O
low	O
island	O

which	O
we	O
called	O
Chain	PNM

It	O
is	O

in	O
the	O

,	O
we	O
could	O
get	O
very	O

many	O
of	O

came	O
off	O
to	O
us	O
in	O

These	O

not	O

they	O
met	O

Mr.	O

On	O
the	O
12th	O
,	O
we	O
received	O
an	O
account	O
from	O
the	O
natives	O
respecting	O
two	O
ships	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
on	O

we	O
gathered	O
from	O
them	O
that	O
the	O

were	O
Spaniards	O

that	O
they	O
had	O
introduced	O

them	O
‡	O
On	O
the	O
15th	O
,	O
the	O
oven-rake	O
was	O
stolen	O

joined	O
to	O
the	O

that	O
had	O
been	O
pilfered	O
from	O
us	O
by	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O

and	O
the	O
insolent	O
treatment	O
Mr.	O
Monkhouse	O
met	O
with	O
,	O
determined	O
the	O
captain	O
to	O
seek	O
redress	O
;	O
he	O
seized	O
twenty-seven	O
double	O
canoes	O
,	O
with	O
sails	O
,	O
which	O
happened	O
to	O
be	O
at	O

the	O
morning	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
which	O
came	O

threatened	O
to	O
burn	O
them	O
if	O
the	O
stolen	O
things	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
returned	O

Before	O
noon	O
they	O
brought	O
back	O
the	O
rake	O

we	O
had	O
no	O

of	O
the	O
rest	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
canoes	O
were	O
still	O
kept	O
in	O

Tootahau	O
was	O
much	O

would	O
not	O

Mr.	O

received	O

very	O
coolly	O

the	O

Mr.	O

went	O
to-bed	O

the	O

I	O
would	O
not	O

them	O

The	O
next	O

they	O
returned	O
to	O

altered	O
his	O
resolution	O

The	O
queen	O
behaved	O
very	O
haughtily	O

yet	O
Mr.	O

agreed	O
they	O
should	O
lie	O
in	O
his	O

On	O
the	O
21st	O

in	O
the	O

A	O
woman	O
,	O
called	O

came	O
from	O
the	O
west	O

presented	O
a	O

bright	O

in	O
the	O
ground	O

bordered	O
with	O
red	O
:	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
it	O
were	O
many	O
crosses	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
apprehended	O
they	O
had	O
learned	O
from	O
the	O
French	O

On	O
the	O
23d	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
we	O
missed	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
a	O
Portugueze	O
,	O
whom	O
we	O
had	O
taken	O
in	O
at	O
Rio	PNM
de	PNM
Janeiro	PNM
;	O
enquiring	O
among	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
we	O
learned	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
at	O
Opare	PNM
with	O
Tootahau	O
;	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
offered	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
bring	O
him	O
back	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
accordingly	O
did	O
the	O
same	O
night	O
.	O

The	O
account	O
which	O
he	O
gave	O
on	O
his	O
return	O
was	O
,	O
That	O
three	O
men	O
came	O
to	O
him	O
crying	O
Tyau	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
watch-word	O
,	O
amongst	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
friendship	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
carried	O
him	O
from	O
the	O
fort	O
,	O
and	O
dragged	O
him	O
to	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
stripped	O
him	O

forced	O
him	O
into	O
a	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
him	O
to	O
Opare	PNM

where	O
Tootahau	O
gave	O
him	O
some	O
cloaths	O
,	O
and	O
persuaded	O
him	O
to	O
stay	O
with	O
him	O

This	O
account	O
we	O
believed	O
to	O
be	O
true	O
,	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
is	O
was	O
known	O
amongst	O

natives	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
rescued	O
,	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
the	O

went	O

in	O
great	O
haste	O

reck	O

them	O

On	O
the	O
26th	O

On	O
the	O
27th	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
favourite	O
game	O

which	O
the	O

,	O
On	O
the	O
29th	O

early	O
in	O
the	O

they	O
set	O
out	O

all	O

at	O
this	O

very	O
scarce	O
;	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
almost	O
famished	O
.	O

This	O
scarcity	O
was	O
principally	O
occasioned	O
by	O
supplying	O
us	O
too	O
liberally	O
with	O
bread-fruit	O
,	O
which	O
obliged	O
the	O

to	O
eat	O

roasted	O

in	O
its	O
stead	O
,	O
which	O

but	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
bread-tree	O
was	O
full	O

we	O
were	O
in	O

of	O
July	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
returned	O
from	O
surveying	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
found	O
to	O
be	O
larger	O
than	O
they	O
expected	O

and	O
brought	O
with	O

several	O

In	O
their	O
tour	O
round	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
they	O
discovered	O
that	O
it	O
consists	O
of	O
two	O
peninsulas	O

con-nected	O
by	O
a	O
low	O
marshy	O
isthmus	O
,	O
through	O
which	O
Mr.	O

supposed	O
canoes	O
might	O
be	O
drawn	O

From	O
Port-Royal	PNM

which	O
is	O
situate	O
at	O
the	O
west	O

,	O
the	O
coast	O
extends	O
E.	O
by	O

about	O
nineteen	O

to	O
a	O

of	O
three	O
small	O
islands	O

forming	O
a	O

called	O
Society-Bay	PNM

From	O
this	O
the	O

into	O
a	O

at	O
the	O
isthmus	O
or	O
juncture	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
divisions	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
the	O
smallest	O
is	O
nearly	O
oval	O
,	O
and	O
surrounded	O
by	O
a	O
reef	O
,	O
which	O
runs	O
parallel	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
at	O
about	O
two	O

This	O
has	O
several	O

which	O
afford	O

The	O
north	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
is	O
likewise	O
defended	O
by	O
a	O
similar	O
reef	O

the	O
ground	O

The	O

Besides	O
the	O

They	O
also	O
learned	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
island	O
is	O
divided	O
into	O
two	O

one	O
of	O

The	O

of	O
these	O

of	O
of	O

In	O

a	O

we	O
at	O

;	O
and	O
,	O
the	O

being	O
against	O
us	O

we	O
were	O

to	O
cast	O

it	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O

endeavouring	O
to	O
heave	O
the	O

we	O
found	O
it	O
was	O

to	O
some	O

where	O
we	O
left	O
it	O

the	O

The	O
natives	O
came	O
off	O
to	O
us	O
in	O
great	O

we	O
bought	O

ten	O

at	O
our	O
arrival	O

Early	O
on	O
the	O

we	O
attempted	O
again	O
to	O
get	O
up	O
the	O
anchor	O
;	O
with	O
some	O
difficulty	O
happily	O
succeeded	O
;	O

warpt	O
the	O
ship	O
into	O
the	O

and	O
,	O
the	O
night	O
coming	O
on	O

we	O

it	O

to	O

next	O

to	O
make	O
for	O
a	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O

several	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
came	O
,	O
in	O
two	O
canoes	O

to	O
visit	O
us	O
:	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
more	O

than	O
the	O
former	O
;	O
but	O
were	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
so	O
frightened	O

that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
persuade	O
them	O
to	O
come	O
on	O

:	O
we	O
offered	O
them	O
various	O
things	O

which	O
they	O
kindly	O
accepted	O

On	O
the	O
14th	O

we	O
made	O
for	O
the	O

the	O

,	O
on	O

up	O

our	O

they	O
were	O
obliged	O

We	O
sailed	O
round	O
most	O

the	O

without	O

any	O
opening	O

and	O
the	O
soundings	O

all	O
along	O
the	O

were	O
very	O

The	O

well	O

In	O

they	O

In	O

we	O

On	O
the	O
15th	O

in	O
the	O
morning	O

we	O
bent	O
our	O

round	O
a	O
small	O

which	O
was	O
joined	O
to	O
the	O

a	O

on	O
which	O

and	O
,	O
within-side	O

the	O

We	O

some	O

brought	O
up	O
to	O

rolled	O
round	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
over-against	O
a	O
point	O
of	O
land	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
circumstance	O
of	O
stealing	O
the	O
boy	O

we	O
called	O
Cape	PNM
Kidnappers	PNM
.	PNM

On	O
doubling	O
the	O
cape	O
,	O
we	O
thought	O
to	O
have	O
met	O
with	O
a	O
snug	O
bay	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
disappointed	O
,	O
the	O
land	O
tending	O
away	O
to	O
a	O
point	O
southward	O
.	O

Soon	O
after	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
small	O
island	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
from	O
its	O
desolate	O
appearance	O
,	O
we	O
called	O
Bare	PNM
Island	PNM

On	O
the	O
17th	O
,	O
we	O
sailed	O
along	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
near	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
forty-one	O
degrees	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
not	O
meeting	O
with	O
any	O
convenient	O
harbour	O
to	O
anchor	O
in	O
,	O
the	O
land	O
lying	O
N.	O
and	O
S.	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
abreast	O
of	O
a	O
round	O
bluff	O
cape	O
,	O
we	O
turned	O
back	O
,	O
being	O
apprehen-sive	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
want	O
water	O
if	O
we	O
proceeded	O
farther	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
no	O
canoes	O
,	O
but	O
several	O
villages	O

and	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
some	O
fires	O
burning	O
upon	O
the	O

The	O
coast	O
appeared	O
more	O
barren	O
than	O
any	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
before	O

There	O
was	O
clear	O
ground	O

and	O
good	O
anchorage	O
upon	O
the	O

,	O
two	O

three	O

On	O
the	O
19th	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O

we	O
were	O
off	O

we	O
could	O
not	O

the	O

A	O

came	O
to	O

with	O
five	O

in	O

who	O
seemed	O
to	O
place	O
great	O

they	O
came	O
on	O

The	O
man	O

who	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O

a	O

early	O
in	O

very	O

in	O

but	O
,	O
toward	O

we	O
saw	O
some	O

that	O
appeared	O
very	O
broken	O

On	O
the	O

we	O
anchored	O
in	O
a	O
very	O

in	O

two	O

several	O

behaved	O
with	O
great	O

at	O

they	O
began	O
to	O

The	O

the	O

in	O

we	O

a	O

they	O

we	O
weighed	O
anchor	O

the	O

we	O
stood	O
off	O

the	O

looked	O
into	O
the	O
bay	O
which	O
we	O
had	O

About	O
noon	O
we	O
dropped	O
anchor	O

and	O
one	O

the	O

so	O
that	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
difficult	O
to	O

with	O
them	O

They	O
had	O
some	O

them	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
we	O
fired	O
several	O
muskets	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
much	O
regard	O
them	O
;	O
we	O
then	O
fired	O
some	O
grape-shot	O
amongst	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
paddled	O
away	O
something	O
faster	O
,	O
till	O
they	O
ima-gined	O
themselves	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
reach	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
they	O
held	O
up	O
their	O
paddles	O
,	O
and	O
seemed	O
to	O
defy	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
fired	O
another	O
gun	O
loaded	O
with	O
round	O
and	O
grape-shot	O
,	O
which	O
passed	O
between	O
two	O
canoes	O
,	O
and	O
narrowly	O
missed	O
them	O
;	O
on	O
which	O
they	O
hesitated	O
no	O
longer	O
,	O
but	O
repaired	O
immediately	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

Toward	O
night	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
near	O
a	O
small	O
high	O
island	O
,	O
called	O
by	O
the	O
natives	O
Mow-tohora	PNM
,	O
about	O
three	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
land	O
.	O

In	O
going	O
between	O
this	O
and	O
the	O
main	O
land	O
,	O
a	O
canoe	O
came	O
off	O
to	O
us	O
from	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

This	O
canoe	O
was	O
double	O
,	O
and	O
differed	O
in	O
other	O
respects	O
from	O
those	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
before	O
.	O

After	O
we	O
had	O
talked	O
with	O
the	O
people	O
which	O
came	O
in	O
it	O
a	O
considerable	O
time	O
,	O
they	O
gave	O
us	O
several	O
heivos	O
,	O
then	O
looked	O
at	O
us	O
very	O
stedfastly	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
threatened	O
us	O
,	O
they	O
stood	O
off	O
toward	O
the	O
main	O
land	O
.	O

Opposite	O
to	O
this	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
high	O
peaked	O
hill	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
named	O
Mount	PNM
Edgecombe	PNM
;	O
and	O
a	O
small	O
bay	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
called	O
Lowland	PNM
Bay	PNM

and	O
the	O
two	O
points	O
thereof	O
,	O
from	O
their	O
situation	O

Highland	PNM

;	O
the	O
latter	O
of	O
which	O
stretches	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
is	O
covered	O
with	O
trees	O
,	O
near	O
it	O
there	O
are	O
three	O
small	O
islands	O
,	O
or	O
rocks	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
with	O
difficulty	O
that	O
we	O
steered	O
clear	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
into	O
six	O
fathoms	O
water	O
;	O
soon	O
after	O
which	O
we	O
made	O
a	O
point	O
of	O
land	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
called	O
Town	PNM
Point	PNM
:	O
this	O
was	O
at	O
the	O
entrance	O
of	O
a	O
little	O
cove	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
2d	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
we	O
discovered	O
three	O
sorts	O
of	O
land	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
weather	O
was	O
hazy	O
,	O
could	O
not	O
make	O
many	O
observations	O
.	O

We	O
also	O
passed	O
three	O
other	O
islands	O
:	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
rocky	O
,	O
high	O
and	O
barren	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
called	O
White	PNM
Island	PNM
.	O

The	O
other	O
two	O
were	O
lower	O
;	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
we	O
named	O
Flat	PNM
Island	PNM
,	O
in	O
which	O
which	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
village	O
.	O

A	O
canoe	O
pursued	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
having	O
a	O
brisk	O
breeze	O
,	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
overtake	O
us	O
.	O

Toward	O
night	O
it	O
blew	O
pretty	O
hard	O
,	O
right	O
on	O
shore	O
;	O
we	O
therefore	O
tacked	O
about	O
,	O
and	O
sailed	O
backward	O
and	O
forward	O
till	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
the	O
3d	O
:	O
then	O
the	O
canoe	O
which	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
night	O
before	O
gave	O
us	O
chace	O
again	O
;	O
having	O
a	O
sail	O
,	O
they	O
at	O
length	O
came	O
up	O
with	O
us	O
;	O
sailed	O
along-side	O
of	O
us	O
for	O
a	O
considerable	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
gave	O
us	O
a	O
song	O
,	O
the	O
tune	O
of	O
which	O
was	O
much	O
like	O
the	O
chant	O
which	O
the	O
popish	O
priests	O
use	O
at	O
mass	O
:	O
they	O
also	O
gave	O
us	O
a	O
heivo	O
,	O
but	O
soon	O
after	O
threw	O
some	O
stones	O
at	O
us	O
:	O
we	O
fired	O
a	O
musket	O
,	O
loaded	O
with	O
small	O
shot	O
,	O
at	O
a	O
young	O
man	O
who	O
distinguished	O
himself	O
at	O
the	O
sport	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
shrunk	O
down	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
wounded	O
.	O

After	O
a	O
short	O
consultation	O
they	O
doused	O
the	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
back	O
for	O
an	O
island	O
.	O

We	O
sailed	O
along	O
with	O
a	O
moderate	O
breeze	O
,	O
and	O
passed	O
an	O
island	O
,	O
or	O
cluster	O
of	O
rocks	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
called	O
the	O
Court	PNM
of	PNM
Aldermen	PNM
:	O
and	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
vicinity	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
last	O
mentioned	O
islands	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
we	O
gave	O
it	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
The	O
Mayor	O

This	O
cluster	O
of	O
rocks	O
lies	O
off	O
a	O
point	O
of	O
land	O
,	O
and	O
terminates	O
the	O
bounds	O
of	O
this	O
large	O
bay	O
to	O
the	O
N.	O
W.	O
which	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
canoes	O
that	O
came	O
off	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
bringing	O
provisions	O
,	O
we	O
named	O
The	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM
Plenty	PNM
.	O

The	O
coast	O
hereabout	O
appeared	O
very	O
barren	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
rocky	O
islands	O
,	O
from	O
which	O
circumstance	O
we	O
named	O
the	O
point	O

Barren	PNM
Point	PNM

The	O
land	O
is	O
very	O
grotesque	O

being	O
cleft	O

or	O
torn	O
into	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
strange	O

and	O
has	O
very	O
few	O
trees	O
upon	O
it	O

About	O
noon	O
,	O
several	O
canoes	O
came	O
off	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
people	O
in	O
them	O
were	O
so	O
daring	O
as	O
to	O
throw	O
a	O
lance	O
into	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
fired	O
a	O
musket	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
paddled	O
away	O
from	O
us	O
.	O

Their	O
canoes	O
were	O
formed	O
out	O
of	O
one	O
tree	O
,	O
and	O
shaped	O
like	O
a	O
butchers	O
tray	O
,	O
without	O
any	O

about	O

The	O
people	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
naked	O
,	O
excepting	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
,	O
were	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
dark	O
complexion	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
mean	O
appearance	O
.	O

We	O
stood	O
in	O
for	O
a	O
bay	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
at	O
night	O
,	O
anchored	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
having	O
seven	O
fathoms	O
water	O

Several	O
canoes	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
former	O

followed	O
us	O
;	O
the	O
people	O
in	O
them	O
cut	O
a	O
despicable	O
figure	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
merry	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
us	O
several	O
heivos	O

or	O
cheers	O

This	O
bay	O

which	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
call	O

is	O
the	O
best	O
harbour	O
we	O
have	O
found	O
,	O
being	O
well	O
land-locked	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
good	O
landing	O
at	O
the	O

in	O
a	O
salt-water	O
river	O

which	O

a	O

up	O

At	O
the	O
bot-tom	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
there	O
is	O
another	O
river	O

which	O
also	O
seems	O
to	O
extend	O
very	O

On	O
the	O
4th	O
,	O
early	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
visited	O
by	O
several	O
canoes	O
;	O
the	O
people	O
in	O
them	O
,	O
about	O
one	O
hundred	O
and	O
thirty-five	O
in	O
number	O
,	O
had	O
a	O
few	O
arms	O
,	O
but	O
seemed	O
unresolved	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
;	O
sometimes	O
staring	O
at	O
us	O
in	O
a	O
wild	O
manner	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
threatening	O
us	O
:	O
but	O
,	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
they	O
traded	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
exchanging	O
the	O
few	O
trifles	O
they	O
had	O
brought	O
for	O
cloth	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
very	O
sly	O
,	O
and	O
attempted	O
to	O
cheat	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
fired	O
several	O
muskets	O
at	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
wounded	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
did	O
not	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
alarmed	O
till	O
the	O
captain	O
shot	O
through	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
canoes	O
,	O
which	O
struck	O
them	O
with	O
a	O
panic	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
on	O
firing	O
a	O
great	O
gun	O
,	O
they	O
made	O
off	O
to	O
land	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
5th	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
peaceably	O
inclined	O
:	O
we	O
made	O
them	O
some	O
presents	O
;	O
they	O
exchanged	O
what	O
trifles	O
they	O
had	O
for	O
small	O
pieces	O
of	O
cloth	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
fond	O
of	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
away	O
highly	O
pleased	O
,	O
promising	O
to	O
bring	O
us	O
some	O
fish	O
.	O

Some	O
people	O
,	O
it	O
seemed	O
,	O
came	O
to	O
them	O
now-and-then	O
from	O
the	O
north	O
,	O
plundered	O
them	O
of	O
every	O
thing	O
they	O
could	O
find	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
their	O
wives	O
and	O
children	O
away	O
captives	O
;	O
and	O
not	O
knowing	O
who	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
nor	O
our	O
design	O
in	O
visiting	O
their	O
coast	O
,	O
was	O
the	O
reason	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
at	O
first	O
so	O
shy	O
of	O
us	O
.	O

To	O
secure	O
themselves	O
from	O
these	O
free-booters	O
,	O
they	O
build	O
their	O
houses	O
near	O
together	O
on	O
the	O
tops	O
of	O
rocks	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
they	O
can	O
easily	O
defend	O
against	O
the	O
assaults	O
of	O
their	O
enemies	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
being	O
so	O
subject	O
to	O
the	O
ravages	O
of	O
those	O
ruffians	O
,	O
they	O
are	O
much	O
dispirited	O

and	O
that	O
may	O
be	O
the	O
principal	O
cause	O
of	O
their	O
poverty	O
and	O
wretchedness	O
.	O

We	O
sent	O
the	O
pinnace	O
to	O
haul	O
the	O
seine	O
,	O
and	O
caught	O
a	O
large	O
draught	O
of	O
mullets	O

and	O
other	O
kind	O
of	O
fish	O

In	O
the	O

the	O
yaul	O
drudged	O
for	O

and	O
met	O
with	O
indifferent	O
success	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
9th	O
,	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
came	O
in	O
canoes	O
about	O
the	O
ship	O

and	O
brought	O
us	O
a	O
large	O
quantity	O
of	O

mostly	O
of	O
the	O
mackrel	O
kind	O

with	O
a	O
few	O
John	O

;	O
and	O
we	O
pickled	O
down	O
several	O
casks	O
full	O
of	O
them	O

Some	O
of	O
these	O
canoes	O
came	O
from	O
another	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
country	O

which	O
were	O
larger	O

and	O
of	O

than	O
the	O

the	O

in	O

had	O
a	O

among	O

some	O

In	O
one	O

there	O
was	O
a	O

a	O

for	O

out	O

the	O

A	O

at	O
one	O

which	O
were	O

A	O

were	O

at	O

in	O
the	O

the	O

we	O
weighed	O

having	O
a	O

nothing	O

The	O
country	O
in	O

appeared	O
rather	O
barren	O

and	O
had	O
but	O
few	O
signs	O

We	O
saw	O
several	O
islands	O

which	O
we	O

On	O
the	O
18th	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
we	O
passed	O
between	O
the	O

an	O
island	O
which	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
fertile	O

as	O

Yoolee-Etea	PNM

Two	O
canoes	O
came	O
to	O
us	O
from	O
the	O
main	O
,	O
having	O
carved	O
heads	O

like	O
those	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
in	O
the	O
bay	O
of	O
Opoorangee	PNM
:	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
longer	O

and	O
had	O
sixty	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
in	O
her	O
:	O
they	O
gazed	O
at	O
us	O
awhile	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
gave	O
us	O
several	O
heivos	O

but	O
the	O
breeze	O
freshening	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
drop	O
astern	O

and	O
we	O
soon	O
left	O
them	O

The	O
coast	O
hereabout	O
is	O
full	O
of	O
islands	O
:	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
the	O

one	O

After	O
we	O
had	O
passed	O
this	O
island	O

-LRB-	O
the	O
passage	O
between	O
which	O
and	O
the	O
main	O
we	O
named	O
Port	PNM
Charles	PNM
,	O
-RRB-	O
it	O
seemed	O
as	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
a	O
large	O

the	O

surrounding	O
us	O
on	O

we	O
bent	O
our	O

and	O
got	O

at	O
length	O

inclosed	O
between	O
two	O
shores	O

which	O
seemed	O
to	O
form	O
a	O

Night	O

on	O
,	O
we	O
anchored	O
here	O

not	O
daring	O
to	O

as	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
whether	O
we	O

a	O
strait	O
or	O
a	O

The	O
land	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
of	O
us	O
appeared	O
very	O
broken	O

had	O
a	O
high	O

bold	O
shore	O

tolerably	O
well	O
cloathed	O
with	O

it	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
thinly	O
inhabited	O
;	O
nor	O
did	O
we	O
see	O
any	O

There	O
are	O
many	O

along	O
the	O

are	O
some	O

On	O
the	O
19th	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
several	O
of	O
the	O

came	O
on	O

the	O

behaved	O
very	O

By	O
what	O
we	O
could	O
learn	O

they	O
had	O
got	O

us	O
from	O
the	O

that	O

the	O
country	O
about	O
Opoorangee	PNM

which	O
is	O

They	O
told	O
us	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
an	O

a	O
deep	O

Some	O
of	O
them	O
presented	O
us	O
with	O
a	O
large	O
parcel	O
of	O
smoaked	O
eels	O
,	O
which	O
tasted	O
very	O
sweet	O
and	O
luscious	O

We	O
observed	O
that	O
the	O
natives	O
mode	O
of	O
salutation	O
was	O
by	O
putting	O
their	O
noses	O
together	O

We	O

we	O
came	O
to	O
six	O

then	O
let	O

The	O

with	O
wood	O

and	O
some	O
parts	O
of	O
it	O
cultivated	O

This	O

with	O
some	O

at	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

It	O
was	O
about	O
half	O

it	O
was	O

The	O

promised	O
to	O

they	O

On	O
that	O
day	O
they	O
also	O
met	O
with	O
the	O

In	O

The	O

they	O
went	O
off	O
with	O
some	O
others	O
,	O
meaning	O
to	O
take	O
an	O
advantage	O
of	O
us	O
.	O

While	O
they	O
were	O
parlying	O
among	O
themselves	O
we	O
fired	O
several	O
muskets	O
at	O
them	O
,	O
loaded	O
with	O
small	O
shot	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
attempted	O
to	O
skreen	O
themselves	O
from	O
with	O
their	O
ahavos	O
,	O
or	O
cloaks	O
.	O

We	O
fired	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
splintered	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
canoes	O
,	O
which	O
seemed	O
to	O
alarm	O
them	O
much	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
paddled	O
away	O
from	O
us	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
possible	O
,	O
till	O
they	O
thought	O
themselves	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
reach	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
they	O
stopped	O
and	O
threatened	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
fired	O
a	O
great	O
gun	O
,	O
which	O
so	O
thoroughly	O
disconcerted	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
made	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
their	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O

These	O
people	O
were	O
much	O
like	O
them	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
heretofore	O
,	O
excepting	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
more	O
tataowed	O
:	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
the	O
figure	O
of	O
volutes	O
on	O
their	O
lips	O

and	O
several	O
had	O
their	O
legs	O

One	O

The	O

upon	O

was	O
not	O

in	O

On	O
the	O
26th	O
,	O
many	O
canoes	O
visited	O
us	O

The	O
people	O
in	O
them	O
were	O
much	O
the	O

the	O

had	O
a	O

of	O
things	O
on	O

were	O

any	O
of	O
them	O
excepting	O
fish	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
obtained	O
a	O
large	O
quantity	O

The	O
coast	O

sailed	O
along	O
this	O
day	O

was	O
generally	O
barren	O

and	O
broke	O
into	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
small	O

among	O
which	O
we	O
presumed	O
there	O
might	O
be	O

We	O
had	O
calm	O

On	O
the	O

we	O
were	O
among	O
a	O

We	O
asked	O
them	O
for	O
some	O

they	O
took	O
them	O
up	O

we	O
had	O
a	O

a	O

On	O
the	O
11th	O
,	O
in	O
the	O

we	O
discovered	O
a	O
very	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O

on	O
the	O
12th	O

we	O
approached	O

it	O

but	O
could	O
not	O

the	O

When	O
we	O
were	O
abreast	O

On	O
the	O

finding	O

we	O
concluded	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
a	O
large	O

On	O
the	O

and	O
the	O
natives	O
flocked	O
in	O
crouds	O
to	O
gaze	O
at	O
us	O

We	O
stood	O
in	O
for	O
a	O

caught	O
a	O

which	O
weighed	O
twenty-one	O

on	O
the	O

Here	O

then	O
the	O

,	O
being	O
willing	O
to	O
satisfy	O
ourselves	O
whether	O
the	O
north	O

this	O

was	O
an	O

,	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O

These	O

The	O

about	O

On	O
the	O
8th	O
,	O
we	O
sailed	O
along	O
the	O
southern	O
coast	O
of	O
this	O
island	O
:	O
the	O
weather	O
was	O
hazy	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
discovered	O
many	O
extensive	O
lawns	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
high	O
hills	O
,	O
the	O
tops	O
of	O
which	O
which	O
were	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
three	O
canoes	O
came	O
off	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
two	O

were	O
large	O

The	O

in	O

out	O

mangled	O
in	O
several	O

of	O
their	O
bodies	O
,	O
behaved	O
peaceably	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
by	O
asking	O
for	O
nails	O
,	O
we	O
concluded	O
they	O
had	O
heard	O
of	O
us	O
from	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
some	O
other	O
islands	O
where	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
much	O

the	O
natives	O
of	O
Mataroowkaow	PNM
,	O
a	O
vil-lage	O
in	O
Tolaga	PNM
Bay	PNM
;	O
being	O
very	O
neatly	O

having	O
their	O

In	O
one	O
of	O

was	O
an	O

who	O
came	O
on	O

attended	O
by	O

he	O
was	O

His	O
brow	O

as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O

of	O
many	O

who	O
were	O
with	O

was	O
much	O

the	O
hair	O
of	O
his	O

quite	O
silvered	O

He	O
had	O
on	O
a	O

ornamented	O
with	O
a	O
beautiful	O
wrought	O
border	O
;	O

under	O
it	O
a	O

on	O

and	O
an	O
ear-ring	O
of	O
Poonamoo	PNM

or	O

For	O
an	O
Indian	O
,	O
his	O
speech	O
was	O
soft	O

and	O
his	O

so	O

the	O

we	O
supposed	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
person	O
of	O

We	O
observed	O
a	O

seem	O

On	O
the	O
9th	O

at	O
noon	O

latitude	O

we	O
had	O
a	O
good	O

of	O
Cape	PNM

We	O
hauled	O
in	O

The	O

had	O
many	O

We	O
passed	O
two	O

On	O
the	O

at	O
the	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
four	O
double	O

were	O
fifty-seven	O

On	O
the	O
16th	O

we	O
sailed	O
along	O
shore	O

and	O
had	O
frequent	O
calms	O

About	O
noon	O
we	O
passed	O
a	O
broad	O

which	O
seemed	O
to	O
divide	O
the	O

on	O
the	O

after	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
the	O
master	O
of	O
our	O

We	O
had	O
light	O
breezes	O

till	O
the	O
ninth	O

and	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
dawn	O
of	O

we	O
narrowly	O
escaped	O
running	O
the	O

upon	O
a	O

or	O
parcel	O
of	O

some	O

were	O

by	O
the	O

going	O
to	O
the	O
mast	O

The	O

being	O
moderate	O

we	O
put	O
the	O
helm	O

were	O
delivered	O
from	O
this	O

danger	O
by	O
the	O

The	O
land	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
then	O
saw	O
at	O
a	O
considerable	O
distance	O
,	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
island	O

having	O
a	O

opening	O
between	O
it	O

but	O
,	O
the	O

we	O

for	O
the	O

it	O
was	O
the	O

This	O

we	O

South-East	PNM

on	O

is	O
a	O
small	O

that	O
we	O

We	O
stood	O
out	O
to	O

but	O
,	O
meeting	O
with	O
contrary	O

we	O
beat	O
to	O

for	O
a	O
considerable	O
time	O
:	O
at	O
length	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
coming	O
fair	O
,	O
we	O
steered	O
westerly	O

and	O
,	O
unexpectedly	O
,	O
found	O
ourselves	O
between	O
two	O
large	O
shoals	O

which	O
had	O
some	O
rocks	O
upon	O
them	O

we	O

them	O

We	O
called	O
these	O

Toward	O

as	O
to	O
make	O
the	O

N.N.E.	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
saw	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O

upon	O
it	O
that	O
glittered	O
very	O
much	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
not	O
discover	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
composed	O
of	O

This	O

the	O
weather	O
was	O
more	O

On	O

,	O
on	O
the	O

fetched	O
the	O

the	O

a	O

,	O
the	O

coming	O

,	O
we	O
steered	O
north-westerly	O

a	O
point	O
of	O
land	O

which	O
we	O
named	O
the	O

We	O
went	O
round	O
this	O

on	O
the	O

about	O
which	O
we	O

On	O
the	O
13th	O
,	O
we	O
sailed	O
along	O
the	O
western	O
coast	O
with	O
a	O
very	O
brisk	O
breeze	O
from	O
the	O

The	O

to	O
an	O

height	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O

We	O

the	O

which	O
,	O
larger	O

but	O
night	O

we	O
did	O
not	O
venture	O
into	O
any	O
of	O
them	O

On	O
the	O
14th	O
,	O
we	O
sailed	O
along	O
shore	O
with	O
a	O
pleasant	O
breeze	O
;	O
the	O
land	O
rose	O
immediately	O
from	O
the	O

a	O
very	O

Some	O

were	O
covered	O
with	O

the	O
others	O
with	O
wood	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
saw	O
no	O

We	O
passed	O
several	O
breaks	O
in	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
which	O
might	O
be	O
good	O
harbours	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
enter	O
into	O
any	O

We	O
saw	O

this	O

a	O

On	O
the	O
16th	O
,	O
having	O
a	O

the	O

We	O
saw	O
a	O
break	O
in	O
the	O
land	O
which	O
we	O
thought	O
might	O
be	O
a	O
good	O
harbour	O

but	O
it	O
proved	O
only	O
a	O
small	O
open	O
bay	O
,	O
we	O
therefore	O
called	O
it	O
Mistaken	PNM
Bay	PNM

As	O
we	O
sailed	O
along	O
we	O
passed	O
a	O
broken	O

that	O
had	O
a	O
flat	O
top	O

from	O
which	O
the	O

poured	O
down	O
into	O
the	O

formed	O
three	O
grand	O

On	O
the	O

which	O
we	O
called	O
Open	PNM

On	O
the	O
20th	O
,	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
contrary	O
winds	O

which	O
carried	O
us	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
west-ward	O
;	O

,	O
the	O
wind	O
coming	O

up	O
with	O
a	O

which	O
we	O
named	O

On	O
the	O
24th	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
point	O
of	O
land	O
which	O
we	O
called	O

soon	O

with	O
a	O
Cape	O

,	O
when	O
we	O
got	O
round	O
it	O

at	O
the	O

the	O

We	O
continued	O
our	O

came	O
up	O
with	O
a	O

On	O
the	O

we	O
had	O
land	O
on	O
every	O

stood	O
to	O

where	O
there	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
opening	O

which	O
carried	O
us	O
into	O
a	O
strait	O

in	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
deep	O

This	O

lies	O

is	O
about	O

The	O

on	O

The	O

We	O

At	O

we	O
saw	O
a	O

which	O
yielded	O
a	O

not	O

On	O

and	O
,	O
about	O
nine	O

in	O
the	O

,	O
we	O
sailed	O
down	O
a	O
reef	O
of	O
coral-rocks	O

Our	O
water	O
shoaled	O
very	O
soon	O
,	O
from	O
twenty-one	O
to	O
eight	O
fathoms	O
;	O
which	O
alarmed	O
us	O
very	O
much	O
:	O
every	O
countenance	O
expressed	O
surprize	O
,	O
and	O
every	O
heart	O
felt	O
some	O
trepidation	O

About	O

the	O

struck	O

We	O
were	O

,	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
escaped	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

we	O
should	O
have	O
fallen	O
into	O
the	O

Agitated	O

surprised	O
as	O

Night	O
came	O
on	O

which	O
providentially	O
was	O
moon-light	O

we	O

it	O
out	O
as	O

considering	O
the	O

were	O

On	O
the	O
11th	O
,	O
early	O
in	O
the	O

we	O

About	O
noon	O

the	O

on	O

her	O
off	O
the	O

hoping	O
in	O

At	O
four	O
oclock	O
in	O
the	O

it	O
was	O
low	O

and	O
the	O

in	O

Between	O

the	O

the	O

about	O
ten	O

some	O
farther	O
attempts	O
to	O
clear	O
her	O
,	O
she	O
providentially	O
got	O
off	O

This	O
desirable	O
event	O
gave	O
us	O
spirits	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
however	O

proved	O
but	O
the	O
transient	O
gleam	O
of	O
sunshine	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
tempestuous	O
day	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
soon	O
depressed	O
again	O
,	O
by	O
observing	O
that	O
the	O
water	O
increased	O
in	O
the	O
hold	O
,	O
faster	O
than	O
we	O
could	O
throw	O
it	O
out	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
expected	O
,	O
every	O
minute	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
would	O
sink	O

or	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
obliged	O
to	O
run	O
her	O
again	O
upon	O
the	O

In	O
the	O
midst	O
of	O
these	O
gloomy	O
prospects	O
and	O
alarming	O
apprehensions	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
stop	O
the	O
leak	O
,	O
by	O
a	O
method	O
suggested	O
to	O
us	O
by	O
an	O
officer	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
former	O
voyage	O
,	O
made	O
use	O
of	O
it	O
with	O
success	O
:	O
we	O
sewed	O
a	O
great	O
quantity	O
of	O
hair	O
and	O
oakum	O
to	O
a	O
large	O
piece	O
of	O
canvas	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
let	O
down	O
by	O
two	O
ropes	O
,	O
one	O
on	O
each	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
bow	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
:	O
in	O
making	O
way	O
,	O
she	O
sucked	O
this	O
under	O

close	O
to	O
her	O
bottom	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
when	O
it	O
reached	O
the	O
leak	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
forced	O
in	O
by	O
the	O
intruding	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
obstructed	O
its	O
passage	O
so	O
much	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
kept	O
it	O
under	O
with	O
a	O
single	O
pump	O
.	O

Providentially	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
at	O
this	O
instant	O
,	O
a	O
breeze	O
sprang	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
steered	O
towards	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
the	O
boats	O
going	O
before	O
,	O
in	O
quest	O
of	O
a	O
harbour	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
also	O
happily	O
found	O

at	O
about	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
leagues	O
distance	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
14th	O
of	O
June	O
,	O
we	O
dropped	O
anchor	O
in	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
entrance	O
into	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
narrow	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
place	O
buoys	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
to	O
steer	O
by	O

While	O
we	O
lay	O
on	O
the	O

,	O
it	O
was	O

,	O
from	O
the	O
time	O
we	O
left	O
it	O
,	O
till	O
this	O
day	O
,	O
it	O
blew	O
gently	O
;	O
but	O
now	O
it	O
began	O
to	O
blow	O
hard	O
,	O
which	O
prevented	O
us	O
from	O
getting	O
into	O
the	O
bay	O
till	O
the	O
18th	O
;	O
when	O
we	O
reached	O
the	O
desired	O
haven	O

though	O
not	O
without	O
some	O
danger	O
,	O
the	O
ship	O
having	O
several	O
times	O
touched	O
the	O
ground	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
threw	O
the	O
guns	O
overboard	O
,	O
we	O
fixed	O
buoys	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
intending	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
escaped	O
,	O
to	O
have	O
heaved	O
them	O
up	O
again	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
on	O
attempting	O
it	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
was	O
impracticable	O
.	O

Soon	O
after	O
we	O
arrived	O
in	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
we	O
laid	O
the	O
ship	O
on	O
a	O
steep	O
bank	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
a	O
river	O

and	O
there	O
lodged	O
and	O
accommodated	O

On	O
the	O
22d	O

we	O
examined	O
the	O
ships	O
bottom	O

and	O
found	O
a	O
large	O
hole	O
;	O
through	O
the	O

the	O

in	O
all	O

the	O

In	O

On	O
the	O
4th	O
of	O

the	O

to	O
the	O

During	O
the	O

we	O
picked	O
up	O
a	O

Some	O
of	O

On	O
the	O
4th	O
of	O

in	O
the	O

we	O
weighed	O

till	O
we	O

there	O
we	O

On	O

that	O
we	O

and	O
were	O

On	O
the	O

We	O
had	O

after	O
the	O

us	O
from	O
the	O

;	O
and	O
,	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
the	O

we	O
did	O
not	O

kept	O

passed	O
by	O
some	O
low	O
islands	O
well	O
covered	O
with	O

We	O
also	O
saw	O
three	O

and	O
sailed	O
betwixt	O
them	O
and	O
the	O
main	O
:	O
the	O

appeared	O
very	O
low	O

Toward	O
evening	O
we	O
were	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
alarmed	O
by	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
land	O
all	O
round	O
us	O
:	O
the	O
weather	O
being	O
hazy	O

and	O
the	O
wind	O
blowing	O
fresh	O

we	O
hauled	O
in	O
our	O
wind	O

and	O
came	O
to	O
under	O
a	O
bluff	O
point	O
of	O
the	O
main	O

On	O
the	O
13th	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
we	O
weighed	O
anchor	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O

close	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
high	O
islands	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
passed	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
on	O
through	O
a	O
break	O
of	O
the	O
reef	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
wide	O
.	O

This	O
reef	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
captain	O
discovered	O
from	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
last-mentioned	O
island	O

ran	O
farther	O
than	O
the	O

on	O
the	O
outermost	O
side	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O

like	O
a	O
wall	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sea	O
broke	O
very	O
high	O
upon	O
it	O
:	O
We	O
found	O
no	O
sounding	O
in	O
the	O
passage	O

latitude	O
14	O

38	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
stood	O
to	O
the	O
N.	O
E.	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
intending	O
to	O
keep	O
to	O
the	O
north-ward	O
on	O
the	O
morrow	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
15th	O
,	O
about	O
noon	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
land	O
again	O
in	O
latitude	O
13	O
°	O
S.	O
also	O
a	O
continuation	O
of	O
the	O
reef	O
which	O
ran	O
along-side	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
standing	O
right	O
in	O
for	O
land	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
alarmed	O
by	O
suddenly	O
discovering	O
that	O
reef	O
extended	O
to	O
leeward	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
we	O
hauled	O
in	O
our	O
wind	O
,	O
and	O
crouded	O
all	O
the	O
sail	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
weather	O
the	O
farthest	O
point	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
wind	O
was	O
easterly	O
this	O
day	O
,	O
more	O
moderate	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
swell	O
of	O
the	O

less	O

On	O
the	O
16th	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
dawn	O
of	O
day	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
reef	O
under	O
our	O
lee	O
,	O
at	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
distance	O
,	O
which	O
alarmed	O
us	O
much	O
.	O

When	O
it	O
was	O
quite	O
light	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
breakers	O
all	O
round	O
us	O
excepting	O
to	O
windward	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
came	O
in	O
.	O

The	O
wind	O
sail-ing	O
us	O
about	O
midnight	O
,	O
we	O
tacked	O
about	O
,	O
being	O
afraid	O
to	O
stand	O
any	O
farther	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
winds	O
still	O
sailing	O
was	O
the	O
cause	O
that	O
we	O
drove	O
on	O
the	O
reef	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
now	O
neared	O
apace	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
dilemma	O
,	O
we	O
first	O
hoisted	O
out	O
our	O
small	O
boats	O
-LRB-	O
the	O
long	O
boat	O
being	O
stowed	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
pinnace	O
repairing	O
-RRB-	O
to	O
tow	O
her	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
sweeps	O
rigged	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
gun-room	O
ports	O
,	O
to	O
turn	O
her	O
head	O
about	O
.	O

A	O
slight	O
puff	O
of	O
wind	O
gave	O
us	O
some	O
hopes	O
of	O
effecting	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
sailing	O
,	O
we	O
approached	O
so	O
near	O
the	O
breakers	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
but	O
one	O
heave	O
of	O
the	O
swell	O
between	O
them	O
and	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
with	O
our	O
pulling	O
,	O
the	O
alteration	O
of	O
the	O
tide	O
,	O
and	O
another	O
slight	O
puff	O
of	O
wind	O
,	O
we	O
cleared	O
her	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
from	O
the	O
reef	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
to	O
where	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
break	O
in	O
the	O
reef	O
to	O
leeward	O
,	O
there	O
we	O
hoped	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
,	O
to	O
find	O
ground	O
to	O
anchor	O
upon	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
got	O
to	O
the	O
entrance	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
driven	O
off	O
by	O
a	O
ripple	O
of	O
the	O
tide	O
that	O
set	O
out	O
with	O
great	O
force	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
proved	O
very	O
providential	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
afterward	O
found	O
there	O
were	O
rocks	O
in	O
the	O
passage	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
proper	O
break	O
.	O

We	O
then	O
stood	O
to	O
windward	O
,	O
intending	O
either	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
as	O
we	O
came	O
in	O
,	O
or	O
a	O
little	O
farther	O
down	O
to	O
leeward	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
reef	O
seemed	O
detached	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
perceiving	O
,	O
soon	O
after	O
,	O
the	O
tops	O
of	O
some	O
rocks	O
in	O
the	O
passage	O
,	O
we	O
declined	O
attempting	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
wind	O
again	O
dying	O
away	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
a	O
lots	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
for	O
the	O
best	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
determined	O
on	O
sending	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
to	O
examine	O
into	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
another	O
break	O
still	O
farther	O
to	O
leeward	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
a	O
light	O
breeze	O
springing	O
up	O
from	O
the	O
east	O
,	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
push	O
in	O
there	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
passage	O
was	O
but	O
narrow	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
happily	O
accomplished	O
,	O
being	O
assisted	O
by	O
the	O
tide	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
anchored	O
between	O
the	O
reef	O
and	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
in	O
fifteen	O
fathoms	O
water	O
;	O
though	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
very	O
edge	O
of	O
these	O
reefs	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
sounding	O
at	O
one	O
hundred	O
and	O
fifty-five	O
fathoms	O
.	O

At	O
our	O
first	O
entrance	O
into	O
this	O
place	O
we	O
had	O
very	O
unequal	O
soundings	O
;	O
sometimes	O
finding	O
no	O
bottom	O
;	O
and	O
one	O
fathom	O
farther	O
finding	O
it	O
with	O
twenty	O
fathoms	O
of	O
line	O

This	O
,	O
we	O
apprehended	O
,	O
was	O
occasioned	O
by	O
the	O
coral	O

On	O
the	O
17th	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
we	O
sent	O
some	O
men	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
to	O
the	O
reef	O
for	O
turtles	O
and	O
clams	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
returned	O
without	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
former	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
but	O
few	O
clams	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
were	O
of	O
a	O
large	O
size	O

The	O
reefs	O
were	O
covered	O
with	O
a	O
numberless	O
variety	O
of	O
beautiful	O
corallines	O
of	O

having	O
here	O

there	O
interstices	O

very	O
white	O

These	O
made	O
a	O
pleasing	O
appearance	O
under	O
water	O

which	O
was	O
smooth	O
on	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
reef	O

while	O
it	O
broke	O
all	O
along	O
the	O
outside	O

and	O
may	O
be	O
aptly	O
compared	O
to	O
a	O
grove	O

growing	O
under	O

may	O
be	O
caught	O
by	O

on	O
the	O
high	O
part	O
of	O
the	O

There	O
are	O
also	O

On	O
the	O
18th	O

we	O
weighed	O

and	O
stood	O
along	O

on	O

thinking	O
that	O
would	O
be	O

way	O
of	O
finding	O
the	O
passage	O
between	O

we	O
met	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
many	O

shoals	O

and	O
reefs	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
at	O
night	O

We	O
kept	O
along	O

till	O
the	O
21st	O

and	O
,	O
at	O
noon	O
,	O
in	O
latitude	O
10	O

we	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
great	O
number	O

which	O
tended	O

We	O
stood	O
through	O
between	O
two	O
of	O
these	O
islands	O

to	O
the	O
west	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
a	O
very	O
strong	O
tide	O
,	O
which	O
carried	O
us	O
along	O
briskly	O

and	O
gave	O

that	O
this	O

a	O
passage	O
between	O

the	O
pinnace	O

,	O
seeing	O
a	O

they	O
hoisted	O

The	O

a	O

quite	O

This	O

was	O
more	O

and	O
less	O

were	O

We	O
also	O
discovered	O
very	O
high	O

at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O

We	O
were	O

to	O
keep	O

we	O
passed	O
between	O

we	O
should	O

found	O
a	O

On	O
the	O
23d	O

We	O

all	O

which	O
we	O
named	O

over	O
a	O

only	O
three	O

a	O

About	O

and	O
some	O

went	O
off	O

shot	O
a	O

About	O

On	O
the	O
17th	O
in	O

On	O
our	O
approaching	O
nearer	O
to	O
it	O

we	O
saw	O
several	O
sorts	O
of	O
cattle	O

which	O
induced	O
us	O
to	O
steer	O

we	O
might	O
meet	O

We	O
pursued	O
our	O
course	O
round	O
the	O

and	O
anchored	O
in	O
a	O
very	O

The	O

if	O
the	O

pleased	O
:	O
The	O

vouchsafed	O

the	O

were	O

After	O
much	O

in	O

through	O
the	O

and	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O

passed	O
a	O
small	O

from	O

very	O

over-shot	O

not	O

that	O

in	O

We	O
had	O
also	O
a	O

where	O

with	O

In	O

off	O
to	O

in	O
a	O

from	O

us	O
that	O
the	O

In	O
the	O

we	O
weighed	O

,	O
having	O
only	O
a	O

we	O
made	O
no	O

On	O
the	O

we	O
had	O
a	O

which	O
was	O
directly	O

and	O
the	O

ran	O
very	O
strong	O

Finding	O
that	O
we	O

we	O
anchored	O
at	O

and	O
,	O
while	O
we	O
lay	O

On	O

Mr.	O

After	O
a	O
passage	O
of	O
eighteen	O
days	O
,	O
during	O
which	O
time	O
nothing	O
remarkable	O
happened	O
,	O
we	O
arrived	O
at	O
St.	PNM

where	O
we	O

commanded	O
by	O
captain	O
Elliot	O
,	O

twelve	O
East-Indiamen	O
under	O
her	O

In	O
going	O
into	O
the	O

we	O
ran	O
foul	O
of	O
one	O

the	O
Indiamen	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
with	O
the	O

we	O
happily	O

without	O

we	O
under	O

as	O

we	O

;	O
and	O
he	O

We	O
stayed	O
there	O
but	O
four	O
days	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
whole	O

consisting	O
of	O
fourteen	O

About	O
a	O
month	O

we	O
fell	O
in	O
with	O
a	O
schooner	O
from	O
Rhode-island	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
whaling	O
off	O
the	O
western	O
islands	O
.	O

We	O
sent	O
a	O
boat	O
on	O

for	O
news	O
;	O
and	O
were	O
informed	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
joy	O
,	O
that	O
all	O
was	O
peaceable	O
in	O
England	PNM
when	O
she	O
left	O
it	O

Through	O
our	O
heavy	O
sailing	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
we	O
lost	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
fleet	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
,	O
saw	O
another	O
whaling	O
schooner	O
,	O
who	O
confirmed	O
the	O
account	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
received	O
from	O
the	O
former	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
two	O
days	O
before	O
they	O
had	O
chased	O
a	O
large	O
whale	O
into	O
a	O
harbour	O
of	O
St.	PNM
Michaels	PNM
Island	PNM
,	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
while	O
they	O
were	O
pursuing	O
it	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
fired	O
upon	O
by	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
,	O
and	O
obliged	O
to	O
retreat	O
,	O
leaving	O
the	O
whale	O
a	O
prize	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
doubtless	O
,	O
made	O
sure	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

We	O
bought	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
master	O
of	O
the	O
schooner	O
,	O
some	O
fine	O
salt	O
cod	O

was	O
in	O

seemed	O

About	O
sixteen	O
days	O
