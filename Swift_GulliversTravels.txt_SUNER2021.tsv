of	O
these	O
Travels	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Lemuel	O

,	O
is	O
my	O
ancient	O

About	O
three	O
years	O
ago	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Gulliver	O
growing	O
weary	O
of	O
the	O
concourse	O
of	O
curious	O
people	O
coming	O
to	O
him	O
at	O
his	O
house	O
in	O
Redriff	O
,	O
made	O
a	O
small	O
purchase	O
of	O
land	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
convenient	O
house	O
,	O
near	O
Newark	O
,	O
in	O
Nottinghamshire	O
,	O
his	O
native	O
country	O
;	O
where	O
he	O
now	O
lives	O
retired	O
,	O
yet	O
in	O
good	O
esteem	O
among	O
his	O
neighbours	O
.	O

Although	O
Mr.	O
Gulliver	O
was	O
born	O
in	O
Nottinghamshire	O
,	O
where	O
his	O
father	O
dwelt	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
have	O
heard	O
him	O
say	O
his	O
family	O
came	O
from	O
Oxfordshire	PNM
;	O
to	O
confirm	O
which	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
observed	O
in	O
the	O
churchyard	O
at	O
Banbury	PNM
in	O
that	O
county	O
,	O
several	O
tombs	O
and	O
monuments	O
of	O
the	O
Gullivers	O
.	O

Before	O
he	O
quitted	O
Redriff	O
,	O
he	O
left	O
the	O
custody	O
of	O
the	O
following	O
papers	O
in	O
my	O
hands	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
liberty	O
to	O
dispose	O
of	O
them	O
as	O
I	O
should	O
think	O
fit	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
carefully	O
perused	O
them	O
three	O
times	O
.	O

The	O
style	O
is	O
very	O
plain	O
and	O
simple	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
only	O
fault	O
I	O
find	O
is	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
author	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
travellers	O
,	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
too	O
circumstantial	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
an	O
air	O
of	O
truth	O
apparent	O
through	O
the	O
whole	O
;	O
and	O
indeed	O
the	O
author	O
was	O
so	O
distinguished	O
for	O
his	O
veracity	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
became	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
proverb	O
among	O
his	O
neighbours	O
at	O
Redriff	O
,	O
when	O
any	O
one	O
affirmed	O
a	O
thing	O
,	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
as	O
true	O
as	O
if	O
Mr.	O
Gulliver	O
had	O
spoken	O
it	O
.	O

By	O
the	O
advice	O
of	O
several	O
worthy	O
persons	O
,	O
to	O
whom	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
author	O
's	O
permission	O
,	O
I	O
communicated	O
these	O
papers	O
,	O
I	O
now	O
venture	O
to	O
send	O
them	O
into	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
hoping	O
they	O
may	O
be	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
a	O
better	O
entertainment	O
to	O
our	O
young	O
noblemen	O
,	O
than	O
the	O
common	O
scribbles	O
of	O
politics	O
and	O
party	O
.	O

This	O
volume	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
at	O
least	O
twice	O
as	O
large	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
made	O
bold	O
to	O
strike	O
out	O
innumerable	O
passages	O
relating	O
to	O
the	O
winds	O
and	O
tides	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
variations	O
and	O
bearings	O
in	O
the	O
several	O
voyages	O
,	O
together	O
with	O
the	O
minute	O
descriptions	O
of	O
the	O
management	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
in	O

,	O
in	O

of	O

;	O
likewise	O
the	O
account	O
of	O
longitudes	O
and	O
latitudes	O
;	O
wherein	O
I	O
have	O
reason	O
to	O
apprehend	O
,	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Gulliver	O
may	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
dissatisfied	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
was	O
resolved	O
to	O
fit	O
the	O
work	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
possible	O
to	O
the	O
general	O
capacity	O
of	O
readers	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
if	O
my	O
own	O
ignorance	O
in	O
sea	O
affairs	O
shall	O
have	O
led	O
me	O
to	O
commit	O
some	O
mistakes	O
,	O
I	O
alone	O
am	O
answerable	O
for	O
them	O
.	O

And	O
if	O
any	O

hath	O
a	O
curiosity	O
to	O
see	O
the	O

that	O
by	O
your	O

you	O
prevailed	O
on	O
me	O
to	O
publish	O
a	O
very	O
loose	O
and	O
uncorrect	O
account	O
of	O
my	O
travels	O
,	O
with	O
directions	O
to	O
hire	O
some	O
young	O
gentleman	O
of	O
either	O
university	O
to	O
put	O
them	O
in	O
order	O
,	O
and	O
correct	O

as	O
my	O

by	O
my	O

in	O
his	O

But	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
remember	O
I	O
gave	O
you	O
power	O
to	O
consent	O
that	O
any	O
thing	O
should	O
be	O
omitted	O
,	O
and	O
much	O
less	O
that	O
any	O

should	O
be	O
inserted	O
;	O
therefore	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
latter	O
,	O
I	O
do	O
here	O
renounce	O
every	O

of	O
that	O

a	O
paragraph	O
about	O
her	O

of	O

although	O
I	O
did	O
reverence	O
and	O
esteem	O
her	O
more	O
than	O
any	O
of	O
human	O
species	O

But	O
you	O
,	O
or	O
your	O
interpolator	O

ought	O
to	O
have	O
considered	O
,	O
that	O
it	O

was	O
it	O
not	O
decent	O
to	O
praise	O

And	O
besides	O
,	O
the	O
fact	O
was	O
altogether	O
false	O
;	O
for	O
to	O
my	O
knowledge	O

being	O
in	O
England	PNM
during	O
some	O
part	O
of	O
her	O
majesty	O

so	O
that	O
you	O

Likewise	O
in	O

When	O
I	O
formerly	O
hinted	O
to	O
you	O
something	O
of	O
this	O
in	O
a	O
letter	O

you	O
were	O
pleased	O
to	O
answer	O
that	O
you	O
were	O
afraid	O
of	O
giving	O
offence	O
;	O
that	O
people	O
in	O
power	O
were	O
very	O
watchful	O
over	O
the	O
press	O
,	O
and	O
apt	O
not	O

to	O
interpret	O

to	O

,	O
pray	O
how	O
could	O
that	O
which	O
I	O
spoke	O
so	O
many	O
years	O

,	O
and	O
at	O
about	O
five	O

of	O

Yahoos	O

who	O
now	O
are	O
said	O
to	O
govern	O
the	O
herd	O
;	O
especially	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
when	O
I	O
little	O
thought	O

or	O
feared	O

the	O
unhappiness	O
of	O
living	O
under	O
them	O

Have	O
not	O
I	O
the	O
most	O
reason	O
to	O
complain	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
see	O
these	O
very	O

Yahoos	O
_	O
carried	O
by	O
_	O
Houyhnhnms	O

in	O

And	O
indeed	O
to	O
avoid	O
so	O
monstrous	O

detestable	O
a	O
sight	O
was	O
one	O
principal	O
motive	O
of	O
my	O
retirement	O
hither	O

Thus	O
much	O
I	O
thought	O
proper	O
to	O
tell	O
you	O
in	O
relation	O
to	O
yourself	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
trust	O
I	O
reposed	O
in	O
you	O

I	O
do	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
place	O

complain	O
of	O
my	O
own	O
great	O
want	O
of	O
judgment	O
,	O
in	O
being	O
prevailed	O
upon	O
by	O
the	O
entreaties	O
and	O
false	O
reasoning	O
of	O
you	O
and	O
some	O
others	O
,	O
very	O
much	O
against	O
my	O

to	O

bring	O
to	O
your	O

how	O
often	O
I	O
desired	O
you	O

In	O

in	O

When	O
I	O

I	O
went	O
down	O

my	O

him	O

my	O

some	O

I	O
got	O
forty	O

a	O
promise	O
of	O
thirty	O

a	O
year	O
to	O
maintain	O

at	O
Leyden	PNM

there	O
I	O
studied	O
physic	O
two	O

seven	O

knowing	O
it	O
would	O

Soon	O
after	O
my	O
return	O
from	O
Leyden	PNM
,	O
I	O
was	O
recommended	O
by	O
my	O
good	O
master	O

Mr.	O

,	O
to	O
be	O
surgeon	O
to	O

a	O
voyage	O
or	O

into	O
the	O

When	O
I	O
came	O
back	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
settle	O
in	O
London	PNM
;	O
to	O
which	O
Mr.	O
Bates	O
,	O
my	O

encouraged	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
him	O
I	O
was	O
recommended	O
to	O
several	O
patients	O

I	O
took	O
part	O
of	O
a	O
small	O
house	O
in	O
the	O
Old	O
Jewry	O
;	O
and	O
being	O
advised	O

I	O
married	O
Mrs.	O

with	O

I	O
received	O
four	O

But	O
my	O
good	O

Bates	O
dying	O
in	O
two	O
years	O
after	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
having	O
few	O
friends	O
,	O
my	O
business	O
began	O
to	O
fail	O
;	O
for	O
my	O
conscience	O
would	O
not	O
suffer	O
me	O
to	O
imitate	O
the	O
bad	O

of	O
too	O
many	O
among	O
my	O

therefore	O
consulted	O
with	O
my	O

some	O
of	O
my	O
acquaintance	O
,	O
I	O
determined	O
to	O
go	O
again	O
to	O
sea	O

I	O
was	O
surgeon	O
successively	O
in	O
two	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
several	O
voyages	O
,	O
for	O
six	O
years	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
East	O
and	O
West	PNM
Indies	PNM
,	O
by	O
which	O
I	O
got	O
some	O
addition	O
to	O
my	O
fortune	O
.	O

My	O
hours	O
of	O
leisure	O
I	O
spent	O
in	O
reading	O
the	O
best	O
authors	O

ancient	O

modern	O
,	O
being	O
always	O
provided	O
with	O
a	O
good	O
number	O
of	O
books	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
ashore	O
,	O
in	O
observing	O
the	O
manners	O

dispositions	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
as	O

as	O
learning	O
their	O

wherein	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
facility	O

by	O
the	O
strength	O
of	O
my	O
memory	O

The	O
last	O
of	O
these	O
voyages	O
not	O
proving	O
very	O
fortunate	O
,	O
I	O
grew	O
weary	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O

and	O
intended	O
to	O
stay	O
at	O
home	O
with	O
my	O
wife	O
and	O
family	O
.	O

I	O
removed	O
from	O
the	O
Old	O
Jewry	O
to	O
Fetter	O
Lane	O
,	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
to	O
Wapping	O
,	O
hoping	O
to	O
get	O
business	O
among	O
the	O
sailors	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
turn	O
to	O
account	O

After	O
three	O
years	O
expectation	O
that	O
things	O
would	O
mend	O

I	O
accepted	O
an	O
advantageous	O

from	O
Captain	O
William	O
Prichard	O

the	O
Antelope	O

who	O
was	O
making	O
a	O

and	O
our	O

was	O
at	O

We	O
rowed	O

by	O
my	O
computation	O

about	O
three	O
leagues	O

we	O

with	O

we	O
were	O
in	O

We	O
therefore	O
trusted	O
ourselves	O
to	O
the	O
mercy	O
of	O
the	O
waves	O

and	O
in	O
about	O
half	O

the	O

For	O
my	O

I	O
swam	O
as	O
fortune	O

me	O

was	O
pushed	O
forward	O

I	O
often	O
let	O
my	O

could	O

no	O

when	O
I	O
was	O
almost	O
gone	O

and	O
able	O
to	O
struggle	O
no	O

I	O
found	O
myself	O
within	O

;	O
and	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
the	O
storm	O
was	O
much	O
abated	O

The	O
declivity	O
was	O
so	O
small	O

that	O
I	O
walked	O
near	O
a	O
mile	O
before	O
I	O
got	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O

which	O
I	O
conjectured	O
was	O
about	O
eight	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O

I	O
then	O
advanced	O
forward	O

could	O
not	O

any	O

at	O

I	O
was	O
in	O
so	O
weak	O
a	O
condition	O

that	O
I	O
did	O
not	O

I	O
was	O

with	O

the	O

and	O
about	O

that	O
I	O
drank	O
as	O
I	O
left	O
the	O

,	O
I	O
found	O
myself	O
much	O
inclined	O
to	O
sleep	O

I	O
lay	O
down	O
on	O
the	O
grass	O

which	O
was	O
very	O
short	O
and	O
soft	O

where	O
I	O
slept	O
sounder	O

I	O
awaked	O

as	O
I	O

to	O
lie	O
on	O

I	O
found	O
my	O

the	O

tied	O
down	O
in	O
the	O

I	O
likewise	O

across	O
my	O

from	O
my	O

my	O

I	O
could	O
only	O

upwards	O

the	O
sun	O
began	O
to	O
grow	O
hot	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
light	O
offended	O
my	O

I	O
heard	O
a	O
confused	O
noise	O
about	O
me	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
posture	O
I	O
lay	O

could	O
see	O
nothing	O

the	O

In	O
a	O
little	O
time	O
I	O
felt	O
something	O
alive	O
moving	O
on	O
my	O
left	O
leg	O

which	O
advancing	O
gently	O
forward	O
over	O
my	O

came	O
almost	O
up	O

when	O
,	O
bending	O
my	O
eyes	O
downwards	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
I	O
could	O

I	O
perceived	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
human	O

not	O
six	O

with	O
a	O

a	O
quiver	O
at	O
his	O

In	O
the	O

I	O
felt	O
at	O

forty	O
more	O
of	O
the	O

kind	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
I	O
conjectured	O

following	O
the	O

I	O
was	O
in	O
the	O

astonishment	O

and	O
roared	O
so	O
loud	O

that	O
they	O
all	O
ran	O
back	O
in	O
a	O
fright	O

and	O
some	O

them	O

as	O
I	O

I	O
had	O
the	O

out	O

up	O

I	O
discovered	O

me	O

and	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
with	O
a	O
violent	O
pull	O

which	O
gave	O
me	O
excessive	O
pain	O

I	O
a	O
little	O
loosened	O
the	O

that	O
tied	O
down	O
my	O

there	O
was	O
a	O

in	O
a	O
very	O
shrill	O

and	O
after	O

I	O

cry	O
aloud	O

Tolgo	O

;	O
when	O
in	O
an	O

I	O
felt	O
above	O
a	O
hundred	O
arrows	O
discharged	O
on	O
my	O

which	O
,	O
pricked	O
me	O
like	O
so	O
many	O

;	O
and	O
besides	O
,	O
they	O
shot	O
another	O
flight	O
into	O
the	O

as	O
we	O
do	O
bombs	O
in	O
Europe	PNM

by	O
good	O

had	O
on	O
a	O
buff	O
jerkin	O

which	O
they	O
could	O
not	O

I	O
thought	O
it	O
the	O
most	O

method	O
to	O
lie	O
still	O

and	O
my	O

as	O
for	O
the	O

I	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O

might	O
be	O
a	O

army	O

they	O
discharged	O
no	O

by	O
the	O

about	O
four	O

from	O

over	O

I	O
heard	O
a	O

the	O

I	O
then	O
made	O
another	O
sign	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
wanted	O
drink	O
.	O

They	O
found	O
by	O
my	O
eating	O
that	O
a	O
small	O
quantity	O
would	O
not	O
suffice	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
being	O
a	O
most	O
ingenious	O
people	O
,	O
they	O
slung	O
up	O
,	O
with	O
great	O
dexterity	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
largest	O
hogsheads	O
,	O
then	O
rolled	O
it	O
towards	O
my	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
beat	O
out	O
the	O
top	O
;	O
I	O
drank	O
it	O
off	O
at	O
a	O
draught	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
might	O
well	O
do	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
hold	O
half	O
a	O
pint	O
,	O
and	O
tasted	O
like	O
a	O
small	O
wine	O
of	O
Burgundy	O
,	O
but	O
much	O
more	O
delicious	O
.	O

They	O
brought	O
me	O
a	O
second	O
hogshead	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
drank	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
manner	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
signs	O
for	O
more	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
had	O
none	O
to	O
give	O
me	O

When	O
I	O
had	O
performed	O
these	O
wonders	O
,	O
they	O
shouted	O
for	O
joy	O
,	O
and	O
danced	O
upon	O
my	O
breast	O
,	O
repeating	O
several	O
times	O
as	O
they	O
did	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
_	O

They	O
made	O
me	O
a	O
sign	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
throw	O
down	O
the	O
two	O
hogsheads	O
,	O
but	O
first	O
warning	O
the	O
people	O
below	O
to	O
stand	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
crying	O
aloud	O

;	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
saw	O
the	O
vessels	O
in	O

,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
universal	O
shout	O
of	O
_	O
Hekinah	O

_	O
.	O

I	O
confess	O
I	O
was	O
often	O
tempted	O
,	O
while	O
they	O
were	O
passing	O
backwards	O
and	O
forwards	O
on	O
my	O
body	O
,	O
to	O
seize	O
forty	O
or	O
fifty	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
that	O
came	O
in	O
my	O
reach	O
,	O
and	O
dash	O
them	O
against	O
the	O
ground	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
remembrance	O
of	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
felt	O
,	O
which	O
probably	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
the	O
worst	O
they	O
could	O
do	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
promise	O
of	O
honour	O
I	O
made	O
them	O
--	O
for	O
so	O
I	O
interpreted	O
my	O
submissive	O
behaviour	O
--	O
soon	O
drove	O
out	O
these	O
imaginations	O
.	O

Besides	O
,	O
I	O
now	O
considered	O
myself	O
as	O
bound	O
by	O
the	O
laws	O
of	O
hospitality	O
,	O
to	O
a	O
people	O
who	O
had	O
treated	O
me	O
with	O
so	O
much	O
expense	O
and	O
magnificence	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
thoughts	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
sufficiently	O
wonder	O
at	O
the	O
intrepidity	O
of	O
these	O
diminutive	O
mortals	O
,	O
who	O
durst	O
venture	O
to	O
mount	O
and	O
walk	O
upon	O
my	O
body	O
,	O
while	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
hands	O
was	O
at	O
liberty	O
,	O
without	O
trembling	O
at	O
the	O
very	O
sight	O
of	O
so	O
prodigious	O
a	O
creature	O
as	O
I	O
must	O
appear	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

After	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
observed	O
that	O
I	O
made	O
no	O
more	O
demands	O
for	O
meat	O
,	O
there	O
appeared	O
before	O
me	O
a	O
person	O
of	O
high	O
rank	O
from	O
his	O
imperial	O

His	O
excellency	O

having	O
mounted	O
on	O
the	O
small	O
of	O
my	O

advanced	O
forwards	O
up	O
to	O
my	O

with	O
about	O
a	O
dozen	O
of	O
his	O
retinue	O
;	O
and	O
producing	O
his	O
credentials	O
under	O
the	O
signet	O
royal	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
applied	O
close	O
to	O
my	O
eyes	O
,	O
spoke	O
about	O
ten	O
minutes	O
without	O
any	O
signs	O
of	O
anger	O
,	O
but	O
with	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
determinate	O
resolution	O
,	O
often	O
pointing	O
forwards	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
afterwards	O
found	O
,	O
was	O
towards	O
the	O
capital	O
city	O
,	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
distant	O
;	O
whither	O
it	O
was	O
agreed	O
by	O
his	O
majesty	O
in	O
council	O
that	O
I	O
must	O
be	O
conveyed	O
.	O

I	O
answered	O
in	O
few	O
words	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
no	O
purpose	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
sign	O
with	O
my	O
hand	O
that	O
was	O
loose	O
,	O
putting	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
-LRB-	O
but	O
over	O
his	O
excellency	O
's	O
head	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
hurting	O
him	O
or	O
his	O
train	O
-RRB-	O
and	O
then	O
to	O
my	O
own	O
head	O
and	O
body	O
,	O
to	O
signify	O
that	O
I	O
desired	O
my	O
liberty	O
.	O

It	O
appeared	O
that	O
he	O
understood	O
me	O
well	O
enough	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
shook	O
his	O
head	O
by	O
way	O
of	O
disapprobation	O
,	O
and	O
held	O
his	O
hand	O
in	O
a	O
posture	O
to	O
show	O
that	O
I	O
must	O
be	O
carried	O
as	O
a	O
prisoner	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
he	O
made	O
other	O
signs	O
to	O
let	O
me	O
understand	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
meat	O
and	O
drink	O
enough	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
good	O
treatment	O
.	O

Whereupon	O
I	O
once	O
more	O
thought	O
of	O
attempting	O
to	O
break	O
my	O
bonds	O
;	O
but	O
again	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
felt	O
the	O
smart	O
of	O
their	O
arrows	O
upon	O
my	O
face	O
and	O
hands	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
all	O
in	O
blisters	O
,	O
and	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
darts	O
still	O
sticking	O
in	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
observing	O
likewise	O
that	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
my	O
enemies	O
increased	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
tokens	O
to	O
let	O
them	O
know	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
do	O
with	O
me	O
what	O
they	O
pleased	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
,	O
the	O
_	O

and	O
his	O
train	O
withdrew	O
,	O
with	O
much	O
civility	O
and	O
cheerful	O
countenances	O
.	O

Soon	O
after	O
I	O
heard	O
a	O
general	O
shout	O
,	O
with	O
frequent	O
repetitions	O
of	O
the	O
words	O
_	O
Peplom	O
selan	O
_	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
felt	O
great	O
numbers	O
of	O
people	O
on	O
my	O
left	O
side	O
relaxing	O
the	O
cords	O
to	O
such	O
a	O
degree	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
turn	O
upon	O
my	O
right	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
ease	O
myself	O
with	O
making	O
water	O
;	O
which	O
I	O
very	O
plentifully	O
did	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
great	O
astonishment	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
;	O
who	O
,	O
conjecturing	O
by	O
my	O
motion	O
what	O
I	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
immediately	O
opened	O
to	O
the	O
right	O
and	O
left	O
on	O
that	O
side	O
,	O
to	O
avoid	O
the	O
torrent	O
,	O
which	O
fell	O
with	O
such	O
noise	O
and	O
violence	O
from	O
me	O
.	O

But	O
before	O
this	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
daubed	O
my	O
face	O
and	O
both	O
my	O
hands	O
with	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
ointment	O
,	O
very	O
pleasant	O
to	O
the	O
smell	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
,	O
removed	O
all	O
the	O
smart	O
of	O
their	O
arrows	O
.	O

These	O
circumstances	O
,	O
added	O
to	O
the	O
refreshment	O
I	O
had	O
received	O
by	O
their	O
victuals	O
and	O
drink	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
very	O
nourishing	O
,	O
disposed	O
me	O
to	O
sleep	O
.	O

I	O
slept	O
about	O
eight	O
hours	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
afterwards	O
assured	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
no	O
wonder	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
physicians	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
emperor	O
's	O
order	O
,	O
had	O
mingled	O
a	O
sleepy	O
potion	O
in	O
the	O
hogsheads	O
of	O
wine	O
.	O

It	O
seems	O
,	O
that	O
upon	O
the	O
first	O
moment	O
I	O
was	O
discovered	O
sleeping	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
after	O
my	O
landing	O
,	O
the	O
emperor	O
had	O
early	O
notice	O
of	O
it	O
by	O
an	O
express	O
;	O
and	O
determined	O
in	O
council	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
tied	O
in	O
the	O
manner	O
I	O
have	O
related	O
,	O
-LRB-	O
which	O
was	O
done	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
while	O
I	O
slept	O
;-RRB-	O
that	O
plenty	O
of	O
meat	O
and	O
drink	O
should	O
be	O
sent	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
machine	O
prepared	O
to	O
carry	O
me	O
to	O
the	O
capital	O
city	O
.	O

This	O
resolution	O
perhaps	O
may	O
appear	O
very	O
bold	O
and	O
dangerous	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
confident	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
imitated	O
by	O
any	O
prince	O
in	O
Europe	PNM
on	O
the	O
like	O
occasion	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
extremely	O
prudent	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
generous	O
:	O
for	O
,	O
supposing	O
these	O
people	O
had	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
kill	O
me	O
with	O
their	O
spears	O
and	O
arrows	O
,	O
while	O
I	O
was	O
asleep	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
certainly	O
have	O
awaked	O
with	O
the	O
first	O
sense	O
of	O
smart	O
,	O
which	O
might	O
so	O
far	O
have	O
roused	O
my	O
rage	O
and	O
strength	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
have	O
enabled	O
me	O
to	O
break	O
the	O
strings	O
wherewith	O
I	O
was	O
tied	O
;	O
after	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
make	O
resistance	O

so	O
they	O
could	O
expect	O
no	O
mercy	O

These	O
people	O
are	O
most	O
excellent	O
mathematicians	O
,	O
and	O
arrived	O
to	O
a	O
great	O
perfection	O
in	O

by	O
the	O
countenance	O

encouragement	O
of	O

who	O

set	O
out	O

It	O
was	O

But	O
the	O
principal	O
difficulty	O
was	O
to	O
raise	O

me	O
in	O
this	O

Eighty	O

very	O
strong	O
cords	O

thus	O

in	O
less	O

three	O

I	O
was	O
raised	O

there	O

About	O
four	O

after	O
we	O

I	O
awaked	O
by	O
a	O

made	O
me	O

the	O
cause	O
of	O
my	O
waking	O
so	O
suddenly	O

We	O
made	O
a	O
long	O
march	O
the	O
remaining	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
rested	O
at	O
night	O
with	O
five	O
hundred	O
guards	O
on	O
each	O
side	O
of	O
me	O
,	O
half	O
with	O

half	O
with	O

ready	O
to	O

me	O
if	O
I	O
should	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
at	O
sun-rise	O
we	O
continued	O
our	O
march	O

and	O
arrived	O
within	O
two	O

yards	O
of	O
the	O
city	O

about	O
noon	O

The	O
emperor	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
his	O
court	O
,	O
came	O
out	O
to	O
meet	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
his	O
great	O
officers	O
would	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
suffer	O
his	O
majesty	O
to	O
endanger	O
his	O
person	O
by	O
mounting	O
on	O
my	O

At	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
the	O
carriage	O
stopped	O
there	O
stood	O
an	O
ancient	O
temple	O
,	O
esteemed	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
largest	O
in	O
the	O
whole	O
kingdom	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
polluted	O
some	O
years	O
before	O
by	O
an	O
unnatural	O
murder	O
,	O
was	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
zeal	O
of	O
those	O
people	O
,	O
looked	O
upon	O
as	O
profane	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
had	O
been	O
applied	O
to	O
common	O
use	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
ornaments	O
and	O
furniture	O
carried	O
away	O

In	O
this	O
edifice	O
it	O
was	O
determined	O
I	O
should	O
lodge	O

The	O
great	O
gate	O
fronting	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
was	O
about	O
four	O
feet	O
high	O
,	O
and	O
almost	O
two	O
feet	O
wide	O

through	O
which	O
I	O
could	O
easily	O
creep	O

On	O
each	O

of	O
the	O
gate	O
was	O
a	O

a	O

at	O

Here	O
the	O
emperor	O
ascended	O
,	O
with	O
many	O
principal	O
lords	O
of	O
his	O
court	O
,	O
to	O
have	O
an	O
opportunity	O
of	O
viewing	O
me	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
told	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
see	O
them	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
reckoned	O
that	O
above	O
a	O
hundred	O
thousand	O
inhabitants	O
came	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
town	O
upon	O
the	O
same	O
errand	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
spite	O
of	O
my	O
guards	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
there	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
fewer	O
than	O
ten	O
thousand	O
at	O
several	O
times	O
,	O
who	O
mounted	O
my	O
body	O
by	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
ladders	O

But	O
a	O
proclamation	O
was	O
soon	O
issued	O
,	O
to	O
forbid	O
it	O
upon	O
pain	O
of	O
death	O

When	O
the	O
workmen	O
found	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
break	O
loose	O
,	O
they	O
cut	O
all	O
the	O

that	O
bound	O
me	O
;	O
whereupon	O
I	O
rose	O
up	O

with	O
as	O
melancholy	O
a	O
disposition	O
as	O
ever	O
I	O
had	O
in	O
my	O
life	O

But	O
the	O
noise	O

of	O
the	O

at	O
seeing	O
me	O
rise	O

The	O

that	O
held	O
my	O

were	O
about	O
two	O

The	O
emperor	O
of	O
Lilliput	PNM
,	O
attended	O
by	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
nobility	O

comes	O

the	O

in	O
his	O
confinement	O

The	O

Learned	O

appointed	O
to	O

the	O
author	O
their	O
language	O

He	O
gains	O
favour	O
by	O
his	O
mild	O
disposition	O

His	O
pockets	O
are	O
searched	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
sword	O
and	O
pistols	O
taken	O
from	O
him	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
found	O
myself	O
on	O
my	O
feet	O
,	O
I	O
looked	O
about	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
must	O
confess	O
I	O
never	O
beheld	O
a	O
more	O
entertaining	O
prospect	O
.	O

The	O
country	O
around	O
appeared	O
like	O
a	O
continued	O
garden	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
enclosed	O
fields	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
generally	O
forty	O
feet	O
square	O
,	O
resembled	O
so	O
many	O
beds	O
of	O
flowers	O
.	O

These	O
fields	O
were	O
intermingled	O
with	O
woods	O
of	O
half	O
a	O
stang	O
,	O
-LCB-	O
301	O
-RCB-	O
and	O
the	O
tallest	O
trees	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
judge	O
,	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
seven	O
feet	O
high	O
.	O

I	O
viewed	O
the	O
town	O
on	O
my	O
left	O
hand	O
,	O
which	O
looked	O
like	O
the	O
painted	O
scene	O
of	O
a	O
city	O
in	O
a	O
theatre	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
been	O
for	O
some	O
hours	O
extremely	O
pressed	O
by	O
the	O
necessities	O
of	O
nature	O
;	O
which	O
was	O
no	O
wonder	O
,	O
it	O
being	O
almost	O
two	O
days	O
since	O
I	O
had	O
last	O
disburdened	O
myself	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
under	O
great	O
difficulties	O
between	O
urgency	O
and	O
shame	O
.	O

The	O
best	O
expedient	O
I	O
could	O
think	O
of	O
,	O
was	O
to	O
creep	O
into	O
my	O
house	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
accordingly	O
did	O
;	O
and	O
shutting	O
the	O
gate	O
after	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
length	O
of	O
my	O
chain	O
would	O
suffer	O
,	O
and	O
discharged	O
my	O
body	O
of	O
that	O
uneasy	O
load	O
.	O

But	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
time	O
I	O
was	O
ever	O
guilty	O
of	O
so	O
uncleanly	O
an	O
action	O
;	O
for	O
which	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
but	O
hope	O
the	O
candid	O
reader	O
will	O
give	O
some	O
allowance	O
,	O
after	O
he	O
has	O
maturely	O
and	O
impartially	O
considered	O
my	O
case	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
distress	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
.	O

From	O
this	O
time	O
my	O
constant	O
practice	O
was	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
rose	O
,	O
to	O
perform	O
that	O
business	O
in	O
open	O
air	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
full	O
extent	O
of	O
my	O
chain	O
;	O
and	O
due	O
care	O
was	O
taken	O
every	O
morning	O
before	O
company	O
came	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
offensive	O
matter	O
should	O
be	O
carried	O
off	O
in	O
wheel-barrows	O
,	O
by	O
two	O
servants	O
appointed	O
for	O
that	O
purpose	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
dwelt	O
so	O
long	O
upon	O
a	O
circumstance	O
that	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
at	O
first	O
sight	O
,	O
may	O
appear	O
not	O
very	O
momentous	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
thought	O
it	O
necessary	O
to	O
justify	O
my	O
character	O
,	O
in	O
point	O
of	O
cleanliness	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
world	O
;	O
which	O

I	O

upon	O
this	O

call	O
in	O

When	O
this	O
adventure	O
was	O
at	O
an	O
end	O
,	O
I	O
came	O
back	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
house	O
,	O
having	O
occasion	O
for	O
fresh	O
air	O
.	O

The	O
emperor	O
was	O
already	O
descended	O
from	O
the	O
tower	O
,	O
and	O
advancing	O
on	O
horseback	O
towards	O
me	O

which	O
had	O

to	O

cost	O
him	O

for	O
the	O
beast	O
,	O
though	O
very	O
well	O
trained	O
,	O
yet	O
wholly	O
unused	O
to	O
such	O
a	O
sight	O
,	O
which	O
appeared	O
as	O
if	O
a	O
mountain	O
moved	O
before	O
him	O

reared	O
up	O
on	O
its	O

but	O
that	O
prince	O
,	O
who	O
is	O
an	O
excellent	O
horseman	O
,	O
kept	O
his	O
seat	O
,	O
till	O
his	O
attendants	O
ran	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
held	O
the	O
bridle	O
,	O
while	O
his	O
majesty	O
had	O
time	O
to	O
dismount	O
.	O

When	O
he	O
alighted	O
,	O
he	O
surveyed	O
me	O
round	O
with	O
great	O
admiration	O
;	O
but	O
kept	O
beyond	O
the	O
length	O
of	O
my	O
chain	O
.	O

He	O
ordered	O
his	O
cooks	O
and	O
butlers	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
already	O
prepared	O
,	O
to	O
give	O
me	O
victuals	O
and	O
drink	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
pushed	O
forward	O
in	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
vehicles	O
upon	O
wheels	O
,	O
till	O
I	O
could	O
reach	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
took	O
these	O
vehicles	O
and	O
soon	O
emptied	O
them	O
all	O
;	O
twenty	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
filled	O
with	O
meat	O
,	O
and	O
ten	O
with	O
liquor	O
;	O
each	O
of	O
the	O
former	O
afforded	O
me	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
good	O
mouthfuls	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
emptied	O
the	O
liquor	O
of	O
ten	O
vessels	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
contained	O
in	O
earthen	O
vials	O

into	O
one	O

drinking	O
it	O
off	O
at	O
a	O

The	O
empress	O

and	O
young	O
princes	O
of	O
the	O
blood	O
of	O
both	O
sexes	O
,	O
attended	O
by	O
many	O
ladies	O
,	O
sat	O
at	O
some	O
distance	O
in	O
their	O
chairs	O

but	O
upon	O
the	O
accident	O
that	O
happened	O
to	O
the	O
emperor	O
's	O
horse	O
,	O
they	O
alighted	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
near	O
his	O
person	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
am	O
now	O
going	O
to	O
describe	O
.	O

He	O
is	O
taller	O
by	O
almost	O
the	O
breadth	O
of	O
my	O
nail	O
,	O
than	O
any	O
of	O
his	O
court	O
;	O
which	O
alone	O
is	O
enough	O
to	O
strike	O
an	O
awe	O
into	O
the	O
beholders	O
.	O

His	O
features	O
are	O
strong	O
and	O
masculine	O
,	O
with	O
an	O
Austrian	O
lip	O
and	O
arched	O
nose	O
,	O
his	O
complexion	O
olive	O
,	O
his	O
countenance	O
erect	O
,	O
his	O
body	O
and	O
limbs	O
well	O
proportioned	O
,	O
all	O
his	O
motions	O
graceful	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
deportment	O
majestic	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
then	O
past	O
his	O
prime	O
,	O
being	O
twenty-eight	O
years	O
and	O
three	O
quarters	O
old	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
reigned	O
about	O
seven	O
in	O
great	O
felicity	O
,	O
and	O
generally	O
victorious	O
.	O

For	O
the	O
better	O
convenience	O
of	O
beholding	O
him	O
,	O
I	O
lay	O
on	O
my	O
side	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
my	O
face	O
was	O
parallel	O
to	O
his	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
stood	O
but	O
three	O
yards	O
off	O
:	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
had	O
him	O
since	O
many	O
times	O
in	O
my	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
deceived	O
in	O
the	O
description	O
.	O

His	O
dress	O
was	O
very	O
plain	O
and	O
simple	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
fashion	O
of	O
it	O
between	O
the	O
Asiatic	O
and	O
the	O
European	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
had	O
on	O
his	O
head	O
a	O
light	O
helmet	O
of	O
gold	O
,	O
adorned	O
with	O
jewels	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
plume	O
on	O
the	O
crest	O
.	O

He	O
held	O
his	O
sword	O
drawn	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
to	O
defend	O
himself	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
should	O
happen	O
to	O
break	O
loose	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
almost	O
three	O
inches	O
long	O
;	O
the	O
hilt	O
and	O
scabbard	O
were	O
gold	O
enriched	O
with	O
diamonds	O
.	O

His	O
voice	O
was	O
shrill	O
,	O
but	O
very	O
clear	O
and	O
articulate	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
could	O
distinctly	O
hear	O
it	O
when	O
I	O
stood	O
up	O
.	O

The	O
ladies	O
and	O
courtiers	O
were	O
all	O
most	O
magnificently	O
clad	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
spot	O
they	O
stood	O
upon	O
seemed	O
to	O
resemble	O
a	O
petticoat	O
spread	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
embroidered	O
with	O
figures	O
of	O
gold	O
and	O
silver	O

His	O
imperial	O
majesty	O
spoke	O
often	O
to	O
me	O

and	O
I	O
returned	O
answers	O

neither	O

After	O

the	O
court	O
retired	O

and	O
I	O
was	O
left	O
with	O
a	O

to	O
prevent	O
the	O
impertinence	O

and	O
probably	O
the	O
malice	O
of	O
the	O

who	O
were	O
very	O
impatient	O
to	O
crowd	O
about	O
me	O

as	O
they	O
durst	O
;	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
the	O
impudence	O
to	O
shoot	O
their	O
arrows	O
at	O

I	O
sat	O
on	O

my	O
house	O

whereof	O
one	O
very	O
narrowly	O
missed	O
my	O

But	O
the	O
colonel	O
ordered	O
six	O
of	O
the	O
ringleaders	O
to	O
be	O
seized	O
,	O
and	O
thought	O
no	O
punishment	O
so	O
proper	O

to	O
deliver	O
them	O
bound	O
into	O
my	O
hands	O
;	O
which	O
some	O
of	O
his	O
soldiers	O
accordingly	O
did	O
,	O
pushing	O
them	O
forward	O
with	O
the	O
butt-ends	O
of	O
their	O
pikes	O
into	O
my	O
reach	O

I	O
took	O
them	O
all	O
in	O
my	O
right	O
hand	O
,	O
put	O
five	O
of	O
them	O
into	O
my	O
coat-pocket	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
sixth	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
countenance	O
as	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
eat	O
him	O
alive	O

The	O
poor	O
man	O
squalled	O
terribly	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
colonel	O
and	O
his	O
officers	O
were	O
in	O
much	O
pain	O
,	O
especially	O
when	O
they	O
saw	O
me	O
take	O
out	O
my	O
penknife	O
:	O
but	O
I	O
soon	O
put	O
them	O
out	O
of	O
fear	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
looking	O
mildly	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
cutting	O
the	O
strings	O

was	O
bound	O
with	O
,	O
I	O
set	O
him	O
gently	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
away	O
he	O
ran	O

I	O
treated	O
the	O
rest	O
in	O
the	O

manner	O
,	O
taking	O
them	O
one	O
by	O
one	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
pocket	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
observed	O
both	O
the	O
soldiers	O
and	O
people	O
were	O
highly	O
delighted	O
at	O
this	O
mark	O
of	O
my	O
clemency	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
represented	O
very	O
much	O
to	O
my	O
advantage	O
at	O
court	O

Towards	O
night	O
I	O
got	O
with	O
some	O
difficulty	O
into	O
my	O
house	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
lay	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
continued	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
about	O
a	O
fortnight	O
;	O
during	O
which	O
time	O
,	O
the	O
emperor	O
gave	O
orders	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
bed	O
prepared	O
for	O
me	O
.	O

Six	O
hundred	O
beds	O
of	O
the	O
common	O
measure	O
were	O
brought	O
in	O
carriages	O
,	O
and	O
worked	O
up	O
in	O
my	O
house	O
;	O
a	O
hundred	O
and	O
fifty	O
of	O
their	O
beds	O
,	O
sewn	O
together	O
,	O
made	O
up	O
the	O
breadth	O
and	O
length	O
;	O
and	O
these	O
were	O
four	O
double	O
:	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
kept	O
me	O
but	O
very	O
indifferently	O
from	O
the	O
hardness	O
of	O
the	O
floor	O
,	O
that	O
was	O
of	O
smooth	O
stone	O
.	O

By	O
the	O
same	O
computation	O
,	O
they	O
provided	O
me	O
with	O
sheets	O
,	O
blankets	O
,	O
and	O
coverlets	O
,	O
tolerable	O
enough	O
for	O
one	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
long	O
inured	O
to	O
hardships	O
.	O

As	O
the	O
news	O
of	O
my	O
arrival	O
spread	O
through	O
the	O
kingdom	O
,	O
it	O
brought	O
prodigious	O
numbers	O
of	O
rich	O
,	O
idle	O
,	O
and	O
curious	O
people	O
to	O
see	O
me	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
villages	O
were	O
almost	O
emptied	O
;	O
and	O
great	O
neglect	O
of	O
tillage	O
and	O
household	O
affairs	O
must	O
have	O
ensued	O
,	O
if	O
his	O
imperial	O
majesty	O
had	O
not	O
provided	O
,	O
by	O
several	O
proclamations	O
and	O
orders	O
of	O
state	O
,	O
against	O
this	O
inconveniency	O
.	O

He	O
directed	O
that	O
those	O
who	O
had	O
already	O
beheld	O
me	O
should	O
return	O
home	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
presume	O
to	O
come	O
within	O
fifty	O
yards	O
of	O
my	O
house	O
,	O
without	O
license	O
from	O
the	O
court	O
;	O
whereby	O
the	O
secretaries	O
of	O
state	O
got	O
considerable	O
fees	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
the	O
emperor	O
held	O
frequent	O
councils	O
,	O
to	O
debate	O
what	O
course	O
should	O
be	O
taken	O
with	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
afterwards	O
assured	O
by	O
a	O
particular	O
friend	O
,	O
a	O
person	O
of	O
great	O
quality	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
as	O
much	O
in	O
the	O
secret	O
as	O
any	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
court	O
was	O
under	O
many	O
difficulties	O
concerning	O
me	O
.	O

They	O
apprehended	O
my	O
breaking	O
loose	O
;	O
that	O
my	O
diet	O
would	O
be	O
very	O
expensive	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
cause	O
a	O
famine	O
.	O

Sometimes	O
they	O
determined	O
to	O
starve	O
me	O
;	O
or	O
at	O
least	O
to	O
shoot	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
face	O
and	O
hands	O
with	O
poisoned	O
arrows	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
soon	O
despatch	O
me	O
;	O
but	O
again	O
they	O
considered	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
stench	O
of	O
so	O
large	O
a	O
carcass	O
might	O
produce	O
a	O
plague	O
in	O
the	O
metropolis	O
,	O
and	O
probably	O
spread	O
through	O
the	O
whole	O
kingdom	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
midst	O
of	O
these	O
consultations	O
,	O
several	O
officers	O
of	O
the	O
army	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
door	O
of	O
the	O
great	O
council-chamber	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
being	O
admitted	O
,	O
gave	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
my	O
behaviour	O
to	O
the	O
six	O
criminals	O
above-mentioned	O
;	O
which	O
made	O
so	O
favourable	O
an	O
impression	O
in	O
the	O
breast	O
of	O
his	O
majesty	O
and	O
the	O
whole	O
board	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
behalf	O
,	O
that	O
an	O
imperial	O
commission	O
was	O
issued	O
out	O

obliging	O
all	O
the	O
villages	O

nine	O

in	O
every	O

six	O
beeves	O

forty	O

and	O
other	O
victuals	O
for	O

with	O
a	O
proportionable	O
quantity	O
of	O
bread	O

and	O
wine	O

and	O
other	O
liquors	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
due	O
payment	O
of	O
which	O

his	O

gave	O
assignments	O
upon	O
his	O

him	O
in	O

at	O
their	O

An	O
establishment	O
was	O
also	O
made	O
of	O
six	O
hundred	O
persons	O
to	O
be	O
my	O
domestics	O

who	O
had	O
board-wages	O
allowed	O
for	O
their	O

and	O
tents	O
built	O
for	O
them	O
very	O
conveniently	O
on	O
each	O
side	O
of	O
my	O
door	O

It	O
was	O
likewise	O
ordered	O
,	O
that	O
three	O
hundred	O
tailors	O
should	O
make	O
me	O
a	O
suit	O
of	O

,	O
after	O
the	O
fashion	O
of	O
the	O

;	O
that	O
six	O
of	O
his	O

should	O
be	O
employed	O
to	O
instruct	O
me	O
in	O
their	O

,	O
that	O
the	O

All	O
these	O
orders	O
were	O
duly	O
put	O
in	O
execution	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
about	O
three	O
weeks	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
great	O
progress	O
in	O

the	O

We	O

in	O
some	O

and	O
the	O
first	O

and	O
indeed	O
upon	O
the	O

people	O
in	O

I	O
began	O
to	O
conceive	O
hopes	O
of	O
getting	O
my	O
liberty	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O

I	O
took	O
all	O

methods	O
to	O
cultivate	O
this	O

disposition	O

The	O

by	O

to	O
be	O
less	O

I	O
would	O

five	O

dance	O
on	O

at	O

at	O

I	O
had	O
now	O
made	O
a	O
good	O
progress	O
in	O

speaking	O

The	O
emperor	O
had	O
a	O
mind	O
one	O
day	O
to	O
entertain	O
me	O
with	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
shows	O

wherein	O
they	O
exceed	O
all	O

have	O
known	O

both	O
for	O
dexterity	O
and	O
magnificence	O

I	O
was	O
diverted	O
with	O
none	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
rope-dancers	O

performed	O
upon	O
a	O

This	O

by	O
those	O

are	O

for	O
great	O

the	O

to	O

the	O

of	O
the	O

much	O
upon	O
a	O

These	O

are	O

with	O

whereof	O
great	O
numbers	O
are	O
on	O

I	O
myself	O
have	O

But	O
the	O
danger	O
is	O
much	O
greater	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
ministers	O
themselves	O
are	O
commanded	O
to	O
show	O
their	O
dexterity	O
;	O
for	O

by	O

to	O
excel	O
themselves	O

their	O

they	O
strain	O
so	O

that	O

is	O

a	O
year	O

There	O
is	O
likewise	O
another	O
diversion	O

which	O
is	O
only	O
shown	O
before	O
the	O

and	O
first	O

upon	O

The	O

These	O

for	O
those	O

the	O

by	O
a	O

The	O
ceremony	O

where	O
the	O

from	O
the	O

such	O
as	O
I	O

The	O

both	O

Sometimes	O
the	O

this	O

The	O

would	O
come	O
up	O
to	O
my	O
very	O
feet	O
without	O

The	O
riders	O
would	O
leap	O

over	O
my	O

as	O
I	O
held	O
it	O
on	O
the	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
emperor	O

huntsmen	O

upon	O
a	O

took	O
my	O
foot	O

and	O
all	O
;	O
which	O
was	O
indeed	O
a	O
prodigious	O
leap	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
good	O
fortune	O
to	O
divert	O
the	O
emperor	O
one	O
day	O
after	O
a	O
very	O
extraordinary	O
manner	O
.	O

I	O
desired	O
he	O
would	O
order	O
several	O
sticks	O
of	O
two	O
feet	O
high	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
thickness	O
of	O
an	O
ordinary	O
cane	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
brought	O
me	O
;	O
whereupon	O
his	O
majesty	O
commanded	O
the	O
master	O
of	O
his	O
woods	O
to	O
give	O
directions	O
accordingly	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
six	O
woodmen	O
arrived	O
with	O
as	O
many	O
carriages	O
,	O
drawn	O
by	O
eight	O
horses	O
to	O
each	O
.	O

I	O
took	O
nine	O
of	O
these	O
sticks	O
,	O
and	O
fixing	O
them	O
firmly	O
in	O
the	O
ground	O
in	O
a	O
quadrangular	O
figure	O
,	O
two	O
feet	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
square	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
four	O
other	O
sticks	O
,	O
and	O
tied	O
them	O
parallel	O
at	O
each	O
corner	O
,	O
about	O
two	O
feet	O
from	O
the	O
ground	O
;	O
then	O
I	O
fastened	O
my	O
handkerchief	O
to	O
the	O
nine	O
sticks	O
that	O
stood	O
erect	O
;	O
and	O
extended	O
it	O
on	O
all	O
sides	O
,	O
till	O
it	O
was	O
tight	O
as	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
a	O
drum	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
four	O
parallel	O
sticks	O
,	O
rising	O
about	O
five	O
inches	O
higher	O
than	O
the	O
handkerchief	O
,	O
served	O
as	O
ledges	O
on	O
each	O
side	O

When	O
I	O
had	O
finished	O
my	O
work	O
,	O
I	O
desired	O
the	O
emperor	O
to	O
let	O
a	O
troop	O
of	O
his	O
best	O
horses	O
twenty-four	O
in	O
number	O
,	O
come	O
and	O
exercise	O
upon	O
this	O
plain	O
.	O

His	O
majesty	O
approved	O
of	O
the	O
proposal	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
took	O
them	O
up	O
,	O
one	O
by	O
one	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
hands	O
,	O
ready	O
mounted	O
and	O
armed	O

with	O
the	O
proper	O
officers	O
to	O
exercise	O
them	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
got	O
into	O
order	O
they	O
divided	O
into	O
two	O
parties	O
,	O
performed	O
mock	O
skirmishes	O
,	O
discharged	O
blunt	O
arrows	O

drew	O
their	O
swords	O
,	O
fled	O
and	O
pursued	O
,	O
attacked	O
and	O
retired	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
short	O
discovered	O
the	O
best	O
military	O
discipline	O
I	O
ever	O
beheld	O
.	O

The	O
parallel	O
sticks	O
secured	O
them	O
and	O
their	O
horses	O
from	O
falling	O
over	O
the	O
stage	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
emperor	O
was	O
so	O
much	O
delighted	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
ordered	O
this	O
entertainment	O
to	O
be	O
repeated	O
several	O
days	O
,	O
and	O
once	O
was	O
pleased	O
to	O
be	O
lifted	O
up	O
and	O
give	O
the	O
word	O
of	O
command	O
;	O
and	O
with	O
great	O
difficulty	O
persuaded	O
even	O
the	O
empress	O
herself	O
to	O
let	O
me	O
hold	O
her	O
in	O
her	O
close	O
chair	O
within	O
two	O
yards	O
of	O
the	O

when	O
she	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
full	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
performance	O

It	O
was	O
my	O
good	O
fortune	O
,	O
that	O
no	O

happened	O
in	O
these	O
entertainments	O
;	O
only	O

a	O

belonged	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
captains	O

pawing	O
with	O
his	O

struck	O
a	O

in	O
my	O

and	O
his	O
foot	O
slipping	O

he	O
overthrew	O
his	O
rider	O
and	O
himself	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
immediately	O
relieved	O
them	O
both	O
,	O
and	O
covering	O
the	O
hole	O
with	O
one	O

I	O
set	O
down	O
the	O

with	O
the	O

in	O
the	O

I	O
took	O
them	O
up	O

The	O
horse	O
that	O
fell	O

in	O
the	O

but	O
the	O

got	O
no	O
hurt	O
;	O

I	O
repaired	O
my	O

as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
could	O

I	O
would	O

About	O
two	O

some	O

they	O
found	O
that	O

first	O
request	O
I	O
made	O
,	O
after	O
I	O
had	O
obtained	O
my	O
liberty	O
,	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
license	O
to	O
see	O
Mildendo	O
,	O
the	O
metropolis	O
;	O
which	O
the	O
emperor	O
easily	O
granted	O
me	O
,	O
but	O
with	O
a	O
special	O
charge	O
to	O
do	O
no	O
hurt	O
either	O
to	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
or	O
their	O
houses	O
.	O

The	O
people	O
had	O
notice	O
,	O
by	O
proclamation	O
,	O
of	O
my	O
design	O
to	O
visit	O
the	O
town	O
.	O

The	O
wall	O
which	O
encompassed	O
it	O
is	O
two	O
feet	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
high	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
least	O
eleven	O
inches	O
broad	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
a	O
coach	O
and	O
horses	O
may	O
be	O
driven	O
very	O
safely	O
round	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
flanked	O
with	O
strong	O
towers	O
at	O
ten	O
feet	O
distance	O
.	O

I	O
stepped	O
over	O
the	O
great	O
western	O
gate	O
,	O
and	O
passed	O
very	O
gently	O
,	O
and	O
sidling	O
,	O
through	O
the	O
two	O
principal	O
streets	O
,	O
only	O
in	O
my	O
short	O
waistcoat	O
,	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
damaging	O
the	O
roofs	O
and	O
eaves	O
of	O
the	O
houses	O
with	O
the	O
skirts	O
of	O
my	O
coat	O
.	O

I	O
walked	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
circumspection	O
,	O
to	O
avoid	O
treading	O
on	O
any	O
stragglers	O
who	O
might	O
remain	O
in	O
the	O
streets	O
,	O
although	O
the	O
orders	O
were	O
very	O
strict	O
,	O
that	O
all	O
people	O
should	O
keep	O
in	O
their	O
houses	O
,	O
at	O
their	O
own	O
peril	O
.	O

The	O
garret	O
windows	O
and	O
tops	O
of	O
houses	O
were	O
so	O
crowded	O
with	O
spectators	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
thought	O
in	O
all	O
my	O
travels	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
seen	O
a	O
more	O
populous	O
place	O
.	O

The	O
city	O
is	O
an	O
exact	O
square	O
,	O
each	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
wall	O
being	O
five	O
hundred	O
feet	O
long	O
.	O

The	O
two	O
great	O
streets	O
,	O
which	O
run	O
across	O
and	O
divide	O
it	O
into	O
four	O
quarters	O
,	O
are	O
five	O
feet	O
wide	O
.	O

The	O
lanes	O
and	O
alleys	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
enter	O
,	O
but	O
only	O
view	O
them	O
as	O
I	O
passed	O
,	O
are	O
from	O
twelve	O
to	O
eighteen	O
inches	O
.	O

The	O
town	O
is	O
capable	O
of	O
holding	O
five	O
hundred	O
thousand	O
souls	O
:	O
the	O
houses	O
are	O
from	O
three	O
to	O
five	O
stories	O
:	O
the	O
shops	O
and	O
markets	O
well	O
provided	O

The	O
emperor	O
's	O
palace	O
is	O
in	O
the	O
centre	O
of	O
the	O
city	O
where	O
the	O
two	O
great	O
streets	O
meet	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
enclosed	O
by	O
a	O
wall	O
of	O
two	O
feet	O
high	O
,	O
and	O
twenty	O
feet	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
buildings	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
his	O
majesty	O
's	O
permission	O
to	O
step	O
over	O
this	O
wall	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
the	O
space	O
being	O
so	O
wide	O
between	O
that	O
and	O
the	O
palace	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
easily	O
view	O
it	O
on	O
every	O
side	O
.	O

The	O
outward	O
court	O
is	O
a	O
square	O
of	O
forty	O
feet	O
,	O
and	O
includes	O
two	O
other	O
courts	O
:	O
in	O
the	O
inmost	O
are	O
the	O
royal	O
apartments	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
desirous	O
to	O
see	O
,	O
but	O
found	O
it	O
extremely	O
difficult	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
great	O
gates	O
,	O
from	O
one	O
square	O
into	O
another	O
,	O
were	O
but	O
eighteen	O
inches	O
high	O
,	O
and	O
seven	O
inches	O
wide	O
.	O

Now	O
the	O
buildings	O
of	O
the	O
outer	O
court	O
were	O
at	O
least	O
five	O
feet	O
high	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
stride	O
over	O
them	O
without	O
infinite	O
damage	O
to	O
the	O
pile	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
walls	O
were	O
strongly	O
built	O
of	O
hewn	O
stone	O
,	O
and	O
four	O
inches	O
thick	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
the	O
emperor	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
desire	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
see	O
the	O
magnificence	O
of	O
his	O
palace	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
till	O
three	O
days	O
after	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
spent	O
in	O
cutting	O
down	O
with	O
my	O
knife	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
largest	O
trees	O
in	O
the	O
royal	O
park	O
,	O
about	O
a	O
hundred	O
yards	O
distant	O
from	O
the	O
city	O
.	O

Of	O
these	O
trees	O
I	O
made	O
two	O
stools	O
,	O
each	O
about	O
three	O
feet	O
high	O
,	O
and	O
strong	O
enough	O
to	O
bear	O
my	O
weight	O
.	O

The	O
people	O
having	O
received	O
notice	O
a	O
second	O
time	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
again	O
through	O
the	O
city	O
to	O
the	O
palace	O
with	O
my	O
two	O
stools	O
in	O
my	O
hands	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
outer	O
court	O
,	O
I	O
stood	O
upon	O
one	O
stool	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
the	O
other	O
in	O
my	O
hand	O
;	O
this	O
I	O
lifted	O
over	O
the	O
roof	O
,	O
and	O
gently	O
set	O
it	O
down	O
on	O
the	O
space	O
between	O
the	O
first	O
and	O
second	O
court	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
eight	O
feet	O
wide	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
stept	O
over	O
the	O
building	O
very	O
conveniently	O
from	O
one	O
stool	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
and	O
drew	O
up	O
the	O
first	O
after	O
me	O
with	O
a	O
hooked	O
stick	O
.	O

By	O
this	O
contrivance	O
I	O
got	O
into	O
the	O
inmost	O
court	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
lying	O
down	O
upon	O
my	O
side	O
,	O
I	O
applied	O
my	O
face	O
to	O
the	O
windows	O
of	O
the	O
middle	O
stories	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
left	O
open	O
on	O
purpose	O
,	O
and	O
discovered	O
the	O
most	O
splendid	O
apartments	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
imagined	O
.	O

There	O
I	O
saw	O
the	O
empress	O
and	O
the	O
young	O
princes	O
,	O
in	O
their	O
several	O
lodgings	O
,	O
with	O
their	O
chief	O
attendants	O
about	O
them	O
.	O

Her	O
imperial	O
majesty	O
was	O
pleased	O
to	O
smile	O
very	O
graciously	O
upon	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
me	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
window	O
her	O
hand	O
to	O
kiss	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
shall	O
not	O

of	O
these	O

the	O

I	O
walked	O

coast	O

over	O
against	O
Blefuscu	PNM
,	O
where	O
,	O
lying	O
down	O
behind	O
a	O
hillock	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
out	O
my	O
small	O
perspective	O
glass	O
,	O
and	O
viewed	O
the	O
enemy	O
's	O
fleet	O
at	O
anchor	O
,	O
consisting	O
of	O
about	O
fifty	O
men	O
of	O
war	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
transports	O
:	O
I	O
then	O
came	O
back	O
to	O
my	O
house	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
orders	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
warrant	O
-RRB-	O
for	O
a	O
great	O
quantity	O
of	O
the	O
strongest	O
cable	O
and	O
bars	O
of	O
iron	O
.	O

The	O
cable	O
was	O
about	O
as	O
thick	O
as	O

and	O
the	O
bars	O
of	O
the	O
length	O

size	O
of	O

I	O
trebled	O
the	O
cable	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
stronger	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
the	O

reason	O
I	O
twisted	O
three	O

together	O
,	O
bending	O
the	O
extremities	O

Having	O
thus	O
fixed	O

putting	O
off	O
my	O
coat	O

leathern	O
jerkin	O
,	O
about	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
before	O
high	O
water	O

I	O
waded	O
with	O
what	O
haste	O
I	O
could	O
,	O

swam	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
about	O
thirty	O
yards	O

till	O
I	O
felt	O
ground	O
.	O

I	O
arrived	O
at	O
the	O
fleet	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
.	O

The	O
enemy	O
was	O
so	O
frightened	O
when	O
they	O
saw	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
leaped	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
swam	O
to	O
shore	O
,	O
where	O
there	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
fewer	O
than	O
thirty	O
thousand	O
souls	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
took	O
my	O
tackling	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
fastening	O
a	O
hook	O
to	O
the	O
hole	O
at	O
the	O
prow	O
of	O
each	O
,	O
I	O
tied	O
all	O
the	O
cords	O
together	O
at	O
the	O
end	O

While	O
I	O
was	O
thus	O
employed	O
,	O
the	O
enemy	O
discharged	O
several	O
thousand	O
arrows	O
,	O
many	O
of	O
which	O
stuck	O
in	O
my	O
hands	O
and	O
face	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
beside	O
the	O
excessive	O
smart	O
,	O
gave	O
me	O
much	O
disturbance	O
in	O
my	O
work	O
.	O

My	O
greatest	O
apprehension	O
was	O
for	O
mine	O
eyes	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
infallibly	O
lost	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
suddenly	O
thought	O
of	O
an	O
expedient	O
.	O

I	O
kept	O
,	O
among	O
other	O
little	O
necessaries	O
,	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
spectacles	O
in	O
a	O
private	O
pocket	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
observed	O
before	O
,	O
had	O
escaped	O
the	O
emperor	O
's	O
searchers	O
.	O

These	O
I	O
took	O
out	O
and	O
fastened	O
as	O
strongly	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
upon	O
my	O
nose	O
,	O
and	O
thus	O
armed	O
,	O
went	O
on	O
boldly	O
with	O
my	O
work	O
,	O
in	O
spite	O
of	O
the	O
enemy	O
's	O
arrows	O
,	O
many	O
of	O
which	O
struck	O
against	O
the	O
glasses	O
of	O
my	O
spectacles	O
,	O
but	O
without	O
any	O
other	O
effect	O
,	O
further	O
than	O
a	O
little	O
to	O
discompose	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
now	O
fastened	O
all	O
the	O
hooks	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
taking	O
the	O
knot	O
in	O
my	O
hand	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
pull	O
;	O
but	O
not	O
a	O
ship	O
would	O
stir	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
too	O
fast	O
held	O
by	O
their	O
anchors	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
boldest	O
part	O
of	O
my	O
enterprise	O
remained	O
.	O

I	O
therefore	O
let	O
go	O
the	O
cord	O
,	O
and	O
leaving	O
the	O
hooks	O
fixed	O
to	O
the	O
ships	O
,	O
I	O
resolutely	O
cut	O
with	O
my	O
knife	O
the	O
cables	O
that	O
fastened	O
the	O
anchors	O
,	O
receiving	O
about	O
two	O
hundred	O
shots	O
in	O
my	O
face	O
and	O
hands	O
;	O
then	O
I	O
took	O
up	O
the	O
knotted	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
cables	O
,	O
to	O
which	O
my	O
hooks	O
were	O
tied	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
great	O
ease	O
drew	O
fifty	O
of	O
the	O
enemy	O
's	O
largest	O
men	O
of	O
war	O
after	O
me	O
.	O

The	O
Blefuscudians	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
not	O
the	O
least	O
imagination	O
of	O
what	O
I	O
intended	O
,	O
were	O
at	O
first	O
confounded	O
with	O
astonishment	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
seen	O
me	O
cut	O
the	O
cables	O
,	O
and	O
thought	O
my	O
design	O
was	O
only	O
to	O
let	O
the	O
ships	O
run	O
adrift	O
or	O
fall	O
foul	O
on	O
each	O
other	O
:	O
but	O
when	O
they	O
perceived	O
the	O
whole	O
fleet	O
moving	O
in	O
order	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
me	O
pulling	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
,	O
they	O
set	O
up	O
such	O
a	O
scream	O
of	O
grief	O
and	O
despair	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
almost	O
impossible	O
to	O
describe	O
or	O
conceive	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
had	O
got	O
out	O
of	O
danger	O
,	O
I	O
stopped	O
awhile	O
to	O
pick	O
out	O
the	O
arrows	O
that	O
stuck	O
in	O
my	O
hands	O
and	O
face	O
;	O
and	O
rubbed	O
on	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
ointment	O
that	O
was	O
given	O
me	O
at	O
my	O
first	O
arrival	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
formerly	O
mentioned	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
took	O
off	O
my	O
spectacles	O
,	O
and	O
waiting	O
about	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
till	O
the	O
tide	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
fallen	O
,	O
I	O
waded	O
through	O
the	O
middle	O
with	O
my	O
cargo	O
,	O
and	O
arrived	O
safe	O
at	O
the	O
royal	O
port	O
of	O
Lilliput	PNM
.	O

The	O
emperor	O
and	O
his	O
whole	O
court	O
stood	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
expecting	O
the	O
issue	O
of	O
this	O
great	O
adventure	O

They	O
saw	O
the	O
ships	O
move	O
forward	O
in	O
a	O
large	O
half-moon	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
not	O
discern	O
me	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
up	O
to	O
my	O
breast	O
in	O
water	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
advanced	O
to	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
channel	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
yet	O
more	O
in	O
pain	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
was	O
under	O
water	O
to	O
my	O
neck	O

The	O

concluded	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
drowned	O

and	O
that	O
the	O
enemy	O

was	O

about	O
five	O

their	O

was	O
very	O
magnificent	O

the	O

is	O

from	O
the	O

of	O

the	O
palace	O
without	O
trampling	O
on	O
any	O
of	O

I	O

the	O

was	O
at	O

the	O
flame	O
was	O
so	O

they	O
did	O

I	O
might	O

those	O

the	O

of	O
this	O

conceived	O
it	O
-LRB-	O
perhaps	O
erroneously	O
-RRB-	O
rather	O
to	O
be	O
rigorous	O

gentle	O

I	O
sometimes	O
thought	O
of	O
standing	O
my	O
trial	O

for	O

could	O
not	O
deny	O
the	O
facts	O
alleged	O
in	O
the	O

articles	O

yet	O
I	O
hoped	O
they	O
would	O
admit	O

in	O

Once	O
I	O
was	O
strongly	O
bent	O
upon	O
resistance	O

for	O
,	O
while	O
I	O
had	O
liberty	O
the	O
whole	O
strength	O
of	O
that	O
empire	O
could	O
hardly	O
subdue	O
me	O

and	O
I	O
might	O
easily	O
with	O
stones	O
pelt	O
the	O

to	O
pieces	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
soon	O
rejected	O
that	O
project	O
with	O
horror	O
,	O
by	O
remembering	O
the	O
oath	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
to	O

to	O

that	O
his	O

fixed	O
upon	O

I	O
may	O
incur	O
some	O

not	O

owe	O
the	O

of	O
mine	O
eyes	O

and	O
consequently	O
my	O
liberty	O

to	O
my	O

great	O
rashness	O

the	O

Three	O
days	O
after	O
my	O
arrival	O

walking	O
out	O
of	O
curiosity	O
to	O
the	O
north-east	O
coast	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
I	O
observed	O
,	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
league	O
off	O
in	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
somewhat	O
that	O
looked	O
like	O
a	O
boat	O
overturned	O
.	O

I	O
pulled	O
off	O
my	O
shoes	O
and	O
stockings	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
wailing	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
hundred	O
yards	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
the	O
object	O
to	O
approach	O
nearer	O
by	O
force	O
of	O
the	O
tide	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
plainly	O
saw	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
real	O
boat	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
supposed	O
might	O
by	O
some	O
tempest	O
have	O
been	O
driven	O
from	O
a	O
ship	O
.	O

Whereupon	O
,	O
I	O
returned	O
immediately	O
towards	O
the	O
city	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
his	O
imperial	O
majesty	O
to	O
lend	O
me	O
twenty	O
of	O
the	O
tallest	O
vessels	O
he	O
had	O
left	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
his	O
fleet	O
,	O
and	O
three	O
thousand	O
seamen	O
,	O
under	O
the	O
command	O
of	O
his	O
vice-admiral	O
.	O

This	O
fleet	O
sailed	O
round	O
,	O
while	O
I	O
went	O
back	O
the	O
shortest	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
first	O
discovered	O
the	O
boat	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
the	O
tide	O
had	O
driven	O
it	O
still	O
nearer	O
.	O

The	O
seamen	O
were	O
all	O
provided	O
with	O
cordage	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
beforehand	O
twisted	O
to	O
a	O
sufficient	O
strength	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
ships	O
came	O
up	O
,	O
I	O
stripped	O
myself	O
,	O
and	O
waded	O
till	O
I	O
came	O
within	O
a	O
hundred	O
yards	O
off	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
after	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
swim	O
till	O
I	O
got	O
up	O
to	O
it	O

The	O
seamen	O
threw	O
me	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
cord	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
fastened	O
to	O
a	O
hole	O
in	O
the	O
fore-part	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
end	O
to	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
war	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
found	O
all	O
my	O
labour	O
to	O
little	O
purpose	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
being	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
depth	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
work	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
necessity	O
I	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
swim	O
behind	O
,	O
and	O
push	O
the	O
boat	O
forward	O
,	O
as	O
often	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
with	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
hands	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
tide	O
favouring	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
advanced	O
so	O
far	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
just	O
hold	O
up	O
my	O
chin	O
and	O
feel	O
the	O
ground	O
.	O

I	O
rested	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
minutes	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
gave	O
the	O
boat	O
another	O
shove	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
on	O
,	O
till	O
the	O
sea	O
was	O
no	O
higher	O
than	O
my	O
arm-pits	O
;	O
and	O
now	O
,	O
the	O
most	O
laborious	O
part	O
being	O
over	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
out	O
my	O
other	O
cables	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
stowed	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
ships	O

and	O
fastened	O
them	O
first	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
to	O
nine	O
of	O
the	O
vessels	O
which	O
attended	O
me	O
;	O
the	O
wind	O
being	O
favourable	O
,	O
the	O
seamen	O
towed	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
shoved	O

until	O
we	O
arrived	O
within	O
forty	O
yards	O
of	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
waiting	O

the	O

out	O

an	O

one	O
Peter	O
Williams	O

who	O
gave	O
me	O
a	O
good	O
character	O
to	O
the	O
captain	O

This	O
gentleman	O
treated	O
me	O
with	O
kindness	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
I	O
would	O
let	O
him	O
know	O
what	O
place	O
I	O
came	O
from	O
last	O
,	O
and	O
whither	O
I	O
was	O
bound	O
;	O
which	O
I	O
did	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
words	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
thought	O
I	O
was	O
raving	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
dangers	O
I	O
underwent	O
had	O
disturbed	O
my	O
head	O
;	O
whereupon	O
I	O
took	O
my	O
black	O
cattle	O
and	O
sheep	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
pocket	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
after	O
great	O
astonishment	O
,	O
clearly	O
convinced	O
him	O
of	O
my	O
veracity	O

I	O
then	O
showed	O
him	O
the	O

I	O
shall	O
not	O
trouble	O
the	O
reader	O
with	O
a	O
particular	O
account	O
of	O
this	O
voyage	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
very	O
prosperous	O
for	O
the	O
most	O
part	O
.	O

We	O
arrived	O
in	O
the	O
Downs	O
on	O
the	O
13th	O
of	O
April	O
,	O
1702	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
only	O
one	O
misfortune	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
rats	O
on	O
board	O
carried	O
away	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
sheep	O
;	O
I	O
found	O
her	O
bones	O
in	O
a	O
hole	O
,	O
picked	O
clean	O
from	O
the	O
flesh	O
.	O

The	O
rest	O
of	O
my	O
cattle	O
I	O
got	O
safe	O
ashore	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
them	O
a-grazing	O
in	O
a	O
bowling-green	O
at	O
Greenwich	PNM
,	O
where	O
the	O
fineness	O
of	O
the	O
grass	O
made	O
them	O
feed	O
very	O
heartily	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
had	O
always	O
feared	O
the	O
contrary	O
:	O
neither	O
could	O
I	O
possibly	O
have	O
preserved	O
them	O
in	O
so	O
long	O
a	O
voyage	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
captain	O
had	O
not	O
allowed	O
me	O
some	O
of	O
his	O
best	O
biscuit	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
rubbed	O
to	O
powder	O
,	O
and	O
mingled	O
with	O
water	O
,	O
was	O
their	O
constant	O
food	O
.	O

The	O
short	O
time	O
I	O
continued	O
in	O
England	PNM
,	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
considerable	O
profit	O
by	O
showing	O
my	O
cattle	O
to	O
many	O
persons	O
of	O
quality	O
and	O
others	O
:	O
and	O
before	O
I	O
began	O
my	O
second	O
voyage	O
,	O
I	O
sold	O
them	O
for	O
six	O
hundred	O
pounds	O

Since	O
my	O
last	O
return	O
I	O
find	O
the	O
breed	O
is	O
considerably	O
increased	O
,	O
especially	O
the	O
sheep	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
hope	O
will	O
prove	O
much	O
to	O
the	O
advantage	O
of	O
the	O
woollen	O
manufacture	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
fineness	O
of	O

I	O
stayed	O
but	O
two	O
months	O
with	O
my	O

and	O
family	O
,	O
for	O
my	O
insatiable	O

foreign	O

We	O

at	O
the	O

where	O
we	O
landed	O
for	O

discovering	O

we	O
unshipped	O

there	O

for	O
the	O

we	O

We	O

had	O
a	O

we	O
passed	O

continuing	O
so	O
for	O
twenty	O
days	O
together	O
:	O
during	O

we	O
were	O
driven	O
a	O

about	O
three	O

as	O
our	O
captain	O
found	O
by	O
an	O
observation	O
he	O
took	O
the	O
2nd	O
of	O
May	O
,	O
at	O
which	O
time	O
the	O
wind	O
ceased	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
perfect	O
calm	O
,	O
whereat	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
little	O
rejoiced	O
.	O

But	O
he	O
,	O
being	O
a	O
man	O
well	O
experienced	O
in	O
the	O
navigation	O
of	O
those	O
seas	O
,	O
bid	O
us	O
all	O
prepare	O
against	O
a	O
storm	O
,	O
which	O
accordingly	O
happened	O
the	O
day	O
following	O
:	O
for	O
the	O
southern	O
wind	O
,	O
called	O
the	O
southern	O
monsoon	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
set	O
in	O
.	O

Finding	O
it	O
was	O
likely	O
to	O
overblow	O
,	O
we	O
took	O
in	O
our	O
sprit-sail	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
by	O
to	O
hand	O
the	O
fore-sail	O
;	O
but	O
making	O
foul	O
weather	O
,	O
we	O
looked	O
the	O
guns	O
were	O
all	O
fast	O
,	O
and	O
handed	O
the	O
mizen	O
.	O

The	O
ship	O
lay	O
very	O
broad	O
off	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
thought	O
it	O
better	O
spooning	O
before	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
than	O
trying	O
or	O
hulling	O
.	O

We	O
reefed	O
the	O
fore-sail	O
and	O
set	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
hauled	O
aft	O
the	O
fore-sheet	O
;	O
the	O
helm	O
was	O
hard	O
a-weather	O
.	O

The	O
ship	O
wore	O
bravely	O
.	O

We	O
belayed	O
the	O
fore	O
down-haul	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
sail	O
was	O
split	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
hauled	O
down	O
the	O
yard	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
the	O
sail	O
into	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
unbound	O
all	O
the	O
things	O
clear	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
fierce	O
storm	O
;	O
the	O
sea	O
broke	O
strange	O
and	O
dangerous	O
.	O

We	O
hauled	O
off	O
upon	O
the	O
laniard	O
of	O
the	O
whip-staff	O
,	O
and	O
helped	O
the	O
man	O
at	O
the	O
helm	O
.	O

We	O
would	O
not	O
get	O
down	O
our	O
top-mast	O
,	O
but	O
let	O
all	O
stand	O
,	O
because	O
she	O
scudded	O
before	O
the	O
sea	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
knew	O
that	O
the	O
top-mast	O
being	O
aloft	O
,	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
the	O
wholesomer	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
better	O
way	O
through	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
seeing	O
we	O
had	O
sea-room	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
storm	O
was	O
over	O
,	O
we	O
set	O
fore-sail	O
and	O
main-sail	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
the	O
ship	O
to	O
.	O

Then	O
we	O
set	O
the	O
mizen	O
,	O
main-top-sail	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
fore-top-sail	O
.	O

Our	O
course	O
was	O
east-north-east	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
was	O
at	O
south-west	O
.	O

We	O
got	O
the	O
starboard	O
tacks	O
aboard	O
,	O
we	O
cast	O
off	O
our	O
weather-braces	O
and	O
lifts	O
;	O
we	O
set	O
in	O
the	O
lee-braces	O
,	O
and	O
hauled	O
forward	O
by	O
the	O
weather-bowlings	O
,	O
and	O
hauled	O
them	O
tight	O
,	O
and	O
belayed	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
hauled	O
over	O
the	O
mizen	O
tack	O
to	O
windward	O
,	O
and	O
kept	O
her	O
full	O
and	O
by	O
as	O
near	O
as	O
she	O
would	O
lie	O

During	O
this	O
storm	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
followed	O
by	O
a	O
strong	O
wind	O
west-south-west	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
carried	O
,	O
by	O
my	O
computation	O
,	O
about	O
five	O
hundred	O
leagues	O
to	O
the	O
east	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
oldest	O
sailor	O
on	O
board	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
in	O
what	O
part	O
of	O
the	O

we	O
were	O

Our	O
provisions	O
held	O
out	O

our	O

was	O
staunch	O

our	O

all	O
in	O
good	O
health	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
lay	O
in	O
the	O
utmost	O
distress	O
for	O
water	O

We	O
thought	O
it	O
best	O
to	O
hold	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
course	O
,	O
rather	O
than	O
turn	O
more	O
northerly	O
,	O
which	O
might	O
have	O
brought	O
us	O
to	O
the	O
north-west	O

On	O
the	O
17th	O

we	O
came	O
in	O
full	O
view	O
of	O
a	O
great	O
island	O

-LRB-	O
for	O

on	O

was	O
a	O

to	O
hold	O

We	O
cast	O

within	O
a	O

of	O
this	O

and	O
our	O

sent	O

Our	O
men	O
therefore	O
wandered	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
some	O
fresh	O
water	O
near	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
walked	O
alone	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
observed	O
the	O
country	O
all	O
barren	O
and	O
rocky	O
.	O

I	O
now	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
weary	O
,	O
and	O
seeing	O
nothing	O
to	O
entertain	O
my	O
curiosity	O
,	O
I	O
returned	O
gently	O
down	O
towards	O
the	O
creek	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
sea	O
being	O
full	O
in	O
my	O
view	O
,	O
I	O
saw	O
our	O
men	O
already	O
got	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
rowing	O
for	O
life	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
holla	O
after	O
them	O
,	O
although	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
to	O
little	O
purpose	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
observed	O
a	O
huge	O
creature	O
walking	O
after	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
he	O
could	O
:	O
he	O
waded	O
not	O
much	O
deeper	O
than	O
his	O
knees	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
prodigious	O
strides	O
:	O
but	O
our	O
men	O
had	O
the	O
start	O
of	O
him	O
half	O
a	O
league	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
the	O
sea	O
thereabouts	O
being	O
full	O
of	O
sharp-pointed	O
rocks	O
,	O
the	O
monster	O
was	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
overtake	O
the	O
boat	O

This	O
I	O
was	O
afterwards	O
told	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
durst	O
not	O
stay	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
issue	O
of	O
the	O
adventure	O
;	O
but	O
ran	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
the	O
way	O
I	O
first	O
went	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
climbed	O
up	O
a	O
steep	O
hill	O
,	O
which	O
gave	O
me	O
some	O
prospect	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
it	O
fully	O
cultivated	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
which	O
first	O
surprised	O
me	O
was	O
the	O
length	O
of	O
the	O
grass	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
in	O
those	O
grounds	O
that	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
kept	O
for	O
hay	O
,	O
was	O
about	O
twenty	O
feet	O
high	O

I	O
fell	O
into	O
a	O
high	O
road	O
,	O
for	O
so	O
I	O
took	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
served	O
to	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
only	O
as	O
a	O
foot-path	O
through	O
a	O
field	O
of	O
barley	O
.	O

Here	O
I	O
walked	O
on	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
see	O
little	O
on	O
either	O
side	O
,	O
it	O
being	O
now	O
near	O
harvest	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
corn	O
rising	O
at	O
least	O
forty	O
feet	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
an	O
hour	O
walking	O
to	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
this	O
field	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
fenced	O
in	O
with	O
a	O
hedge	O
of	O
at	O
least	O
one	O
hundred	O
and	O
twenty	O
feet	O
high	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
trees	O
so	O
lofty	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
make	O
no	O
computation	O
of	O
their	O
altitude	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
stile	O
to	O
pass	O
from	O
this	O
field	O
into	O
the	O
next	O
.	O

It	O
had	O
four	O
steps	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
stone	O
to	O
cross	O
over	O
when	O
you	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
uppermost	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
climb	O
this	O
stile	O
,	O
because	O
every	O
step	O
was	O
six-feet	O
high	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
upper	O
stone	O
about	O
twenty	O

I	O
was	O
endeavouring	O
to	O
find	O
some	O
gap	O
in	O
the	O
hedge	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
discovered	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
field	O
,	O
advancing	O
towards	O
the	O
stile	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
size	O
with	O
him	O
whom	O
I	O
saw	O
in	O
the	O
sea	O
pursuing	O
our	O
boat	O
.	O

He	O
appeared	O
as	O
tall	O
as	O
an	O
ordinary	O
spire	O
steeple	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
about	O
ten	O
yards	O
at	O
every	O
stride	O
,	O
as	O
near	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
guess	O

I	O
was	O
struck	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
fear	O
and	O
astonishment	O
,	O
and	O
ran	O
to	O
hide	O
myself	O
in	O
the	O
corn	O
,	O
whence	O
I	O
saw	O
him	O
at	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
stile	O
looking	O
back	O
into	O
the	O
next	O
field	O
on	O
the	O
right	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
heard	O
him	O
call	O
in	O
a	O
voice	O
many	O
degrees	O
louder	O
than	O
a	O
speaking-trumpet	O
:	O
but	O
the	O
noise	O
was	O
so	O
high	O
in	O
the	O
air	O
,	O
that	O
at	O
first	O
I	O
certainly	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
thunder	O
.	O

Whereupon	O
seven	O
monsters	O
,	O
like	O
himself	O
,	O
came	O
towards	O
him	O
with	O
reaping-hooks	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
each	O
hook	O
about	O
the	O
largeness	O
of	O
six	O
scythes	O
.	O

These	O
people	O
were	O
not	O
so	O
well	O
clad	O
as	O
the	O
first	O
,	O
whose	O
servants	O
or	O
labourers	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
upon	O
some	O
words	O
he	O
spoke	O
,	O
they	O
went	O
to	O
reap	O
the	O
corn	O
in	O
the	O
field	O
where	O
I	O
lay	O
.	O

I	O
kept	O
from	O
them	O
at	O
as	O
great	O
a	O
distance	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
move	O
with	O
extreme	O
difficulty	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
stalks	O
of	O
the	O
corn	O
were	O
sometimes	O
not	O
above	O
a	O
foot	O
distant	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
hardly	O
squeeze	O
my	O
body	O
betwixt	O
them	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
shift	O
to	O
go	O
forward	O
,	O
till	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
field	O
where	O
the	O
corn	O
had	O
been	O
laid	O
by	O
the	O
rain	O
and	O
wind	O
.	O

Here	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
advance	O
a	O
step	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
stalks	O
were	O
so	O
interwoven	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
creep	O
through	O

and	O
the	O
beards	O
of	O
the	O
fallen	O
ears	O
so	O
strong	O
and	O
pointed	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
pierced	O
through	O
my	O
clothes	O
into	O
my	O
flesh	O
.	O

At	O
the	O

time	O
I	O
heard	O
the	O
reapers	O
not	O
a	O
hundred	O

behind	O
me	O

Being	O
quite	O
dispirited	O
with	O
toil	O
,	O
and	O
wholly	O
overcome	O
by	O
grief	O
and	O
dispair	O
,	O
I	O
lay	O
down	O
between	O
two	O
ridges	O

and	O
heartily	O
wished	O
I	O
might	O
there	O
end	O
my	O
days	O

I	O
bemoaned	O
my	O
desolate	O
widow	O
and	O
fatherless	O
children	O

I	O
lamented	O
my	O
own	O
folly	O
and	O
wilfulness	O
,	O
in	O
attempting	O
a	O
second	O
voyage	O
,	O
against	O
the	O
advice	O
of	O
all	O
my	O
friends	O

In	O
this	O
terrible	O
agitation	O
of	O
mind	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
forbear	O
thinking	O
of	O
Lilliput	PNM
,	O
whose	O
inhabitants	O
looked	O
upon	O
me	O
as	O
the	O
greatest	O
prodigy	O
that	O
ever	O
appeared	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
;	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
draw	O
an	O
imperial	O
fleet	O
in	O
my	O
hand	O

and	O
perform	O
those	O

actions	O

which	O
will	O
be	O
recorded	O
for	O

while	O
posterity	O
shall	O
hardly	O
believe	O
them	O

although	O
attested	O
by	O
millions	O

I	O
reflected	O
what	O
a	O
mortification	O
it	O
must	O
prove	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
to	O
appear	O
as	O
inconsiderable	O
in	O
this	O
nation	O
,	O
as	O
one	O
single	O
Lilliputian	O
would	O
be	O
among	O
us	O

But	O
this	O
I	O
conceived	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
least	O
of	O
my	O
misfortunes	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
human	O
creatures	O
are	O
observed	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
savage	O
and	O
cruel	O
in	O
proportion	O
to	O
their	O
bulk	O

what	O
could	O
I	O
expect	O
but	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
morsel	O
in	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
among	O
these	O
enormous	O

that	O
should	O
happen	O

Undoubtedly	O
philosophers	O
are	O
in	O
the	O
right	O

when	O
they	O
tell	O
us	O
that	O
nothing	O

great	O
or	O
little	O

by	O

It	O
might	O

to	O
have	O
let	O
the	O
Lilliputians	O
find	O
some	O
nation	O

where	O
the	O
people	O
were	O
as	O
diminutive	O
with	O
respect	O
to	O
them	O

they	O
were	O

And	O
who	O

that	O
even	O
this	O

might	O

Scared	O

confounded	O
as	O
I	O
was	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
forbear	O
going	O
on	O
with	O
these	O
reflections	O

when	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
reapers	O
,	O
approaching	O
within	O
ten	O
yards	O
of	O
the	O
ridge	O
where	O
I	O
lay	O
,	O
made	O
me	O
apprehend	O
that	O
with	O
the	O

step	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
squashed	O
to	O
death	O
under	O
his	O

or	O
cut	O
in	O

And	O
therefore	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
was	O
again	O
about	O
to	O
move	O
,	O
I	O
screamed	O
as	O
loud	O
as	O
fear	O
could	O
make	O
me	O
:	O
whereupon	O
the	O
huge	O
creature	O
trod	O
short	O

looking	O
round	O

him	O
for	O
some	O

at	O

espied	O
me	O

on	O
the	O

He	O
considered	O
awhile	O

with	O
the	O
caution	O
of	O
one	O
who	O
endeavours	O
to	O
lay	O
hold	O
on	O
a	O
small	O

animal	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
manner	O
that	O
it	O

to	O

him	O

as	O
I	O
myself	O

sometimes	O
done	O
with	O
a	O
weasel	O
in	O
England	PNM

At	O
length	O
he	O
ventured	O
to	O
take	O
me	O
behind	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
middle	O
,	O
between	O
his	O
fore-finger	O

thumb	O

and	O
brought	O
me	O
within	O
three	O
yards	O
of	O
his	O
eyes	O

that	O
he	O
might	O
behold	O
my	O

more	O
perfectly	O

I	O
guessed	O
his	O
meaning	O

and	O
my	O
good	O
fortune	O
gave	O
me	O
so	O
much	O
presence	O
of	O
mind	O

that	O
I	O
resolved	O
not	O
to	O
struggle	O
in	O
the	O

he	O
held	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
air	O
above	O
sixty	O
feet	O
from	O
the	O
ground	O

although	O
he	O
grievously	O
pinched	O
my	O
sides	O

for	O
fear	O
I	O
should	O
slip	O
through	O
his	O

All	O
I	O
ventured	O

to	O
raise	O
mine	O

place	O
my	O

to	O
speak	O
some	O

suitable	O
to	O
the	O
condition	O

then	O
was	O
in	O

I	O
apprehended	O
every	O

that	O
he	O
would	O
dash	O
me	O

my	O

it	O

that	O
he	O

with	O
my	O

of	O
my	O
face	O

He	O
called	O
his	O
hinds	O
about	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
asked	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
afterwards	O
learned	O
,	O
whether	O
they	O
had	O
ever	O
seen	O
in	O
the	O
fields	O
any	O
little	O
creature	O
that	O
resembled	O
me	O
.	O

He	O
then	O
placed	O
me	O
softly	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
upon	O
all	O
fours	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
got	O
immediately	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
walked	O
slowly	O
backward	O
and	O
forward	O
,	O
to	O
let	O
those	O
people	O
see	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
intent	O
to	O
run	O
away	O
.	O

They	O
all	O
sat	O
down	O
in	O
a	O
circle	O
about	O
me	O
,	O
the	O
better	O
to	O
observe	O
my	O
motions	O
.	O

I	O
pulled	O
off	O
my	O
hat	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
low	O
bow	O
towards	O
the	O
farmer	O
.	O

I	O
fell	O
on	O
my	O
knees	O
,	O
and	O
lifted	O
up	O
my	O
hands	O
and	O
eyes	O
,	O
and	O
spoke	O
several	O
words	O
as	O
loud	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
:	O
I	O
took	O
a	O
purse	O
of	O
gold	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
pocket	O
,	O
and	O
humbly	O
presented	O
it	O
to	O
him	O
.	O

He	O
received	O
it	O
on	O
the	O
palm	O
of	O
his	O
hand	O
,	O
then	O
applied	O
it	O
close	O
to	O
his	O
eye	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
and	O
afterwards	O
turned	O
it	O
several	O
times	O
with	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
a	O
pin	O
-LRB-	O
which	O
he	O
took	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
sleeve	O
,	O
-RRB-	O
but	O
could	O
make	O
nothing	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

Whereupon	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
sign	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
place	O
his	O
hand	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
took	O
the	O
purse	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
opening	O
it	O
,	O
poured	O
all	O
the	O
gold	O
into	O
his	O
palm	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
six	O
Spanish	O
pieces	O
of	O
four	O
pistoles	O
each	O
,	O
beside	O
twenty	O
or	O
thirty	O
smaller	O
coins	O
.	O

I	O
saw	O
him	O
wet	O
the	O
tip	O
of	O
his	O
little	O
finger	O
upon	O
his	O
tongue	O
,	O
and	O
take	O
up	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
largest	O
pieces	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
another	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
wholly	O
ignorant	O
what	O
they	O
were	O
.	O

He	O
made	O
me	O
a	O
sign	O
to	O
put	O
them	O
again	O
into	O
my	O
purse	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
purse	O
again	O
into	O
my	O
pocket	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
after	O
offering	O
it	O
to	O
him	O
several	O
times	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
best	O
to	O
do	O
.	O

The	O
farmer	O
,	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
was	O
convinced	O
I	O
must	O
be	O
a	O
rational	O
creature	O
.	O

He	O
spoke	O
often	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
sound	O
of	O
his	O
voice	O
pierced	O
my	O
ears	O
like	O
that	O
of	O
a	O
water-mill	O
,	O
yet	O
his	O
words	O
were	O
articulate	O
enough	O
.	O

I	O
answered	O
as	O
loud	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
in	O
several	O
languages	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
often	O
laid	O
his	O
ear	O
within	O
two	O
yards	O
of	O
me	O
:	O
but	O
all	O
in	O
vain	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
wholly	O
unintelligible	O
to	O
each	O
other	O
.	O

He	O
then	O
sent	O
his	O
servants	O
to	O
their	O
work	O
,	O
and	O
taking	O
his	O
handkerchief	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
pocket	O
,	O
he	O
doubled	O
and	O
spread	O
it	O
on	O
his	O
left	O
hand	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
placed	O
flat	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
with	O
the	O
palm	O
upward	O
,	O
making	O
me	O
a	O
sign	O
to	O
step	O
into	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
easily	O
do	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
above	O
a	O
foot	O
in	O
thickness	O
.	O

I	O
thought	O
it	O
my	O
part	O
to	O
obey	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
falling	O
,	O
laid	O
myself	O
at	O
full	O
length	O
upon	O
the	O
handkerchief	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
remainder	O
of	O
which	O
he	O
lapped	O
me	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
head	O
for	O
further	O
security	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
this	O
manner	O
carried	O
me	O
home	O
to	O
his	O
house	O
.	O

There	O
he	O
called	O
his	O
wife	O
,	O
and	O
showed	O
me	O
to	O
her	O
;	O
but	O
she	O
screamed	O
and	O
ran	O
back	O
,	O
as	O
women	O
in	O
England	PNM
do	O
at	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
a	O
toad	O
or	O
a	O
spider	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
when	O
she	O
had	O
a	O
while	O
seen	O
my	O
behaviour	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
well	O
I	O
observed	O
the	O
signs	O
her	O
husband	O
made	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
soon	O
reconciled	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
degrees	O
grew	O
extremely	O
tender	O
of	O
me	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
about	O
twelve	O
at	O
noon	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
servant	O
brought	O
in	O
dinner	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
only	O
one	O
substantial	O
dish	O
of	O
meat	O
-LRB-	O
fit	O
for	O
the	O
plain	O
condition	O
of	O
a	O
husbandman	O
,	O
-RRB-	O
in	O
a	O
dish	O
of	O
about	O
four-and-twenty	O
feet	O
diameter	O
.	O

The	O
company	O
were	O
,	O
the	O
farmer	O
and	O
his	O
wife	O
,	O
three	O
children	O
,	O
and	O
an	O
old	O
grandmother	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
were	O
sat	O
down	O
,	O
the	O
farmer	O
placed	O
me	O
at	O
some	O
distance	O
from	O
him	O
on	O
the	O
table	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
thirty	O
feet	O
high	O
from	O
the	O
floor	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
terrible	O
fright	O
,	O
and	O
kept	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
from	O
the	O
edge	O
,	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
falling	O
.	O

The	O
wife	O
minced	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
meat	O
,	O
then	O
crumbled	O
some	O
bread	O
on	O
a	O
trencher	O
,	O
and	O
placed	O
it	O
before	O
me	O
.	O

I	O
made	O
her	O
a	O
low	O
bow	O
,	O
took	O
out	O
my	O
knife	O
and	O
fork	O
,	O
and	O
fell	O
to	O
eat	O
,	O
which	O
gave	O
them	O
exceeding	O
delight	O
.	O

The	O
mistress	O
sent	O
her	O
maid	O
for	O
a	O
small	O
dram	O
cup	O
,	O
which	O
held	O
about	O
two	O
gallons	O
,	O
and	O
filled	O
it	O
with	O
drink	O
;	O
I	O
took	O
up	O
the	O
vessel	O
with	O
much	O
difficulty	O
in	O
both	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
most	O
respectful	O
manner	O
drank	O
to	O
her	O
ladyship	O
's	O
health	O
,	O
expressing	O
the	O
words	O
as	O
loud	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
in	O
English	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
the	O
company	O
laugh	O
so	O
heartily	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
almost	O
deafened	O
with	O
the	O
noise	O
.	O

This	O
liquor	O
tasted	O
like	O
a	O
small	O
cider	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
not	O
unpleasant	O
.	O

Then	O
the	O
master	O
made	O
me	O
a	O
sign	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
his	O
trencher	O
side	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
I	O
walked	O
on	O
the	O
table	O
,	O
being	O
in	O
great	O
surprise	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
indulgent	O
reader	O
will	O
easily	O
conceive	O
and	O
excuse	O
,	O
I	O
happened	O
to	O
stumble	O
against	O
a	O
crust	O
,	O
and	O
fell	O
flat	O
on	O
my	O
face	O
,	O
but	O
received	O
no	O
hurt	O
.	O

I	O
got	O
up	O
immediately	O
,	O
and	O
observing	O
the	O
good	O
people	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
much	O
concern	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
my	O
hat	O
-LRB-	O
which	O
I	O
held	O
under	O
my	O
arm	O
out	O
of	O
good	O
manners	O
,	O
-RRB-	O
and	O
waving	O
it	O
over	O
my	O
head	O
,	O
made	O
three	O
huzzas	O
,	O
to	O
show	O
I	O
had	O
got	O
no	O
mischief	O
by	O
my	O
fall	O
.	O

But	O
advancing	O
forward	O
towards	O
my	O
master	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
I	O
shall	O
henceforth	O
call	O
him	O
,	O
-RRB-	O
his	O
youngest	O
son	O
,	O
who	O
sat	O
next	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
an	O
arch	O
boy	O
of	O
about	O
ten	O
years	O
old	O
,	O
took	O
me	O
up	O
by	O
the	O
legs	O
,	O
and	O
held	O
me	O
so	O
high	O
in	O
the	O
air	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
trembled	O
every	O
limb	O
:	O
but	O
his	O
father	O
snatched	O
me	O
from	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
gave	O
him	O
such	O
a	O
box	O
on	O
the	O
left	O
ear	O
,	O
as	O
would	O
have	O
felled	O
an	O
European	O
troop	O
of	O
horse	O
to	O
the	O
earth	O
,	O
ordering	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
from	O
the	O
table	O
.	O

But	O
being	O
afraid	O
the	O
boy	O
might	O
owe	O
me	O
a	O
spite	O
,	O
and	O
well	O
remembering	O
how	O
mischievous	O
all	O
children	O
among	O
us	O
naturally	O
are	O
to	O
sparrows	O
,	O
rabbits	O
,	O
young	O
kittens	O
,	O
and	O
puppy	O
dogs	O
,	O
I	O
fell	O
on	O
my	O
knees	O
,	O
and	O
pointing	O
to	O
the	O
boy	O
,	O
made	O
my	O
master	O
to	O
understand	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
desired	O
his	O
son	O
might	O
be	O
pardoned	O
.	O

The	O
father	O
complied	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
lad	O
took	O
his	O
seat	O
again	O
,	O
whereupon	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
kissed	O
his	O
hand	O
,	O
which	O
my	O
master	O
took	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
him	O
stroke	O
me	O
gently	O
with	O
it	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
midst	O
of	O
dinner	O
,	O
my	O
mistress	O
's	O
favourite	O
cat	O
leaped	O
into	O
her	O
lap	O
.	O

I	O
heard	O
a	O
noise	O
behind	O
me	O
like	O
that	O
of	O
a	O
dozen	O
stocking-weavers	O
at	O
work	O
;	O
and	O
turning	O
my	O
head	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
it	O
proceeded	O
from	O
the	O
purring	O
of	O
that	O
animal	O
,	O
who	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
three	O
times	O
larger	O
than	O
an	O
ox	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
computed	O
by	O
the	O
view	O
of	O
her	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
her	O
paws	O
,	O
while	O
her	O
mistress	O
was	O
feeding	O
and	O
stroking	O
her	O
.	O

The	O
fierceness	O
of	O
this	O
creature	O
's	O
countenance	O
altogether	O
discomposed	O
me	O
;	O
though	O
I	O
stood	O
at	O
the	O
farther	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
table	O
,	O
above	O
fifty	O
feet	O
off	O
;	O
and	O
although	O
my	O
mistress	O
held	O
her	O
fast	O
,	O
for	O
fear	O
she	O
might	O
give	O
a	O
spring	O
,	O
and	O
seize	O
me	O
in	O
her	O
talons	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
happened	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
danger	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
cat	O
took	O
not	O
the	O
least	O
notice	O
of	O
me	O
when	O
my	O
master	O
placed	O
me	O
within	O
three	O
yards	O
of	O
her	O
.	O

And	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
always	O
told	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
true	O
by	O
experience	O
in	O
my	O
travels	O
,	O
that	O
flying	O
or	O
discovering	O
fear	O
before	O
a	O
fierce	O
animal	O
,	O
is	O
a	O
certain	O
way	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
pursue	O
or	O
attack	O
you	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
resolved	O
,	O
in	O
this	O
dangerous	O
juncture	O
,	O
to	O
show	O
no	O
manner	O
of	O
concern	O
.	O

I	O
walked	O
with	O
intrepidity	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
times	O
before	O
the	O
very	O
head	O
of	O
the	O
cat	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
within	O
half	O
a	O
yard	O
of	O
her	O
;	O
whereupon	O
she	O
drew	O
herself	O
back	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
she	O
were	O
more	O
afraid	O
of	O
me	O
:	O
I	O
had	O
less	O
apprehension	O
concerning	O
the	O
dogs	O
,	O
whereof	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
room	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
usual	O
in	O
farmers	O
'	O
houses	O
;	O
one	O
of	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
mastiff	O
,	O
equal	O
in	O
bulk	O
to	O
four	O
elephants	O
,	O
and	O
another	O
a	O
greyhound	O
,	O
somewhat	O
taller	O
than	O
the	O
mastiff	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
so	O
large	O
.	O

When	O
dinner	O
was	O
almost	O
done	O
,	O
the	O
nurse	O
came	O
in	O
with	O
a	O
child	O
of	O
a	O
year	O
old	O
in	O
her	O
arms	O
,	O
who	O
immediately	O
spied	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
a	O
squall	O
that	O
you	O
might	O
have	O
heard	O
from	O
London-Bridge	O
to	O
Chelsea	PNM
,	O
after	O
the	O
usual	O
oratory	O
of	O
infants	O
,	O
to	O
get	O
me	O
for	O
a	O
plaything	O
.	O

The	O
mother	O
,	O
out	O
of	O
pure	O
indulgence	O
,	O
took	O
me	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
me	O
towards	O
the	O
child	O
,	O
who	O
presently	O
seized	O
me	O
by	O
the	O
middle	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
my	O
head	O
into	O
his	O
mouth	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
roared	O
so	O
loud	O
that	O
the	O
urchin	O
was	O
frighted	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
me	O
drop	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
should	O
infallibly	O
have	O
broke	O
my	O
neck	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
mother	O
had	O
not	O
held	O
her	O
apron	O
under	O
me	O
.	O

The	O
nurse	O
,	O
to	O
quiet	O
her	O
babe	O
,	O
made	O
use	O
of	O
a	O
rattle	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
hollow	O
vessel	O
filled	O
with	O
great	O

I	O
must	O
confess	O
no	O
object	O
ever	O
disgusted	O
me	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
her	O

which	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
tell	O
what	O
to	O

to	O
give	O
the	O
curious	O

an	O
idea	O
of	O
its	O
bulk	O

shape	O

stood	O

six	O

could	O
not	O

sixteen	O

The	O
nipple	O
was	O
about	O
half	O
the	O

the	O

that	O
nothing	O
could	O
appear	O
more	O

a	O

sitting	O
down	O

This	O
made	O
me	O
reflect	O
upon	O
the	O
fair	O
skins	O
of	O
our	O
English	O
ladies	O
,	O
who	O
appear	O
so	O
beautiful	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
only	O
because	O
they	O
are	O
of	O
our	O
own	O
size	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
defects	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
but	O
through	O
a	O
magnifying	O
glass	O
;	O
where	O
we	O
find	O
by	O
experiment	O
that	O
the	O
smoothest	O
and	O
whitest	O
skins	O
look	O
rough	O
,	O
and	O
coarse	O
,	O
and	O
ill-coloured	O

I	O
remember	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
Lilliput	PNM
,	O
the	O
complexion	O
of	O
those	O
diminutive	O
people	O

to	O
me	O
the	O
fairest	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
;	O
and	O
talking	O
upon	O
this	O
subject	O
with	O
a	O
person	O
of	O
learning	O
there	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
an	O
intimate	O
friend	O
of	O
mine	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
that	O
my	O
face	O
appeared	O
much	O
fairer	O
and	O
smoother	O
when	O
he	O
looked	O
on	O
me	O
from	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
than	O
it	O
did	O
upon	O
a	O
nearer	O
view	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
took	O
him	O
up	O
in	O
my	O
hand	O

and	O
brought	O
him	O
close	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
confessed	O
was	O
at	O
first	O
a	O
very	O
shocking	O
sight	O

He	O
said	O

``	O

I	O

this	O

was	O
obvious	O
enough	O

I	O
could	O

lest	O
the	O

might	O

those	O

were	O

for	O
I	O
must	O
do	O
them	O
the	O

he	O
was	O

a	O
farmer	O

when	O
I	O
beheld	O
him	O
from	O
the	O
height	O
of	O
sixty	O
feet	O

appeared	O
very	O
well	O

When	O
dinner	O
was	O

my	O

went	O
out	O
to	O
his	O

and	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
discover	O
by	O
his	O

gave	O
his	O

I	O
was	O
very	O
much	O
tired	O

and	O
disposed	O
to	O
sleep	O
,	O
which	O
my	O
mistress	O
perceiving	O
,	O
she	O
put	O
me	O
on	O
her	O
own	O
bed	O

and	O
covered	O
me	O
with	O
a	O
clean	O
white	O
handkerchief	O

but	O
larger	O
and	O
coarser	O
than	O
the	O
main-sail	O
of	O
a	O
man-of-war	O

I	O
slept	O
about	O
two	O
hours	O
,	O
and	O
dreamt	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
home	O
with	O
my	O
wife	O
and	O
children	O
,	O
which	O
aggravated	O
my	O
sorrows	O
when	O
I	O
awaked	O

and	O
found	O
myself	O
alone	O
in	O
a	O
vast	O
room	O
,	O
between	O
two	O
and	O
three	O
hundred	O
feet	O

and	O
above	O
two	O

lying	O
in	O
a	O
bed	O
twenty	O
yards	O
wide	O

My	O
mistress	O
was	O
gone	O
about	O
her	O
household	O
affairs	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
locked	O
me	O
in	O
.	O

The	O
bed	O
was	O
eight	O
yards	O
from	O
the	O
floor	O
.	O

Some	O
natural	O
necessities	O
required	O
me	O
to	O
get	O
down	O
;	O
I	O
durst	O
not	O
presume	O
to	O
call	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
in	O
vain	O
,	O
with	O
such	O
a	O
voice	O
as	O
mine	O
,	O
at	O
so	O
great	O
a	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
room	O
where	O
I	O
lay	O
to	O
the	O
kitchen	O
where	O
the	O
family	O
kept	O
.	O

While	O
I	O
was	O
under	O
these	O
circumstances	O
,	O
two	O
rats	O
crept	O
up	O
the	O
curtains	O
,	O
and	O
ran	O
smelling	O
backwards	O
and	O
forwards	O
on	O
the	O
bed	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
them	O
came	O
up	O
almost	O
to	O
my	O
face	O
,	O
whereupon	O
I	O
rose	O
in	O
a	O
fright	O
,	O
and	O
drew	O
out	O
my	O
hanger	O
to	O
defend	O
myself	O
.	O

These	O
horrible	O
animals	O
had	O
the	O
boldness	O
to	O
attack	O
me	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
held	O
his	O
fore-feet	O
at	O
my	O
collar	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
good	O
fortune	O
to	O
rip	O
up	O
his	O
belly	O
before	O
he	O
could	O
do	O
me	O
any	O
mischief	O
.	O

He	O
fell	O
down	O
at	O
my	O
feet	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
seeing	O
the	O
fate	O
of	O
his	O
comrade	O
,	O
made	O
his	O
escape	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
without	O
one	O
good	O
wound	O
on	O
the	O
back	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
gave	O
him	O
as	O
he	O
fled	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
the	O
blood	O
run	O
trickling	O
from	O
him	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
exploit	O
,	O
I	O
walked	O
gently	O
to	O
and	O
fro	O
on	O
the	O
bed	O
,	O
to	O
recover	O
my	O
breath	O
and	O
loss	O
of	O
spirits	O
.	O

These	O
creatures	O
were	O
of	O
the	O
size	O
of	O
a	O
large	O
mastiff	O
,	O
but	O
infinitely	O
more	O
nimble	O
and	O
fierce	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
taken	O
off	O
my	O
belt	O
before	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
sleep	O
,	O
I	O
must	O
have	O
infallibly	O
been	O
torn	O
to	O
pieces	O
and	O
devoured	O
.	O

I	O
measured	O
the	O
tail	O
of	O
the	O
dead	O
rat	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
two	O
yards	O
long	O
,	O
wanting	O
an	O
inch	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
went	O
against	O
my	O
stomach	O
to	O
drag	O
the	O
carcass	O
off	O
the	O
bed	O
,	O
where	O
it	O
lay	O
still	O
bleeding	O
;	O
I	O
observed	O
it	O
had	O
yet	O
some	O
life	O
,	O
but	O
with	O
a	O
strong	O
slash	O
across	O
the	O
neck	O
,	O
I	O
thoroughly	O
despatched	O
it	O
.	O

Soon	O
after	O
my	O
mistress	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
room	O
,	O
who	O
seeing	O
me	O
all	O
bloody	O
,	O
ran	O
and	O
took	O
me	O
up	O
in	O
her	O
hand	O
.	O

I	O
pointed	O
to	O
the	O
dead	O
rat	O
,	O
smiling	O
,	O
and	O
making	O
other	O
signs	O
to	O
show	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
hurt	O
;	O
whereat	O
she	O
was	O
extremely	O
rejoiced	O
,	O
calling	O
the	O
maid	O
to	O
take	O
up	O
the	O
dead	O
rat	O
with	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
tongs	O
,	O
and	O
throw	O
it	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
window	O
.	O

Then	O
she	O
set	O
me	O
on	O
a	O
table	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
showed	O
her	O
my	O
hanger	O
all	O
bloody	O
,	O
and	O
wiping	O
it	O
on	O
the	O
lappet	O
of	O
my	O
coat	O
,	O
returned	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
scabbard	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
pressed	O
to	O
do	O
more	O
than	O
one	O
thing	O
which	O
another	O
could	O
not	O
do	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
make	O
my	O
mistress	O
understand	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
desired	O
to	O
be	O
set	O
down	O
on	O
the	O
floor	O
;	O
which	O
after	O
she	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
my	O
bashfulness	O
would	O
not	O
suffer	O
me	O
to	O
express	O
myself	O
farther	O
,	O
than	O
by	O
pointing	O
to	O
the	O
door	O
,	O
and	O
bowing	O
several	O
times	O

The	O
good	O
woman	O
,	O
with	O
much	O
difficulty	O
,	O
at	O
last	O
perceived	O
what	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
at	O
,	O
and	O
taking	O
me	O
up	O
again	O
in	O
her	O
hand	O
,	O
walked	O
into	O
the	O
garden	O
,	O
where	O
she	O
set	O
me	O
down	O
.	O

I	O
went	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
about	O
two	O
hundred	O
yards	O
,	O
and	O
beckoning	O
to	O
her	O
not	O
to	O
look	O
or	O
to	O
follow	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
hid	O
myself	O
between	O
two	O
leaves	O
of	O
sorrel	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
discharged	O
the	O
necessities	O
of	O

I	O
hope	O

me	O
for	O

me	O

He	O

the	O
character	O

,	O
to	O

upon	O

about	O
two-and-twenty	O

I	O
guessed	O
there	O

some	O
mischief	O
when	O
I	O
observed	O

whispering	O
together	O

sometimes	O
pointing	O
at	O
me	O

my	O

me	O

that	O
I	O
overheard	O

understood	O
some	O

But	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
Glumdalclitch	O
,	O
my	O
little	O
nurse	O
,	O
told	O
me	O
the	O
whole	O
matter	O
,	O
which	O
she	O
had	O
cunningly	O
picked	O
out	O
from	O
her	O
mother	O

The	O
poor	O
girl	O
laid	O
me	O
on	O
her	O
bosom	O
,	O
and	O
fell	O
a	O
weeping	O
with	O
shame	O
and	O
grief	O

She	O
apprehended	O
some	O
mischief	O
would	O
happen	O
to	O
me	O
from	O
rude	O
vulgar	O
folks	O
,	O
who	O
might	O
squeeze	O
me	O
to	O
death	O

or	O
break	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
limbs	O
by	O
taking	O
me	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O

She	O
had	O
also	O
observed	O
how	O
modest	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
my	O
nature	O
,	O
how	O
nicely	O
I	O
regarded	O
my	O
honour	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
an	O
indignity	O
I	O
should	O
conceive	O
it	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
exposed	O
for	O
money	O
as	O
a	O
public	O
spectacle	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
meanest	O
of	O
the	O
people	O

She	O
said	O
,	O
her	O
papa	O
and	O
mamma	O
had	O
promised	O
that	O
Grildrig	O
should	O
be	O
hers	O
;	O
but	O
now	O
she	O
found	O
they	O
meant	O
to	O
serve	O
her	O
as	O
they	O
did	O
last	O
year	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
pretended	O
to	O
give	O
her	O
a	O
lamb	O

and	O
yet	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
it	O
was	O

it	O
to	O
a	O

For	O
my	O
own	O
part	O
,	O
I	O
may	O
truly	O
affirm	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
less	O
concerned	O
than	O
my	O
nurse	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
strong	O
hope	O

which	O
never	O
left	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
one	O

recover	O
my	O
liberty	O

as	O
to	O
the	O
ignominy	O
of	O
being	O
carried	O
about	O
for	O
a	O
monster	O

I	O
considered	O
myself	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
perfect	O
stranger	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
such	O
a	O
misfortune	O
could	O
never	O
be	O
charged	O
upon	O
me	O
as	O
a	O
reproach	O

if	O
ever	O
I	O
should	O
return	O

the	O

My	O
master	O
,	O
pursuant	O
to	O
the	O
advice	O
of	O
his	O
friend	O
,	O
carried	O
me	O
in	O
a	O
box	O
the	O
next	O
market-day	O
to	O
the	O
neighbouring	O

took	O
along	O

upon	O
a	O

a	O

The	O

However	O

I	O
was	O
terribly	O

it	O

trotted	O
so	O
high	O

that	O
the	O

the	O

My	O

We	O

were	O

viewed	O
with	O

that	O

But	O
this	O
opinion	O
was	O
rejected	O
by	O
the	O

that	O

They	O
would	O
not	O
allow	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
a	O

my	O
littleness	O

thirty	O

After	O
much	O

they	O
concluded	O

that	O
I	O

out	O

the	O
queen	O
-LRB-	O
who	O
had	O
indeed	O
but	O
a	O
weak	O

-RRB-	O
took	O
up	O

at	O
one	O
mouthful	O

as	O
much	O
as	O
a	O
dozen	O
English	O

at	O
a	O
meal	O

which	O
to	O
me	O
was	O
for	O
some	O

a	O
very	O
nauseous	O
sight	O

She	O

all	O

put	O

I	O

when	O

out	O

at	O

This	O

took	O
a	O
pleasure	O
in	O

wherein	O
I	O
gave	O
him	O
the	O
best	O
account	O
I	O
was	O
able	O

His	O
apprehension	O
was	O
so	O
clear	O

and	O
his	O
judgment	O
so	O
exact	O

that	O
he	O
made	O
very	O

observations	O
upon	O
all	O
I	O
said	O

But	O
I	O
confess	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
after	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
little	O
too	O
copious	O
in	O
talking	O
of	O
my	O

of	O
our	O
trade	O

so	O

that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
forbear	O
taking	O
me	O
up	O
in	O
his	O
right	O
hand	O

and	O
stroking	O
me	O
gently	O
with	O
the	O

after	O
a	O
hearty	O

``	O

I	O
should	O

One	O

this	O

the	O

my	O

ran	O
to	O

relief	O

took	O
me	O
out	O

a	O
suit	O

The	O

was	O
soundly	O

and	O
as	O
a	O

punishment	O

forced	O
to	O
drink	O
up	O

bestowed	O
him	O
on	O

might	O
have	O
carried	O
his	O
resentment	O

He	O
had	O
before	O
served	O
me	O
a	O
scurvy	O
trick	O
,	O
which	O
set	O
the	O
queen	O
a-laughing	O
,	O
although	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
she	O
was	O
heartily	O
vexed	O

and	O
would	O
have	O
immediately	O
cashiered	O
him	O

upon	O

,	O
after	O
knocking	O
out	O
the	O

again	O

watching	O
his	O
opportunity	O

while	O
Glumdalclitch	O
was	O
gone	O
to	O
the	O
side-board	O

that	O
she	O
stood	O
on	O
to	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
me	O
at	O
meals	O

took	O
me	O
up	O
in	O
both	O
hands	O

and	O
squeezing	O
my	O
legs	O
together	O
,	O
wedged	O
them	O
into	O
the	O
marrow	O
bone	O
above	O
my	O
waist	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
stuck	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
very	O
ridiculous	O
figure	O

I	O
believe	O
it	O
was	O
near	O
a	O
minute	O
before	O
any	O
one	O
knew	O
what	O
was	O
become	O
of	O
me	O

for	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O

out	O

But	O
,	O
as	O
princes	O
seldom	O
get	O
their	O
meat	O
hot	O

my	O

were	O

scalded	O

The	O

at	O
my	O
entreaty	O

had	O
no	O
other	O
punishment	O
than	O
a	O
sound	O
whipping	O

I	O
was	O
frequently	O
rallied	O
by	O
the	O
queen	O
upon	O
account	O
of	O
my	O
fearfulness	O
;	O
and	O
she	O
used	O
to	O
ask	O
me	O
whether	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
my	O
country	O
were	O
as	O
great	O
cowards	O
as	O
myself	O
?	O

The	O
occasion	O

this	O

the	O
kingdom	O

much	O
pestered	O
with	O
flies	O
in	O

;	O
and	O
these	O
odious	O
insects	O
,	O
each	O
of	O
them	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
a	O
Dunstable	O

hardly	O
gave	O
me	O
any	O
rest	O
while	O
I	O
sat	O
at	O
dinner	O
,	O
with	O
their	O
continual	O
humming	O
and	O
buzzing	O
about	O
mine	O
ears	O

They	O
would	O
sometimes	O
alight	O
upon	O
my	O
victuals	O
,	O
and	O
leave	O
their	O
loathsome	O
excrement	O
,	O
or	O
spawn	O
behind	O

which	O
to	O
me	O
was	O
very	O
visible	O

though	O
not	O
to	O
the	O
natives	O
of	O

not	O
so	O

mine	O

Sometimes	O
they	O
would	O
fix	O
upon	O
my	O
nose	O

where	O
they	O
stung	O
me	O
to	O
the	O
quick	O

I	O
could	O
easily	O

I	O
had	O
much	O
ado	O
to	O
defend	O
myself	O
against	O
these	O
detestable	O

and	O
could	O
not	O

starting	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
on	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
common	O
practice	O
of	O
the	O
dwarf	O

to	O
catch	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
these	O

My	O

was	O
to	O
cut	O

as	O
we	O

-RRB-	O

after	O
I	O
had	O
lifted	O
up	O
one	O

sat	O
down	O

above	O
twenty	O

allured	O

came	O
flying	O
into	O

humming	O
louder	O
than	O
the	O
drones	O
of	O

Some	O
of	O

confounding	O
me	O
with	O
the	O
noise	O

putting	O
me	O
in	O
the	O

of	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
courage	O
to	O
rise	O

draw	O
my	O

attack	O
them	O
in	O
the	O

I	O
dispatched	O
four	O

but	O
the	O
rest	O
got	O
away	O

I	O
presently	O
shut	O

These	O
insects	O
were	O
as	O
large	O

I	O
took	O

I	O

that	O
our	O

by	O

nothing	O

for	O
it	O
was	O
ever	O
my	O

that	O
there	O
must	O
be	O
a	O
balance	O

to	O

the	O

and	O
therefore	O
they	O
ought	O
to	O
correct	O
their	O
maps	O

by	O
joining	O
this	O
vast	O

The	O

One	O

the	O

gave	O
me	O
the	O
most	O
horrible	O
spectacle	O
that	O
ever	O

There	O
was	O

the	O

was	O
the	O
lice	O

I	O

They	O
were	O
the	O

I	O
unluckily	O
left	O
behind	O

indeed	O

the	O
sight	O
was	O
so	O
nauseous	O

when	O
I	O
was	O
weary	O

Glumdalclitch	O

into	O
the	O
gardens	O
of	O
the	O

in	O
my	O

and	O
would	O

out	O

hold	O
me	O
in	O
her	O

my	O

I	O
being	O
close	O

I	O
must	O

a	O

each	O
of	O
them	O
near	O
as	O

one	O
of	O

hit	O

I	O

the	O

pardoned	O
at	O

Another	O

Glumdalclitch	O
left	O

such	O
cruel	O

set	O
me	O
gently	O
on	O

By	O

asked	O
me	O
how	O

I	O

out	O

I	O

not	O

In	O

This	O
accident	O
absolutely	O
determined	O
Glumdalclitch	O
never	O
to	O
trust	O
me	O
abroad	O
for	O
the	O
future	O
out	O
of	O
her	O
sight	O

I	O
had	O
been	O
long	O
afraid	O
of	O
this	O
resolution	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
concealed	O
from	O
her	O
some	O
little	O
unlucky	O
adventures	O
,	O
that	O
happened	O
in	O
those	O
times	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
left	O
by	O
myself	O

Once	O
a	O
kite	O
,	O
hovering	O
over	O
the	O
garden	O
,	O
made	O
a	O
stoop	O
at	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
resolutely	O
drawn	O
my	O
hanger	O
,	O
and	O
run	O
under	O
a	O
thick	O
espalier	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
certainly	O
carried	O
me	O
away	O
in	O
his	O
talons	O

Another	O
time	O
,	O
walking	O
to	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
a	O
fresh	O
mole-hill	O
,	O
I	O
fell	O
to	O
my	O
neck	O
in	O
the	O
hole	O
,	O
through	O
which	O
that	O
animal	O
had	O
cast	O
up	O
the	O

and	O
coined	O
some	O

not	O
worth	O
remembering	O
,	O
to	O
excuse	O
myself	O
for	O
spoiling	O
my	O
clothes	O

I	O
likewise	O
broke	O
my	O
right	O
shin	O
against	O
the	O
shell	O
of	O
a	O
snail	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
happened	O
to	O
stumble	O
over	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
walking	O
alone	O
and	O
thinking	O
on	O
poor	O
England	PNM

I	O
can	O
not	O
tell	O
whether	O
I	O
were	O
more	O
pleased	O
or	O
mortified	O
to	O
observe	O
,	O
in	O
those	O
solitary	O
walks	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
smaller	O
birds	O
did	O
not	O
appear	O
to	O
be	O
at	O
all	O
afraid	O
of	O
me	O
,	O
but	O
would	O
hop	O
about	O
within	O
a	O
yard	O
's	O
distance	O
,	O
looking	O
for	O
worms	O
and	O
other	O
food	O
,	O
with	O
as	O
much	O
indifference	O
and	O
security	O
as	O
if	O
no	O
creature	O
at	O
all	O
were	O
near	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
remember	O
,	O
a	O
thrush	O
had	O
the	O
confidence	O
to	O
snatch	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
hand	O
,	O
with	O
his	O
bill	O
,	O
a	O
of	O
cake	O
that	O
Glumdalclitch	O
had	O
just	O
given	O
me	O
for	O
my	O
breakfast	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
attempted	O
to	O
catch	O
any	O
of	O
these	O
birds	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
boldly	O
turn	O
against	O
me	O
,	O
endeavouring	O
to	O
peck	O
my	O
fingers	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
durst	O
not	O
venture	O
within	O
their	O
reach	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
they	O
would	O
hop	O
back	O
unconcerned	O
,	O
to	O
hunt	O
for	O
worms	O
or	O
snails	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
did	O
before	O
.	O

But	O
one	O
day	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
a	O
thick	O
cudgel	O
,	O
and	O
threw	O
it	O
with	O
all	O
my	O
strength	O
so	O
luckily	O
,	O
at	O
a	O
linnet	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
knocked	O
him	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
seizing	O
him	O
by	O
the	O
neck	O
with	O
both	O
my	O
hands	O
,	O
ran	O
with	O
him	O
in	O
triumph	O
to	O
my	O
nurse	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
bird	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
only	O
been	O
stunned	O
,	O
recovering	O
himself	O
gave	O
me	O
so	O
many	O
boxes	O
with	O
his	O
wings	O
,	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
of	O
my	O
head	O
and	O
body	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
held	O
him	O
at	O
arm	O
's	O
-	O
length	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
reach	O
of	O
his	O
claws	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
twenty	O
times	O
thinking	O
to	O
let	O
him	O
go	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
was	O
soon	O
relieved	O
by	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
servants	O
,	O
who	O
wrung	O
off	O
the	O
bird	O
's	O
neck	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
him	O
next	O
day	O
for	O
dinner	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
queen	O
's	O
command	O
.	O

This	O
linnet	O
,	O
as	O
near	O
as	O
I	O
can	O
remember	O
,	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
somewhat	O
larger	O
than	O
an	O

The	O
maids	O
of	O
honour	O
often	O
invited	O
Glumdalclitch	O
to	O
their	O
apartments	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
she	O
would	O
bring	O
me	O
along	O

her	O
,	O
on	O
purpose	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
pleasure	O
of	O
seeing	O
and	O

me	O

They	O
would	O
often	O
strip	O
me	O
naked	O
from	O
top	O
to	O
toe	O
,	O
and	O
lay	O
me	O
at	O
full	O
length	O
in	O
their	O
bosoms	O
;	O
wherewith	O
I	O
was	O
much	O
disgusted	O
because	O
,	O
to	O
say	O
the	O
truth	O
,	O
a	O
very	O
offensive	O
smell	O
came	O
from	O
their	O
skins	O
;	O
which	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
mention	O
,	O
or	O
intend	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
disadvantage	O
of	O
those	O
excellent	O
ladies	O
,	O
for	O
whom	O
I	O
have	O
all	O
manner	O
of	O
respect	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
conceive	O
that	O
my	O
sense	O
was	O
more	O
acute	O
in	O
proportion	O
to	O
my	O
littleness	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
those	O
illustrious	O
persons	O
were	O
no	O
more	O
disagreeable	O
to	O
their	O

to	O

And	O
,	O
after	O
all	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
their	O
natural	O
smell	O
was	O
much	O
more	O
supportable	O
,	O
than	O
when	O
they	O
used	O
perfumes	O
,	O
under	O
which	O
I	O
immediately	O
swooned	O
away	O

I	O
can	O
not	O
forget	O

that	O
an	O
intimate	O
friend	O
of	O
mine	O
in	O
Lilliput	O

took	O
the	O
freedom	O
in	O
a	O
warm	O

I	O

used	O
a	O

to	O
complain	O
of	O
a	O
strong	O
smell	O
about	O

I	O

as	O
little	O
faulty	O
that	O
way	O

as	O
most	O
of	O
my	O
sex	O

but	O
I	O
suppose	O
his	O
faculty	O
of	O

was	O
as	O
nice	O
with	O

to	O
me	O

to	O
row	O
for	O
my	O
own	O
diversion	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
queen	O
and	O
her	O
ladies	O
,	O
who	O
thought	O
themselves	O
well	O
entertained	O
with	O
my	O
skill	O
and	O
agility	O
.	O

Sometimes	O
I	O
would	O
put	O
up	O
my	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
my	O
business	O
was	O
only	O
to	O
steer	O
,	O
while	O
the	O
ladies	O
gave	O
me	O
a	O
gale	O
with	O
their	O
fans	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
weary	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
pages	O
would	O
blow	O
my	O
sail	O
forward	O
with	O
their	O
breath	O
,	O
while	O
I	O
showed	O
my	O
art	O
by	O
steering	O
starboard	O
or	O
larboard	O
as	O
I	O
pleased	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
Glumdalclitch	O
always	O
carried	O
back	O
my	O
boat	O
into	O
her	O
closet	O
,	O
and	O
hung	O
it	O
on	O
a	O
nail	O
to	O
dry	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
exercise	O
I	O
once	O
met	O
an	O
accident	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
like	O
to	O
have	O
cost	O
me	O
my	O
life	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
pages	O
having	O
put	O
my	O
boat	O
into	O
the	O
trough	O
,	O
the	O
governess	O
who	O
attended	O
Glumdalclitch	O
very	O
officiously	O
lifted	O
me	O
up	O
,	O
to	O
place	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
:	O
but	O
I	O
happened	O
to	O
slip	O
through	O
her	O
fingers	O
,	O
and	O
should	O
infallibly	O
have	O
fallen	O
down	O
forty	O
feet	O
upon	O
the	O
floor	O
,	O
if	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
luckiest	O
chance	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
stopped	O
by	O
a	O
corking-pin	O
that	O
stuck	O
in	O
the	O
good	O
gentlewoman	O
's	O
stomacher	O
;	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
the	O
pin	O
passing	O
between	O
my	O
shirt	O
and	O
the	O
waistband	O
of	O
my	O
breeches	O
,	O
and	O
thus	O
I	O
was	O
held	O
by	O
the	O
middle	O
in	O
the	O
air	O
,	O
till	O
Glumdalclitch	O
ran	O
to	O
my	O
relief	O
.	O

Another	O
time	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
servants	O
,	O
whose	O
office	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
fill	O
my	O
trough	O
every	O
third	O
day	O
with	O
fresh	O
water	O
,	O
was	O
so	O
careless	O
as	O
to	O
let	O
a	O
huge	O
frog	O
-LRB-	O
not	O
perceiving	O
it	O
-RRB-	O
slip	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
pail	O
.	O

The	O
frog	O
lay	O
concealed	O
till	O
I	O
was	O
put	O
into	O
my	O
boat	O
,	O
but	O
then	O
,	O
seeing	O
a	O
resting-place	O
,	O
climbed	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
it	O
lean	O
so	O
much	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
balance	O
it	O
with	O
all	O
my	O
weight	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
to	O
prevent	O
overturning	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
frog	O
was	O
got	O
in	O
,	O
it	O
hopped	O
at	O
once	O
half	O
the	O
length	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
over	O
my	O
head	O
,	O
backward	O
and	O
forward	O
,	O
daubing	O
my	O
face	O
and	O
clothes	O
with	O
its	O
odious	O
slime	O
.	O

The	O
largeness	O
of	O
its	O
features	O
made	O
it	O
appear	O
the	O
most	O
deformed	O
animal	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
conceived	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
desired	O
Glumdalclitch	O
to	O
let	O
me	O
deal	O
with	O
it	O
alone	O
.	O

I	O
banged	O
it	O
a	O
good	O
while	O
with	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
sculls	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
forced	O
it	O
to	O
leap	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
greatest	O
danger	O
I	O
ever	O
underwent	O
in	O
that	O
kingdom	O
,	O
was	O
from	O
a	O
monkey	O
,	O
who	O
belonged	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
clerks	O
of	O
the	O
kitchen	O
.	O

Glumdalclitch	O
had	O
locked	O
me	O
up	O
in	O
her	O
closet	O
,	O
while	O
she	O
went	O
somewhere	O
upon	O
business	O
,	O
or	O
a	O
visit	O
.	O

The	O
weather	O
being	O
very	O
warm	O
,	O
the	O
closet-window	O
was	O
left	O
open	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
windows	O
and	O
the	O
door	O
of	O
my	O
bigger	O
box	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
I	O
usually	O
lived	O
,	O
because	O
of	O
its	O
largeness	O
and	O
conveniency	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
sat	O
quietly	O
meditating	O
at	O
my	O
table	O
,	O
I	O
heard	O
something	O
bounce	O
in	O
at	O
the	O
closet-window	O
,	O
and	O
skip	O
about	O
from	O
one	O
side	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
:	O
whereat	O
,	O
although	O
I	O
was	O
much	O
alarmed	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
ventured	O
to	O
look	O
out	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
stirring	O
from	O
my	O
seat	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
saw	O
this	O
frolicsome	O
animal	O
frisking	O
and	O
leaping	O
up	O
and	O
down	O
,	O
till	O
at	O
last	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
my	O
box	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
seemed	O
to	O
view	O
with	O
great	O
pleasure	O
and	O
curiosity	O
,	O
peeping	O
in	O
at	O
the	O
door	O
and	O
every	O
window	O
.	O

I	O
retreated	O
to	O
the	O
farther	O
corner	O
of	O
my	O
room	O
;	O
or	O
box	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
monkey	O
looking	O
in	O
at	O
every	O
side	O
,	O
put	O
me	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
fright	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
wanted	O
presence	O
of	O
mind	O
to	O
conceal	O
myself	O
under	O
the	O
bed	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
might	O
easily	O
have	O
done	O
.	O

After	O
some	O
time	O
spent	O
in	O
peeping	O
,	O
grinning	O
,	O
and	O
chattering	O
,	O
he	O
at	O
last	O
espied	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
reaching	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
paws	O
in	O
at	O
the	O
door	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
cat	O
does	O
when	O
she	O
plays	O
with	O
a	O
mouse	O
,	O
although	O
I	O
often	O
shifted	O
place	O
to	O
avoid	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
at	O
length	O
seized	O
the	O
lappet	O
of	O
my	O
coat	O
-LRB-	O
which	O
being	O
made	O
of	O
that	O
country	O
silk	O
,	O
was	O
very	O
thick	O
and	O
strong	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
and	O
dragged	O
me	O
out	O
.	O

He	O
took	O
me	O
up	O
in	O
his	O
right	O
fore-foot	O
and	O
held	O
me	O
as	O
a	O
nurse	O
does	O
a	O
child	O
she	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
suckle	O
,	O
just	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
seen	O
the	O
same	O
sort	O
of	O
creature	O
do	O
with	O
a	O
kitten	O
in	O
Europe	PNM
;	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
offered	O
to	O
struggle	O
he	O
squeezed	O
me	O
so	O
hard	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
more	O
prudent	O
to	O
submit	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
good	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
took	O
me	O
for	O
a	O
young	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
species	O
,	O
by	O
his	O
often	O
stroking	O
my	O
face	O
very	O
gently	O
with	O
his	O
other	O
paw	O
.	O

In	O
these	O
diversions	O
he	O
was	O
interrupted	O
by	O
a	O
noise	O
at	O
the	O
closet	O
door	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
somebody	O
were	O
opening	O
it	O
:	O
whereupon	O
he	O
suddenly	O
leaped	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
window	O
at	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
come	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
thence	O
upon	O
the	O
leads	O
and	O
gutters	O
,	O
walking	O
upon	O
three	O
legs	O
,	O
and	O
holding	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
fourth	O
,	O
till	O
he	O
clambered	O
up	O
to	O
a	O
roof	O
that	O
was	O
next	O
to	O
ours	O
.	O

I	O
heard	O
Glumdalclitch	O
give	O
a	O
shriek	O
at	O
the	O
moment	O
he	O
was	O
carrying	O
me	O
out	O
.	O

The	O
poor	O
girl	O
was	O
almost	O
distracted	O
:	O
that	O
quarter	O
of	O
the	O
palace	O
was	O
all	O
in	O
an	O
uproar	O
;	O
the	O
servants	O
ran	O
for	O
ladders	O
;	O
the	O
monkey	O
was	O
seen	O
by	O
hundreds	O
in	O
the	O
court	O
,	O
sitting	O
upon	O
the	O
ridge	O
of	O
a	O
building	O
,	O
holding	O
me	O
like	O
a	O
baby	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
forepaws	O
,	O
and	O
feeding	O
me	O
with	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
by	O
cramming	O
into	O
my	O
mouth	O
some	O
victuals	O
he	O
had	O
squeezed	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
bag	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
of	O
his	O
chaps	O
,	O
and	O
patting	O
me	O
when	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
eat	O
;	O
whereat	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
rabble	O
below	O
could	O
not	O
forbear	O
laughing	O
;	O
neither	O
do	O
I	O
think	O
they	O
justly	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
blamed	O
,	O
for	O
,	O
without	O
question	O
,	O
the	O
sight	O
was	O
ridiculous	O
enough	O
to	O
every	O
body	O
but	O
myself	O
.	O

Some	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
threw	O
up	O
stones	O
,	O
hoping	O
to	O
drive	O
the	O
monkey	O
down	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
was	O
strictly	O
forbidden	O
,	O
or	O
else	O
,	O
very	O
probably	O
,	O
my	O
brains	O
had	O
been	O
dashed	O
out	O
.	O

The	O
ladders	O
were	O
now	O
applied	O
,	O
and	O
mounted	O
by	O
several	O
men	O
;	O
which	O
the	O
monkey	O
observing	O
,	O
and	O
finding	O
himself	O
almost	O
encompassed	O
,	O
not	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
make	O
speed	O
enough	O
with	O
his	O
three	O
legs	O
,	O
let	O
me	O
drop	O
on	O
a	O
ridge	O
tile	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
his	O
escape	O
.	O

Here	O
I	O
sat	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
five	O
hundred	O
yards	O
from	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
expecting	O
every	O
moment	O
to	O
be	O
blown	O
down	O
by	O
the	O
wind	O
,	O
or	O
to	O
fall	O
by	O
my	O
own	O
giddiness	O
,	O
and	O
come	O
tumbling	O
over	O
and	O
over	O
from	O
the	O
ridge	O
to	O
the	O
eaves	O

but	O
an	O
honest	O
lad	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
nurse	O

footmen	O
,	O
climbed	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
putting	O
me	O
into	O
his	O
breeches	O
pocket	O
,	O
brought	O
me	O
down	O
safe	O

I	O
was	O
almost	O
choked	O
with	O
the	O
filthy	O
stuff	O
the	O
monkey	O
had	O
crammed	O
down	O
my	O
throat	O
:	O
but	O
my	O
dear	O
little	O
nurse	O
picked	O
it	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
mouth	O
with	O
a	O
small	O
needle	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
fell	O
a-vomiting	O
,	O
which	O
gave	O
me	O
great	O
relief	O

Yet	O
I	O
was	O
so	O
weak	O
and	O
bruised	O
in	O
the	O
sides	O
with	O
the	O
squeezes	O
given	O
me	O
by	O
this	O
odious	O
animal	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
keep	O
my	O

The	O

every	O

her	O

made	O
me	O
several	O

The	O

an	O

that	O

This	O

me	O

how	O
vain	O
an	O

it	O
is	O
for	O
a	O

And	O
yet	O
I	O
have	O
seen	O
the	O
moral	O
of	O
my	O
own	O
behaviour	O
very	O
frequent	O
in	O
England	PNM
since	O
my	O

I	O
was	O
every	O

furnishing	O
the	O
court	O
with	O
some	O
ridiculous	O

and	O
Glumdalclitch	O
,	O
although	O
she	O
loved	O
me	O
to	O
excess	O
,	O
yet	O
was	O
arch	O
enough	O
to	O
inform	O
the	O
queen	O
,	O
whenever	O
I	O
committed	O
any	O
folly	O
that	O
she	O
thought	O
would	O
be	O

to	O
her	O
majesty	O

The	O
girl	O

who	O
had	O
been	O
out	O
of	O
order	O

was	O
carried	O
by	O
her	O

take	O
the	O

about	O
an	O

thirty	O

They	O
alighted	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
coach	O
near	O
a	O
small	O
foot-path	O
in	O
a	O
field	O

and	O
Glumdalclitch	O
setting	O
down	O
my	O

I	O
went	O
out	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
cow-dung	O
in	O
the	O

I	O
must	O
need	O
try	O
my	O
activity	O
by	O
attempting	O
to	O
leap	O

it	O

I	O
took	O
a	O
run	O

unfortunately	O
jumped	O
short	O

found	O
myself	O
just	O
in	O
the	O

up	O

I	O
waded	O
through	O
with	O
some	O

and	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
footmen	O
wiped	O
me	O
as	O
clean	O

he	O
could	O
with	O
his	O

The	O
king	O

observations	O
thereon	O

I	O
used	O
to	O
attend	O
the	O
king	O
's	O
levee	O
once	O
or	O
twice	O
a	O
week	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
often	O
seen	O
him	O
under	O
the	O
barber	O
's	O
hand	O
,	O
which	O
indeed	O
was	O
at	O
first	O
very	O
terrible	O
to	O
behold	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
razor	O
was	O
almost	O
twice	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
an	O
ordinary	O
scythe	O
.	O

His	O
majesty	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
custom	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
was	O
only	O
shaved	O
twice	O
a-week	O
.	O

I	O
once	O
prevailed	O
on	O
the	O
barber	O
to	O
give	O
me	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
suds	O
or	O
lather	O
,	O
out	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
picked	O
forty	O
or	O
fifty	O
of	O
the	O
strongest	O
stumps	O
of	O
hair	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
took	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
fine	O
wood	O
,	O
and	O
cut	O
it	O
like	O
the	O
back	O
of	O
a	O
comb	O
,	O
making	O
several	O
holes	O
in	O
it	O
at	O
equal	O
distances	O
with	O
as	O
small	O
a	O
needle	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
get	O
from	O
Glumdalclitch	PNM
.	O

I	O
fixed	O
in	O
the	O
stumps	O
so	O
artificially	O
,	O
scraping	O
and	O
sloping	O
them	O
with	O
my	O
knife	O
toward	O
the	O
points	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
very	O
tolerable	O
comb	O
;	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
seasonable	O
supply	O
,	O
my	O
own	O
being	O
so	O
much	O
broken	O
in	O
the	O
teeth	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
almost	O
useless	O
:	O
neither	O
did	O
I	O
know	O
any	O
artist	O
in	O
that	O
country	O
so	O
nice	O
and	O
exact	O
,	O
as	O
would	O
undertake	O
to	O
make	O
me	O
another	O
.	O

And	O
this	O
puts	O
me	O
in	O
mind	O
of	O
an	O
amusement	O
,	O
wherein	O
I	O
spent	O
many	O
of	O
my	O
leisure	O
hours	O
.	O

I	O
desired	O
the	O
queen	O
's	O
woman	O
to	O
save	O
for	O
me	O
the	O
combings	O
of	O
her	O
majesty	O
's	O
hair	O
,	O
whereof	O
in	O
time	O
I	O
got	O
a	O
good	O
quantity	O
;	O
and	O
consulting	O
with	O
my	O
friend	O
the	O
cabinet-maker	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
received	O
general	O
orders	O
to	O
do	O
little	O
jobs	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
directed	O
him	O
to	O
make	O
two	O
chair-frames	O
,	O
no	O
larger	O
than	O
those	O
I	O
had	O
in	O
my	O
box	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
bore	O
little	O
holes	O
with	O
a	O
fine	O
awl	O
,	O
round	O
those	O
parts	O
where	O
I	O
designed	O
the	O
backs	O
and	O
seats	O
;	O
through	O
these	O
holes	O
I	O
wove	O
the	O
strongest	O
hairs	O
I	O
could	O
pick	O
out	O
,	O
just	O
after	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
cane	O
chairs	O
in	O
England	PNM
.	O

When	O
they	O
were	O
finished	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
present	O
of	O
them	O
to	O
her	O
majesty	O
;	O
who	O
kept	O
them	O
in	O
her	O
cabinet	O
,	O
and	O
used	O
to	O
show	O
them	O
for	O
curiosities	O
,	O
as	O
indeed	O
they	O
were	O
the	O
wonder	O
of	O
every	O
one	O
that	O
beheld	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
queen	O
would	O
have	O
me	O
sit	O
upon	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
chairs	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
absolutely	O
refused	O
to	O
obey	O
her	O
,	O
protesting	O
I	O
would	O
rather	O
die	O
than	O
place	O
a	O
dishonourable	O
part	O
of	O
my	O
body	O
on	O
those	O
precious	O
hairs	O
,	O
that	O
once	O
adorned	O
her	O
majesty	O

head	O

Of	O
these	O
hairs	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
always	O
a	O
mechanical	O
genius	O
-RRB-	O
I	O
likewise	O
made	O
a	O
neat	O
little	O
purse	O
,	O
about	O
five	O
feet	O
long	O
,	O
with	O
her	O
majesty	O
's	O
name	O
deciphered	O
in	O
gold	O
letters	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
gave	O
to	O
Glumdalclitch	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
queen	O
's	O
consent	O
.	O

To	O
say	O
the	O
truth	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
more	O
for	O
show	O
than	O
use	O
,	O
being	O
not	O
of	O
strength	O
to	O
bear	O
the	O
weight	O
of	O
the	O
larger	O
coins	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
she	O
kept	O
nothing	O
in	O
it	O
but	O
some	O
little	O
toys	O
that	O
girls	O
are	O
fond	O
of	O
.	O

The	O
king	O
,	O
who	O
delighted	O
in	O
music	O
,	O
had	O
frequent	O
concerts	O
at	O
court	O
,	O
to	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
sometimes	O
carried	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
in	O
my	O
box	O
on	O
a	O
table	O
to	O
hear	O
them	O
:	O
but	O
the	O
noise	O
was	O
so	O
great	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
hardly	O
distinguish	O
the	O
tunes	O
.	O

I	O
am	O
confident	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
drums	O
and	O
trumpets	O
of	O
a	O
royal	O
army	O
,	O
beating	O
and	O
sounding	O
together	O
just	O
at	O
your	O
ears	O
,	O
could	O
not	O
equal	O
it	O
.	O

My	O
practice	O
was	O
to	O
have	O
my	O
box	O
removed	O
from	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
the	O
performers	O
sat	O
,	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
then	O
to	O
shut	O
the	O
doors	O
and	O
windows	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
draw	O
the	O
window	O
curtains	O
;	O
after	O
which	O
I	O
found	O
their	O
music	O
not	O
disagreeable	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
learned	O
in	O
my	O
youth	O
to	O
play	O
a	O
little	O
upon	O
the	O
spinet	O
.	O

Glumdalclitch	O
kept	O
one	O
in	O
her	O
chamber	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
master	O
attended	O
twice	O
a-week	O
to	O
teach	O
her	O
:	O
I	O
called	O
it	O
a	O
spinet	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
somewhat	O
resembled	O
that	O
instrument	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
played	O
upon	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
manner	O
.	O

A	O
fancy	O
came	O
into	O
my	O
head	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
entertain	O
the	O
king	O
and	O
queen	O
with	O
an	O
English	O
tune	O
upon	O
this	O
instrument	O
.	O

But	O
this	O
appeared	O
extremely	O
difficult	O
:	O
for	O
the	O
spinet	O
was	O
near	O
sixty	O
feet	O
long	O
,	O
each	O
key	O
being	O
almost	O
a	O
foot	O
wide	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
with	O
my	O
arms	O
extended	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
reach	O
to	O
above	O
five	O
keys	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
press	O
them	O
down	O
required	O
a	O
good	O
smart	O
stroke	O
with	O
my	O
fist	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
be	O
too	O
great	O
a	O
labour	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
no	O
purpose	O
.	O

The	O
method	O
I	O
contrived	O
was	O
this	O
:	O
I	O
prepared	O
two	O
round	O
sticks	O
,	O
about	O
the	O
bigness	O
of	O
common	O
cudgels	O
;	O
they	O
were	O
thicker	O
at	O
one	O
end	O
than	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
covered	O
the	O
thicker	O
ends	O
with	O
pieces	O
of	O
a	O
mouse	O
's	O
skin	O
,	O
that	O
by	O
rapping	O
on	O
them	O
I	O
might	O
neither	O
damage	O
the	O
tops	O
of	O
the	O
keys	O
nor	O
interrupt	O
the	O
sound	O
.	O

Before	O
the	O
spinet	O
a	O
bench	O
was	O
placed	O
,	O
about	O
four	O
feet	O
below	O
the	O
keys	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
put	O
upon	O
the	O
bench	O
.	O

I	O
ran	O
sideling	O
upon	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
way	O
and	O
this	O
,	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
banging	O
the	O
proper	O
keys	O
with	O
my	O
two	O
sticks	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
shift	O
to	O
play	O
a	O
jig	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
great	O
satisfaction	O
of	O
both	O
their	O
majesties	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
most	O
violent	O
exercise	O
I	O
ever	O
underwent	O
;	O
and	O
yet	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
strike	O
above	O
sixteen	O
keys	O
,	O
nor	O
consequently	O
play	O
the	O
bass	O
and	O
treble	O
together	O
,	O
as	O
other	O
artists	O
do	O
;	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
disadvantage	O
to	O
my	O
performance	O
.	O

The	O
king	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
before	O
observed	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
prince	O
of	O
excellent	O
understanding	O
,	O
would	O
frequently	O
order	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
brought	O
in	O
my	O
box	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
upon	O
the	O
table	O
in	O
his	O
closet	O
:	O
he	O
would	O
then	O
command	O
me	O
to	O
bring	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
chairs	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
box	O
,	O
and	O
sit	O
down	O
within	O
three	O
yards	O
distance	O
upon	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
cabinet	O
,	O
which	O
brought	O
me	O
almost	O
to	O
a	O
level	O
with	O
his	O
face	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
manner	O
I	O
had	O
several	O
conversations	O
with	O
him	O

I	O
one	O
day	O
took	O
the	O
freedom	O
to	O
tell	O
his	O
majesty	O

``	O

discovered	O
towards	O

happened	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
curious	O

inquisitive	O
upon	O
every	O

that	O
it	O
could	O
not	O

to	O
refuse	O
giving	O

what	O
satisfaction	O
I	O
was	O
able	O

Yet	O
thus	O
much	O
I	O
may	O
be	O
allowed	O
to	O
say	O
in	O
my	O
own	O
vindication	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
artfully	O
eluded	O
many	O
of	O
his	O

gave	O
to	O
every	O

a	O
more	O

I	O
have	O

must	O

the	O

most	O
prevail	O

I	O
was	O

is	O

I	O
was	O

their	O

for	O

I	O
had	O
always	O
a	O
strong	O
impulse	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
some	O
time	O
recover	O
my	O
liberty	O

though	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O

The	O
ship	O
in	O
which	O
I	O
sailed	O

was	O
the	O
first	O
ever	O
known	O
to	O
be	O
driven	O
within	O
sight	O
of	O
that	O
coast	O

and	O
the	O
king	O
had	O
given	O
strict	O
orders	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
another	O
appeared	O
,	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
taken	O
ashore	O

with	O

its	O
crew	O

brought	O

He	O
was	O
strongly	O

my	O

size	O

by	O
whom	O
I	O
might	O
propagate	O

:	O
but	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
should	O
rather	O
have	O
died	O
than	O
undergone	O
the	O
disgrace	O
of	O
leaving	O
a	O
posterity	O
to	O
be	O
kept	O
in	O
cages	O
,	O
like	O
tame	O
canary-birds	O

perhaps	O

persons	O

I	O
was	O
indeed	O
treated	O
with	O
much	O
kindness	O
:	O
I	O
was	O
the	O
favourite	O
of	O
a	O
great	O
king	O
and	O
queen	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
delight	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
court	O

but	O
it	O
was	O
upon	O
such	O
a	O
foot	O
as	O
ill	O
became	O
the	O
dignity	O
of	O
humankind	O
.	O

I	O
could	O
never	O
forget	O
those	O
domestic	O
pledges	O
I	O
had	O
left	O
behind	O
me	O
.	O

I	O
wanted	O
to	O
be	O
among	O
people	O
,	O
with	O
whom	O
I	O
could	O
converse	O
upon	O
even	O
terms	O

walk	O
about	O
the	O
streets	O

fields	O
without	O
being	O
afraid	O
of	O
being	O
trod	O
to	O
death	O

But	O
my	O
deliverance	O
came	O
sooner	O
than	O
I	O
expected	O

in	O
a	O
manner	O
not	O

the	O
whole	O

circumstances	O
of	O
which	O
I	O

I	O
had	O
now	O
been	O
two	O

in	O
this	O

and	O
about	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
the	O
third	O

Glumdalclitch	O
and	O
I	O
attended	O
the	O
king	O

queen	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
progress	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
coast	O
of	O
the	O
kingdom	O

I	O
was	O
carried	O
,	O
as	O
usual	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
travelling-box	O
,	O
which	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
already	O
described	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
convenient	O
closet	O
,	O
of	O
twelve	O
feet	O
wide	O

And	O
I	O
had	O
ordered	O
a	O
hammock	O
to	O
be	O
fixed	O
,	O
by	O
silken	O
ropes	O
from	O
the	O
four	O
corners	O
at	O
the	O
top	O
,	O
to	O
break	O
the	O
jolts	O
,	O
when	O
a	O
servant	O
carried	O
me	O
before	O
him	O
on	O
horseback	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
sometimes	O
desired	O
;	O
and	O
would	O
often	O
sleep	O
in	O
my	O
hammock	O
,	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
upon	O
the	O
road	O

On	O
the	O
roof	O
of	O
my	O
closet	O
,	O
not	O
directly	O
over	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
hammock	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
joiner	O
to	O
cut	O
out	O
a	O
hole	O
of	O
a	O
foot	O
square	O
,	O
to	O
give	O
me	O
air	O
in	O
hot	O
weather	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
slept	O
;	O
which	O
hole	O
I	O
shut	O
at	O
pleasure	O
with	O
a	O
board	O
that	O
drew	O
backward	O
and	O
forward	O
through	O
a	O

.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
our	O
journey	O
's	O
end	O
,	O
the	O
king	O
thought	O
proper	O
to	O
pass	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
at	O
a	O
palace	O
he	O
has	O
near	O
Flanflasnic	O
,	O
a	O
city	O
within	O
eighteen	O
English	O
miles	O
of	O
the	O
seaside	O

Glumdalclitch	O
and	O
I	O
were	O
much	O
fatigued	O
:	O
I	O
had	O
gotten	O
a	O
small	O
cold	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
poor	O
girl	O
was	O
so	O
ill	O
as	O
to	O
be	O
confined	O
to	O
her	O
chamber	O
.	O

I	O
longed	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
ocean	O
,	O
which	O
must	O
be	O
the	O
only	O
scene	O
of	O
my	O
escape	O
,	O
if	O
ever	O
it	O
should	O
happen	O
.	O

I	O
pretended	O
to	O
be	O
worse	O
than	O
I	O
really	O
was	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
leave	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
fresh	O
air	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
page	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
fond	O
of	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
had	O
sometimes	O
been	O
trusted	O
with	O
me	O
.	O

I	O
shall	O
never	O
forget	O
with	O
what	O
unwillingness	O
Glumdalclitch	O
consented	O
,	O
nor	O
the	O
strict	O
charge	O
she	O
gave	O
the	O
page	O
to	O
be	O
careful	O
of	O
me	O
,	O
bursting	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
into	O
a	O
flood	O
of	O
tears	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
she	O
had	O
some	O
forboding	O
of	O
what	O
was	O
to	O
happen	O
.	O

The	O
boy	O
took	O
me	O
out	O
in	O
my	O
box	O
,	O
about	O
half	O
an	O
hours	O
walk	O
from	O
the	O
palace	O
,	O
towards	O
the	O
rocks	O
on	O
the	O
sea-shore	O
.	O

I	O
ordered	O
him	O
to	O
set	O
me	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
lifting	O
up	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
sashes	O
,	O
cast	O
many	O
a	O
wistful	O
melancholy	O
look	O
towards	O
the	O
sea	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
myself	O
not	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
the	O
page	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
mind	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
nap	O
in	O
my	O
hammock	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
hoped	O
would	O
do	O
me	O
good	O
.	O

I	O
got	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
boy	O
shut	O
the	O
window	O
close	O
down	O
,	O
to	O
keep	O
out	O
the	O
cold	O

I	O
soon	O
fell	O
asleep	O

and	O
all	O
I	O
can	O
conjecture	O

I	O
slept	O
,	O
the	O
page	O
,	O
thinking	O
no	O
danger	O
could	O
happen	O
,	O
went	O
among	O
the	O
rocks	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
birds	O
'	O
eggs	O
,	O
having	O
before	O
observed	O
him	O
from	O
my	O
window	O
searching	O
about	O

and	O
picking	O
up	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
in	O
the	O
clefts	O
.	O

Be	O
that	O
as	O
it	O
will	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
myself	O
suddenly	O
awaked	O
with	O
a	O
violent	O
pull	O
upon	O
the	O
ring	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
fastened	O
at	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
my	O
box	O
for	O
the	O
conveniency	O
of	O
carriage	O
.	O

I	O
felt	O
my	O
box	O
raised	O
very	O
high	O
in	O
the	O
air	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
borne	O
forward	O
with	O
prodigious	O
speed	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
jolt	O
had	O
like	O
to	O
have	O
shaken	O
me	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
hammock	O
,	O
but	O
afterward	O
the	O
motion	O
was	O
easy	O
enough	O
.	O

I	O
called	O
out	O
several	O
times	O
,	O
as	O
loud	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
raise	O
my	O
voice	O
,	O
but	O
all	O
to	O
no	O
purpose	O

I	O
looked	O
towards	O
my	O
windows	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
see	O
nothing	O
but	O
the	O
clouds	O
and	O
sky	O

I	O
heard	O
a	O
noise	O
just	O
over	O
my	O
head	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
clapping	O
of	O
wings	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
began	O
to	O
perceive	O
the	O
woful	O
condition	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
;	O
that	O
some	O
eagle	O
had	O
got	O
the	O
ring	O
of	O
my	O
box	O
in	O
his	O
beak	O
,	O
with	O
an	O
intent	O
to	O
let	O
it	O
fall	O
on	O
a	O
rock	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
tortoise	O
in	O
a	O
shell	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
pick	O
out	O
my	O
body	O
,	O
and	O
devour	O
it	O
:	O
for	O
the	O
sagacity	O
and	O
smell	O
of	O
this	O
bird	O
enables	O
him	O
to	O
discover	O
his	O
quarry	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O

though	O
better	O

than	O
I	O
could	O
be	O
within	O
a	O
two-inch	O
board	O

In	O
a	O
little	O
time	O
,	O
I	O
observed	O
the	O
noise	O
and	O
flutter	O
of	O
wings	O
to	O
increase	O
very	O
fast	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
box	O
was	O
tossed	O
up	O
and	O
down	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
sign	O
in	O
a	O
windy	O
day	O

I	O
heard	O
several	O
bangs	O
or	O
buffets	O

as	O
I	O
thought	O
given	O
to	O
the	O
eagle	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
such	O
I	O
am	O
certain	O
it	O

then	O

all	O
on	O
a	O

myself	O
falling	O
perpendicularly	O
down	O

for	O
above	O
a	O
minute	O

with	O
such	O
incredible	O
swiftness	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
almost	O
lost	O
my	O
breath	O

My	O
fall	O
was	O
stopped	O
by	O
a	O
terrible	O
squash	O
,	O
that	O
sounded	O
louder	O
to	O
my	O
ears	O
than	O
the	O
cataract	O
of	O
Niagara	PNM

after	O
which	O

I	O
was	O
quite	O

and	O
then	O
my	O

began	O
to	O
rise	O
so	O
high	O

that	O
I	O
could	O
see	O
light	O
from	O
the	O
tops	O

I	O
now	O
perceived	O

that	O
the	O

with	O
much	O

out	O
of	O

I	O

myself	O

my	O

from	O
whom	O
one	O

I	O
may	O
say	O
with	O
truth	O

that	O
in	O
the	O

of	O

I	O
could	O
not	O

lamenting	O

Perhaps	O

have	O
not	O

under	O

I	O
was	O
at	O

see	O

A	O
breach	O
in	O
one	O

I	O
saw	O
the	O

in	O
at	O
several	O

although	O
the	O
leaks	O
were	O

I	O
endeavoured	O

I	O
was	O

I	O
might	O

Or	O
if	O
I	O
escaped	O
these	O
dangers	O
for	O
a	O
day	O
or	O
two	O
,	O
what	O
could	O
I	O
expect	O
but	O
a	O
miserable	O
death	O
of	O

I	O
was	O
four	O

under	O
these	O
circumstances	O
,	O
expecting	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
wishing	O
,	O
every	O

to	O
be	O
my	O
last	O

I	O
have	O
already	O
told	O
the	O
reader	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
two	O
strong	O
staples	O
fixed	O
upon	O
that	O
side	O
of	O
my	O
box	O
which	O
had	O
no	O
window	O
,	O
and	O
into	O
which	O
the	O
servant	O
,	O
who	O
used	O
to	O
carry	O
me	O
on	O
horseback	O
,	O
would	O
put	O
a	O
leathern	O
belt	O
,	O
and	O
buckle	O
it	O
about	O
his	O
waist	O

Being	O
in	O
this	O
disconsolate	O
state	O
,	O
I	O
heard	O
,	O
or	O
at	O
least	O
thought	O
I	O
heard	O
,	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
grating	O
noise	O
on	O
that	O
side	O
of	O
my	O
box	O
where	O
the	O
staples	O
were	O
fixed	O
;	O
and	O
soon	O
after	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
fancy	O
that	O
the	O
box	O
was	O
pulled	O
or	O
towed	O
along	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
felt	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
tugging	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
the	O
waves	O
rise	O
near	O
the	O
tops	O
of	O
my	O
windows	O
,	O
leaving	O
me	O
almost	O
in	O
the	O
dark	O
.	O

This	O
gave	O
me	O
some	O
faint	O
hopes	O
of	O
relief	O
,	O
although	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
imagine	O
how	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
brought	O
about	O
.	O

I	O
ventured	O
to	O
unscrew	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
chairs	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
always	O
fastened	O
to	O
the	O
floor	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
made	O
a	O
hard	O
shift	O
to	O
screw	O
it	O
down	O
again	O
,	O
directly	O
under	O
the	O
slipping-board	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
lately	O
opened	O
,	O
I	O
mounted	O
on	O
the	O
chair	O
,	O
and	O
putting	O
my	O
mouth	O
as	O
near	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
to	O
the	O
hole	O
,	O
I	O
called	O
for	O
help	O
in	O
a	O
loud	O
voice	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
languages	O
I	O
understood	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
fastened	O
my	O
handkerchief	O
to	O
a	O
stick	O
I	O
usually	O
carried	O
,	O
and	O
thrusting	O
it	O
up	O
the	O
hole	O
,	O
waved	O
it	O
several	O
times	O
in	O
the	O
air	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
any	O
boat	O
or	O
ship	O
were	O
near	O
,	O
the	O
seamen	O
might	O
conjecture	O
some	O
unhappy	O
mortal	O
to	O
be	O
shut	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
box	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
no	O
effect	O
from	O
all	O
I	O
could	O
do	O
,	O
but	O
plainly	O
perceived	O
my	O
closet	O
to	O
be	O
moved	O
along	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
space	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
or	O
better	O
,	O
that	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
box	O
where	O
the	O
staples	O
were	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
no	O
windows	O
,	O
struck	O
against	O
something	O
that	O
was	O
hard	O
.	O

I	O
apprehended	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
rock	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
myself	O
tossed	O
more	O
than	O
ever	O
.	O

I	O
plainly	O
heard	O
a	O
noise	O
upon	O
the	O
cover	O
of	O
my	O
closet	O
,	O
like	O
that	O
of	O
a	O
cable	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
grating	O
of	O
it	O
as	O
it	O
passed	O
through	O
the	O
ring	O

I	O
then	O
found	O
myself	O
hoisted	O
up	O
,	O
by	O
degrees	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
three	O
feet	O
higher	O
than	O
I	O
was	O
before	O
.	O

Whereupon	O
I	O
again	O
thrust	O
up	O
my	O
stick	O
and	O
handkerchief	O
,	O
calling	O
for	O
help	O
till	O
I	O
was	O
almost	O
hoarse	O
.	O

In	O
return	O
to	O
which	O
,	O
I	O
heard	O
a	O
great	O
shout	O
repeated	O
three	O
times	O
,	O
giving	O
me	O
such	O
transports	O
of	O
joy	O
as	O
are	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
conceived	O
but	O
by	O
those	O
who	O
feel	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
now	O
heard	O
a	O
trampling	O
over	O
my	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
somebody	O
calling	O
through	O
the	O
hole	O
with	O
a	O
loud	O
voice	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
English	O
tongue	O

``	O

there	O

any	O
body	O

I	O
answered	O

``	O

about	O
nine	O

began	O
to	O

myself	O
in	O
Lilliput	PNM

I	O
was	O
afraid	O
of	O
trampling	O
on	O
every	O
traveller	O
I	O
met	O

often	O
called	O
aloud	O

out	O

so	O
that	O
I	O

one	O

When	O
I	O

could	O
not	O

I	O
went	O
to	O

her	O
up	O
with	O

one	O

two	O

were	O
in	O

He	O
had	O

treated	O

than	O
an	O
inferior	O
officer	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
hearing	O
of	O
my	O
arrival	O

made	O
me	O
a	O

as	O
I	O
apprehended	O
only	O
out	O
of	O

for	O
nothing	O

what	O

I	O
me	O
in	O

The	O

that	O
remained	O

was	O
to	O
persuade	O

I	O
at	O

obtained	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
prospect	O
of	O
advantage	O

proposed	O
to	O
her	O

We	O
set	O
out	O
the	O
5th	O
day	O
of	O
August	O
,	O
1706	O
,	O
and	O
arrived	O
at	O
Fort	PNM
St.	PNM
George	PNM
the	O
11th	O
of	O
April	O
,	O
1707	O

We	O
staid	O
there	O
three	O
weeks	O
to	O
refresh	O
our	O
crew	O
,	O
many	O
of	O
whom	O
were	O
sick	O
.	O

From	O
thence	O
we	O
went	O
to	O
Tonquin	PNM
,	O
where	O
the	O
captain	O
resolved	O
to	O
continue	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
because	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
goods	O
he	O
intended	O
to	O
buy	O
were	O
not	O
ready	O
,	O
nor	O
could	O
he	O
expect	O
to	O
be	O
dispatched	O
in	O
several	O
months	O

Therefore	O
,	O
in	O
hopes	O
to	O
defray	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
charges	O
he	O
must	O
be	O
at	O
,	O
he	O
bought	O
a	O
sloop	O

loaded	O
it	O
with	O
several	O
sorts	O
of	O
goods	O

wherewith	O
the	O
Tonquinese	O
usually	O
trade	O
to	O
the	O
neighbouring	O

putting	O
fourteen	O
men	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
whereof	O
three	O
were	O
of	O
the	O
country	O

he	O
appointed	O
me	O
master	O
of	O
the	O
sloop	O

and	O
gave	O
me	O
power	O
to	O
traffic	O
,	O
while	O
he	O
transacted	O
his	O
affairs	O
at	O
Tonquin	PNM
.	O

We	O
had	O
not	O
sailed	O
above	O
three	O
days	O
,	O
when	O
a	O
great	O
storm	O
arising	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
driven	O
five	O
days	O
to	O
the	O
north-north-east	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
to	O
the	O
east	O
:	O
after	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
fair	O
weather	O
,	O
but	O
still	O
with	O
a	O
pretty	O
strong	O
gale	O
from	O
the	O
west	O

Upon	O
the	O
tenth	O
day	O
we	O
were	O
chased	O
by	O
two	O
pirates	O
,	O
who	O
soon	O
overtook	O
us	O
;	O
for	O
my	O
sloop	O
was	O
so	O
deep	O
laden	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
sailed	O
very	O
slow	O
,	O
neither	O
were	O
we	O
in	O
a	O
condition	O
to	O
defend	O
ourselves	O

We	O
were	O
boarded	O
about	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
by	O
both	O
the	O
pirates	O
,	O
who	O
entered	O
furiously	O
at	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
their	O
men	O
;	O
but	O
finding	O
us	O
all	O
prostrate	O
upon	O
our	O
faces	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
so	O
I	O
gave	O
order	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
they	O
pinioned	O
us	O
with	O
strong	O
ropes	O
,	O
and	O
setting	O
guard	O
upon	O
us	O
,	O
went	O
to	O
search	O
the	O
sloop	O

I	O
observed	O
among	O
them	O
a	O
Dutchman	O
,	O
who	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
of	O
some	O
authority	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
commander	O
of	O
either	O
ship	O

He	O
knew	O
us	O
by	O
our	O
countenances	O
to	O
be	O
Englishmen	O
,	O
and	O
jabbering	O
to	O
us	O
in	O
his	O
own	O
language	O

swore	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
tied	O
back	O

back	O

thrown	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O

spoke	O

told	O
him	O
who	O
we	O
were	O

being	O
Christians	O

that	O
he	O
would	O
move	O
the	O

to	O
take	O
some	O

on	O
us	O

This	O
inflamed	O
his	O

;	O
he	O
repeated	O
his	O
threatenings	O
,	O
and	O
turning	O
to	O
his	O
companions	O

spoke	O
with	O
great	O
vehemence	O
in	O

largest	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
pirate	O
ships	O
was	O
commanded	O
by	O
a	O
Japanese	O
captain	O
,	O
who	O
spoke	O
a	O
little	O
Dutch	O
,	O
but	O
very	O
imperfectly	O
.	O

He	O
came	O
up	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
several	O
questions	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
answered	O
in	O
great	O
humility	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
``	O
we	O
should	O
not	O
die	O
.	O
''	O

I	O
made	O
the	O
captain	O
a	O
very	O
low	O
bow	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
turning	O
to	O
the	O
Dutchman	O
,	O
said	O
,	O
``	O
I	O
was	O
sorry	O
to	O
find	O
more	O
mercy	O
in	O
a	O
heathen	O
,	O
than	O
in	O
a	O
brother	O
christian	O
.	O
''	O

But	O
I	O
had	O
soon	O
reason	O
to	O
repent	O
those	O
foolish	O
words	O
:	O
for	O
that	O
malicious	O
reprobate	O
,	O
having	O
often	O
endeavoured	O
in	O
vain	O
to	O
persuade	O
both	O
the	O
captains	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
thrown	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
-LRB-	O
which	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
yield	O
to	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
promise	O
made	O
me	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
not	O
die	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
prevailed	O
so	O
far	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
punishment	O
inflicted	O
on	O
me	O
,	O
worse	O
,	O
in	O
all	O
human	O
appearance	O
,	O
than	O
death	O
itself	O
.	O

My	O
men	O
were	O
sent	O
by	O
an	O
equal	O
division	O
into	O
both	O
the	O
pirate	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
sloop	O
new	O
manned	O
.	O

As	O
to	O
myself	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
determined	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
set	O
adrift	O
in	O
a	O
small	O
canoe	O
,	O
with	O
paddles	O
and	O
a	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
four	O
days	O
'	O
provisions	O
;	O
which	O
last	O
,	O
the	O
Japanese	O
captain	O
was	O
so	O
kind	O
to	O
double	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
stores	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
permit	O
no	O
man	O
to	O
search	O
me	O
.	O

I	O
got	O
down	O
into	O
the	O
canoe	O
,	O
while	O
the	O
Dutchman	O
,	O
standing	O
upon	O
the	O
deck	O
,	O
loaded	O
me	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
curses	O
and	O
injurious	O
terms	O
his	O
language	O
could	O
afford	O
.	O

About	O
an	O
hour	O
before	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
pirates	O
I	O
had	O
taken	O
an	O
observation	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
46	O
N.	O
and	O
longitude	O
of	O
183	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
some	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
pirates	O
,	O
I	O
discovered	O
,	O
by	O
my	O
pocket-glass	O
,	O
several	O
islands	O
to	O
the	O
south-east	O
.	O

I	O
set	O
up	O
my	O
sail	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
being	O
fair	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
design	O
to	O
reach	O
the	O
nearest	O
of	O
those	O
islands	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
shift	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
in	O
about	O
three	O
hours	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
all	O
rocky	O
:	O
however	O
I	O
got	O
many	O
birds	O
'	O
eggs	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
striking	O
fire	O
,	O
I	O
kindled	O
some	O
heath	O
and	O
dry	O
sea-weed	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
I	O
roasted	O
my	O
eggs	O
.	O

I	O
ate	O
no	O
other	O
supper	O
,	O
being	O
resolved	O
to	O
spare	O
my	O
provisions	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
.	O

I	O
passed	O
the	O
night	O
under	O
the	O
shelter	O
of	O
a	O
rock	O
,	O
strewing	O
some	O
heath	O
under	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
slept	O
pretty	O
well	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
I	O
sailed	O
to	O
another	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
thence	O
to	O
a	O
third	O
and	O
fourth	O
,	O
sometimes	O
using	O
my	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
my	O
paddles	O

But	O
,	O
not	O
to	O
trouble	O
the	O
reader	O
with	O
a	O
particular	O
account	O
of	O
my	O
distresses	O
,	O
let	O
it	O
suffice	O
,	O
that	O
on	O
the	O
fifth	O
day	O
I	O
arrived	O
at	O
the	O
last	O
island	O
in	O
my	O
sight	O
,	O
which	O
lay	O
south-south-east	O
to	O
the	O
former	O
.	O

This	O
island	O
was	O
at	O
a	O
greater	O
distance	O
than	O
I	O
expected	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
reach	O
it	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
five	O
hours	O
.	O

I	O
encompassed	O
it	O
almost	O
round	O
,	O
before	O
I	O
could	O
find	O
a	O
convenient	O
place	O
to	O
land	O
in	O
;	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
small	O
creek	O
,	O
about	O
three	O
times	O
the	O
wideness	O
of	O
my	O
canoe	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
the	O
island	O
to	O
be	O
all	O
rocky	O
,	O
only	O
a	O
little	O
intermingled	O
with	O
tufts	O
of	O
grass	O
,	O
and	O
sweet-smelling	O
herbs	O
.	O

I	O
took	O
out	O
my	O
small	O
provisions	O
and	O
after	O
having	O
refreshed	O
myself	O
,	O
I	O
secured	O
the	O
remainder	O
in	O
a	O
cave	O
,	O
whereof	O
there	O
were	O
great	O
numbers	O
;	O
I	O
gathered	O
plenty	O
of	O
eggs	O
upon	O
the	O
rocks	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
a	O
quantity	O
of	O
dry	O
sea-weed	O
,	O
and	O
parched	O
grass	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
designed	O
to	O
kindle	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
roast	O
my	O
eggs	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
about	O
me	O
my	O
flint	O
,	O
steel	O
,	O
match	O
,	O
and	O
burning-glass	O
.	O

I	O
lay	O
all	O
night	O
in	O
the	O
cave	O
where	O
I	O
had	O
lodged	O
my	O
provisions	O
.	O

My	O
bed	O
was	O
the	O
same	O
dry	O
grass	O
and	O
sea-weed	O
which	O
I	O
intended	O
for	O
fuel	O
.	O

I	O
slept	O
very	O
little	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
disquiets	O
of	O
my	O
mind	O
prevailed	O
over	O
my	O
weariness	O
,	O
and	O
kept	O
me	O
awake	O
.	O

I	O
considered	O
how	O
impossible	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
preserve	O
my	O
life	O
in	O
so	O
desolate	O
a	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
miserable	O
my	O
end	O
must	O
be	O
:	O
yet	O
found	O
myself	O
so	O
listless	O
and	O
desponding	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
the	O
heart	O
to	O
rise	O
;	O
and	O
before	O
I	O
could	O
get	O
spirits	O
enough	O
to	O
creep	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
cave	O
,	O
the	O
day	O
was	O
far	O
advanced	O
.	O

I	O
walked	O
awhile	O
among	O
the	O
rocks	O
:	O
the	O
sky	O
was	O
perfectly	O
clear	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sun	O
so	O
hot	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
turn	O
my	O
face	O
from	O
it	O
:	O
when	O
all	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
it	O
became	O
obscure	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
manner	O
very	O
different	O
from	O
what	O
happens	O
by	O
the	O
interposition	O
of	O
a	O
cloud	O
.	O

I	O
turned	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
perceived	O
a	O
vast	O
opaque	O
body	O
between	O
me	O
and	O
the	O
sun	O
moving	O
forwards	O
towards	O
the	O
island	O
:	O
it	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
about	O
two	O
miles	O
high	O
,	O
and	O
hid	O
the	O
sun	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
minutes	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
observe	O
the	O
air	O
to	O
be	O
much	O
colder	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
sky	O
more	O
darkened	O
,	O
than	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
stood	O
under	O
the	O
shade	O
of	O
a	O
mountain	O
.	O

As	O
it	O
approached	O
nearer	O
over	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
,	O
it	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
firm	O
substance	O
,	O
the	O
bottom	O
flat	O

smooth	O
,	O
and	O
shining	O
very	O
bright	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
reflection	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
below	O
.	O

I	O
stood	O
upon	O
a	O
height	O
about	O
two	O
hundred	O
yards	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
this	O
vast	O
body	O
descending	O
almost	O
to	O
a	O
parallel	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
at	O
less	O
than	O
an	O
English	O
mile	O
distance	O
.	O

I	O
took	O
out	O
my	O
pocket	O
perspective	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
plainly	O
discover	O
numbers	O
of	O
people	O
moving	O
up	O
and	O
down	O
the	O
sides	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
sloping	O
;	O
but	O
what	O
those	O
people	O
where	O
doing	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
distinguish	O
.	O

The	O
natural	O
love	O
of	O
life	O
gave	O
me	O
some	O
inward	O
motion	O
of	O
joy	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
ready	O
to	O
entertain	O
a	O
hope	O
that	O
this	O
adventure	O
might	O
,	O
some	O
way	O
or	O
other	O
,	O
help	O
to	O
deliver	O
me	O
from	O
the	O
desolate	O
place	O
and	O
condition	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
.	O

But	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
the	O
reader	O
can	O
hardly	O
conceive	O
my	O
astonishment	O
,	O
to	O
behold	O
an	O
island	O
in	O
the	O
air	O
,	O
inhabited	O
by	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
able	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
it	O
should	O
seem	O
-RRB-	O
to	O
raise	O
or	O
sink	O
,	O
or	O
put	O
it	O
into	O
progressive	O
motion	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
pleased	O

But	O
not	O
being	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
in	O
a	O
disposition	O
to	O
philosophise	O
upon	O
this	O
phenomenon	O
,	O
I	O
rather	O
chose	O
to	O
observe	O
what	O
course	O
the	O
island	O
would	O
take	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
seemed	O
for	O
awhile	O
to	O
stand	O
still	O
.	O

Yet	O
soon	O
after	O
,	O
it	O
advanced	O
nearer	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
could	O
see	O
the	O
sides	O
of	O
it	O
encompassed	O
with	O
several	O
gradations	O
of	O
galleries	O
,	O
and	O
stairs	O
,	O
at	O
certain	O
intervals	O
,	O
to	O
descend	O
from	O
one	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
lowest	O
gallery	O
,	O
I	O
beheld	O
some	O
people	O
fishing	O
with	O
long	O
angling	O
rods	O
,	O
and	O
others	O
looking	O
on	O
.	O

I	O
waved	O
my	O
cap	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
my	O
hat	O
was	O
long	O
since	O
worn	O
out	O

my	O
handkerchief	O
toward	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
and	O
upon	O
its	O
nearer	O
approach	O
,	O
I	O
called	O
and	O
shouted	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
strength	O
of	O
my	O
voice	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
looking	O
circumspectly	O
,	O
I	O
beheld	O
a	O
crowd	O
gather	O
to	O
that	O
side	O
which	O
was	O
most	O
in	O
my	O
view	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
by	O
their	O
pointing	O
towards	O
me	O
and	O
to	O
each	O
other	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
plainly	O
discovered	O
me	O

although	O
they	O
made	O
no	O
return	O
to	O
my	O

But	O
I	O
could	O

four	O

five	O
men	O
running	O
in	O
great	O
haste	O

up	O
the	O
stairs	O

to	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
who	O
then	O
disappeared	O

I	O
happened	O
rightly	O
to	O
conjecture	O

that	O
these	O
were	O
sent	O
for	O

to	O
some	O
person	O
in	O

upon	O
this	O

The	O
number	O
of	O
people	O
increased	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
the	O
island	O
was	O
moved	O
and	O
raised	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
manner	O

that	O
the	O

a	O
hundred	O

the	O

I	O
then	O
put	O
myself	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
supplicating	O
posture	O

and	O
spoke	O
in	O
the	O
humblest	O

received	O
no	O
answer	O

Those	O
who	O
stood	O

seemed	O
to	O
be	O
persons	O
of	O

I	O
returned	O

that	O
the	O

His	O

We	O
had	O
two	O
courses	O

of	O
three	O

each	O

In	O
the	O
first	O
course	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
shoulder	O
of	O
mutton	O
cut	O
into	O
an	O
equilateral	O

a	O
piece	O

a	O

The	O

was	O
two	O

in	O
the	O

of	O
fiddles	O

sausages	O
and	O

and	O
a	O
breast	O
of	O
veal	O
in	O
the	O

The	O

cut	O
our	O

cones	O

parallelograms	O

and	O
several	O
other	O

While	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
dinner	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
bold	O
to	O
ask	O
the	O
names	O
of	O
several	O
things	O
in	O

and	O
those	O

delighted	O

give	O
me	O
answers	O

hoping	O
to	O
raise	O
my	O
admiration	O
of	O
their	O
great	O
abilities	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
be	O
brought	O
to	O

with	O
them	O

I	O
was	O

whatever	O

I	O

After	O

my	O

withdrew	O

a	O

was	O
sent	O

by	O
the	O
king	O

attended	O
by	O
a	O

He	O

paper	O

and	O
three	O

four	O

giving	O
me	O

by	O
signs	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
sent	O
to	O
teach	O
me	O
the	O

We	O
sat	O
together	O
four	O
hours	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
time	O
I	O
wrote	O
down	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
words	O
in	O
columns	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
translations	O
over	O
against	O
them	O
;	O
I	O
likewise	O
made	O
a	O
shift	O
to	O
learn	O
several	O
short	O
sentences	O
;	O
for	O
my	O
tutor	O
would	O
order	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
servants	O
to	O
fetch	O
something	O

to	O
turn	O
about	O

to	O
stand	O

or	O
walk	O

and	O
the	O

Then	O
I	O
took	O
down	O
the	O
sentence	O
in	O

He	O
showed	O
me	O
also	O

together	O
with	O
the	O

of	O

He	O
gave	O
me	O
the	O

and	O
the	O

After	O

I	O
placed	O
all	O
my	O

thus	O

by	O
the	O

of	O
a	O

all	O

From	O
these	O

two	O
methods	O
of	O

them	O
to	O

The	O
first	O
and	O
the	O
mildest	O
course	O
is	O
,	O
by	O
keeping	O
the	O
island	O
hovering	O
over	O
such	O
a	O
town	O

and	O
the	O
lands	O
about	O
it	O

whereby	O

deprive	O
them	O
of	O
the	O
benefit	O
of	O
the	O

and	O

afflict	O
the	O

with	O
dearth	O
and	O
diseases	O
:	O
and	O
if	O
the	O
crime	O
deserve	O
it	O
,	O
they	O
are	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
pelted	O
from	O
above	O
with	O
great	O
stones	O
,	O
against	O
which	O
they	O
have	O
no	O
defence	O
but	O
by	O
creeping	O
into	O
cellars	O
or	O
caves	O
,	O
while	O
the	O
roofs	O
of	O
their	O
houses	O
are	O
beaten	O
to	O
pieces	O

But	O
if	O
they	O
still	O
continue	O
obstinate	O
,	O
or	O
offer	O
to	O
raise	O
insurrections	O
,	O
he	O
proceeds	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
remedy	O
,	O
by	O
letting	O
the	O
island	O
drop	O
directly	O
upon	O
their	O
heads	O
,	O
which	O
makes	O
a	O
universal	O
destruction	O
both	O
of	O
houses	O
and	O
men	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
an	O
extremity	O
to	O
which	O
the	O
prince	O
is	O
seldom	O
driven	O
,	O
neither	O
indeed	O
is	O
he	O
willing	O
to	O
put	O
it	O
in	O
execution	O
;	O
nor	O
dare	O
his	O
ministers	O
advise	O
him	O
to	O
an	O
action	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
would	O
render	O
them	O
odious	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
so	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
great	O
damage	O
to	O
their	O
own	O
estates	O

which	O
all	O
lie	O

But	O
there	O
is	O
still	O
indeed	O
a	O
more	O
weighty	O
reason	O
,	O
why	O
the	O
kings	O

The	O
author	O
permitted	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
grand	O
academy	O
of	O
Lagado	PNM
.	O

The	O
academy	O
largely	O
described	O
.	O

The	O
arts	O
wherein	O
the	O
professors	O
employ	O
themselves	O
.	O

This	O
academy	O
is	O
not	O
an	O
entire	O
single	O
building	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
continuation	O
of	O
several	O
houses	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
of	O
a	O
street	O
,	O
which	O
growing	O
waste	O
,	O
was	O
purchased	O
and	O
applied	O
to	O
that	O
use	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
received	O
very	O
kindly	O
by	O
the	O
warden	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
for	O
many	O
days	O
to	O
the	O
academy	O
.	O

Every	O
room	O
has	O
in	O
it	O
one	O
or	O
more	O
projectors	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
believe	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
in	O
fewer	O
than	O
five	O
hundred	O
rooms	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
man	O
I	O
saw	O
was	O
of	O
a	O
meagre	O
aspect	O
,	O
with	O
sooty	O
hands	O
and	O
face	O
,	O
his	O
hair	O
and	O
beard	O
long	O
,	O
ragged	O
,	O
and	O
singed	O
in	O
several	O
places	O
.	O

His	O
clothes	O
,	O
shirt	O
,	O
and	O
skin	O
,	O
were	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
colour	O
.	O

He	O
has	O
been	O
eight	O
years	O
upon	O
a	O
project	O
for	O
extracting	O
sunbeams	O
out	O
of	O
cucumbers	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
put	O
in	O
phials	O
hermetically	O
sealed	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
out	O
to	O
warm	O
the	O
air	O
in	O
raw	O
inclement	O
summers	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
doubt	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
eight	O
years	O
more	O
,	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
supply	O
the	O
governor	O
's	O
gardens	O
with	O
sunshine	O
,	O
at	O
a	O
reasonable	O
rate	O
:	O
but	O
he	O
complained	O
that	O
his	O
stock	O
was	O
low	O
,	O
and	O
entreated	O
me	O
``	O
to	O
give	O
him	O
something	O
as	O
an	O
encouragement	O
to	O
ingenuity	O
,	O
especially	O
since	O
this	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
very	O
dear	O
season	O
for	O
cucumbers	O
.	O
''	O

I	O
made	O
him	O
a	O
small	O
present	O
,	O
for	O
my	O
lord	O
had	O
furnished	O
me	O
with	O
money	O
on	O
purpose	O
,	O
because	O
he	O
knew	O
their	O
practice	O
of	O
begging	O
from	O
all	O
who	O
go	O
to	O
see	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
went	O
into	O
another	O
chamber	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
ready	O
to	O
hasten	O
back	O
,	O
being	O
almost	O
overcome	O
with	O
a	O
horrible	O
stink	O
.	O

My	O
conductor	O
pressed	O
me	O
forward	O
,	O
conjuring	O
me	O
in	O
a	O
whisper	O
``	O
to	O
give	O
no	O
offence	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
be	O
highly	O
resented	O
;	O
''	O
and	O
therefore	O
I	O
durst	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
stop	O
my	O
nose	O
.	O

The	O
projector	O
of	O
this	O
cell	O
was	O
the	O
most	O
ancient	O
student	O
of	O
the	O
academy	O
;	O
his	O
face	O
and	O
beard	O
were	O
of	O
a	O
pale	O
yellow	O
;	O
his	O
hands	O
and	O
clothes	O
daubed	O
over	O
with	O
filth	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
was	O
presented	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
gave	O
me	O
a	O
close	O
embrace	O
,	O
a	O
compliment	O
I	O
could	O
well	O
have	O
excused	O
.	O

His	O
employment	O
,	O
from	O
his	O
first	O
coming	O
into	O
the	O
academy	O
,	O
was	O
an	O
operation	O
to	O
reduce	O
human	O
excrement	O
to	O
its	O
original	O
food	O
,	O
by	O
separating	O
the	O
several	O
parts	O
,	O
removing	O
the	O
tincture	O
which	O
it	O
receives	O
from	O
the	O
gall	O
,	O
making	O
the	O
odour	O
exhale	O
,	O
and	O
scumming	O
off	O
the	O
saliva	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
a	O
weekly	O
allowance	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
society	O
,	O
of	O
a	O
vessel	O
filled	O
with	O
human	O
ordure	O
,	O
about	O
the	O
bigness	O
of	O
a	O
Bristol	O
barrel	O
.	O

I	O
saw	O
another	O
at	O
work	O
to	O
calcine	O
ice	O
into	O
gunpowder	O
;	O
who	O
likewise	O
showed	O
me	O
a	O
treatise	O
he	O
had	O
written	O
concerning	O
the	O
malleability	O
of	O
fire	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
intended	O
to	O
publish	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
most	O
ingenious	O
architect	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
contrived	O
a	O
new	O
method	O
for	O
building	O
houses	O
,	O
by	O
beginning	O
at	O
the	O
roof	O
,	O
and	O
working	O
downward	O
to	O
the	O
foundation	O
;	O
which	O
he	O
justified	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
like	O
practice	O
of	O
those	O
two	O
prudent	O
insects	O
,	O
the	O
bee	O
and	O
the	O
spider	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
man	O
born	O
blind	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
several	O
apprentices	O
in	O
his	O
own	O
condition	O
:	O
their	O
employment	O
was	O
to	O
mix	O
colours	O
for	O
painters	O
,	O
which	O
their	O
master	O
taught	O
them	O
to	O
distinguish	O
by	O
feeling	O
and	O
smelling	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
indeed	O
my	O
misfortune	O
to	O
find	O
them	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
not	O
very	O
perfect	O
in	O
their	O
lessons	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
professor	O
himself	O
happened	O
to	O
be	O
generally	O
mistaken	O
.	O

This	O
artist	O
is	O
much	O
encouraged	O
and	O
esteemed	O
by	O
the	O
whole	O
fraternity	O
.	O

In	O
another	O
apartment	O
I	O
was	O
highly	O
pleased	O
with	O
a	O
projector	O
who	O
had	O
found	O
a	O
device	O
of	O
ploughing	O
the	O
ground	O
with	O
hogs	O
,	O
to	O
save	O
the	O
charges	O
of	O
ploughs	O
,	O
cattle	O
,	O
and	O
labour	O
.	O

The	O
method	O
is	O
this	O
:	O
in	O
an	O
acre	O
of	O
ground	O
you	O
bury	O
,	O
at	O
six	O
inches	O
distance	O
and	O
eight	O
deep	O
,	O
a	O
quantity	O
of	O
acorns	O
,	O
dates	O
,	O
chestnuts	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
mast	O
or	O
vegetables	O
,	O
whereof	O
these	O
animals	O
are	O
fondest	O
;	O
then	O
you	O
drive	O
six	O
hundred	O
or	O
more	O
of	O
them	O
into	O
the	O
field	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
,	O
they	O
will	O
root	O
up	O
the	O
whole	O
ground	O
in	O
search	O
of	O
their	O
food	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
it	O
fit	O
for	O
sowing	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
manuring	O
it	O
with	O
their	O
dung	O
:	O
it	O
is	O
true	O
,	O
upon	O
experiment	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
the	O
charge	O
and	O
trouble	O
very	O
great	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
had	O
little	O
or	O
no	O
crop	O
.	O

However	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
doubted	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
invention	O
may	O
be	O
capable	O
of	O
great	O
improvement	O
.	O

I	O
went	O
into	O
another	O
room	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
walls	O
and	O
ceiling	O
were	O
all	O
hung	O
round	O
with	O
cobwebs	O
,	O
except	O
a	O
narrow	O
passage	O
for	O
the	O
artist	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
and	O
out	O
.	O

At	O
my	O
entrance	O
,	O
he	O
called	O
aloud	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
``	O
not	O
to	O

He	O
lamented	O
``	O
the	O
fatal	O

so	O

had	O
such	O

proposed	O

``	O
that	O

But	O
the	O

would	O
soon	O
be	O

``	O
although	O

the	O
custom	O

had	O
thereby	O
at	O

this	O

that	O
it	O
became	O

We	O
next	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
school	O
of	O
languages	O

where	O
three	O
professors	O
sat	O
in	O
consultation	O
upon	O
improving	O
that	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
country	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
project	O
was	O
,	O
to	O
shorten	O
discourse	O
,	O
by	O
cutting	O
polysyllables	O
into	O
one	O
,	O
and	O
leaving	O
out	O
verbs	O
and	O
participles	O
,	O
because	O
,	O
in	O
reality	O
,	O
all	O
things	O
imaginable	O
are	O
but	O
norms	O
.	O

The	O
other	O
project	O
was	O
,	O
a	O
scheme	O
for	O
entirely	O
abolishing	O
all	O
words	O
whatsoever	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
urged	O
as	O
a	O
great	O
advantage	O
in	O
point	O
of	O
health	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
brevity	O
.	O

For	O
it	O
is	O
plain	O
,	O
that	O
every	O
word	O
we	O
speak	O
is	O
,	O
in	O
some	O
degree	O
,	O
a	O
diminution	O
of	O
our	O
lungs	O
by	O
corrosion	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
consequently	O
,	O
contributes	O
to	O
the	O
shortening	O
of	O
our	O
lives	O
.	O

An	O
expedient	O
was	O
therefore	O
offered	O
,	O
``	O
that	O
since	O
words	O
are	O
only	O
names	O
for	O
things	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
convenient	O
for	O
all	O
men	O
to	O
carry	O
about	O
them	O
such	O
things	O
as	O
were	O
necessary	O
to	O
express	O

particular	O
business	O

are	O
to	O
discourse	O
on	O

And	O
this	O
invention	O
would	O
certainly	O
have	O
taken	O
place	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
great	O
ease	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
health	O
of	O
the	O
subject	O

if	O
the	O
women	O

in	O

had	O
not	O
threatened	O
to	O
raise	O
a	O
rebellion	O

they	O
might	O
be	O
allowed	O
the	O
liberty	O

many	O
of	O
the	O
most	O

wise	O
adhere	O
to	O
the	O
new	O
scheme	O
of	O
expressing	O
themselves	O
by	O
things	O

which	O
has	O
only	O
this	O

I	O
set	O
apart	O
one	O
day	O
on	O
purpose	O

I	O
proposed	O
that	O
Homer	O
and	O
Aristotle	O
might	O
appear	O
at	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
all	O
their	O
commentators	O
;	O
but	O
these	O
were	O
so	O
numerous	O
,	O
that	O
some	O
hundreds	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
attend	O
in	O
the	O
court	O
,	O
and	O
outward	O
rooms	O
of	O
the	O
palace	O
.	O

I	O
knew	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
distinguish	O
those	O
two	O
heroes	O
,	O
at	O
first	O
sight	O
,	O
not	O
only	O
from	O
the	O
crowd	O
,	O
but	O
from	O
each	O
other	O
.	O

Homer	O
was	O
the	O
taller	O
and	O
comelier	O
person	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
,	O
walked	O
very	O
erect	O
for	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
age	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
eyes	O
were	O
the	O
most	O
quick	O
and	O
piercing	O
I	O
ever	O
beheld	O
.	O

Aristotle	O
stooped	O
much	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
use	O
of	O
a	O
staff	O
.	O

His	O
visage	O
was	O
meagre	O
,	O
his	O
hair	O
lank	O
and	O
thin	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
voice	O
hollow	O
.	O

I	O
soon	O
discovered	O
that	O
both	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
perfect	O
strangers	O
to	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
company	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
or	O
heard	O
of	O
them	O
before	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
whisper	O
from	O
a	O
ghost	O
who	O
shall	O
be	O
nameless	O
,	O
``	O
that	O
these	O
commentators	O
always	O

in	O
the	O
lower	O
world	O
,	O
through	O
a	O
consciousness	O
of	O
shame	O
and	O
guilt	O
,	O
because	O
they	O
had	O
so	O
horribly	O
misrepresented	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
those	O
authors	O
to	O
posterity	O

''	O

I	O
introduced	O
Didymus	O
and	O
Eustathius	O
to	O
Homer	PNM
,	O
and	O
prevailed	O
on	O
him	O
to	O
treat	O
them	O
better	O
than	O
perhaps	O
they	O
deserved	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
soon	O
found	O
they	O
wanted	O
a	O
genius	O
to	O
enter	O
into	O
the	O
spirit	O
of	O
a	O
poet	O

But	O
Aristotle	O
was	O
out	O
of	O
all	O
patience	O
with	O
the	O
account	O
I	O
gave	O
him	O
of	O
Scotus	O

Ramus	O

as	O
I	O
presented	O
them	O
to	O
him	O

he	O
asked	O
them	O

``	O
whether	O

This	O
great	O
philosopher	O
freely	O
acknowledged	O
his	O
own	O
mistakes	O
in	O
natural	O

because	O
he	O
proceeded	O
in	O
many	O
things	O
upon	O
conjecture	O

all	O
men	O
must	O
do	O

he	O
found	O
that	O
Gassendi	O

had	O
made	O
the	O
doctrine	O
of	O

as	O
palatable	O
as	O
he	O
could	O
,	O
and	O
the	O

of	O
Descartes	O

were	O
equally	O

call	O
myself	O

The	O
author	O
leaves	O
Luggnagg	O

and	O
sails	O
to	O
Japan	PNM

From	O
thence	O
he	O
returns	O

I	O
thought	O
this	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
_	O
struldbrugs	O
_	O
might	O
be	O
some	O
entertainment	O
to	O
the	O
reader	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
common	O
way	O
;	O
at	O
least	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
remember	O
to	O
have	O
met	O
the	O
like	O
in	O
any	O
book	O
of	O
travels	O
that	O
has	O
come	O
to	O
my	O
hands	O
:	O
and	O
if	O
I	O
am	O
deceived	O
,	O
my	O
excuse	O
must	O
be	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
necessary	O
for	O
travellers	O
who	O
describe	O
the	O
same	O
country	O
,	O
very	O
often	O
to	O
agree	O
in	O
dwelling	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
particulars	O
,	O
without	O
deserving	O
the	O
censure	O
of	O
having	O
borrowed	O
or	O
transcribed	O
from	O
those	O
who	O
wrote	O
before	O
them	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
indeed	O
a	O
perpetual	O
commerce	O
between	O
this	O
kingdom	O
and	O
the	O
great	O
empire	O
of	O
Japan	PNM
;	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
probable	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
Japanese	O
authors	O
may	O
have	O
given	O
some	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
_	O
struldbrugs	O
_	O
;	O
but	O
my	O
stay	O
in	O
Japan	PNM
was	O
so	O
short	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
so	O
entirely	O
a	O
stranger	O
to	O
the	O
language	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
qualified	O
to	O
make	O
any	O
inquiries	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
hope	O
the	O
Dutch	O
,	O
upon	O
this	O
notice	O
,	O
will	O
be	O
curious	O
and	O
able	O
enough	O
to	O
supply	O
my	O
defects	O

His	O
majesty	O
having	O
often	O
pressed	O
me	O
to	O
accept	O
some	O
employment	O
in	O
his	O
court	O
,	O
and	O
finding	O
me	O
absolutely	O
determined	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
my	O
native	O
country	O
,	O
was	O
pleased	O
to	O
give	O
me	O
his	O
license	O
to	O
depart	O
;	O
and	O
honoured	O
me	O
with	O
a	O
letter	O
of	O
recommendation	O
,	O
under	O
his	O
own	O
hand	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
Emperor	O
of	O
Japan	PNM
.	O

He	O
likewise	O
presented	O
me	O
with	O
four	O
hundred	O
and	O
forty-four	O
large	O
pieces	O
of	O
gold	O

I	O
sold	O

On	O
the	O
6th	O
of	O
May	O
,	O
1709	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
a	O
solemn	O
leave	O
of	O
his	O
majesty	O

and	O
all	O
my	O
friends	O

This	O
prince	O
was	O
so	O
gracious	O
as	O
to	O
order	O
a	O
guard	O
to	O
conduct	O
me	O
to	O
Glanguenstald	PNM

which	O
is	O
a	O
royal	O
port	O
to	O
the	O
south-west	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O

In	O
six	O
days	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
vessel	O
ready	O
to	O
carry	O
me	O
to	O
Japan	PNM
,	O
and	O
spent	O
fifteen	O
days	O
in	O
the	O
voyage	O

We	O
landed	O
at	O
a	O
small	O
port-town	O

At	O

I	O
showed	O
the	O
custom-house	O

my	O
letter	O
from	O
the	O
king	O
of	O
Luggnagg	PNM

his	O

They	O
knew	O

bore	O

I	O
was	O
admitted	O

an	O

delivered	O
my	O
letter	O

which	O
was	O
opened	O
with	O
great	O
ceremony	O

and	O
explained	O
to	O
the	O
Emperor	O
by	O
an	O

gave	O

''	O

This	O
interpreter	O
was	O
a	O
person	O
employed	O
to	O
transact	O
affairs	O
with	O
the	O
Hollanders	O
.	O

He	O
soon	O
conjectured	O
,	O
by	O
my	O
countenance	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
European	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
repeated	O
his	O
majesty	O
's	O
commands	O
in	O
Low	O
Dutch	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
spoke	O
perfectly	O
well	O

I	O
answered	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
before	O
determined	O
,	O
``	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
a	O

whence	O
I	O
had	O
travelled	O
by	O

to	O
Luggnagg	PNM

and	O
then	O
took	O
shipping	O
for	O
Japan	PNM

where	O
I	O
knew	O
my	O
countrymen	O
often	O
traded	O

with	O
some	O

these	O
I	O
hoped	O
to	O
get	O
an	O
opportunity	O
of	O
returning	O
into	O
Europe	PNM
:	O
I	O
therefore	O
most	O
humbly	O
entreated	O
his	O
royal	O
favour	O

to	O
give	O
order	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
conducted	O
in	O
safety	O
to	O
Nangasac	PNM

''	O

To	O
this	O
I	O
added	O
another	O
petition	O

``	O
that	O
for	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
my	O
patron	O
the	O
king	O

Luggnagg	PNM

his	O
majesty	O
would	O
condescend	O
to	O

performing	O
the	O
ceremony	O
imposed	O
on	O
my	O
countrymen	O

of	O
trampling	O
upon	O
the	O

any	O

When	O
this	O
latter	O
petition	O
was	O
interpreted	O
to	O
the	O
Emperor	O
,	O
he	O
seemed	O
a	O
little	O
surprised	O
;	O
and	O
said	O
,	O
``	O
he	O
believed	O

was	O

this	O

began	O

whether	O
I	O

not	O

rather	O
suspected	O

must	O

,	O
for	O

reasons	O
I	O
had	O
offered	O

chiefly	O
to	O
gratify	O
the	O
king	O
of	O
Luggnagg	PNM
by	O
an	O
uncommon	O
mark	O
of	O
his	O
favour	O

he	O
would	O
comply	O
with	O
the	O
singularity	O
of	O
my	O
humour	O

the	O
affair	O
must	O
be	O
managed	O
with	O
dexterity	O

his	O
officers	O
should	O
be	O
commanded	O
to	O
let	O
me	O
pass	O

as	O
it	O
were	O
by	O
forgetfulness	O

For	O
he	O
assured	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
secret	O
should	O
be	O
discovered	O
by	O
my	O
countrymen	O

Dutch	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
cut	O
my	O

returned	O

for	O

arrived	O
at	O

after	O
a	O
very	O
long	O
and	O
troublesome	O
journey	O

I	O
soon	O
fell	O
into	O
the	O
company	O

were	O
curious	O
to	O
inquire	O

made	O
up	O

short	O

probable	O
as	O
I	O
could	O

concealed	O

knew	O

We	O
set	O

from	O
Portsmouth	PNM
upon	O
the	O
7th	O
day	O
of	O
September	O
,	O
1710	O
;	O
on	O
the	O
14th	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
Captain	O
Pocock	O

of	O
Bristol	PNM

at	O
Teneriffe	PNM

who	O
was	O

On	O
the	O
16th	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
parted	O
from	O
us	O
by	O
a	O
storm	O
;	O
I	O
heard	O
since	O
my	O

that	O
his	O
ship	O
foundered	O
,	O
and	O
none	O
escaped	O
but	O
one	O
cabin	O

He	O
was	O
an	O
honest	O
man	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
good	O
sailor	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
too	O
positive	O
in	O
his	O
own	O
opinions	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
his	O
destruction	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
with	O
several	O
others	O
;	O
for	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
followed	O
my	O
advice	O
,	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
safe	O
at	O
home	O
with	O
his	O
family	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
myself	O

I	O
had	O
several	O
men	O
who	O
died	O
in	O
my	O
ship	O
of	O
calentures	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
get	O
recruits	O
out	O
of	O
Barbadoes	PNM
and	O
the	O
Leeward	PNM
Islands	PNM
,	O
where	O
I	O
touched	O

by	O
the	O
direction	O
of	O
the	O
merchants	O
who	O
employed	O
me	O
;	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
soon	O
too	O
much	O
cause	O
to	O
repent	O
:	O
for	O
I	O
found	O
afterwards	O
,	O
that	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
been	O
buccaneers	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
fifty	O
hands	O
onboard	O
;	O
and	O
my	O
orders	O
were	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
trade	O
with	O
the	O
Indians	O
in	O
the	O
South-Sea	PNM
,	O
and	O
make	O
what	O
discoveries	O
I	O
could	O

These	O
rogues	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
had	O
picked	O
up	O
,	O
debauched	O
my	O
other	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
all	O
formed	O
a	O
conspiracy	O
to	O
seize	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
secure	O
me	O
;	O
which	O
they	O
did	O
one	O
morning	O
,	O
rushing	O
into	O
my	O
cabin	O
,	O
and	O
binding	O
me	O
hand	O
and	O
foot	O
,	O
threatening	O
to	O
throw	O
me	O
overboard	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
offered	O
to	O
stir	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
them	O
,	O
``	O
I	O
was	O
their	O
prisoner	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
submit	O
.	O
''	O

This	O
they	O
made	O
me	O
swear	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
they	O
unbound	O
me	O
,	O
only	O
fastening	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
legs	O
with	O
a	O
chain	O
,	O
near	O
my	O
bed	O
,	O
and	O
placed	O
a	O
sentry	O
at	O
my	O
door	O
with	O
his	O
piece	O
charged	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
commanded	O
to	O
shoot	O
me	O
dead	O
if	O
I	O
attempted	O
my	O
liberty	O
.	O

They	O
sent	O
me	O
own	O
victuals	O
and	O
drink	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
the	O
government	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
to	O
themselves	O
.	O

Their	O
design	O
was	O
to	O
turn	O
pirates	O
and	O
,	O
plunder	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
do	O
till	O
they	O
got	O
more	O
men	O
.	O

But	O
first	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
sell	O
the	O
goods	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
go	O
to	O
Madagascar	PNM
for	O
recruits	O
,	O
several	O
among	O
them	O
having	O
died	O
since	O
my	O
confinement	O
.	O

They	O
sailed	O
many	O
weeks	O
,	O
and	O
traded	O
with	O
the	O
Indians	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
course	O
they	O
took	O
,	O
being	O
kept	O
a	O
close	O
prisoner	O
in	O
my	O
cabin	O
,	O
and	O
expecting	O
nothing	O
less	O
than	O
to	O
be	O
murdered	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
often	O
threatened	O
me	O

Upon	O
the	O
9th	O
day	O
of	O
May	O
,	O
1711	O
,	O
one	O
James	O
Welch	O
came	O
down	O
to	O
my	O
cabin	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
,	O
``	O
he	O
had	O
orders	O
from	O
the	O
captain	O
to	O
set	O
me	O
ashore	O

''	O

I	O
expostulated	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
vain	O
;	O
neither	O
would	O
he	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
tell	O
me	O
who	O
their	O
new	O
captain	O
was	O
.	O

They	O
forced	O
me	O
into	O
the	O
long-boat	O
,	O
letting	O
me	O
put	O
on	O
my	O
best	O
suit	O
of	O
clothes	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
new	O
,	O
and	O
take	O
a	O
small	O
bundle	O
of	O
linen	O
,	O
but	O
no	O
arms	O
,	O
except	O
my	O
hanger	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
civil	O
as	O
not	O
to	O
search	O
my	O
pockets	O
,	O
into	O
which	O
I	O
conveyed	O
what	O
money	O
I	O
had	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
other	O
little	O
necessaries	O
.	O

They	O
rowed	O
about	O
a	O
league	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
set	O
me	O
down	O
on	O
a	O
strand	O
.	O

I	O
desired	O
them	O
to	O
tell	O
me	O
what	O
country	O
it	O
was	O
.	O

They	O
all	O
swore	O
,	O
``	O
they	O
knew	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
myself	O
;	O
''	O
but	O
said	O
,	O
``	O
that	O
the	O
captain	O
''	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
they	O
called	O
him	O
-RRB-	O
``	O
was	O
resolved	O

after	O
they	O
had	O
sold	O
the	O
lading	O

to	O
get	O

of	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
where	O
they	O
could	O
discover	O
land	O
.	O
''	O

They	O
pushed	O
off	O
immediately	O
,	O
advising	O
me	O
to	O
make	O
haste	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
being	O
overtaken	O
by	O
the	O
tide	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
bade	O
me	O
farewell	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
desolate	O
condition	O
I	O
advanced	O
forward	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
got	O
upon	O
firm	O
ground	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
sat	O
down	O
on	O
a	O
bank	O
to	O
rest	O
myself	O
,	O
and	O
consider	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
best	O
do	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
refreshed	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
resolving	O
to	O
deliver	O
myself	O
to	O
the	O
first	O
savages	O
I	O
should	O
meet	O
,	O
and	O
purchase	O
my	O
life	O
from	O
them	O
by	O
some	O
bracelets	O
,	O
glass	O
rings	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
toys	O
,	O
which	O
sailors	O
usually	O
provide	O
themselves	O
with	O
in	O
those	O
voyages	O
,	O
and	O
whereof	O
I	O
had	O
some	O
about	O
me	O
.	O

The	O
land	O
was	O
divided	O
by	O
long	O
rows	O
of	O
trees	O
,	O
not	O
regularly	O
planted	O
,	O
but	O
naturally	O
growing	O
;	O
there	O
was	O
great	O
plenty	O
of	O
grass	O
,	O
and	O
several	O
fields	O
of	O
oats	O
.	O

I	O
walked	O
very	O
circumspectly	O
,	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
being	O
surprised	O
,	O
or	O
suddenly	O
shot	O
with	O
an	O
arrow	O
from	O
behind	O
,	O
or	O
on	O
either	O
side	O
.	O

I	O
fell	O
into	O
a	O
beaten	O
road	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
saw	O
many	O
tracts	O
of	O
human	O
feet	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
cows	O
,	O
but	O
most	O
of	O
horses	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
I	O
beheld	O
several	O
animals	O
in	O
a	O
field	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
kind	O
sitting	O
in	O
trees	O
.	O

Their	O
shape	O
was	O
very	O
singular	O
and	O
deformed	O
,	O
which	O
a	O
little	O
discomposed	O
me	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
lay	O
down	O
behind	O
a	O
thicket	O
to	O
observe	O
them	O
better	O
.	O

Some	O
of	O
them	O
coming	O
forward	O
near	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
I	O
lay	O
,	O
gave	O
me	O
an	O
opportunity	O
of	O
distinctly	O
marking	O
their	O
form	O
.	O

Their	O
heads	O
and	O
breasts	O
were	O
covered	O
with	O
a	O
thick	O
hair	O
,	O
some	O
frizzled	O
,	O
and	O
others	O
lank	O
;	O
they	O
had	O
beards	O
like	O
goats	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
long	O
ridge	O
of	O
hair	O
down	O
their	O
backs	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
fore	O
parts	O
of	O
their	O
legs	O
and	O
feet	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
their	O
bodies	O
was	O
bare	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
see	O
their	O
skins	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
of	O
a	O
brown	O
buff	O
colour	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
no	O
tails	O
,	O
nor	O
any	O
hair	O
at	O
all	O
on	O
their	O
buttocks	O
,	O
except	O
about	O
the	O
anus	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
I	O
presume	O
,	O
nature	O
had	O
placed	O
there	O
to	O
defend	O
them	O
as	O
they	O
sat	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
for	O
this	O
posture	O
they	O
used	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
lying	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
often	O
stood	O
on	O
their	O
hind	O
feet	O
.	O

They	O
climbed	O
high	O
trees	O
as	O
nimbly	O
as	O
a	O
squirrel	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
strong	O
extended	O
claws	O
before	O
and	O
behind	O
,	O
terminating	O
in	O
sharp	O
points	O
,	O
and	O
hooked	O
.	O

They	O
would	O
often	O
spring	O
,	O
and	O
bound	O
,	O
and	O
leap	O
,	O
with	O
prodigious	O
agility	O
.	O

The	O
females	O
were	O
not	O
so	O
large	O
as	O
the	O
males	O
;	O
they	O
had	O
long	O
lank	O
hair	O
on	O
their	O
heads	O
,	O
but	O
none	O
on	O
their	O
faces	O
,	O
nor	O
any	O
thing	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
down	O
on	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
their	O
bodies	O
,	O
except	O
about	O
the	O
anus	O
and	O
pudenda	O
.	O

The	O
dugs	O
hung	O
between	O
their	O
fore	O
feet	O
,	O
and	O
often	O
reached	O
almost	O
to	O
the	O
ground	O
as	O
they	O
walked	O
.	O

The	O
hair	O
of	O
both	O
sexes	O
was	O
of	O
several	O
colours	O
,	O
brown	O
,	O
red	O
,	O
black	O
,	O
and	O
yellow	O
.	O

Upon	O
the	O
whole	O
,	O
I	O
never	O
beheld	O
,	O
in	O
all	O
my	O
travels	O
,	O
so	O
disagreeable	O
an	O
animal	O
,	O
or	O
one	O
against	O
which	O
I	O
naturally	O
conceived	O
so	O
strong	O
an	O
antipathy	O
.	O

So	O
that	O
,	O
thinking	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
enough	O
,	O
full	O
of	O
contempt	O
and	O
aversion	O
,	O
I	O
got	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
pursued	O
the	O
beaten	O
road	O
,	O
hoping	O
it	O
might	O
direct	O
me	O
to	O
the	O
cabin	O
of	O
some	O
Indian	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
not	O
got	O
far	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
met	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
creatures	O
full	O
in	O
my	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
coming	O
up	O
directly	O
to	O
me	O
.	O

The	O
ugly	O
monster	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
saw	O
me	O
,	O
distorted	O
several	O
ways	O
,	O
every	O
feature	O
of	O
his	O
visage	O
,	O
and	O
stared	O
,	O
as	O
at	O
an	O
object	O
he	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
before	O
;	O
then	O
approaching	O
nearer	O
,	O
lifted	O
up	O
his	O
fore-paw	O
,	O
whether	O
out	O
of	O
curiosity	O
or	O
mischief	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
drew	O
my	O
hanger	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
good	O
blow	O
with	O
the	O
flat	O
side	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
durst	O
not	O
strike	O
with	O
the	O
edge	O
,	O
fearing	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
might	O
be	O
provoked	O
against	O
me	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
should	O
come	O
to	O
know	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
killed	O
or	O
maimed	O
any	O
of	O
their	O
cattle	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
beast	O
felt	O
the	O
smart	O
,	O
he	O
drew	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
roared	O
so	O
loud	O
,	O
that	O
a	O
herd	O
of	O
at	O
least	O
forty	O
came	O
flocking	O
about	O
me	O
from	O
the	O
next	O
field	O
,	O
howling	O
and	O
making	O
odious	O
faces	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
ran	O
to	O
the	O
body	O
of	O
a	O
tree	O
,	O
and	O
leaning	O
my	O
back	O
against	O
it	O
,	O
kept	O
them	O
off	O
by	O
waving	O
my	O
hanger	O
.	O

Several	O
of	O
this	O
cursed	O
brood	O
,	O
getting	O
hold	O
of	O
the	O
branches	O
behind	O
,	O
leaped	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
whence	O
they	O
began	O
to	O
discharge	O
their	O
excrements	O
on	O
my	O
head	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
escaped	O
pretty	O
well	O
by	O
sticking	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
stem	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
almost	O
stifled	O
with	O
the	O
filth	O
,	O
which	O
fell	O
about	O
me	O
on	O
every	O
side	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
midst	O
of	O
this	O
distress	O
,	O
I	O
observed	O
them	O
all	O
to	O
run	O
away	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
;	O
at	O
which	O
I	O
ventured	O
to	O
leave	O
the	O
tree	O
and	O
pursue	O
the	O
road	O
,	O
wondering	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
that	O
could	O
put	O
them	O
into	O
this	O
fright	O
.	O

But	O
looking	O
on	O
my	O
left	O
hand	O
,	O
I	O
saw	O
a	O
horse	O
walking	O
softly	O
in	O
the	O
field	O
;	O
which	O
my	O
persecutors	O
having	O
sooner	O
discovered	O
,	O
was	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
their	O
flight	O
.	O

The	O
horse	O
started	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
came	O
near	O
me	O
,	O
but	O
soon	O
recovering	O
himself	O
,	O
looked	O
full	O
in	O
my	O
face	O
with	O
manifest	O
tokens	O
of	O
wonder	O
;	O
he	O
viewed	O
my	O
hands	O
and	O
feet	O
,	O
walking	O
round	O
me	O
several	O
times	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
have	O
pursued	O
my	O
journey	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
placed	O
himself	O
directly	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
yet	O
looking	O
with	O
a	O
very	O
mild	O
aspect	O
,	O
never	O
offering	O
the	O
least	O
violence	O
.	O

We	O
stood	O
gazing	O
at	O
each	O
other	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
;	O
at	O
last	O
I	O
took	O
the	O
boldness	O
to	O
reach	O
my	O
hand	O
towards	O
his	O
neck	O
with	O
a	O
design	O
to	O
stroke	O
it	O
,	O
using	O
the	O
common	O
style	O
and	O
whistle	O
of	O
jockeys	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
handle	O
a	O
strange	O
horse	O
.	O

But	O
this	O
animal	O
seemed	O
to	O
receive	O
my	O
civilities	O
with	O
disdain	O
,	O
shook	O
his	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
bent	O
his	O
brows	O
,	O
softly	O
raising	O
up	O
his	O
right	O
fore-foot	O
to	O
remove	O
my	O
hand	O
.	O

Then	O
he	O
neighed	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
times	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
so	O
different	O
a	O
cadence	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
almost	O
began	O
to	O
think	O
he	O
was	O
speaking	O
to	O
himself	O
,	O
in	O
some	O
language	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
.	O

While	O
he	O
and	O
I	O
were	O
thus	O
employed	O
,	O
another	O
horse	O
came	O
up	O
;	O
who	O
applying	O
himself	O
to	O
the	O
first	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
formal	O
manner	O
,	O
they	O
gently	O
struck	O
each	O
other	O
's	O
right	O
hoof	O
before	O
,	O
neighing	O
several	O
times	O
by	O
turns	O
,	O
and	O
varying	O
the	O
sound	O
,	O
which	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
almost	O
articulate	O
.	O

They	O
went	O
some	O
paces	O
off	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
it	O
were	O
to	O
confer	O
together	O
,	O
walking	O
side	O
by	O
side	O
,	O
backward	O
and	O
forward	O
,	O
like	O
persons	O
deliberating	O
upon	O
some	O
affair	O
of	O
weight	O
,	O
but	O
often	O
turning	O
their	O
eyes	O
towards	O
me	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
to	O
watch	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
not	O
escape	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
amazed	O
to	O
see	O
such	O
actions	O
and	O
behaviour	O
in	O
brute	O
beasts	O
;	O
and	O
concluded	O
with	O
myself	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
of	O
this	O
country	O
were	O
endued	O
with	O
a	O
proportionable	O
degree	O
of	O
reason	O
,	O
they	O
must	O
needs	O
be	O
the	O
wisest	O
people	O
upon	O
earth	O
.	O

This	O
thought	O
gave	O
me	O
so	O
much	O
comfort	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
forward	O
,	O
until	O
I	O
could	O
discover	O
some	O
house	O
or	O
village	O
,	O
or	O
meet	O
with	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
leaving	O
the	O
two	O
horses	O
to	O
discourse	O
together	O
as	O
they	O
pleased	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
first	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
a	O
dapple	O
gray	O
,	O
observing	O
me	O
to	O
steal	O
off	O
,	O
neighed	O
after	O
me	O
in	O
so	O
expressive	O
a	O
tone	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
fancied	O
myself	O
to	O
understand	O
what	O
he	O
meant	O
;	O
whereupon	O
I	O
turned	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
near	O
to	O
him	O
to	O
expect	O
his	O
farther	O
commands	O
:	O
but	O
concealing	O
my	O
fear	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
some	O
pain	O
how	O
this	O
adventure	O
might	O
terminate	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
reader	O
will	O
easily	O
believe	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
much	O
like	O
my	O
present	O
situation	O

The	O
two	O
horses	O
came	O
up	O
close	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
looking	O
with	O
great	O
earnestness	O
upon	O
my	O
face	O
and	O
hands	O
.	O

The	O
gray	O
steed	O
rubbed	O
my	O
hat	O
all	O
round	O
with	O
his	O
right	O
fore-hoof	O
,	O
and	O
discomposed	O
it	O
so	O
much	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
adjust	O
it	O
better	O
by	O
taking	O
it	O
off	O
and	O
settling	O
it	O
again	O
;	O
whereat	O

both	O
he	O
and	O
his	O
companion	O
-LRB-	O
who	O
was	O
a	O
brown	O
bay	O
-RRB-	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
much	O
surprised	O
:	O
the	O
latter	O
felt	O
the	O
lappet	O
of	O
my	O
coat	O
,	O
and	O
finding	O
it	O
to	O
hang	O
loose	O
about	O
me	O
,	O
they	O
both	O
looked	O
with	O
new	O
signs	O
of	O
wonder	O
.	O

He	O
stroked	O
my	O
right	O
hand	O
,	O
seeming	O
to	O
admire	O
the	O
softness	O
and	O
colour	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
squeezed	O
it	O
so	O
hard	O
between	O
his	O
hoof	O
and	O
his	O
pastern	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
roar	O
;	O
after	O
which	O
they	O
both	O
touched	O
me	O
with	O
all	O
possible	O
tenderness	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
under	O
great	O
perplexity	O
about	O
my	O
shoes	O
and	O
stockings	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
felt	O
very	O
often	O
,	O
neighing	O
to	O
each	O
other	O
,	O
and	O
using	O
various	O
gestures	O
,	O
not	O
unlike	O
those	O
of	O
a	O

,	O
when	O
he	O
would	O
attempt	O
to	O
solve	O
some	O
new	O
and	O
difficult	O
phenomenon	O
.	O

Upon	O
the	O
whole	O
,	O
the	O
behaviour	O
of	O
these	O
animals	O
was	O
so	O
orderly	O
and	O
rational	O
,	O
so	O
acute	O
and	O
judicious	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
at	O

concluded	O
they	O
must	O
needs	O
be	O
magicians	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
thus	O
metamorphosed	O
themselves	O
upon	O
some	O
design	O
,	O
and	O
seeing	O
a	O
stranger	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
resolved	O
to	O
divert	O
themselves	O
with	O
him	O
;	O
or	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
were	O
really	O
amazed	O
at	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
a	O
man	O
so	O
very	O
different	O

,	O
from	O
those	O
who	O
might	O
probably	O
live	O
in	O
so	O
remote	O
a	O
climate	O

Upon	O
the	O
strength	O
of	O
this	O

I	O
ventured	O
to	O

We	O
went	O
through	O
the	O
second	O
room	O
towards	O
the	O

Here	O
the	O
gray	O
walked	O
in	O
first	O
,	O
beckoning	O
me	O
to	O
attend	O
:	O
I	O
waited	O
in	O
the	O
second	O
room	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
ready	O
my	O
presents	O
for	O
the	O
master	O
and	O
mistress	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
;	O
they	O
were	O
two	O
knives	O

three	O
bracelets	O
of	O
false	O
pearls	O
,	O
a	O
small	O
looking-glass	O

and	O
a	O

The	O
horse	O
neighed	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
times	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
waited	O
to	O
hear	O
some	O
answers	O
in	O
a	O
human	O
voice	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
heard	O
no	O
other	O
returns	O
than	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
dialect	O
,	O
only	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
a	O
little	O
shriller	O
than	O
his	O
.	O

I	O
began	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
this	O
house	O
must	O
belong	O
to	O
some	O
person	O
of	O
great	O
note	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
because	O
there	O
appeared	O
so	O
much	O
ceremony	O
before	O
I	O
could	O
gain	O
admittance	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
that	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
quality	O
should	O
be	O
served	O
all	O
by	O
horses	O
,	O
was	O
beyond	O
my	O
comprehension	O
.	O

I	O
feared	O
my	O
brain	O
was	O
disturbed	O
by	O
my	O
sufferings	O
and	O
misfortunes	O
.	O

I	O
roused	O
myself	O
,	O
and	O
looked	O
about	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
room	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
left	O
alone	O
:	O
this	O
was	O
furnished	O
like	O
the	O
first	O
,	O
only	O
after	O
a	O
more	O
elegant	O
manner	O
.	O

I	O
rubbed	O
my	O
eyes	O
often	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
same	O
objects	O
still	O
occurred	O
.	O

I	O
pinched	O
my	O
arms	O
and	O
sides	O
to	O
awake	O
myself	O
,	O
hoping	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
dream	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
absolutely	O
concluded	O
,	O
that	O
all	O
these	O
appearances	O
could	O
be	O
nothing	O
else	O
but	O
necromancy	O
and	O
magic	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
time	O
to	O
pursue	O
these	O
reflections	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
gray	O
horse	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
door	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
me	O
a	O
sign	O
to	O
follow	O
him	O
into	O
the	O
third	O
room	O
where	O
I	O
saw	O
a	O
very	O
comely	O
mare	O
,	O
together	O
with	O
a	O
colt	O
and	O
foal	O
,	O
sitting	O
on	O
their	O
haunches	O
upon	O
mats	O
of	O
straw	O
,	O
not	O
unartfully	O
made	O
,	O
and	O
perfectly	O
neat	O
and	O
clean	O
.	O

The	O
mare	O
soon	O
after	O
my	O
entrance	O
rose	O
from	O
her	O
mat	O
,	O
and	O
coming	O
up	O
close	O
,	O
after	O
having	O
nicely	O
observed	O
my	O
hands	O
and	O
face	O
,	O
gave	O
me	O
a	O
most	O
contemptuous	O
look	O
;	O
and	O
turning	O
to	O
the	O
horse	O
,	O
I	O
heard	O
the	O
word	O
_	O
Yahoo	O
_	O
often	O
repeated	O
betwixt	O
them	O
;	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
which	O
word	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
then	O
comprehend	O
,	O
although	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
I	O
had	O
learned	O
to	O
pronounce	O

But	O
I	O
was	O
soon	O
better	O
informed	O
,	O
to	O
my	O
everlasting	O
mortification	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
horse	O
,	O
beckoning	O
to	O

did	O
upon	O
the	O

which	O
I	O
understood	O
was	O
to	O
attend	O
him	O

led	O
me	O
out	O
into	O
a	O

where	O
was	O
another	O

at	O
some	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O

Here	O
we	O
entered	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
saw	O
three	O
of	O
those	O
detestable	O
creatures	O

which	O
I	O
first	O
met	O
after	O
my	O

feeding	O
upon	O

and	O
the	O
flesh	O
of	O
some	O

now	O
and	O
then	O
a	O

They	O

with	O
strong	O

fastened	O
to	O
a	O

their	O

tore	O
it	O

The	O

My	O
horror	O

are	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
described	O

when	O
I	O
observed	O

a	O

the	O

the	O

The	O

The	O
great	O

that	O
seemed	O
to	O

was	O
to	O
see	O
the	O

different	O
from	O
that	O
of	O

The	O

,	O
having	O
smelt	O

returned	O
it	O
to	O
him	O
again	O
as	O
civilly	O
as	O
I	O
could	O

He	O
brought	O
out	O

_	O
'	O
kennel	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O

but	O
it	O
smelt	O
so	O
offensively	O
that	O
I	O
turned	O
from	O
it	O
with	O
loathing	O

he	O
then	O
threw	O
it	O

the	O
_	O

by	O
whom	O
it	O
was	O
greedily	O

He	O

showed	O
me	O
a	O
wisp	O
of	O
hay	O

and	O
a	O
fetlock	O
full	O
of	O

I	O
shook	O
my	O

to	O
signify	O
that	O
neither	O
of	O
these	O
were	O
food	O
for	O
me	O

And	O
indeed	O
I	O
now	O
apprehended	O
that	O
I	O
must	O
absolutely	O
starve	O

if	O

did	O
not	O
get	O

some	O

myself	O

I	O
never	O

any	O

This	O
the	O
master	O

observed	O

,	O
and	O
therefore	O
sent	O
the	O
_	O
Yahoo	O
_	O
back	O
to	O
his	O
kennel	O

He	O
then	O
put	O
his	O
fore-hoof	O
to	O
his	O
mouth	O
,	O
at	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
much	O
surprised	O

although	O
he	O
did	O
it	O
with	O
ease	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
a	O
motion	O
that	O
appeared	O
perfectly	O
natural	O

made	O
other	O

to	O
know	O
what	O
I	O
would	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
return	O
him	O
such	O
an	O

if	O

it	O

for	O
finding	O
myself	O

While	O
we	O
were	O
thus	O
engaged	O
,	O
I	O
observed	O
a	O
cow	O
passing	O
by	O
,	O
whereupon	O
I	O
pointed	O
to	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
expressed	O
a	O
desire	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
milk	O
her	O

This	O
had	O
its	O
effect	O
;	O
for	O
he	O
led	O
me	O
back	O
into	O
the	O
house	O

and	O
ordered	O
a	O

to	O
open	O
a	O
room	O

where	O
a	O
good	O
store	O
of	O

in	O
earthen	O

after	O
a	O
very	O
orderly	O

She	O
gave	O
me	O
a	O
large	O
bowlful	O

of	O
which	O
I	O
drank	O
very	O
heartily	O

and	O
found	O
myself	O
well	O
refreshed	O

About	O
noon	O

I	O
saw	O
coming	O
towards	O
the	O

There	O
was	O
in	O
it	O
an	O

alighted	O
with	O
his	O

They	O
dined	O
in	O
the	O

had	O
oats	O
boiled	O
in	O

for	O
the	O
second	O
course	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
old	O
horse	O
ate	O
warm	O

the	O

Their	O

upon	O

a	O
kind	O
of	O

might	O
be	O
sufficient	O

The	O
horse	O
immediately	O
ordered	O

heated	O

I	O
could	O

and	O
rubbed	O
them	O

made	O
a	O

I	O
ground	O

beat	O
them	O
between	O
two	O

;	O
then	O
took	O
water	O

and	O
made	O
them	O
into	O
a	O
paste	O

which	O
I	O
toasted	O

It	O
was	O
at	O

though	O
common	O
enough	O
in	O

in	O

this	O
was	O

the	O
first	O

had	O
made	O
how	O

And	O
I	O
can	O
not	O

observe	O

that	O
I	O
never	O
had	O
one	O

in	O
this	O

It	O
is	O
true	O

I	O

I	O

at	O

at	O

reconciled	O

I	O
am	O
confident	O
that	O
the	O

use	O
of	O

among	O

is	O
an	O
effect	O
of	O
luxury	O

The	O

I	O
must	O

hire	O

right	O

it	O
being	O
against	O
all	O
rules	O

should	O
be	O
allowed	O
to	O
speak	O

,	O
who	O
am	O
the	O
right	O
owner	O

lie	O
under	O
two	O
great	O
disadvantages	O
:	O
first	O
,	O
my	O
lawyer	O
,	O
being	O
practised	O
almost	O
from	O
his	O
cradle	O
in	O
defending	O
falsehood	O
,	O
is	O
quite	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
element	O
when	O
he	O
would	O
be	O
an	O
advocate	O
for	O
justice	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
an	O
unnatural	O
office	O
he	O
always	O
attempts	O
with	O
great	O
awkwardness	O
,	O
if	O
not	O
with	O
ill-will	O
.	O

The	O
second	O
disadvantage	O
is	O
,	O
that	O
my	O
lawyer	O
must	O
proceed	O
with	O
great	O
caution	O
,	O
or	O
else	O
he	O
will	O
be	O
reprimanded	O
by	O
the	O
judges	O
,	O
and	O
abhorred	O
by	O
his	O
brethren	O
,	O
as	O
one	O
that	O
would	O
lessen	O
the	O
practice	O
of	O
the	O
law	O
.	O

And	O
therefore	O
I	O
have	O
but	O
two	O
methods	O
to	O
preserve	O
my	O
cow	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
is	O
,	O
to	O
gain	O
over	O
my	O
adversary	O
's	O
lawyer	O
with	O
a	O
double	O
fee	O
,	O
who	O
will	O
then	O
betray	O
his	O
client	O
by	O
insinuating	O
that	O
he	O
hath	O
justice	O
on	O
his	O
side	O
.	O

The	O
second	O
way	O
is	O
for	O
my	O
lawyer	O
to	O
make	O
my	O
cause	O
appear	O
as	O
unjust	O
as	O
he	O
can	O
,	O
by	O
allowing	O
the	O
cow	O
to	O
belong	O
to	O
my	O
adversary	O
:	O
and	O
this	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
be	O
skilfully	O
done	O
,	O
will	O
certainly	O
bespeak	O
the	O
favour	O
of	O
the	O
bench	O
.	O

Now	O
your	O
honour	O
is	O
to	O
know	O
,	O
that	O
these	O
judges	O
are	O
persons	O
appointed	O
to	O
decide	O
all	O
controversies	O
of	O
property	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
for	O
the	O
trial	O

picked	O
out	O
from	O
the	O
most	O
dexterous	O
lawyers	O
,	O
who	O
are	O
grown	O
old	O
or	O
lazy	O

and	O
having	O
been	O
biassed	O
all	O
their	O
lives	O
against	O
truth	O
and	O
equity	O

such	O
a	O
fatal	O
necessity	O
of	O
favouring	O
fraud	O

a	O
large	O
bribe	O
from	O
the	O
side	O
where	O
justice	O
lay	O
,	O
rather	O
than	O
injure	O
the	O
faculty	O
,	O
by	O
doing	O
any	O
thing	O
unbecoming	O
their	O
nature	O
or	O
their	O
office	O

what	O

confined	O

several	O

when	O
I	O
was	O

ashore	O
in	O

However	O

about	O
10	O

southward	O

or	O
about	O
45	O

I	O
gathered	O

And	O
although	O
this	O
were	O

I	O
resolved	O
to	O

perhaps	O
some	O

island	O

I	O
desired	O
lying	O
westward	O

it	O

The	O

was	O
full	O
west	O

by	O
six	O
in	O
the	O

I	O
computed	O

had	O
gone	O
eastward	O
at	O

eighteen	O

I	O
spied	O
a	O

small	O
island	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
league	O

I	O

put	O
in	O
my	O

climbing	O
a	O

of	O
the	O

I	O
could	O
plainly	O

I	O
lay	O

repeating	O
my	O
voyage	O
early	O

ready	O

faint	O
at	O
the	O

At	O

desired	O
something	O

out	O

ordered	O
me	O
a	O
chicken	O

some	O
excellent	O

then	O
directed	O
that	O

should	O
be	O
put	O
to	O

in	O
a	O
very	O
clean	O
cabin	O

I	O
would	O
not	O

myself	O

lay	O
on	O
the	O
bed-clothes	O

and	O
in	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
stole	O
out	O

I	O
thought	O
the	O

at	O
dinner	O

getting	O
to	O
the	O

one	O

Thus	O
,	O
gentle	O
reader	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
given	O
thee	O
a	O
faithful	O
history	O
of	O
my	O
travels	O
for	O
sixteen	O
years	O
and	O
above	O
seven	O
months	O
:	O
wherein	O
I	O
have	O
not	O
been	O
so	O
studious	O
of	O
ornament	O
as	O
of	O
truth	O
.	O

I	O
could	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
like	O
others	O
,	O
have	O
astonished	O
thee	O
with	O
strange	O
improbable	O
tales	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
rather	O
chose	O
to	O
relate	O
plain	O
matter	O
of	O
fact	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
simplest	O
manner	O
and	O
style	O
;	O
because	O
my	O
principal	O
design	O
was	O
to	O
inform	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
to	O
amuse	O
thee	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
easy	O
for	O
us	O
who	O
travel	O
into	O
remote	O
countries	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
seldom	O
visited	O
by	O
Englishmen	O

to	O

Whereas	O
a	O
traveller	O
's	O
chief	O
aim	O
should	O
be	O
to	O
make	O
men	O
wiser	O
and	O
better	O

and	O
to	O
improve	O
their	O
minds	O
by	O

I	O
could	O
heartily	O
wish	O
a	O
law	O
was	O
enacted	O

that	O
every	O
traveller	O
,	O
before	O
he	O
were	O
permitted	O
to	O
publish	O
his	O
voyages	O
,	O
should	O
be	O
obliged	O
to	O
make	O
oath	O
before	O
the	O
Lord	O
High	O
Chancellor	O
,	O
that	O
all	O
he	O
intended	O
to	O
print	O
was	O
absolutely	O
true	O
to	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
his	O
knowledge	O
;	O
for	O
then	O
the	O
world	O
would	O
no	O
longer	O
be	O
deceived	O

as	O
it	O
usually	O
is	O

the	O

I	O
have	O
perused	O
several	O
books	O
of	O

with	O
great	O
delight	O
in	O
my	O
younger	O

but	O
having	O
since	O
gone	O
over	O
most	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O

and	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
contradict	O
many	O
fabulous	O
accounts	O
from	O
my	O
own	O
observation	O
,	O
it	O
has	O
given	O
me	O
a	O
great	O
disgust	O
against	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
reading	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
indignation	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
credulity	O
of	O
mankind	O
so	O
impudently	O
abused	O

Therefore	O

since	O
my	O

my	O
poor	O

might	O
not	O
be	O
unacceptable	O
to	O
my	O

imposed	O
on	O
myself	O

as	O
a	O

never	O
to	O
