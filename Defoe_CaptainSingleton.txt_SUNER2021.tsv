it	O

It	O
is	O

the	O

is	O
simple	O

Defoe	O

plain	O

homely	O
realism	O
soon	O
grew	O
to	O
be	O

was	O

much	O

upon	O
some	O
unlucky	O
thing	O
I	O
said	O

which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
remember	O
,	O
was	O
about	O
abusing	O
my	O
master	O

they	O
took	O
me	O
and	O
beat	O
me	O
most	O
unmercifully	O
with	O
a	O
flat	O
stick	O
on	O
the	O

of	O
my	O

so	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
neither	O

for	O
several	O

But	O
my	O
good	O
fortune	O
was	O
my	O
friend	O
upon	O
this	O
occasion	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
sailing	O
away	O
with	O
our	O
ship	O
in	O

as	O
a	O
prize	O

in	O

of	O
the	O
bay	PNM
of	PNM
Cadiz	PNM

the	O
Turkish	O
rover	O
was	O
attacked	O

two	O
great	O

taken	O

into	O

As	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
much	O

at	O
my	O

not	O
indeed	O
understanding	O
the	O

if	O
it	O
had	O
continued	O

so	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
suitably	O
sensible	O
of	O
my	O
deliverance	O
;	O
nor	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
was	O
it	O
so	O
much	O
a	O
deliverance	O
to	O
me	O
as	O
it	O
would	O
otherwise	O
have	O
been	O
,	O
for	O
my	O
master	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
friend	O
I	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
died	O
at	O
Lisbon	PNM
of	O
his	O
wounds	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
being	O
then	O
almost	O
reduced	O
to	O
my	O
primitive	O
state	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
of	O
starving	O
,	O
had	O
this	O
addition	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
foreign	O

I	O
knew	O
nobody	O

could	O
not	O
speak	O
a	O
word	O
of	O

language	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
fared	O
better	O
here	O
than	O
I	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
expect	O
;	O
for	O
when	O
all	O
the	O

that	O

at	O

one	O
of	O

there	O

why	O

and	O
immediately	O
having	O
gotten	O
his	O

put	O

on	O

look	O
after	O

I	O
was	O
too	O
young	O
in	O
the	O
trade	O
to	O
keep	O
any	O
journal	O
of	O
this	O
voyage	O
,	O
though	O
my	O
master	O

who	O
was	O
,	O
for	O
a	O
Portuguese	O
,	O
a	O
pretty	O
good	O
artist	O
,	O
prompted	O
me	O
to	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
my	O
not	O
understanding	O
the	O
language	O
was	O
one	O
hindrance	O
;	O
at	O
least	O
it	O
served	O
me	O
for	O
an	O
excuse	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
after	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
look	O
into	O
his	O
charts	O
and	O
books	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
write	O
a	O
tolerable	O
hand	O
,	O
understood	O
some	O
Latin	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
little	O
smattering	O
of	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
tongue	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
superficial	O
knowledge	O
of	O
navigation	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
such	O
as	O
was	O
likely	O
to	O
be	O
sufficient	O
to	O
carry	O
me	O
through	O
a	O
life	O
of	O
adventure	O
,	O
as	O
mine	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
I	O
learned	O
several	O
material	O
things	O
in	O
this	O
voyage	O
among	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
;	O
I	O
learned	O
particularly	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
arrant	O
thief	O
and	O
a	O
bad	O
sailor	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
may	O
say	O
they	O
are	O
the	O
best	O
masters	O
for	O
teaching	O
both	O
these	O
of	O
any	O
nation	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

We	O
made	O
our	O
way	O
for	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
,	O
by	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Brazil	PNM

not	O
that	O

our	O

either	O
on	O
his	O
own	O
account	O
,	O
or	O
by	O
the	O
direction	O
of	O
the	O

went	O
thither	O

at	O
All	PNM

call	O
it	O
in	O
Portugal	O
,	O
the	O
Rio	O
de	O
Todos	O
los	O
Santos	O
,	O
we	O
delivered	O
near	O
a	O
hundred	O
tons	O
of	O
goods	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
in	O
a	O
considerable	O
quantity	O
of	O
gold	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
chests	O
of	O

seventy	O

Here	O
,	O
being	O
lodged	O
on	O
shore	O
by	O
my	O
master	O
's	O
order	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
charge	O
of	O
the	O
captain	O

business	O
,	O
he	O
having	O
seen	O
me	O
very	O

my	O

master	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
requital	O
for	O
his	O
mistaken	O
confidence	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
secure	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
to	O
steal	O
,	O
about	O
twenty	O
moidores	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
gold	O
that	O
was	O
shipped	O
on	O

by	O
the	O
merchants	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
my	O
first	O
adventure	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
tolerable	O
voyage	O
from	O
hence	O
to	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
de	PNM
Bona	PNM
Speranza	PNM
;	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
reputed	O
as	O
a	O
mighty	O
diligent	O
servant	O
to	O
my	O
master	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
faithful	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
diligent	O
indeed	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
far	O
from	O
honest	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
they	O
thought	O
me	O
honest	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
was	O
their	O
very	O
great	O
mistake	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
very	O
mistake	O
the	O
captain	O
took	O
a	O
particular	O
liking	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
employed	O
me	O
frequently	O
on	O
his	O

occasion	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
in	O
recompense	O
for	O
my	O
officious	O
diligence	O
,	O
I	O
received	O
several	O
particular	O
favours	O
from	O
him	O
;	O
particularly	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
captain	O

command	O
,	O
made	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
steward	O
under	O

steward	O
,	O
for	O
such	O
provisions	O
as	O
the	O

demanded	O
for	O
his	O

He	O
had	O
another	O
steward	O
for	O
his	O
private	O
stores	O
besides	O
,	O
but	O
my	O
office	O
concerned	O
only	O
what	O
the	O

called	O
for	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O

stores	O
for	O
his	O
private	O
use	O

However	O
,	O
by	O
this	O

I	O
had	O
opportunity	O

to	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
my	O

to	O
furnish	O
myself	O

better	O
than	O
the	O

in	O
the	O

anything	O
out	O
of	O

indeed	O
nothing	O
to	O

my	O

being	O
generally	O
on	O

to	O

everything	O
that	O

wicked	O

the	O
most	O

with	O
the	O

the	O
most	O

cowards	O
that	O
I	O
ever	O
met	O

the	O

was	O
evident	O
upon	O

there	O
was	O
here	O

there	O
one	O
among	O

,	O
as	O
my	O
lot	O
fell	O
among	O

the	O

contemptible	O
thoughts	O
of	O
the	O

as	O
indeed	O
they	O
deserved	O

I	O
was	O
exactly	O

no	O

yet	O

even	O
in	O
this	O
state	O

them	O

heartily	O
from	O
the	O
beginning	O

and	O
all	O
my	O
life	O

They	O
were	O
so	O

not	O

something	O

Add	O

this	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
natural	O
to	O
an	O

to	O
hate	O

the	O

a	O

equally	O
my	O

However	O

according	O
to	O
the	O
English	O
proverb	O
,	O
he	O
that	O
is	O
shipped	O
with	O

must	O
sail	O
with	O
the	O

;	O
I	O
was	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
managed	O
myself	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
.	O

My	O
master	O
had	O
consented	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
assist	O
the	O
captain	O
in	O
the	O
office	O
,	O
as	O
above	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
understood	O
afterwards	O
that	O
the	O
captain	O
allowed	O
my	O
master	O
half	O
a	O
moidore	O
a	O
month	O
for	O
my	O
service	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
my	O
name	O
upon	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
books	O
also	O
,	O
I	O
expected	O
that	O
when	O
the	O
ship	O
came	O
to	O
be	O
paid	O
four	O
months	O
'	O
wages	O
at	O
the	O
Indies	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
always	O
do	O
,	O
my	O
master	O
would	O
let	O
me	O
have	O
something	O
for	O
myself	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
was	O
wrong	O
in	O
my	O
man	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
was	O
none	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
;	O
he	O
had	O
taken	O
me	O
up	O
as	O
in	O
distress	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
business	O
was	O
to	O
keep	O
me	O
so	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
his	O
market	O
of	O
me	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
he	O
could	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
after	O
a	O
different	O
manner	O
than	O
I	O
did	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
for	O
at	O
first	O
I	O
thought	O
he	O
had	O
entertained	O
me	O
in	O
mere	O
charity	O
,	O
upon	O
seeing	O
my	O
distressed	O
circumstances	O
,	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
doubt	O
but	O
when	O
he	O
put	O
me	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
some	O
wages	O
for	O
my	O
service	O
.	O

But	O
he	O
thought	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
quite	O
otherwise	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
procured	O
one	O
to	O
speak	O
to	O
him	O
about	O
it	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
paid	O
at	O
Goa	PNM
,	O
he	O
flew	O
into	O
the	O
greatest	O
rage	O
imaginable	O
,	O
and	O
called	O
me	O
English	O
dog	O
,	O
young	O
heretic	O
,	O
and	O
threatened	O
to	O
put	O
me	O
into	O
the	O
Inquisition	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
names	O
the	O
four-and-twenty	O
letters	O
could	O
make	O
up	O
,	O
he	O
should	O
not	O
have	O
called	O
me	O
heretic	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
I	O
knew	O
nothing	O
about	O
religion	O
,	O
neither	O
Protestant	O
from	O
Papist	PNM
,	O
or	O
either	O
of	O
them	O
from	O
a	O
Mahometan	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
never	O
be	O
a	O
heretic	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
it	O
passed	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
young	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
carried	O
into	O
the	O
Inquisition	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
asked	O
me	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
Protestant	O
or	O
a	O
Catholic	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
said	O
yes	O
to	O
that	O
which	O
came	O
first	O

If	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
the	O
Protestant	O
they	O
had	O
asked	O
first	O
,	O
it	O
had	O
certainly	O
made	O
a	O
martyr	O
of	O
me	O
for	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
what	O

But	O
the	O
very	O
priest	O
they	O
carried	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
or	O
chaplain	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
called	O
him	O
,	O
saved	O
me	O
;	O
for	O
seeing	O
me	O
a	O
boy	O
entirely	O
ignorant	O
of	O
religion	O
,	O
and	O
ready	O
to	O
do	O
or	O
say	O
anything	O
they	O
bid	O
me	O
,	O
he	O
asked	O
me	O
some	O
questions	O
about	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
found	O
I	O
answered	O
so	O
very	O
simply	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
took	O
it	O
upon	O
him	O
to	O
tell	O
them	O
he	O
would	O
answer	O
for	O
my	O
being	O
a	O
good	O
Catholic	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
hoped	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
the	O
means	O
of	O
saving	O
my	O
soul	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
pleased	O
himself	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
work	O
of	O
merit	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
so	O
he	O
made	O
me	O
as	O
good	O
a	O
Papist	O
as	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
about	O
a	O
week	O
's	O
time	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
told	O
him	O
my	O
case	O
about	O
my	O
master	O
;	O
how	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
true	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
taken	O
me	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
miserable	O
case	O
on	O
board	O
a	O
man-of-war	O
at	O
Lisbon	PNM
;	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
indebted	O
to	O
him	O
for	O
bringing	O
me	O
on	O
board	O
this	O
ship	O
;	O
that	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
left	O
at	O
Lisbon	PNM
,	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
starved	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
like	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
I	O
was	O
willing	O
to	O
serve	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
I	O
hoped	O
he	O
would	O
give	O
me	O
some	O
little	O
consideration	O
for	O
my	O
service	O
,	O
or	O
let	O
me	O
know	O
how	O
long	O
he	O
expected	O
I	O
should	O
serve	O
him	O
for	O
nothing	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
all	O
one	O
;	O
neither	O
the	O
priest	O
nor	O
any	O
one	O
else	O
could	O
prevail	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
his	O
servant	O
but	O
his	O
slave	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
took	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
Algerine	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
Turk	O
,	O
only	O
pretended	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
English	O
boy	O
to	O
get	O
my	O
liberty	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
would	O
carry	O
me	O
to	O
the	O
Inquisition	O
as	O
a	O
Turk	O
.	O

This	O
frighted	O
me	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
wits	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
nobody	O
to	O
vouch	O
for	O
me	O
what	O
I	O
was	O
,	O
or	O
from	O
whence	O
I	O
came	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
good	O
Padre	O
Antonio	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
was	O
his	O
name	O
,	O
cleared	O
me	O
of	O
that	O
part	O
by	O
a	O
way	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
;	O
for	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
me	O
one	O
morning	O
with	O
two	O
sailors	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
they	O
must	O
search	O
me	O
,	O
to	O
bear	O
witness	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
Turk	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
amazed	O
at	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
frighted	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
them	O
,	O
nor	O
could	O
I	O
imagine	O
what	O
they	O
intended	O
to	O
do	O
to	O
me	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
stripping	O
me	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
soon	O
satisfied	O
,	O
and	O
Father	O
Antony	O
bade	O
me	O
be	O
easy	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
could	O
all	O
witness	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
no	O
Turk	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
escaped	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
my	O
master	O
's	O
cruelty	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
I	O
resolved	O
from	O
that	O
time	O
to	O
run	O
away	O
from	O
him	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
but	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
doing	O
of	O
it	O
there	O
,	O
for	O
there	O
were	O
not	O
ships	O
of	O
any	O
nation	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
in	O
that	O
port	O
,	O
except	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
Persian	O
vessels	O
from	O
Ormus	PNM
,	O
so	O
that	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
offered	O
to	O
go	O
away	O
from	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
had	O
me	O
seized	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
on	O
board	O
by	O
force	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
remedy	O
but	O
patience	O
.	O

And	O
this	O
he	O
brought	O
to	O
an	O
end	O
too	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
could	O
,	O
for	O
after	O
this	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
use	O
me	O
ill	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
only	O
to	O
straiten	O
my	O
provisions	O

but	O
to	O
beat	O
and	O
torture	O
me	O
in	O
a	O
barbarous	O
manner	O
for	O
every	O
trifle	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
my	O
life	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
miserable	O

The	O
violence	O
of	O
this	O
usage	O
of	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
impossibility	O
of	O
my	O
escape	O
from	O
his	O
hands	O

set	O
my	O
head	O
a-working	O
upon	O
all	O
sorts	O
of	O
mischief	O

and	O
in	O

I	O
resolved	O

after	O

to	O
deliver	O
myself	O

finding	O

With	O
this	O
hellish	O
resolution	O
in	O
my	O

I	O
spent	O
whole	O
nights	O

days	O
contriving	O
how	O
to	O
put	O
it	O
in	O
execution	O
,	O
the	O
devil	O
prompting	O
me	O
very	O
warmly	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O

I	O
was	O
indeed	O
entirely	O
at	O
a	O
loss	O
for	O

I	O

my	O

knew	O
not	O
where	O

any	O

if	O
I	O

as	O
they	O

by	O
a	O
violent	O
storm	O
from	O
the	O
W.S.W.	O

which	O
held	O
us	O
six	O

a	O

standing	O

The	O
storm	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
violent	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
had	O
received	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
damage	O

it	O
required	O
some	O

standing	O
in	O
nearer	O
the	O

the	O
pilot	O

my	O
master	O

brought	O
the	O

into	O
a	O
very	O

where	O
we	O
rid	O
in	O
twenty-six	O

about	O

a	O

from	O
the	O

While	O
the	O

rode	O
here	O
there	O
happened	O
a	O
most	O
desperate	O
mutiny	O
among	O
the	O
men	O

upon	O
account	O
of	O
some	O
deficiency	O
in	O
their	O
allowance	O

which	O
came	O
to	O
that	O
height	O
that	O
they	O
threatened	O
the	O

to	O

him	O
on	O
shore	O

go	O
back	O

the	O

I	O
wished	O

with	O
all	O

I	O
prompted	O
the	O
mischief	O
all	O
I	O
could	O

and	O
embarked	O
in	O
it	O
so	O
openly	O

that	O
I	O
escaped	O
very	O
little	O
being	O
hanged	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
and	O
most	O
early	O
part	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
captain	O
had	O
some	O
notice	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
design	O
laid	O
by	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
company	O
to	O
murder	O
him	O
;	O

partly	O
by	O
money	O
and	O
promises	O
,	O
and	O
partly	O
by	O
threatening	O
and	O
torture	O

brought	O
two	O

to	O
confess	O
the	O
particulars	O

and	O
the	O
names	O
of	O
the	O
persons	O

they	O
were	O
presently	O
apprehended	O
,	O
till	O
,	O
one	O
accusing	O
another	O
,	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
sixteen	O
men	O
were	O
seized	O
and	O
put	O
into	O
irons	O
,	O
whereof	O
I	O
was	O
one	O

The	O
captain	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
made	O
desperate	O
by	O
his	O
danger	O
,	O
resolving	O
to	O
clear	O
the	O
ship	O
of	O
his	O
enemies	O
,	O
tried	O
us	O
all	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
condemned	O
to	O
die	O
.	O

The	O
manner	O
of	O
his	O
process	O
I	O
was	O
too	O
young	O
to	O
take	O
notice	O
of	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
purser	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
gunners	O
were	O
hanged	O
immediately	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
expected	O
it	O
with	O
the	O
rest	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
not	O
remember	O
any	O
great	O
concern	O
I	O
was	O
under	O
about	O
it	O
,	O
only	O
that	O
I	O
cried	O
very	O
much	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
knew	O
little	O
then	O
of	O
this	O
world	O
,	O
and	O
nothing	O
at	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
next	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
contented	O
himself	O
with	O
executing	O
these	O
two	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
upon	O
their	O
humble	O
submission	O
and	O
promise	O
of	O
future	O
good	O
behaviour	O
,	O
were	O
pardoned	O
;	O
but	O
five	O
were	O
ordered	O
to	O
be	O
set	O
on	O
shore	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
and	O
left	O
there	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
one	O
.	O

My	O
master	O
used	O
all	O
his	O
interest	O
with	O
the	O
captain	O
to	O
have	O
me	O
excused	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
not	O
obtain	O
it	O
;	O
for	O
somebody	O
having	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
who	O
was	O
singled	O
out	O
to	O
have	O
killed	O
him	O
,	O
when	O
my	O
master	O
desired	O
I	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
set	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
told	O
him	O
I	O
should	O
stay	O
on	O
board	O
if	O
he	O
desired	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
then	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
hanged	O
,	O
so	O
he	O
might	O
choose	O
for	O
me	O
which	O
he	O
thought	O
best	O
.	O

The	O
captain	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
was	O
particularly	O
provoked	O
at	O
my	O
being	O
concerned	O
in	O
the	O
treachery	O
,	O
because	O
of	O
his	O
having	O
been	O
so	O
kind	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
his	O
having	O
singled	O
me	O
out	O
to	O
serve	O
him	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
above	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
obliged	O
him	O
to	O
give	O
my	O
master	O
such	O
a	O
rough	O
choice	O
,	O
either	O
to	O
set	O
me	O
on	O
shore	O
or	O
to	O
have	O
me	O
hanged	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

And	O
had	O
my	O
master	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
known	O
what	O
good-will	O
I	O
had	O
for	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
long	O
in	O
choosing	O
for	O
me	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
certainly	O
determined	O
to	O
do	O
him	O
a	O
mischief	O
the	O
first	O
opportunity	O
I	O
had	O
for	O
it	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
a	O
good	O
providence	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
keep	O
me	O
from	O
dipping	O
my	O
hands	O
in	O
blood	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
made	O
me	O
more	O
tender	O
afterwards	O
in	O
matters	O
of	O
blood	O
than	O
I	O
believe	O
I	O
should	O
otherwise	O
have	O
been	O
.	O

But	O
as	O
to	O
my	O
being	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
that	O
was	O
to	O
kill	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
wronged	O
in	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
person	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
really	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
that	O
were	O
pardoned	O
,	O
he	O
having	O
the	O
good	O
luck	O
not	O
to	O
have	O
that	O
part	O
discovered	O

I	O
was	O
now	O
to	O
enter	O
upon	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
independent	O
life	O
,	O
a	O
thing	O
I	O
was	O
indeed	O
very	O
ill	O
prepared	O
to	O
manage	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
perfectly	O
loose	O
and	O
dissolute	O
in	O
my	O
behaviour	O
,	O
bold	O
and	O
wicked	O
while	O
I	O
was	O
under	O
government	O
,	O
and	O
now	O
perfectly	O
unfit	O
to	O
be	O
trusted	O
with	O
liberty	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
as	O
ripe	O
for	O
any	O
villainy	O
as	O
a	O
young	O
fellow	O
that	O
had	O
no	O
solid	O
thought	O
ever	O
placed	O
in	O
his	O
mind	O

be	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O

Education	O
,	O
as	O
you	O
have	O
heard	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
none	O
;	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
little	O
scenes	O
of	O
life	O
I	O
had	O
passed	O
through	O
had	O
been	O
full	O
of	O
dangers	O
and	O
desperate	O
circumstances	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
either	O
so	O
young	O
or	O
so	O
stupid	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
escaped	O
the	O
grief	O
and	O
anxiety	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
having	O
a	O
sense	O
of	O
their	O
tendency	O
and	O
consequences	O

This	O
thoughtless	O
,	O
unconcerned	O
temper	O
had	O
one	O
felicity	O
indeed	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
made	O
me	O
daring	O
and	O
ready	O
for	O
doing	O
any	O
mischief	O
,	O
and	O
kept	O
off	O
the	O
sorrow	O
which	O
otherwise	O
ought	O
to	O
have	O
attended	O
me	O
when	O
I	O
fell	O
into	O
any	O
mischief	O
;	O
that	O
this	O
stupidity	O
was	O
instead	O
of	O
a	O
happiness	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
left	O
my	O
thoughts	O
free	O
to	O
act	O
upon	O
means	O
of	O
escape	O
and	O
deliverance	O
in	O
my	O
distress	O
,	O
however	O
great	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
;	O
whereas	O
my	O
companions	O
in	O
the	O
misery	O
were	O
so	O
sunk	O
by	O
their	O
fear	O
and	O
grief	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
abandoned	O
themselves	O
to	O
the	O
misery	O
of	O
their	O
condition	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
over	O
all	O
thought	O
but	O
of	O
their	O
perishing	O
and	O
starving	O
,	O
being	O
devoured	O
by	O
wild	O
beasts	O

murdered	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
eaten	O
by	O
cannibals	O
,	O
and	O
the	O

I	O
was	O
but	O
a	O
young	O
fellow	O
,	O
about	O
seventeen	O
or	O
eighteen	O
;	O
but	O
hearing	O
what	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
my	O
fate	O
,	O
I	O
received	O
it	O
with	O
no	O
appearance	O
of	O
discouragement	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
asked	O
what	O
my	O
master	O
said	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
told	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
used	O
his	O
utmost	O
interest	O
to	O
save	O
me	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
captain	O
had	O
answered	O
I	O
should	O
either	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
or	O
be	O
hanged	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
pleased	O
,	O
I	O
then	O
gave	O
over	O
all	O
hope	O
of	O
being	O
received	O
again	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
not	O
very	O
thankful	O
in	O
my	O
thoughts	O
to	O
my	O
master	O
for	O
his	O
soliciting	O
the	O
captain	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
knew	O
that	O
what	O
he	O
did	O
was	O
not	O
in	O
kindness	O
to	O
me	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
in	O
kindness	O
to	O
himself	O
;	O
I	O
mean	O
,	O
to	O
preserve	O
the	O
wages	O
which	O
he	O
got	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
which	O
amounted	O
to	O
above	O
six	O
dollars	O
a	O
month	O
,	O
including	O
what	O
the	O
captain	O
allowed	O
him	O
for	O
my	O
particular	O
service	O
to	O
him	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
understood	O
that	O
my	O
master	O
was	O
so	O
apparently	O
kind	O
,	O
I	O
asked	O
if	O
I	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
admitted	O
to	O
speak	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
told	O
me	O
I	O
might	O
,	O
if	O
my	O
master	O
would	O
come	O
down	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
allowed	O
to	O
come	O
up	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
so	O
then	O
I	O
desired	O
my	O
master	O
might	O
be	O
spoke	O
to	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
accordingly	O
came	O
to	O
me	O
.	O

I	O
fell	O
on	O
my	O
knees	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
begged	O
he	O
would	O
forgive	O
me	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
to	O
displease	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
indeed	O
the	O
resolution	O
I	O
had	O
taken	O
to	O
murder	O
him	O
lay	O
with	O
some	O
horror	O
upon	O
my	O
mind	O
just	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
once	O
just	O
a-going	O
to	O
confess	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
beg	O
him	O
to	O
forgive	O
me	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
kept	O
it	O
in	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
all	O
he	O
could	O
to	O
obtain	O
my	O
pardon	O
of	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
not	O
and	O
he	O
knew	O
no	O
way	O
for	O
me	O
but	O
to	O
have	O
patience	O
,	O
and	O
submit	O
to	O
my	O
fate	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
speak	O
with	O
any	O
ship	O
of	O
their	O
nation	O
at	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
,	PNM
he	O
would	O
endeavour	O
to	O
have	O
them	O
stand	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
fetch	O
us	O
off	O
again	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
might	O
be	O
found	O
.	O

Then	O
I	O
begged	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
my	O
clothes	O
on	O
shore	O
with	O
me	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
was	O
afraid	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
little	O
need	O
of	O
clothes	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
see	O
how	O
we	O
could	O
long	O
subsist	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
told	O
that	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
were	O
cannibals	O
or	O
men-eaters	O
-LRB-	O
though	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
reason	O
for	O
that	O
suggestion	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
live	O
among	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
afraid	O
of	O
that	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
of	O
starving	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
victuals	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
for	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
being	O
cannibals	O
,	O
I	O
believed	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
more	O
likely	O
to	O
eat	O
them	O
than	O
they	O
us	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
but	O
get	O
at	O
them	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
was	O
mightily	O
concerned	O
,	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
no	O
weapons	O
with	O
us	O
to	O
defend	O
ourselves	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
begged	O
nothing	O
now	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
give	O
me	O
a	O
gun	O
and	O
a	O
sword	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
little	O
powder	O
and	O
shot	O
.	O

He	O
smiled	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
they	O
would	O
signify	O
nothing	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
pretend	O
to	O
preserve	O
our	O
lives	O
among	O
such	O
a	O
populous	O
and	O
desperate	O
nation	O
as	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
this	O
island	O
were	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
do	O
us	O
this	O
good	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
devoured	O
or	O
destroyed	O
immediately	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
begged	O
hard	O
for	O
the	O
gun	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
whether	O
the	O
captain	O
would	O
give	O
him	O
leave	O
to	O
give	O
me	O
a	O
gun	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
not	O
,	O
he	O
durst	O
not	O
do	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
promised	O
to	O
use	O
his	O
interest	O
to	O
obtain	O
it	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
did	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
he	O
sent	O
me	O
a	O
gun	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
ammunition	O
,	O
but	O
told	O
me	O
the	O
captain	O
would	O
not	O
suffer	O
the	O
ammunition	O
to	O
be	O
given	O
us	O
till	O
we	O
were	O
set	O
all	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
till	O
he	O
was	O
just	O
going	O
to	O
set	O
sail	O
.	O

He	O
also	O
sent	O
me	O
the	O
few	O
clothes	O
I	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
indeed	O
were	O
not	O
many	O
.	O

Two	O
days	O
after	O
this	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
carried	O
on	O
shore	O
together	O
;	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
my	O
fellow-criminals	O
hearing	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
gun	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
powder	O

shot	O
,	O
solicited	O
for	O
liberty	O
to	O
carry	O
the	O
like	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
also	O
granted	O
them	O

and	O
thus	O
we	O
were	O
set	O
on	O
shore	O
to	O
shift	O
for	O
ourselves	O
.	O

At	O
our	O
first	O
coming	O
into	O
the	O
island	O
we	O
were	O
terrified	O
exceedingly	O
with	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
barbarous	O
people	O
,	O
whose	O
figure	O
was	O
made	O
more	O
terrible	O
to	O
us	O
than	O
it	O
really	O
was	O
by	O
the	O
report	O
we	O
had	O
of	O
them	O
from	O
the	O
seamen	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
converse	O
with	O
them	O
awhile	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
cannibals	O
,	O
as	O
was	O
reported	O
,	O
or	O
such	O
as	O
would	O
fall	O
immediately	O
upon	O
us	O
and	O
eat	O
us	O
up	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
came	O
and	O
sat	O
down	O
by	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
wondered	O
much	O
at	O
our	O
clothes	O
and	O
arms	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
give	O
us	O
some	O
victuals	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
only	O
roots	O
and	O
plants	O
dug	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ground	O
for	O
the	O
present	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
brought	O
us	O
fowls	O
and	O
flesh	O
afterwards	O
in	O
good	O
plenty	O
.	O

This	O
encouraged	O
the	O
other	O
four	O
men	O
that	O
were	O
with	O
me	O
very	O
much	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
quite	O
dejected	O
before	O
;	O
but	O
now	O
they	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
familiar	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
signs	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
use	O
us	O
kindly	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
stay	O
and	O
live	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
which	O
they	O
seemed	O
glad	O
of	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
knew	O
little	O
of	O
the	O
necessity	O
we	O
were	O
under	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
,	O
or	O
how	O
much	O
we	O
were	O
afraid	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
upon	O
second	O
thoughts	O
we	O
resolved	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
only	O
stay	O
in	O
that	O
part	O
so	O
long	O
as	O
the	O
ship	O
rid	O
in	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
making	O
them	O
believe	O
we	O
were	O
gone	O
with	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
go	O
and	O
place	O
ourselves	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
where	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
inhabitants	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
live	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
or	O
perhaps	O
watch	O
for	O
a	O
ship	O
that	O
might	O
be	O
driven	O
upon	O
the	O
coast	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
.	O

The	O
ship	O
continued	O
a	O
fortnight	O
in	O
the	O
roads	O
,	O
repairing	O
some	O
damage	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
done	O
her	O
in	O
the	O
late	O
storm	O
,	O
and	O
taking	O
in	O
wood	O
and	O
water	O
;	O
and	O
during	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
the	O
boat	O
coming	O
often	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
the	O
men	O
brought	O
us	O
several	O
refreshments	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
natives	O
believing	O
we	O
only	O
belonged	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
were	O
civil	O
enough	O
.	O

We	O
lived	O
in	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
tent	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
a	O
hut	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
made	O
with	O
the	O
boughs	O
of	O
trees	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
retired	O
to	O
a	O
wood	O
a	O
little	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
way	O
,	O
to	O
let	O
them	O
think	O
we	O
were	O
gone	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
them	O
barbarous	O
,	O
treacherous	O
,	O
and	O
villainous	O
enough	O
in	O
their	O
nature	O
,	O
only	O
civil	O
from	O
fear	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
concluded	O
we	O
should	O
soon	O
fall	O
into	O
their	O
hands	O
when	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
gone	O
.	O

The	O
sense	O
of	O
this	O
wrought	O
upon	O
my	O
fellow-sufferers	O
even	O
to	O
distraction	O
;	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
being	O
a	O
carpenter	O
,	O
in	O
his	O
mad	O
fit	O
,	O
swam	O
off	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
though	O
she	O
lay	O
then	O
a	O
league	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
such	O
pitiful	O
moan	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
in	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
captain	O
was	O
prevailed	O
with	O
at	O
last	O
to	O
take	O
him	O
in	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
let	O
him	O
lie	O
swimming	O
three	O
hours	O
in	O
the	O
water	O
before	O
he	O
consented	O
to	O
it	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
humble	O
submission	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
received	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
the	O
importunity	O
of	O
this	O
man	O
-LRB-	O
who	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
petitioned	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
in	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
hanged	O
him	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
him	O
-RRB-	O
was	O
such	O
as	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
resisted	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
after	O
he	O
had	O
swam	O
so	O
long	O
about	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
reach	O
the	O
shore	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
captain	O
saw	O
evidently	O
that	O
the	O
man	O
must	O
be	O
taken	O
on	O
board	O
or	O
suffered	O
to	O
drown	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
whole	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O
offering	O
to	O

bound	O
for	O
him	O
for	O
his	O
good	O
behaviour	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
at	O
last	O
yielded	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
was	O
taken	O
up	O
,	O
but	O
almost	O
dead	O
with	O
his	O
being	O
so	O
long	O
in	O
the	O
water	O
.	O

When	O
this	O
man	O
was	O

he	O
never	O

the	O

all	O

of	O
the	O

in	O

that	O
were	O
behind	O

but	O
to	O
the	O
very	O
last	O
day	O
the	O
captain	O
was	O
inexorable	O
;	O
when	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
their	O
preparations	O
were	O
making	O
to	O
sail	O

orders	O

the	O

into	O
the	O
ship	O

all	O
the	O

in	O
a	O

came	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
rail	O
of	O
the	O
quarter-deck	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
captain	O
was	O
walking	O
with	O
some	O
of	O
his	O
officers	O
,	O
and	O
appointing	O
the	O
boatswain	O
to	O
speak	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
he	O
went	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
falling	O
on	O
his	O
knees	O
to	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
begged	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
humblest	O
manner	O
possible	O
,	O
to	O
receive	O
the	O
four	O
men	O
on	O

again	O
,	O
offering	O
to	O

for	O
their	O
fidelity	O

to	O

in	O

there	O
to	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
while	O

any	O
notice	O

when	O

Upon	O
this	O
severity	O

one	O
of	O
the	O

bolder	O

rest	O

still	O
with	O
all	O
possible	O
respect	O
to	O
the	O

honour	O

to	O
that	O

;	O
that	O
mutiny	O
on	O

The	O

twenty-three	O

him	O

that	O

them	O
leave	O
to	O
go	O
on	O

that	O

to	O
the	O
captain	O
not	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
ill	O
that	O

no	O

extremity	O

it	O
was	O

enough	O
to	O

The	O

,	O
if	O

for	O
the	O

which	O
should	O

very	O

he	O
promised	O

their	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
an	O
hour	O
before	O
day	O
,	O
those	O
twenty-three	O
men	O

with	O
every	O

without	O

about	O
half	O

c.	O

embarked	O
themselves	O
so	O
silently	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
captain	O
got	O
no	O
notice	O
of	O
it	O
till	O
they	O
were	O
gotten	O
half	O
the	O
way	O
on	O
shore	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
captain	O
heard	O
of	O
it	O
he	O
called	O
for	O
the	O
gunner	O
's	O
mate	O
,	O
the	O
chief	O
gunner	O
being	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
sick	O
in	O
his	O
cabin	O
,	O
and	O
ordered	O
to	O
fire	O
at	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
to	O
his	O
great	O
mortification	O
,	O
the	O
gunner	O
's	O
mate	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
number	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
gone	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
indeed	O
it	O
was	O
by	O
this	O
means	O
they	O
got	O
so	O
many	O
arms	O
and	O
so	O
much	O
ammunition	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
captain	O
found	O
how	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
help	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
appeased	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
light	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
called	O
up	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
spoke	O
kindly	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
them	O
he	O
was	O
very	O
well	O
satisfied	O
in	O
the	O
fidelity	O
and	O
ability	O
of	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
now	O
left	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
give	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
their	O
encouragement	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
divided	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
the	O
wages	O
which	O
were	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
men	O
that	O
were	O
gone	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
satisfaction	O
to	O
him	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
free	O
from	O
such	O
a	O
mutinous	O
rabble	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
not	O
the	O
least	O
reason	O
for	O
their	O
discontent	O
.	O

The	O
men	O
seemed	O
very	O
well	O
satisfied	O
,	O
and	O
particularly	O
the	O
promise	O
of	O
the	O
wages	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
were	O
gone	O
went	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
,	O
the	O
letter	O
which	O
was	O
left	O
by	O
the	O
men	O
was	O
given	O
to	O
the	O
captain	O
by	O
his	O
boy	O
,	O
with	O
whom	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
the	O
men	O
had	O
left	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
letter	O
was	O
much	O
to	O
the	O
same	O
purpose	O
of	O
what	O
they	O
had	O
said	O
to	O
the	O
mate	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
he	O
declined	O
to	O
say	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
only	O
that	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
their	O
letter	O
they	O
told	O
the	O
captain	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
dishonest	O
design	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
had	O
taken	O
nothing	O
away	O
with	O
them	O
which	O
was	O
not	O
their	O
own	O
,	O
except	O
some	O
arms	O
and	O
ammunition	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
were	O
absolutely	O
necessary	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
for	O
their	O
defence	O
against	O
the	O
savages	O
as	O
to	O
kill	O
fowls	O
or	O
beasts	O
for	O
their	O
food	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
not	O
perish	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
there	O
were	O
considerable	O
sums	O
due	O
to	O
them	O
for	O
wages	O
,	O
they	O
hoped	O
he	O
would	O
allow	O
the	O
arms	O
and	O
ammunition	O
upon	O
their	O
accounts	O

They	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O

longboat	O

which	O
they	O
had	O
taken	O
to	O
bring	O
them	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
they	O
knew	O
it	O
was	O
necessary	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
willing	O
to	O
restore	O
it	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
he	O
pleased	O
to	O

for	O
it	O
,	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
very	O
honestly	O
delivered	O
to	O
his	O
men	O

and	O
not	O
the	O

injury	O
offered	O
to	O
any	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
came	O
for	O
it	O

nor	O
the	O

and	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
the	O
letter	O
,	O
they	O
very	O
humbly	O
besought	O
him	O
that	O

for	O
their	O
defence	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
the	O
safety	O
of	O
their	O

he	O
would	O

to	O

them	O
a	O
barrel	O

some	O

make	O
themselves	O
a	O

Upon	O
this	O
the	O

who	O

upon	O

by	O
what	O
he	O

to	O

and	O
was	O
very	O
easy	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
general	O
peace	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
true	O
that	O
the	O

gone	O
-RRB-	O

came	O

let	O
them	O
know	O
the	O
substance	O
of	O
the	O
letter	O

the	O

that	O

however	O
they	O

from	O
him	O

yet	O
he	O

than	O
they	O
were	O
willing	O
to	O
expose	O
themselves	O

he	O

to	O
send	O

and	O
as	O
they	O

one	O

them	O
see	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
civiller	O
to	O
them	O
than	O
they	O

The	O

applauded	O
the	O

and	O
every	O

of	O

sent	O
us	O
something	O

and	O
about	O
three	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
the	O
pinnace	O
came	O
on	O

and	O
brought	O
us	O
all	O
these	O
things	O

which	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
glad	O
of	O
,	O
and	O
returned	O
the	O
long-boat	O

;	O
and	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
men	O
that	O
came	O
with	O
the	O
pinnace	O

as	O
the	O

such	O
men	O
as	O
he	O
knew	O

not	O
come	O
over	O

so	O
they	O

us	O
on	O
board	O
again	O

upon	O
pain	O

and	O
indeed	O
both	O
were	O
so	O
true	O
to	O
our	O
points	O

that	O
we	O
neither	O
asked	O
them	O
to	O
stay	O

they	O
us	O

We	O
were	O
now	O
a	O
good	O
troop	O

being	O
in	O
all	O
twenty-seven	O

very	O
well	O
armed	O

and	O
provided	O
with	O
everything	O

we	O
had	O
two	O
carpenters	O
among	O
us	O

a	O
gunner	O

and	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
worth	O
all	O
the	O

,	O
a	O
surgeon	O
or	O
doctor	O
;	O
that	O
is	O
to	O

he	O
was	O
an	O

at	O

and	O
was	O
entertained	O

the	O

all	O
his	O

and	O
indeed	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
great	O

that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
on	O
the	O

for	O
some	O

us	O
had	O

the	O

on	O

of	O
whom	O
I	O
was	O
one	O
;	O

I	O
had	O
one	O
thing	O
which	O
none	O

had	O

viz.	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
twenty-two	O
moidores	O
of	O

at	O
the	O

two	O

The	O

showed	O

one	O

ever	O

that	O

up	O
in	O

in	O

by	O
my	O

It	O
will	O
be	O
easy	O
to	O
imagine	O
we	O
four	O
that	O
were	O
left	O
at	O
first	O
were	O
joyful	O
,	O
nay	O
,	O
even	O
surprised	O
with	O
joy	O
at	O
the	O
coming	O
of	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
though	O
at	O
first	O
we	O
were	O
frighted	O

and	O
thought	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
fetch	O
us	O
back	O
to	O
hang	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
took	O
ways	O
quickly	O
to	O
satisfy	O
us	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
condition	O
with	O
us	O

only	O
with	O
this	O

circumstance	O

and	O
ours	O
by	O
force	O

The	O
first	O
piece	O
of	O
news	O
they	O
told	O
us	O
after	O
the	O
short	O
history	O
of	O
their	O
coming	O
away	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
our	O
companion	O
was	O
on	O
board	O

but	O
how	O
he	O
got	O
thither	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
imagine	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
had	O
given	O
us	O
the	O
slip	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
never	O
imagined	O
he	O
could	O
swim	O
so	O
well	O
as	O
to	O
venture	O
off	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
lay	O
at	O
so	O
great	O
a	O
distance	O
;	O
nay	O
,	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
know	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
swim	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
thinking	O
anything	O
of	O
what	O
really	O
happened	O
,	O
we	O
thought	O
he	O
must	O
have	O
wandered	O
into	O
the	O
woods	O
and	O
was	O
devoured	O
,	O
or	O
was	O
fallen	O
into	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
murdered	O
;	O
and	O
these	O
thoughts	O
filled	O
us	O
with	O
fears	O
enough	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
several	O
kinds	O
,	O
about	O
its	O
being	O
some	O
time	O
or	O
other	O
our	O
lot	O
to	O
fall	O
into	O
their	O
hands	O
also	O

But	O
hearing	O
how	O
he	O
had	O
with	O
much	O
difficulty	O
been	O
received	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
again	O
and	O
pardoned	O

we	O
were	O
much	O
better	O

than	O
before	O

now	O
,	O
as	O
I	O

a	O
considerable	O
number	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
condition	O
to	O
defend	O
ourselves	O
,	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
we	O
did	O
was	O
to	O
give	O
every	O
one	O
his	O
hand	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
not	O
separate	O
from	O
one	O
another	O
upon	O
any	O
occasion	O
whatsoever	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
live	O
and	O
die	O
together	O
;	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
kill	O
no	O
food	O

that	O
we	O
would	O
distribute	O
it	O

that	O
we	O
would	O
be	O
in	O
all	O

not	O

anything	O
if	O
the	O

our	O
governor	O

on	O
pain	O
of	O
death	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
every	O
one	O
should	O
take	O
turn	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
captain	O
was	O
not	O
to	O
act	O
in	O
any	O
particular	O
thing	O
without	O
advice	O
of	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
majority	O
.	O

Having	O
established	O
these	O
rules	O
,	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
enter	O
into	O
some	O
measures	O
for	O
our	O
food	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
conversing	O
with	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
or	O
natives	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
for	O
our	O
supply	O
.	O

As	O
for	O
food	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
at	O
first	O
very	O
useful	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
soon	O
grew	O
weary	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
being	O
an	O
ignorant	O
,	O
ravenous	O
,	O
brutish	O
sort	O
of	O
people	O
,	O
even	O
worse	O
than	O
the	O
natives	O
of	O
any	O
other	O
country	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
soon	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
principal	O
part	O
of	O
our	O
subsistence	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
had	O
by	O
our	O
guns	O
,	O
shooting	O
of	O
deer	O
and	O
other	O
creatures	O
,	O
and	O
fowls	O
of	O
all	O
other	O
sorts	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
there	O
is	O
abundance	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
the	O
natives	O
did	O
not	O
disturb	O
or	O
concern	O
themselves	O
much	O
about	O
us	O
;	O
nor	O
did	O
they	O
inquire	O
,	O
or	O
perhaps	O
know	O
,	O
whether	O
we	O
stayed	O
among	O
them	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
much	O
less	O
that	O
our	O
ship	O
was	O
gone	O
quite	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
cast	O
us	O
off	O
,	O
as	O
was	O
our	O
case	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
sent	O
back	O
the	O
long-boat	O
,	O
the	O
ship	O
stood	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
south-east	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
four	O
hours	O
'	O
time	O
was	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
sight	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
two	O
of	O
us	O
went	O
out	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
one	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
another	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
land	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
soon	O
found	O
the	O
country	O
was	O
very	O
pleasant	O
and	O
fruitful	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
convenient	O
place	O
enough	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
inhabited	O
by	O
a	O
parcel	O
of	O
creatures	O
scarce	O
human	O
,	O
or	O
capable	O
of	O
being	O
made	O
social	O
on	O
any	O
account	O
whatsoever	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
the	O
place	O
full	O
of	O
cattle	O
and	O
provisions	O
;	O
but	O
whether	O
we	O
might	O
venture	O
to	O
take	O
them	O
where	O
we	O
could	O
find	O
them	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
we	O
were	O
under	O
a	O
necessity	O
to	O
get	O
provisions	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
were	O
loth	O
to	O
bring	O
down	O
a	O
whole	O
nation	O
of	O
devils	O
upon	O
us	O
at	O
once	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
company	O
agreed	O
to	O
try	O
to	O
speak	O
with	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
see	O
what	O
course	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

Eleven	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
went	O
on	O
this	O
errand	O
,	O
well	O
armed	O
and	O
furnished	O
for	O
defence	O
.	O

They	O
brought	O
word	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
seen	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
who	O
appeared	O
very	O
civil	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
very	O
shy	O
and	O
afraid	O
,	O
seeing	O
their	O
guns	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
easy	O
to	O
perceive	O
that	O
the	O
natives	O
knew	O
what	O
their	O
guns	O
were	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
use	O
they	O
were	O
of	O
.	O

They	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
the	O
natives	O
for	O
some	O
food	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
went	O
and	O
fetched	O
several	O
herbs	O
and	O
roots	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
milk	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
evident	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
design	O
to	O
give	O
it	O
away	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
sell	O
it	O
,	O
making	O
signs	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
our	O
men	O
would	O
give	O
them	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
were	O
perplexed	O
at	O
this	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
barter	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
pulled	O
out	O
a	O
knife	O
and	O
showed	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
fond	O
of	O
it	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
ready	O
to	O
go	O
together	O
by	O
the	O
ears	O
for	O
the	O
knife	O
.	O

The	O
seaman	O
seeing	O
that	O
,	O
was	O
willing	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
good	O
market	O
of	O
his	O
knife	O
,	O
and	O
keeping	O
them	O
chaffering	O
about	O
it	O
a	O
good	O
while	O
,	O
some	O
offered	O
him	O
roots	O
,	O
and	O
others	O
milk	O
;	O
at	O
last	O
one	O
offered	O
him	O
a	O
goat	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
took	O
.	O

Then	O
another	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
showed	O
them	O
another	O
knife	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
had	O
nothing	O
good	O
enough	O
for	O
that	O
,	O
whereupon	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
go	O
and	O
fetch	O
something	O
;	O
so	O
our	O
men	O
stayed	O
three	O
hours	O
for	O
their	O
return	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
back	O
and	O
brought	O
him	O
a	O
small-sized	O
,	O
thick	O
,	O
short	O
cow	O
,	O
very	O
fat	O
and	O
good	O
meat	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
him	O
for	O
his	O
knife	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
market	O
,	O
but	O
our	O
misfortune	O
was	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
merchandise	O
;	O
for	O
our	O
knives	O
were	O
as	O
needful	O
to	O
us	O
as	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
but	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
distress	O
for	O
food	O
,	O
and	O
must	O
of	O
necessity	O
have	O
some	O
,	O
these	O
men	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
parted	O
with	O
their	O
knives	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
time	O
more	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
woods	O
were	O
full	O
of	O
living	O
creatures	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
might	O
kill	O
for	O
our	O
food	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
without	O
giving	O
offence	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
our	O
men	O
went	O
daily	O
out	O
a-hunting	O
,	O
and	O
never	O
failed	O
in	O
killing	O
something	O
or	O
other	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
goods	O
to	O
barter	O
;	O
and	O
for	O
money	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
stock	O
among	O
us	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
subsisted	O
us	O
long	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
called	O
a	O
general	O
council	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
money	O
we	O
had	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
bring	O
it	O
all	O
together	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
might	O
go	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
possible	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
it	O
came	O
to	O
my	O
turn	O
,	O
I	O
pulled	O
out	O
a	O
moidore	O
and	O
the	O
two	O
dollars	O
I	O
spoke	O
of	O
before	O
.	O

This	O
moidore	O
I	O
ventured	O
to	O
show	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
not	O
despise	O
me	O
too	O
much	O
for	O
adding	O
too	O
little	O
to	O
the	O
store	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
not	O
pretend	O
to	O
search	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
civil	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
upon	O
the	O
presumption	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
faithful	O
to	O
them	O
as	O
not	O
to	O
conceal	O
anything	O
from	O
them	O
.	O

But	O
our	O
money	O
did	O
us	O
little	O
service	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
people	O
neither	O
knew	O
the	O
value	O
or	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
nor	O
could	O
they	O
justly	O
rate	O
the	O
gold	O
in	O
proportion	O
with	O
the	O
silver	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
all	O
our	O
money	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
not	O
much	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
all	O
put	O
together	O
,	O
would	O
go	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
to	O
buy	O
us	O
provisions	O
.	O

Our	O
next	O
consideration	O
was	O
to	O
get	O
away	O
from	O
this	O
cursed	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
whither	O
to	O
go	O
.	O

When	O
my	O
opinion	O
came	O
to	O
be	O
asked	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
I	O
would	O
leave	O
that	O
all	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
I	O
had	O
rather	O
they	O
would	O
let	O
me	O
go	O
into	O
the	O
woods	O
to	O
get	O
them	O
some	O
provisions	O
,	O
than	O
consult	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
would	O
agree	O
to	O
whatever	O
they	O
did	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
agree	O
to	O
that	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
consent	O
that	O
any	O
of	O
us	O
should	O
go	O
into	O
the	O
woods	O
alone	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
yet	O
seen	O
no	O
lions	O
or	O
tigers	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
assured	O
there	O
were	O
many	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
besides	O
other	O
creatures	O
as	O
dangerous	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
worse	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
afterwards	O
found	O
by	O
our	O
own	O
experience	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
many	O
adventures	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
for	O
our	O
provisions	O
,	O
and	O
often	O
met	O
with	O
wild	O
and	O
terrible	O
beasts	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
call	O
by	O
their	O
names	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
like	O
us	O
,	O
seeking	O
their	O
prey	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
themselves	O
good	O
for	O
nothing	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
disturbed	O
them	O
as	O
little	O
as	O
possible	O
.	O

Our	O
consultations	O
concerning	O
our	O
escape	O
from	O
this	O
place	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
upon	O
,	O
ended	O
in	O
this	O
only	O
,	O
that	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
two	O
carpenters	O
among	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
tools	O
almost	O
of	O
all	O
sorts	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
try	O
to	O
build	O
us	O
a	O
boat	O
to	O
go	O
off	O
to	O
sea	O
with	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
then	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
find	O
our	O
way	O
back	O
to	O
Goa	O
,	O
or	O
land	O
on	O
some	O
more	O
proper	O
place	O
to	O
make	O
our	O
escape	O
.	O

The	O
counsels	O
of	O
this	O
assembly	O
were	O
not	O
of	O
great	O
moment	O
,	O
yet	O
as	O
they	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
introductory	O
of	O
many	O
more	O
remarkable	O
adventures	O
which	O
happened	O
under	O
my	O
conduct	O
hereabouts	O
many	O
years	O
after	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
miniature	O
of	O
my	O
future	O
enterprises	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
unpleasant	O
to	O
relate	O
.	O

To	O
the	O
building	O
of	O
a	O
boat	O
I	O
made	O
no	O
objection	O
,	O
and	O
away	O
they	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
immediately	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
they	O
went	O
on	O
,	O
great	O
difficulties	O
occurred	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
saws	O
to	O
cut	O
our	O
plank	O
;	O
nails	O
,	O
bolts	O
,	O
and	O
spikes	O
,	O
to	O
fasten	O
the	O
timbers	O
;	O
hemp	O
,	O
pitch	O
,	O
and	O
tar	O
,	O
to	O
caulk	O
and	O
pay	O
her	O

,	O
and	O
the	O
like	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
company	O
proposed	O
that	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
building	O
a	O
bark	O
or	O
sloop	O
,	O
or	O
shallop	O
,	O
or	O
whatever	O
they	O
would	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
found	O
was	O
so	O
difficult	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
rather	O
make	O
a	O
large	O
periagua	O
,	O
or	O
canoe	O
,	O
which	O
might	O
be	O
done	O
with	O
great	O
ease	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
presently	O
objected	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
never	O
make	O
a	O
canoe	O
large	O
enough	O
to	O
pass	O
the	O
great	O
ocean	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
go	O
over	O
to	O
get	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Malabar	PNM
;	O
that	O
it	O
not	O
only	O
would	O
not	O
bear	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
would	O
never	O
bear	O
the	O
burden	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
only	O
twenty-seven	O
men	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
luggage	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
must	O
,	O
for	O
our	O
provision	O
,	O
take	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
more	O
.	O

I	O
never	O
proposed	O
to	O
speak	O
in	O
their	O
general	O
consultations	O
before	O
,	O
but	O
finding	O
they	O
were	O
at	O
some	O
loss	O
about	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O

they	O
should	O
make	O

for	O
our	O
use	O

what	O
not	O

I	O
told	O
them	O
I	O

were	O
at	O
a	O
full	O
stop	O
in	O
their	O
counsels	O
of	O
every	O

that	O
it	O

though	O
we	O

that	O

for	O
the	O
voyage	O

to	O

nothing	O

that	O

that	O

all	O

before	O
well	O

what	O
I	O
meant	O
by	O
telling	O
them	O
first	O
how	O
dangerous	O

impossible	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
make	O
our	O
escape	O
in	O
a	O

to	O
advise	O

a	O

that	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
understand	O

To	O
this	O
I	O
answered	O

that	O
I	O
conceived	O
our	O
business	O
was	O
not	O
to	O
attempt	O
our	O
escape	O
in	O
a	O
canoe	O

but	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
there	O
were	O
other	O
vessels	O
at	O
sea	O
besides	O
our	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
few	O
nations	O
that	O
lived	O
on	O
the	O
sea-shore	O
that	O
were	O
so	O
barbarous	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
went	O
to	O
sea	O
in	O
some	O
boats	O
or	O
other	O
,	O
our	O
business	O
was	O
to	O
cruise	O
along	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
very	O
long	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
seize	O
upon	O
the	O
first	O
we	O
could	O
get	O
that	O
was	O
better	O
than	O
our	O
own	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
from	O
that	O
to	O
another	O
,	O
till	O
perhaps	O
we	O
might	O
at	O
last	O
get	O
a	O
good	O
ship	O
to	O
carry	O
us	O
wherever	O
we	O
pleased	O
to	O
go	O

there	O

we	O

with	O
all	O
the	O

we	O

The	O

down	O

I	O
remember	O
that	O

we	O
were	O
as	O

Upon	O
this	O
he	O
goes	O
to	O
work	O
,	O
and	O
first	O
by	O
heating	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
an	O
old	O
broken	O
chisel	O
in	O
the	O
fire	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
with	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
his	O
file	O
,	O
he	O
made	O
himself	O
several	O
kinds	O
of	O
tools	O
for	O
his	O
work	O
.	O

Then	O
he	O
takes	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
,	O
and	O
beats	O
them	O
out	O
with	O
a	O
hammer	O
upon	O
a	O
stone	O
,	O
till	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
broad	O
and	O
thin	O
;	O
then	O
he	O
cuts	O
them	O
out	O
into	O
the	O
shape	O
of	O
birds	O
and	O
beasts	O
;	O
he	O
made	O
little	O
chains	O
of	O
them	O
for	O
bracelets	O
and	O
necklaces	O
,	O
and	O
turned	O
them	O
into	O
so	O
many	O

of	O
his	O
own	O
head	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
hardly	O
to	O
be	O
expressed	O

When	O
he	O
had	O
for	O
about	O
a	O
fortnight	O
exercised	O
his	O
head	O
and	O
hands	O
at	O
this	O
work	O
,	O
we	O
tried	O
the	O
effect	O
of	O
his	O
ingenuity	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
another	O
meeting	O
with	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
were	O
surprised	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
folly	O
of	O
the	O
poor	O
people	O

For	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
silver	O
cut	O
in	O
the	O
shape	O
of	O
a	O
bird	O

we	O
had	O
two	O

it	O
had	O

For	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
bracelets	O
made	O
of	O
chain-work	O

we	O
had	O
as	O
much	O

of	O
several	O

as	O
would	O

fifteen	O

sixteen	O

and	O
so	O
of	O
all	O
the	O

Thus	O
,	O
that	O
which	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
coin	O
was	O
not	O

sixpence	O

us	O

when	O
thus	O

In	O
this	O
condition	O
we	O
lived	O
upwards	O
of	O
a	O
year	O
,	O
but	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
very	O

it	O

and	O
,	O
whatever	O
came	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
resolved	O
to	O
attempt	O
an	O
escape	O

We	O
had	O
furnished	O
ourselves	O
with	O
no	O

than	O
three	O
very	O
good	O

But	O
always	O

when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
look	O
into	O
it	O

the	O
want	O

the	O

that	O
put	O

might	O

preserve	O
as	O
much	O

water	O
as	O
we	O

our	O

we	O

this	O

I	O
can	O
not	O

the	O

it	O

of	O
its	O
kind	O

necessity	O
is	O
a	O
spur	O
to	O
ingenuity	O

the	O
mother	O
of	O

It	O
wanted	O

a	O
little	O
consultation	O
to	O
resolve	O
now	O
upon	O
our	O
voyage	O

The	O
first	O
design	O
was	O
only	O
to	O
coast	O

round	O

to	O

fit	O
to	O
embark	O
ourselves	O
in	O

as	O
also	O
to	O
take	O

of	O
any	O
opportunity	O
which	O
might	O
present	O
for	O
our	O
passing	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
main	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
our	O
resolution	O
was	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
the	O
inside	O
or	O
west	O
shore	O
of	O
the	O
island	O

where	O

at	O

at	O

the	O
land	O
stretching	O
a	O

the	O

I	O
believe	O
was	O
never	O
made	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
is	O
certain	O
we	O
took	O
the	O
worst	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
any	O
shipping	O
,	O
especially	O
for	O
shipping	O
of	O
other	O
nations	O
,	O
this	O
being	O
quite	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
we	O
put	O

after	O
taking	O
all	O
our	O
provisions	O

ammunition	O

baggage	O

on	O
board	O

had	O
made	O
both	O
mast	O

sail	O
for	O
our	O
two	O
large	O
periaguas	O

and	O
the	O
other	O
we	O
paddled	O
along	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
a	O
gale	O
sprung	O
up	O
,	O
we	O
took	O
her	O
in	O

We	O
sailed	O
merrily	O
forward	O
for	O
several	O
days	O
,	O
meeting	O
with	O
nothing	O
to	O
interrupt	O
us	O

We	O
saw	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
in	O
small	O
canoes	O
catching	O
fish	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
we	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
come	O
near	O
enough	O
to	O
speak	O
with	O
them	O

but	O
they	O
were	O
always	O
shy	O

afraid	O
of	O
us	O

making	O
in	O
for	O
the	O
shore	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
attempted	O
it	O
;	O
till	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
company	O
remembered	O
the	O
signal	O
of	O

up	O
a	O
long	O
pole	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
us	O
in	O
mind	O
that	O
perhaps	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
to	O
them	O
as	O
a	O
flag	O
of	O
truce	O
to	O
us	O
.	O

So	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
try	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
accordingly	O
the	O
next	O
time	O
we	O
saw	O
any	O
of	O
their	O
fishing-boats	O
at	O
sea	O
we	O
put	O
up	O
a	O
pole	O
in	O
our	O
canoe	O
that	O
had	O
no	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
rowed	O
towards	O
them	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
saw	O
the	O
pole	O
they	O
stayed	O
for	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
came	O
nearer	O
paddled	O
towards	O
us	O
;	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
us	O
they	O
showed	O
themselves	O
very	O
much	O
pleased	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
us	O
some	O
large	O
fish	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
the	O
names	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
good	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
our	O
misfortune	O
still	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
in	O
return	O
;	O
but	O
our	O
artist	O
,	O
of	O
whom	O
I	O
spoke	O
before	O
,	O
gave	O
them	O
two	O
little	O
thin	O
plates	O
of	O
silver	O
,	O
beaten	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
before	O
,	O
out	O
of	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
eight	O
;	O
they	O
were	O
cut	O
in	O
a	O
diamond	O
square	O
,	O
longer	O
one	O
way	O
than	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
hole	O
punched	O
at	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
longest	O
corners	O
.	O

This	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
fond	O
of	O
that	O
they	O
made	O
us	O
stay	O
till	O
they	O
had	O
cast	O
their	O
lines	O
and	O
nets	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
us	O
as	O
many	O
fish	O
as	O
we	O
cared	O
to	O
have	O
.	O

All	O
this	O
while	O
we	O
had	O
our	O
eyes	O
upon	O
their	O
boats	O
,	O
viewed	O
them	O
very	O
narrowly	O
,	O
and	O
examined	O
whether	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
fit	O
for	O
our	O
turn	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
poor	O
,	O
sorry	O
things	O
;	O
their	O
sail	O
was	O
made	O
of	O
a	O
large	O
mat	O
,	O
only	O
one	O
that	O
was	O
of	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
cotton	O
stuff	O
fit	O
for	O
little	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
ropes	O
were	O
twisted	O
flags	O
of	O
no	O
strength	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
concluded	O
we	O
were	O
better	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
them	O
alone	O
.	O

We	O
went	O
forward	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
,	O
keeping	O
the	O
coast	O
close	O
on	O
board	O
for	O
twelve	O
days	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
east	O
and	O
E.S.E.	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
very	O
fresh	O
way	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
no	O
towns	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
but	O
often	O
saw	O
some	O
huts	O
by	O
the	O
water-side	O
upon	O
the	O
rocks	O
,	O
and	O
always	O
abundance	O
of	O
people	O
about	O
them	O
,	O
who	O
we	O
could	O
perceive	O
run	O
together	O
to	O
stare	O
at	O
us	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
as	O
odd	O
a	O
voyage	O
as	O
ever	O
man	O
went	O
;	O
we	O
were	O
a	O
little	O
fleet	O
of	O
three	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
an	O
army	O
of	O
between	O
twenty	O
and	O
thirty	O
as	O
dangerous	O
fellows	O
as	O
ever	O
they	O
had	O
amongst	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
had	O
they	O
known	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
compounded	O
to	O
give	O
us	O
everything	O
we	O
desired	O
to	O
be	O
rid	O
of	O
us	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
as	O
miserable	O
as	O
nature	O
could	O
well	O
make	O
us	O
to	O
be	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
upon	O
a	O
voyage	O
and	O
no	O
voyage	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
bound	O
somewhere	O
and	O
nowhere	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
we	O
knew	O
what	O
we	O
intended	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
we	O
did	O
really	O
not	O
know	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
doing	O
.	O

We	O
went	O
forward	O
and	O
forward	O
by	O
a	O
northerly	O
course	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
advanced	O
the	O
heat	O
increased	O
,	O
which	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
intolerable	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
on	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
without	O
any	O
covering	O
from	O
heat	O
or	O
wet	O
;	O
besides	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
in	O
the	O
month	O
of	O
October	O
,	O
or	O
thereabouts	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
southern	O
latitude	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
went	O
every	O
day	O
nearer	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
the	O
sun	O
came	O
also	O
every	O
day	O
nearer	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
till	O
at	O
last	O
we	O
found	O
ourselves	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
20	O
degrees	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
passed	O
the	O
tropic	O
about	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
days	O
before	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
more	O
the	O
sun	O
would	O
be	O
in	O
the	O
zenith	O
,	O
just	O
over	O
our	O
heads	O
.	O

Upon	O
these	O
considerations	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
seek	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
place	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
pitch	O
our	O
tents	O
,	O
till	O
the	O
heat	O
of	O
the	O
weather	O
abated	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
measured	O
half	O
the	O
length	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
come	O
to	O
that	O
part	O
where	O
the	O
shore	O
tending	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
north-west	O
,	O
promised	O
fair	O
to	O
make	O
our	O
passage	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
mainland	O
of	O
Africa	PNM
much	O
shorter	O
than	O
we	O
expected	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
that	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
good	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
it	O
was	O
about	O
120	O
leagues	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
the	O
heats	O
considered	O
,	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
take	O
harbour	O
;	O
besides	O
,	O
our	O
provisions	O
were	O
exhausted	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
many	O
days	O
'	O
store	O
left	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
putting	O
in	O
for	O
the	O
shore	O
early	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
usually	O
did	O
once	O
in	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
days	O
for	O
fresh	O
water	O
,	O
we	O
sat	O
down	O
and	O
considered	O
whether	O
we	O
would	O
go	O
on	O
or	O
take	O
up	O
our	O
standing	O
there	O
;	O
but	O
upon	O
several	O
considerations	O
,	O
too	O
long	O
to	O
repeat	O
here	O
,	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
like	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
longer	O
.	O

After	O
sailing	O
on	O
N.W.	O
by	O
N.	O
with	O
a	O
fresh	O
gale	O
at	O
S.E.	O
,	O
about	O
six	O
days	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
,	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
,	O
a	O
large	O
promontory	O
or	O
cape	O
of	O
land	O
,	O
pushing	O
out	O
a	O
long	O
way	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
exceeding	O
fond	O
of	O
seeing	O
what	O
was	O
beyond	O
the	O
cape	O
,	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
double	O
it	O
before	O
we	O
took	O
into	O
harbour	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
kept	O
on	O
our	O
way	O
,	O
the	O
gale	O
continuing	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
it	O
was	O
four	O
days	O
more	O
before	O
we	O
reached	O
the	O
cape	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
possible	O
to	O
express	O
the	O
discouragement	O
and	O
melancholy	O
that	O
seized	O
us	O
all	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
thither	O
;	O
for	O
when	O
we	O
made	O
the	O
headland	O
of	O
the	O
cape	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
surprised	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
shore	O
fall	O
away	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
it	O
had	O
advanced	O
on	O
this	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
more	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
would	O
venture	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
of	O
Africa	PNM
,	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
from	O
hence	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
went	O
further	O
,	O
the	O
breadth	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
still	O
increased	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
what	O
breadth	O
it	O
might	O
increase	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
mused	O
upon	O
this	O
discovery	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
surprised	O
with	O
very	O
bad	O
weather	O
,	O
and	O
especially	O
violent	O
rains	O
,	O
with	O
thunder	O
and	O
lightning	O
,	O
most	O
unusually	O
terrible	O
to	O
us	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
pickle	O
we	O
run	O
for	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
getting	O
under	O
the	O
lee	O
of	O
the	O
cape	O
,	O
run	O
our	O
frigates	O
into	O
a	O
little	O
creek	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
land	O
overgrown	O
with	O
trees	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
all	O
the	O
haste	O
possible	O
to	O
get	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
being	O
exceeding	O
wet	O
,	O
and	O
fatigued	O
with	O
the	O
heat	O
,	O
the	O
thunder	O
,	O
lightning	O
,	O
and	O
rain	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
thought	O
our	O
case	O
was	O
very	O
deplorable	O
indeed	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
our	O
artist	O
,	O
of	O
whom	O
I	O
have	O
spoken	O
so	O
often	O
,	O
set	O
up	O
a	O
great	O
cross	O
of	O
wood	O
on	O
the	O
hill	O
which	O
was	O
within	O
a	O
mile	O
of	O
the	O
headland	O
,	O
with	O
these	O
words	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
language	O
:	O
--	O
``	O
Point	O
Desperation	O
.	O

Jesus	O
have	O
mercy	O
.	O
''	O

We	O
set	O
to	O
work	O
immediately	O
to	O
build	O
us	O
some	O
huts	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
get	O
our	O
clothes	O
dried	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
I	O
was	O
young	O
and	O
had	O
no	O
skill	O
in	O
such	O
things	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
shall	O
never	O
forget	O
the	O
little	O
city	O
we	O
built	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
no	O
less	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
fortified	O
it	O
accordingly	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
idea	O
is	O
so	O
fresh	O
in	O
my	O
thought	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
but	O
give	O
a	O
short	O
description	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

Our	O
camp	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
south	O
side	O
of	O
a	O
little	O
creek	O
on	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
under	O
the	O
shelter	O
of	O
a	O
steep	O
hill	O
,	O
which	O
lay	O
,	O
though	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
creek	O
,	O
yet	O
within	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
N.W.	O
by	O
N.	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
happily	O
intercepted	O
the	O
heat	O
of	O
the	O
sun	O
all	O
the	O
after	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
.	O

The	O
spot	O
we	O
pitched	O
on	O
had	O
a	O
little	O
fresh	O
water	O
brook	O
,	O
or	O
a	O
stream	O
running	O
into	O
the	O
creek	O
by	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
saw	O
cattle	O
feeding	O
in	O
the	O
plains	O
and	O
low	O
ground	O
east	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
of	O
us	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
set	O
up	O
twelve	O
little	O
huts	O
like	O
soldiers	O
'	O
tents	O
,	O
but	O
made	O
of	O
the	O
boughs	O
of	O
trees	O
stuck	O
in	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
bound	O
together	O
on	O
the	O
top	O
with	O
withies	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
other	O
things	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
get	O
;	O
the	O
creek	O
was	O
our	O
defence	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
,	O
a	O
little	O
brook	O
on	O
the	O
west	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
south	O
and	O
east	O
sides	O
were	O
fortified	O
with	O
a	O
bank	O
,	O
which	O
entirely	O
covered	O
our	O
huts	O
;	O
and	O
being	O
drawn	O
oblique	O
from	O
the	O
north-west	O
to	O
the	O
south-east	O
,	O
made	O
our	O
city	O
a	O
triangle	O
.	O

Behind	O
the	O
bank	O
or	O
line	O
our	O
huts	O
stood	O
,	O
having	O
three	O
other	O
huts	O
behind	O
them	O
at	O
a	O
good	O
distance	O
.	O

In	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
one	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
further	O
off	O
,	O
we	O
put	O
our	O
gunpowder	O
,	O
and	O
nothing	O
else	O
,	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
danger	O
;	O
in	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
bigger	O
,	O
we	O
dressed	O
our	O
victuals	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
all	O
our	O
necessaries	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
third	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
biggest	O
of	O
all	O
,	O
we	O
ate	O
our	O
dinners	O
,	O
called	O
our	O
councils	O
,	O
and	O
sat	O
and	O
diverted	O
ourselves	O
with	O
such	O
conversation	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
one	O
with	O
another	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
but	O
indifferent	O
truly	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
.	O

Our	O
correspondence	O
with	O
the	O
natives	O
was	O
absolutely	O
necessary	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
artist	O
the	O
cutler	O
having	O
made	O
abundance	O
of	O
those	O
little	O
diamond-cut	O
squares	O
of	O
silver	O
,	O
with	O
these	O
we	O
made	O
shift	O
to	O
traffic	O
with	O
the	O
black	O
people	O
for	O
what	O
we	O
wanted	O
;	O
for	O
indeed	O
they	O
were	O
pleased	O
wonderfully	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
thus	O
we	O
got	O
plenty	O
of	O
provisions	O
.	O

At	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
particular	O
,	O
we	O
got	O
about	O
fifty	O
head	O
of	O
black	O
cattle	O
and	O
goats	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
cook	O
's	O

took	O
care	O
to	O
cure	O
them	O
and	O
dry	O
them	O
,	O
salt	O
and	O
preserve	O
them	O
for	O
our	O
grand	O
supply	O
;	O
nor	O
was	O
this	O
hard	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
the	O
salt	O
and	O
saltpetre	O
being	O
very	O
good	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sun	O
excessively	O
hot	O
;	O
and	O
here	O
we	O
lived	O
about	O
four	O
months	O
.	O

The	O
southern	O
solstice	O
was	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sun	O
gone	O
back	O
towards	O
the	O
equinoctial	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
considered	O
of	O
our	O
next	O
adventure	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
to	O
go	O
over	O
the	O
sea	O
of	O
Zanguebar	PNM
,	O
as	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
land	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
upon	O
the	O
continent	O
of	O
Africa	PNM
.	O

We	O
talked	O
with	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
about	O
it	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
make	O
ourselves	O
intelligible	O
to	O
,	O
but	O
all	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
learn	O
from	O
them	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
land	O
of	O
lions	O
beyond	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
off	O
.	O

We	O
knew	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
they	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
long	O
way	O
,	O
but	O
our	O
people	O
differed	O
mightily	O
about	O
it	O
;	O
some	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
150	O
leagues	O
,	O
others	O
not	O
above	O
100	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
that	O
had	O
a	O
map	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
showed	O
us	O
by	O
his	O
scale	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
above	O
eighty	O
leagues	O
.	O

Some	O
said	O
there	O
were	O
islands	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
touch	O
at	O
,	O
some	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
islands	O
at	O
all	O
.	O

For	O
my	O
own	O
part	O
,	O
I	O
knew	O
nothing	O
of	O
this	O
matter	O
one	O
way	O
or	O
another	O
,	O
but	O
heard	O
it	O
all	O
without	O
concern	O
,	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
near	O
or	O
far	O
off	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
this	O
we	O
learned	O
from	O
an	O
old	O
man	O
who	O
was	O
blind	O
and	O
led	O
about	O
by	O
a	O
boy	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
stayed	O
till	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
August	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
sure	O
of	O
the	O
wind	O
to	O
be	O
fair	O
and	O
the	O
sea	O
smooth	O
all	O
the	O
voyage	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
some	O
encouragement	O
;	O
but	O
staying	O
again	O
was	O
very	O
unwelcome	O
news	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
because	O
that	O
then	O
the	O
sun	O
would	O
be	O
returning	O
again	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
what	O
our	O
men	O
were	O
very	O
unwilling	O
to	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
we	O
called	O
a	O
council	O
of	O
our	O
whole	O
body	O
;	O
their	O
debates	O
were	O
too	O
tedious	O
to	O
take	O
notice	O
of	O
,	O
only	O
to	O
note	O
,	O
that	O
when	O
it	O
came	O
to	O
Captain	O
Bob	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
so	O
they	O
called	O
me	O
ever	O
since	O
I	O
had	O
taken	O
state	O
upon	O
me	O
before	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
great	O
princes	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
truly	O
I	O
was	O
on	O
no	O
side	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
one	O
farthing	O
matter	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
,	O
whether	O
we	O
went	O
or	O
stayed	O
;	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
home	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
world	O
was	O
alike	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
left	O
it	O
entirely	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
determine	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
they	O
saw	O
plainly	O
there	O
was	O
nothing	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
without	O
shipping	O
;	O
that	O
if	O
our	O
business	O
indeed	O
was	O
only	O
to	O
eat	O
and	O
drink	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
find	O
a	O
better	O
place	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
;	O
but	O
if	O
our	O
business	O
was	O
to	O
get	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
get	O
home	O
into	O
our	O
country	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
find	O
a	O
worse	O
.	O

I	O
confess	O
I	O
liked	O
the	O
country	O
wonderfully	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
then	O
had	O
strange	O
notions	O
of	O
coming	O
again	O
to	O
live	O
there	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
used	O
to	O
say	O
to	O
them	O
very	O
often	O
that	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
but	O
a	O
ship	O
of	O
twenty	O
guns	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
sloop	O
,	O
and	O
both	O
well	O
manned	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
desire	O
a	O
better	O
place	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
to	O
make	O
myself	O
as	O
rich	O
as	O
a	O
king	O
.	O

But	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
the	O
consultations	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
about	O
going	O
.	O

Upon	O
the	O
whole	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
resolved	O
to	O
venture	O
over	O
for	O
the	O
main	O
;	O
and	O
venture	O
we	O
did	O
,	O
madly	O
enough	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
wrong	O
time	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
to	O
undertake	O
such	O
a	O
voyage	O
in	O
that	O
country	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
winds	O
hang	O
easterly	O
all	O
the	O
months	O
from	O
September	O
to	O
March	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
generally	O
hang	O
westerly	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
,	O
and	O
blew	O
right	O
in	O
our	O
teeth	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
land-breeze	O
,	O
stretched	O
over	O
about	O
fifteen	O
or	O
twenty	O
leagues	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
may	O
say	O
,	O
just	O
enough	O
to	O
lose	O
ourselves	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
wind	O
set	O
in	O
a	O
steady	O
fresh	O
gale	O
or	O
breeze	O
from	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
at	O
west	O
,	O
W.S.W.	O
,	O
or	O
S.W.	O
by	O
W.	O
,	O
and	O
never	O
further	O
from	O
the	O
west	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
make	O
nothing	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
the	O
vessel	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
,	O
would	O
not	O
lie	O
close	O
upon	O
a	O
wind	O
;	O
if	O
so	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
stretched	O
away	O
N.N.W.	O
,	O
and	O
have	O
met	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
islands	O
in	O
our	O
way	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
found	O
afterwards	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
could	O
make	O
nothing	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
tried	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
trying	O
had	O
almost	O
undone	O
us	O
all	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
stretching	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
,	O
as	O
near	O
the	O
wind	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
forgotten	O
the	O
shape	O
and	O
position	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Madagascar	PNM
itself	O
;	O
how	O
that	O
we	O
came	O
off	O
at	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
a	O
promontory	O
or	O
point	O
of	O
land	O
,	O
that	O
lies	O
about	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
stretches	O
out	O
west	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
now	O
,	O
being	O
run	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
forty	O
leagues	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
,	O
the	O
shore	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
fell	O
off	O
again	O
above	O
200	O
miles	O
to	O
the	O
east	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
in	O
the	O
wide	O
ocean	O
,	O
between	O
the	O
island	O
and	O
the	O
main	O
,	O
and	O
almost	O
100	O
leagues	O
from	O
both	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
winds	O
blew	O
fresh	O
at	O
west	O
,	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
smooth	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
pretty	O
good	O
going	O
before	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
,	O
taking	O
our	O
smallest	O
canoe	O
in	O
tow	O
,	O
we	O
stood	O
in	O
for	O
the	O
shore	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
sail	O
we	O
could	O
make	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
terrible	O
adventure	O
,	O
for	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
least	O
gust	O
of	O
wind	O
had	O
come	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
all	O
lost	O
,	O
our	O
canoes	O
being	O
deep	O
and	O
in	O
no	O
condition	O
to	O
make	O
way	O
in	O
a	O
high	O
sea	O
.	O

This	O
voyage	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
held	O
us	O
eleven	O
days	O
in	O
all	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
length	O
,	O
having	O
spent	O
most	O
of	O
our	O
provisions	O
,	O
and	O
every	O
drop	O
of	O
water	O
we	O
had	O
,	O
we	O
spied	O
land	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
joy	O
,	O
though	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
ten	O
or	O
eleven	O
leagues	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
,	O
under	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
came	O
off	O
like	O
a	O
land-breeze	O
,	O
and	O
blew	O
hard	O
against	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
two	O
days	O
more	O
before	O
we	O
reached	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
having	O
all	O
that	O
while	O
excessive	O
hot	O
weather	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
a	O
drop	O
of	O
water	O
or	O
any	O
other	O
liquor	O
,	O
except	O
some	O
cordial	O
waters	O
,	O
which	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
company	O
had	O
a	O
little	O
of	O
left	O
in	O
a	O
case	O
of	O
bottles	O
.	O

This	O
gave	O
us	O
a	O
taste	O
of	O
what	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
done	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
ventured	O
forward	O
with	O
a	O
scant	O
wind	O
and	O
uncertain	O
weather	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
us	O
a	O
surfeit	O
of	O
our	O
design	O
for	O
the	O
main	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
until	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
some	O
better	O
vessels	O
under	O
us	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
pitched	O
our	O
camp	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
in	O
as	O
convenient	O
manner	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
fortifying	O
ourselves	O
against	O
any	O
surprise	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
natives	O
here	O
were	O
exceeding	O
courteous	O
,	O
and	O
much	O
more	O
civil	O
than	O
on	O
the	O
south	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
understand	O
what	O
they	O
said	O
,	O
or	O
they	O
us	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
understand	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
seafaring	O
men	O
and	O
strangers	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
distress	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
provisions	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
proof	O
we	O
had	O
of	O
their	O
kindness	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
saw	O
us	O
come	O
on	O
shore	O
and	O
begin	O
to	O
make	O
our	O
habitation	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
captains	O
or	O
kings	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
to	O
call	O
them	O
,	O
came	O
down	O
with	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
men	O
and	O
some	O
women	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
us	O
five	O
goats	O
and	O
two	O
young	O
fat	O
steers	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
them	O
to	O
us	O
for	O
nothing	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
we	O
went	O
to	O
offer	O
them	O
anything	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
or	O
the	O
king	O
would	O
not	O
let	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
touch	O
it	O
,	O
or	O
take	O
anything	O
of	O
us	O
.	O

About	O
two	O
hours	O
after	O
came	O
another	O
king	O
,	O
or	O
captain	O
,	O
with	O
forty	O
or	O
fifty	O
men	O
after	O
him	O
.	O

We	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
afraid	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
laid	O
hands	O
upon	O
our	O
weapons	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
perceiving	O
it	O
,	O
caused	O
two	O
men	O
to	O
go	O
before	O
him	O
,	O
carrying	O
two	O
long	O
poles	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
held	O
upright	O
,	O
as	O
high	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
presently	O
perceived	O
was	O
a	O
signal	O
of	O
peace	O
;	O
and	O
these	O
two	O
poles	O
they	O
set	O
up	O
afterwards	O
,	O
sticking	O
them	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
ground	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
the	O
king	O
and	O
his	O
men	O
came	O
to	O
these	O
two	O
poles	O
,	O
they	O
struck	O
all	O
their	O
lances	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
on	O
unarmed	O
,	O
leaving	O
their	O
lances	O
,	O
as	O
also	O
their	O
bows	O
and	O
arrows	O
,	O
behind	O
them	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
to	O
satisfy	O
us	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
come	O
as	O
friends	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
glad	O
to	O
see	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
mind	O
to	O
quarrel	O
with	O
them	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
help	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
captain	O
of	O
this	O
gang	O
seeing	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
making	O
up	O
their	O
huts	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
it	O
but	O
bunglingly	O
,	O
he	O
beckoned	O
to	O
some	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
help	O
us	O
.	O

Immediately	O
fifteen	O
or	O
sixteen	O
of	O
them	O
came	O
and	O
mingled	O
among	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
for	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
indeed	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
better	O
workmen	O
than	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
run	O
up	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
huts	O
for	O
us	O
in	O
a	O
moment	O
,	O
and	O
much	O
handsomer	O
done	O
than	O
ours	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
they	O
sent	O
us	O
milk	O
,	O
plantains	O
,	O
pumpkins	O
,	O
and	O
abundance	O
of	O
roots	O
and	O
greens	O
that	O
were	O
very	O
good	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
took	O
their	O
leave	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
not	O
take	O
anything	O
from	O
us	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
offered	O
the	O
king	O
or	O
captain	O
of	O
these	O
men	O
a	O
dram	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
drank	O
and	O
was	O
mightily	O
pleased	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
held	O
out	O
his	O
hand	O
for	O
another	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
gave	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
after	O
this	O
,	O
he	O
hardly	O
failed	O
coming	O
to	O
us	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
times	O
a	O
week	O
,	O
always	O
bringing	O
us	O
something	O
or	O
other	O
;	O
and	O
one	O
time	O
sent	O
us	O
seven	O
head	O
of	O
black	O
cattle	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
cured	O
and	O
dried	O
as	O
before	O
.	O

And	O
here	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
but	O
remember	O
one	O
thing	O
,	O
which	O
afterwards	O
stood	O
us	O
in	O
great	O
stead	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
flesh	O
of	O
their	O
goats	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
beef	O
also	O
,	O
but	O
especially	O
the	O
former	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
had	O
dried	O
and	O
cured	O
it	O
,	O
looked	O
red	O
,	O
and	O
ate	O
hard	O
and	O
firm	O
,	O
as	O
dried	O
beef	O
in	O
Holland	PNM
;	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
pleased	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
such	O
a	O
dainty	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
after	O
they	O
would	O
trade	O
with	O
us	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
not	O
knowing	O
,	O
or	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
imagining	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
for	O
ten	O
or	O
twelve	O
pounds	O
'	O
weight	O
of	O
smoke-dried	O
beef	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
give	O
us	O
a	O
whole	O
bullock	O
,	O
or	O
cow	O
,	O
or	O
anything	O
else	O
we	O
could	O
desire	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
observed	O
two	O
things	O
that	O
were	O
very	O
material	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
even	O
essentially	O
so	O
;	O
first	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
earthenware	O
here	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
made	O
use	O
of	O
many	O
ways	O
as	O
we	O
did	O
;	O
particularly	O
they	O
had	O
long	O
,	O
deep	O
earthen	O
pots	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
used	O
to	O
sink	O
into	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
water	O
which	O
they	O
drunk	O
cool	O
and	O
pleasant	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
larger	O
canoes	O
than	O
their	O
neighbours	O
had	O
.	O

By	O
this	O
we	O
were	O
prompted	O
to	O
inquire	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
larger	O
vessels	O
than	O
those	O
we	O
saw	O
there	O
,	O
or	O
if	O
any	O
other	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
had	O
not	O
such	O
.	O

They	O
signified	O
presently	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
larger	O
boats	O
than	O
that	O
they	O
showed	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
they	O
had	O
larger	O
boats	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
with	O
decks	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
large	O
sails	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
made	O
us	O
resolve	O
to	O
coast	O
round	O
the	O
whole	O
island	O
to	O
see	O
them	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
prepared	O
and	O
victualled	O
our	O
canoe	O
for	O
the	O
voyage	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
went	O
to	O
sea	O
for	O
the	O
third	O
time	O
.	O

It	O
cost	O
us	O
a	O
month	O
or	O
six	O
weeks	O
'	O
time	O
to	O
perform	O
this	O
voyage	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
time	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
several	O
times	O
for	O
water	O
and	O
provisions	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
the	O
natives	O
always	O
very	O
free	O
and	O
courteous	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
were	O
surprised	O
one	O
morning	O
early	O
,	O
being	O
at	O
the	O
extremity	O
of	O
the	O
northernmost	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
when	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
cried	O
out	O
,	O
``	O
A	O
sail	O
!	O

a	O
sail	O
!	O
''	O

We	O
presently	O
saw	O
a	O
vessel	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
out	O
at	O
sea	O
;	O
but	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
looked	O
at	O
it	O
with	O
our	O
perspective	O
glasses	O
,	O
and	O
endeavoured	O
all	O
we	O
could	O
to	O
make	O
out	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
what	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
neither	O
ship	O
,	O
ketch	O
,	O
galley	O
,	O
galliot	O
,	O
or	O
like	O
anything	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
ever	O
seen	O
before	O
;	O
all	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
make	O
of	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
went	O
from	O
us	O
,	O
standing	O
out	O
to	O
sea	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
we	O
soon	O
lost	O
sight	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
no	O
condition	O
to	O
chase	O
anything	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
never	O
saw	O
it	O
again	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
by	O
all	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
perceive	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
from	O
what	O
we	O
saw	O
of	O
such	O
things	O
afterwards	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
some	O
Arabian	O
vessel	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
trading	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Mozambique	PNM
,	O
or	O
Zanzibar	O
,	O
the	O
same	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
afterwards	O
went	O
,	O
as	O
you	O
shall	O
hear	O
.	O

I	O
kept	O
no	O
journal	O
of	O
this	O
voyage	O
,	O
nor	O
indeed	O
did	O
I	O
all	O
this	O
while	O
understand	O
anything	O
of	O
navigation	O
,	O
more	O
than	O
the	O
common	O
business	O
of	O
a	O
foremast-man	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
nothing	O
to	O
the	O
latitudes	O
or	O
distances	O
of	O
any	O
places	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
,	O
how	O
long	O
we	O
were	O
going	O
,	O
or	O
how	O
far	O
we	O
sailed	O
in	O
a	O
day	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
I	O
remember	O
,	O
that	O
being	O
now	O
come	O
round	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
we	O
sailed	O
up	O
the	O
eastern	O
shore	O
due	O
south	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
done	O
down	O
the	O
western	O
shore	O
due	O
north	O
before	O
.	O

Nor	O
do	O
I	O
remember	O
that	O
the	O
natives	O
differed	O
much	O
from	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
either	O
in	O
stature	O
or	O
complexion	O
,	O
or	O
in	O
their	O
manners	O
,	O
their	O
habits	O
,	O
their	O
weapons	O
,	O
or	O
indeed	O
in	O
anything	O
;	O
and	O
yet	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
perceive	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
any	O
intelligence	O
one	O
with	O
another	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
extremely	O
kind	O
and	O
civil	O
to	O
us	O
on	O
this	O
side	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
.	O

We	O
continued	O
our	O
voyage	O
south	O
for	O
many	O
weeks	O
,	O
though	O
with	O
several	O
intervals	O
of	O
going	O
on	O
shore	O
to	O
get	O
provisions	O
and	O
water	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
,	O
coming	O
round	O
a	O
point	O
of	O
land	O
which	O
lay	O
about	O
a	O
league	O
further	O
than	O
ordinary	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
agreeably	O
surprised	O
with	O
a	O
sight	O
which	O
,	O
no	O
doubt	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
as	O
disagreeable	O
to	O
those	O
concerned	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
pleasant	O
to	O
us	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
wreck	O
of	O
an	O
European	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
cast	O
away	O
upon	O
the	O
rocks	O
,	O
which	O
in	O
that	O
place	O
run	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
.	O

We	O
could	O
see	O
plainly	O
,	O
at	O
low	O
water	O
,	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
lay	O
dry	O
;	O
even	O
at	O
high	O
water	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
not	O
entirely	O
covered	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
at	O
most	O
she	O
did	O
not	O
lie	O
above	O
a	O
league	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

It	O
will	O
easily	O
be	O
believed	O
that	O
our	O
curiosity	O
led	O
us	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
and	O
weather	O
also	O
permitting	O
,	O
to	O
go	O
directly	O
to	O
her	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
without	O
any	O
difficulty	O
,	O
and	O
presently	O
found	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
Dutch-built	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
she	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
long	O
in	O
that	O
condition	O
,	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
the	O
upper	O
work	O
of	O
her	O
stern	O
remaining	O
firm	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
mizzen-mast	O
standing	O
.	O

Her	O
stern	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
jammed	O
in	O
between	O
two	O
ridges	O
of	O
the	O
rock	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
remained	O
fast	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
fore	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
having	O
been	O
beaten	O
to	O
pieces	O
.	O

We	O
could	O
see	O
nothing	O
to	O
be	O
gotten	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
wreck	O
that	O
was	O
worth	O
our	O
while	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
stay	O
some	O
time	O
thereabouts	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
perhaps	O
we	O
might	O
get	O
any	O
light	O
into	O
the	O
story	O
of	O
her	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
without	O
hopes	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
hear	O
something	O
more	O
particular	O
about	O
her	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
find	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
on	O
shore	O
there	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
condition	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
might	O
increase	O
our	O
company	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
pleasant	O
sight	O
to	O
us	O
when	O
,	O
coming	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
all	O
the	O
marks	O
and	O
tokens	O
of	O
a	O
ship-carpenter	O
's	O
yard	O
;	O
as	O
a	O
launch-block	O
and	O
cradles	O
,	O
scaffolds	O
and	O
planks	O
,	O
and	O
pieces	O
of	O
planks	O
,	O
the	O
remains	O
of	O
the	O
building	O
a	O
ship	O
or	O
vessel	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
things	O
that	O
fairly	O
invited	O
us	O
to	O
go	O
about	O
the	O
same	O
work	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
soon	O
came	O
to	O
understand	O
that	O
the	O
men	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
that	O
was	O
lost	O
had	O
saved	O
themselves	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
perhaps	O
in	O
their	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
built	O
themselves	O
a	O
barque	O
or	O
sloop	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
were	O
gone	O
to	O
sea	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
inquiring	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
which	O
way	O
they	O
went	O
,	O
they	O
pointed	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
and	O
south-west	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
we	O
could	O
easily	O
understand	O
they	O
were	O
gone	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
of	PNM
Good	PNM
Hope	PNM
.	O

Nobody	O
will	O
imagine	O
we	O
could	O
be	O
so	O
dull	O
as	O
not	O
to	O
gather	O
from	O
hence	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
take	O
the	O
same	O
method	O
for	O
our	O
escape	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
resolved	O
first	O
,	O
in	O
general	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
try	O
if	O
possible	O
to	O
build	O
us	O
a	O
boat	O
of	O
one	O
kind	O
or	O
other	O
,	O
and	O
go	O
to	O
sea	O
as	O
our	O
fate	O
should	O
direct	O
.	O

In	O
order	O
to	O
this	O
our	O
first	O
work	O
was	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
two	O
carpenters	O
search	O
about	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
materials	O
the	O
Dutchmen	O
had	O
left	O
behind	O
them	O
that	O
might	O
be	O
of	O
use	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
particular	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
one	O
that	O
was	O
very	O
useful	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
much	O
employed	O
about	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
pitch-kettle	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
pitch	O
in	O
it	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
set	O
close	O
to	O
this	O
work	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
very	O
laborious	O
and	O
difficult	O
,	O
having	O
but	O
few	O
tools	O
,	O
no	O
ironwork	O
,	O
no	O
cordage	O
,	O
no	O
sails	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
whatever	O
we	O
built	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
be	O
our	O
own	O
smiths	O
,	O
rope-makers	O
,	O
sail-makers	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
to	O
practise	O
twenty	O
trades	O
that	O
we	O
knew	O
little	O
or	O
nothing	O
of	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
necessity	O
was	O
the	O
spur	O
to	O
invention	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
did	O
many	O
things	O
which	O
before	O
we	O
thought	O
impracticable	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O

After	O
our	O
two	O
carpenters	O
had	O
resolved	O
upon	O
the	O
dimensions	O
of	O
what	O
they	O
would	O
build	O
,	O
they	O
set	O
us	O
all	O
to	O
work	O

to	O
go	O
off	O
in	O
our	O
boats	O
and	O
split	O
up	O
the	O
wreck	O
of	O
the	O
old	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
bring	O
away	O
everything	O
we	O
could	O
;	O
and	O
particularly	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
bring	O
away	O
the	O
mizzen-mast	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
left	O
standing	O
,	O
which	O
with	O
much	O
difficulty	O
we	O
effected	O

after	O
above	O
twenty	O
days	O
'	O
labour	O
of	O
fourteen	O
of	O
our	O
men	O

At	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
we	O
got	O
out	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
ironwork	O
,	O
as	O
bolts	O
,	O
spikes	O

spoken	O
already	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
now	O
grown	O
a	O
very	O
dexterous	O

nails	O

for	O
our	O
rudder	O

and	O
spikes	O
such	O
as	O
we	O
wanted	O

But	O
we	O
wanted	O
an	O
anchor	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
had	O
an	O
anchor	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
made	O
a	O
cable	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
contented	O
ourselves	O
with	O
making	O
some	O
ropes	O
with	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
of	O
such	O
stuff	O
as	O
they	O
made	O
their	O
mats	O
of	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
these	O
we	O
made	O
such	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
cable	O
or	O
tow-line	O
as	O
was	O
sufficient	O
to	O
fasten	O
our	O
vessel	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
contented	O
ourselves	O
with	O
for	O
that	O
time	O
.	O

To	O
be	O
short	O
,	O
we	O
spent	O
four	O
months	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
worked	O
very	O
hard	O
too	O
;	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
which	O
time	O
we	O
launched	O
our	O
frigate	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
words	O
,	O
had	O
many	O
defects	O
,	O
but	O
yet	O
,	O
all	O
things	O
considered	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
expect	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
sloop	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
burthen	O
of	O
near	O
eighteen	O
or	O
twenty	O

had	O
we	O

a	O

to	O
go	O
;	O
but	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
materials	O
we	O
wanted	O
,	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
worst	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
tar	O
or	O
pitch	O
to	O
pay	O
the	O
seams	O
and	O
secure	O
the	O
bottom	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
we	O
did	O
what	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
with	O
tallow	O
and	O
oil	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
mixture	O
to	O
supply	O
that	O
part	O

yet	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
bring	O
it	O
to	O
answer	O
our	O
end	O
fully	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
we	O
launched	O
her	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
so	O
leaky	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
in	O
the	O
water	O
so	O
fast	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
thought	O
all	O
our	O
labour	O
had	O
been	O
lost	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
much	O
ado	O
to	O
make	O
her	O
swim	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
for	O
pumps	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
none	O

nor	O
had	O
we	O
any	O
means	O
to	O

But	O
at	O
length	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
a	O
black	O
negro-man	O
,	O
showed	O
us	O
a	O
tree	O
,	O
the	O
wood	O
of	O
which	O
being	O
put	O
into	O
the	O
fire	O
,	O
sends	O
forth	O
a	O
liquid	O
that	O
is	O
as	O
glutinous	O
and	O
almost	O
as	O
strong	O
as	O
tar	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
which	O
,	O
by	O
boiling	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
stuff	O
which	O
served	O
us	O
for	O
pitch	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
answered	O
our	O
end	O
effectually	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
perfectly	O
made	O
our	O
vessel	O
sound	O
and	O
tight	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
wanted	O
no	O
pitch	O
or	O
tar	O
at	O
all	O

This	O
secret	O
has	O
stood	O
me	O
in	O
stead	O
upon	O
many	O
occasions	O
since	O
that	O
time	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
place	O

Our	O
vessel	O
being	O
thus	O
finished	O
,	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
mizzen-mast	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
we	O
made	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
mast	O
to	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
fitted	O
our	O
sails	O
to	O
it	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
;	O
then	O
we	O
made	O
a	O
rudder	O
and	O
tiller	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
everything	O
that	O
our	O
present	O
necessity	O
called	O
upon	O
us	O
for	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
victualled	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
as	O
much	O
fresh	O
water	O
on	O
board	O
as	O
we	O
thought	O
we	O
wanted	O
,	O
or	O
as	O
we	O

how	O
to	O
stow	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
yet	O
without	O
casks	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
we	O
put	O
to	O
sea	O
with	O
a	O
fair	O
wind	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
spent	O
near	O
another	O
year	O
in	O
these	O
rambles	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
this	O
piece	O
of	O
work	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
now	O
,	O
as	O
our	O
men	O
said	O
,	O
about	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
our	O
February	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sun	O
went	O
from	O
us	O
apace	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
much	O
to	O
our	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
heats	O
were	O
exceedingly	O
violent	O
.	O

The	O
wind	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
was	O
fair	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
since	O
learned	O
,	O
the	O
winds	O
generally	O
spring	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
sun	O
goes	O
from	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
.	O

Our	O
debate	O
now	O
was	O
,	O
which	O
way	O
we	O
should	O
go	O
,	O
and	O
never	O
were	O
men	O
so	O
irresolute	O
;	O
some	O
were	O
for	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
east	O
,	O
and	O
stretching	O
away	O
directly	O
for	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Malabar	PNM
;	O
but	O
others	O
,	O
who	O
considered	O
more	O
seriously	O
the	O
length	O
of	O
that	O
voyage	O
,	O
shook	O
their	O
heads	O
at	O
the	O
proposal	O
,	O
knowing	O
very	O
well	O
that	O
neither	O
our	O
provisions	O
,	O
especially	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
or	O
our	O
vessel	O
,	O
were	O
equal	O
to	O
such	O
a	O
run	O
as	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
of	O
near	O
2000	O
miles	O
without	O
any	O
land	O
to	O
touch	O
at	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
.	O

These	O
men	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
had	O
all	O
along	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
mind	O
to	O
a	O
voyage	O
for	O
the	O
mainland	O
of	O
Africa	PNM
,	O
where	O
they	O
said	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
a	O
fair	O
cast	O
for	O
our	O
lives	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
be	O
sure	O
to	O
make	O
ourselves	O
rich	O
,	O
which	O
way	O
soever	O
we	O
went	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
but	O
able	O
to	O
make	O
our	O
way	O
through	O
,	O
whether	O
by	O
sea	O
or	O
by	O
land	O
.	O

Besides	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
case	O
stood	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
much	O
choice	O
for	O
our	O
way	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
resolved	O
for	O
the	O
east	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
the	O
wrong	O
season	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
,	O
and	O
must	O
have	O
stayed	O
till	O
April	O
or	O
May	O
before	O
we	O
had	O
gone	O
to	O
sea	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
S.E.	O
and	O
E.S.E.	O
,	O
and	O
fine	O
promising	O
weather	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
all	O
into	O
the	O
first	O
proposal	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
for	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Africa	PNM
;	O
nor	O
were	O
we	O
long	O
in	O
disputing	O
as	O
to	O
our	O
coasting	O
the	O
island	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
upon	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
upon	O
the	O
wrong	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
for	O
the	O
voyage	O
we	O
intended	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
stood	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
rounded	O
the	O
cape	O
,	O
we	O
hauled	O
away	O
southward	O
,	O
under	O
the	O
lee	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
thinking	O
to	O
reach	O
the	O
west	O
point	O
of	O
land	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
observed	O
before	O
,	O
runs	O
out	O
so	O
far	O
towards	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Africa	PNM
,	O
as	O
would	O
have	O
shortened	O
our	O
run	O
almost	O
100	O
leagues	O
.	O

But	O
when	O
we	O
had	O
sailed	O
about	O
thirty	O
leagues	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
winds	O
variable	O
under	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
right	O
against	O
us	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
concluded	O
to	O
stand	O
over	O
directly	O
,	O
for	O
then	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
wind	O
fair	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
vessel	O
was	O
but	O
very	O
ill	O
fated	O
to	O
lie	O
near	O
the	O
wind	O
,	O
or	O
any	O
way	O
indeed	O
but	O
just	O
before	O
it	O
.	O

Having	O
resolved	O
upon	O
it	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
we	O
put	O
into	O
the	O
shore	O
to	O
furnish	O
ourselves	O
again	O
with	O
fresh	O
water	O
and	O
other	O
provisions	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
the	O
latter	O
end	O
of	O
March	O
,	O
with	O
more	O
courage	O
than	O
discretion	O
,	O
more	O
resolution	O
than	O
judgment	O
,	O
we	O
launched	O
for	O
the	O
main	O
coast	O
of	O
Africa	PNM
.	O

As	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
anxieties	O
about	O
it	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
but	O
a	O
view	O
of	O
reaching	O
some	O
land	O
or	O
other	O
,	O
I	O
cared	O
not	O
what	O
or	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
,	O
having	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
no	O
views	O
of	O
what	O
was	O
before	O
me	O
,	O
nor	O
much	O
thought	O
of	O
what	O
might	O
or	O
might	O
not	O
befall	O
me	O
;	O
but	O
with	O
as	O
little	O
consideration	O
as	O
any	O
one	O
can	O
be	O
supposed	O
to	O
have	O
at	O
my	O
age	O
,	O
I	O
consented	O
to	O
everything	O
that	O
was	O
proposed	O
,	O
however	O
hazardous	O
the	O
thing	O
itself	O
,	O
however	O
improbable	O
the	O

The	O
voyage	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
undertaken	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
ignorance	O
and	O
desperation	O
,	O
so	O
really	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
carried	O
on	O
with	O
much	O
resolution	O
or	O
judgment	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
knew	O
no	O
more	O
of	O
the	O
course	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
steer	O
than	O
this	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
anywhere	O
about	O
the	O
west	O
,	O
within	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
points	O
N.	O
or	O
S.	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
compass	O
with	O
us	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
brass	O
pocket	O
compass	O
,	O
which	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
had	O
more	O
by	O
accident	O
than	O
otherwise	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
very	O
exact	O
in	O
our	O
course	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
pleased	O
God	O
that	O
the	O
wind	O
continued	O
fair	O
at	O
S.E.	O
and	O
by	O
E.	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
N.W.	O
by	O
W.	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
right	O
afore	O
it	O
,	O
was	O
as	O
good	O
a	O
course	O
for	O
us	O
as	O
any	O
we	O
could	O
go	O
,	O
and	O
thus	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
.	O

The	O
voyage	O
was	O
much	O
longer	O
than	O
we	O
expected	O
;	O
our	O
vessel	O
also	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
no	O

that	O

very	O
little	O
way	O
in	O
the	O

sailed	O
heavily	O

We	O
had	O

indeed	O

no	O
great	O

in	O
this	O

eight	O

nine	O

when	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
joy	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
cried	O
out	O
``	O
Land	O
!	O
''	O

We	O
had	O
great	O
reason	O
to	O
be	O
glad	O
of	O
the	O
discovery	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
water	O
enough	O
left	O
for	O
above	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
more	O
,	O
though	O
at	O
a	O
short	O
allowance	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
early	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
when	O
we	O
discovered	O
it	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
it	O
near	O
night	O
before	O
we	O
reached	O
it	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
slackening	O
almost	O
to	O
a	O
calm	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
ship	O
being	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
a	O
very	O
dull	O
sailer	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
sadly	O
baulked	O
upon	O
our	O
coming	O
to	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
the	O
mainland	O
of	O
Africa	PNM
,	O
it	O
was	O
only	O
a	O
little	O
island	O
,	O
with	O
no	O
inhabitants	O
upon	O
it	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
none	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
find	O
;	O
nor	O
any	O
cattle	O
,	O
except	O
a	O
few	O
goats	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
killed	O
three	O
only	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
they	O
served	O
us	O
for	O
fresh	O
meat	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
very	O
good	O
water	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
fifteen	O
days	O
more	O
before	O
we	O
reached	O
the	O
main	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
at	O
last	O
we	O
arrived	O
at	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
was	O
most	O
essential	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
it	O
just	O
as	O
all	O
our	O
provisions	O
were	O
spent	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
we	O
may	O
say	O
they	O
were	O
spent	O
first	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
but	O
a	O
pint	O
of	O
water	O
a	O
day	O
to	O
each	O
man	O
for	O
the	O
last	O
two	O
days	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
joy	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
though	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
,	O
the	O
evening	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
a	O
pleasant	O
gale	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
were	O
by	O
morning	O
within	O
two	O
leagues	O
of	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

We	O
never	O
scrupled	O
going	O
ashore	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
we	O
came	O
at	O
,	O
though	O
,	O
had	O
we	O
had	O
patience	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
found	O
a	O
very	O
fine	O
river	O
a	O
little	O
farther	O
north	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
kept	O
our	O
frigate	O
on	O
float	O
by	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
two	O
great	O
poles	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
fastened	O
into	O
the	O
ground	O
to	O
moor	O
her	O
,	O
like	O
poles	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
little	O
weak	O
ropes	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
made	O
of	O
matting	O
,	O
served	O
us	O
well	O
enough	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
vessel	O
fast	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
viewed	O
the	O
country	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
got	O
fresh	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
furnished	O
ourselves	O
with	O
some	O
victuals	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
very	O
scarce	O
here	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
board	O
again	O
with	O
our	O
stores	O
.	O

All	O
we	O
got	O
for	O
provision	O
was	O
some	O
fowls	O
that	O
we	O
killed	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
wild	O
buffalo	O
or	O
bull	O
,	O
very	O
small	O
,	O
but	O
good	O
meat	O
;	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
having	O
got	O
these	O
things	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
sail	O
along	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
which	O
lay	O
N.N.E.	O
,	O
till	O
we	O
found	O
some	O
creek	O
or	O
river	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
run	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
or	O
some	O
town	O
or	O
people	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
reason	O
enough	O
to	O
know	O
the	O
place	O
was	O
inhabited	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
several	O
times	O
saw	O
fires	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
smoke	O
in	O
the	O
day	O
,	O
every	O
way	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
from	O
us	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
very	O
large	O
bay	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
it	O
several	O
little	O
creeks	O
or	O
rivers	O
emptying	O
themselves	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
ran	O
boldly	O
into	O
the	O
first	O
creek	O
we	O
came	O
at	O
;	O
where	O
,	O
seeing	O
some	O
huts	O
and	O
wild	O
people	O
about	O
them	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
we	O
ran	O
our	O
vessel	O
into	O
a	O
little	O
cove	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
creek	O
,	O
and	O
held	O
up	O
a	O
long	O
pole	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
white	O
bit	O
of	O
cloth	O
on	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
a	O
signal	O
of	O
peace	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
they	O
understood	O
us	O
presently	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
came	O
flocking	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
men	O
,	O
women	O
,	O
and	O
children	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
of	O
both	O
sexes	O
,	O
stark	O
naked	O
.	O

At	O
first	O
they	O
stood	O
wondering	O
and	O
staring	O
at	O
us	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
monsters	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
frighted	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
found	O
they	O
inclined	O
to	O
be	O
familiar	O
with	O
us	O
afterwards	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
thing	O
we	O
did	O
to	O
try	O
them	O
,	O
was	O
,	O
we	O
held	O
up	O
our	O
hands	O
to	O
our	O
mouths	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
drink	O
,	O
signifying	O
that	O
we	O
wanted	O
water	O
.	O

This	O
they	O
understood	O
presently	O
,	O
and	O
three	O
of	O
their	O
women	O
and	O
two	O
boys	O
ran	O
away	O
up	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
back	O
in	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
with	O
several	O
pots	O
,	O
made	O
of	O
earth	O
,	O
pretty	O
enough	O
,	O
and	O
baked	O
,	O
I	O
suppose	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
;	O
these	O
they	O
brought	O
us	O
full	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
them	O
down	O
near	O
the	O
sea-shore	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
left	O
them	O
,	O
going	O
back	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
fetch	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
.	O

Some	O
time	O
after	O
this	O
,	O
they	O
brought	O
us	O
roots	O
and	O
herbs	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
fruits	O
which	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
remember	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
them	O
not	O
so	O
free	O
as	O
the	O
people	O
in	O
Madagascar	PNM
were	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
our	O
cutler	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
saved	O
some	O
iron	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
wreck	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O

birds	O
,	O
dogs	O
,	O
pins	O
,	O
hooks	O
,	O
and	O

and	O
we	O
helped	O
to	O
file	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
them	O
bright	O
for	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
we	O
gave	O
them	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
,	O
they	O
brought	O
us	O
all	O
sorts	O
of	O

they	O
had	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
goats	O
,	O
hogs	O
,	O
and	O
cows	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
got	O
victuals	O
enough	O

We	O

Yet	O
,	O
fearless	O
of	O
all	O
these	O

we	O
resolved	O
to	O
adventure	O

and	O
accordingly	O
made	O
such	O
preparations	O
for	O
our	O
journey	O
as	O
the	O
place	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
would	O
allow	O
us	O

and	O
such	O
as	O
our	O
little	O
experience	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
seemed	O
to	O
dictate	O
to	O
us	O
.	O

It	O
had	O
been	O
some	O
time	O
already	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
used	O
to	O
tread	O
barefooted	O
upon	O
the	O

the	O
gravel	O

the	O
grass	O

and	O
the	O
sand	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
worst	O
thing	O
for	O
our	O
feet	O
was	O
the	O
walking	O
or	O
travelling	O
on	O
the	O
dry	O
burning	O
sands	O
,	O
within	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
provided	O
ourselves	O
with	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
shoes	O
,	O
made	O
of	O
the	O
skins	O
of	O

with	O

and	O
being	O
dried	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
the	O
outsides	O
were	O
thick	O

hard	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
last	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
called	O
them	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
the	O
term	O
very	O
proper	O
still	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
us	O
gloves	O
for	O
our	O
feet	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
them	O
very	O
convenient	O
and	O
very	O
comfortable	O
.	O

We	O
conversed	O
with	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
friendly	O
enough	O
.	O

What	O
tongue	O
they	O
spoke	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
yet	O
pretend	O
to	O
know	O

We	O
talked	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
make	O
them	O
understand	O
us	O
,	O
not	O
only	O
about	O
our	O
provisions	O
,	O
but	O
also	O
about	O
our	O
undertaking	O
,	O
and	O
asked	O
them	O
what	O
country	O
lay	O
that	O
way	O
,	O
pointing	O
west	O
with	O
our	O
hands	O
.	O

They	O
told	O
us	O
but	O
little	O
to	O
our	O
purpose	O
,	O
only	O
we	O
thought	O
,	O
by	O
all	O
their	O
discourse	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
people	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
,	O
of	O
one	O
sort	O
or	O
other	O
,	O
everywhere	O
;	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
many	O
great	O
rivers	O

many	O
lions	O
and	O
tigers	O
,	O
elephants	O
,	O
and	O
furious	O
wild	O
cats	O
-LRB-	O
which	O
in	O
the	O

we	O
found	O
to	O
be	O
civet	O

-RRB-	O
,	O
and	O
the	O

When	O
we	O
asked	O
them	O
if	O
any	O
one	O
had	O
ever	O
travelled	O
that	O
way	O
,	O
they	O
told	O
us	O
yes	O
,	O
some	O
had	O
gone	O
to	O
where	O
the	O
sun	O
sleeps	O
,	O
meaning	O
to	O
the	O
west	O

but	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
us	O
who	O
they	O
were	O

When	O
we	O
asked	O
for	O
some	O
to	O
guide	O
us	O

they	O
shrunk	O
up	O

as	O
Frenchmen	O
do	O
when	O
they	O
are	O
afraid	O
to	O
undertake	O
a	O
thing	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
asked	O
them	O
about	O
the	O
lions	O
and	O
wild	O
creatures	O
,	O
they	O
laughed	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
us	O
know	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
do	O
us	O
no	O
hurt	O
,	O
and	O
directed	O
us	O
to	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
indeed	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
to	O
make	O
some	O
fire	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
always	O
fright	O
them	O
away	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
indeed	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
.	O

Upon	O
these	O
encouragements	O
we	O
resolved	O
upon	O
our	O
journey	O
,	O
and	O
many	O
considerations	O
put	O
us	O
upon	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
had	O
the	O
thing	O
itself	O
been	O
practicable	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
to	O
blame	O
for	O
as	O
it	O
might	O
otherwise	O
be	O
supposed	O
;	O
I	O
will	O
name	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
not	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
account	O
too	O
tedious	O
.	O

First	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
perfectly	O
destitute	O
of	O
means	O
to	O
work	O
about	O
our	O
own	O
deliverance	O
any	O
other	O
way	O
;	O
we	O
were	O
on	O
shore	O
in	O
a	O
place	O
perfectly	O
remote	O
from	O
all	O
European	O
navigation	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
never	O
think	O
of	O
being	O
relieved	O
,	O
and	O
fetched	O
off	O
by	O
any	O
of	O
our	O
own	O
countrymen	O
in	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

Secondly	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
adventured	O
to	O
have	O
sailed	O
on	O
along	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Mozambique	PNM
,	O
and	O
the	O
desolate	O
shores	O
of	O
Africa	PNM
to	O
the	O
north	O
,	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
Red	O
Sea	O
,	O
all	O
we	O
could	O
hope	O
for	O
there	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
by	O
the	O
Arabs	O
,	O
and	O
be	O
sold	O
for	O
slaves	O
to	O
the	O
Turks	O
,	O
which	O
to	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
was	O
little	O
better	O
than	O
death	O
.	O

We	O
could	O
not	O
build	O
anything	O
of	O
a	O
vessel	O
that	O
would	O
carry	O
us	O
over	O
the	O
great	O
Arabian	O
Sea	O
to	O
India	PNM
,	O
nor	O
could	O
we	O
reach	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
de	PNM
Bona	PNM
Speranza	PNM
,	O
the	O
winds	O
being	O
too	O
variable	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sea	O
in	O
that	O
latitude	O
too	O
tempestuous	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
all	O
knew	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
cross	O
this	O
continent	O
of	O
land	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
reach	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
great	O
rivers	O
that	O
run	O
into	O
the	O
Atlantic	PNM
Ocean	PNM
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
banks	O
of	O
any	O
of	O
those	O
rivers	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
there	O
build	O
us	O
canoes	O
which	O
would	O
carry	O
us	O
down	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
were	O
thousands	O
of	O
miles	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
want	O
nothing	O
but	O
food	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
assured	O
we	O
might	O
kill	O
sufficient	O
with	O
our	O
guns	O
;	O
and	O
to	O
add	O
to	O
the	O
satisfaction	O
of	O
our	O
deliverance	O
,	O
we	O
concluded	O
we	O
might	O
,	O
every	O
one	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
get	O
a	O
quantity	O
of	O
gold	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
came	O
safe	O
,	O
would	O
infinitely	O
recompense	O
us	O
for	O
our	O
toil	O
.	O

I	O
can	O
not	O
say	O
that	O
in	O
all	O
our	O
consultations	O
I	O
ever	O
began	O
to	O
enter	O
into	O
the	O
weight	O
and	O
merit	O
of	O
any	O
enterprise	O
we	O
went	O
upon	O
till	O
now	O
.	O

My	O
view	O
before	O
was	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
very	O
good	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
get	O
into	O
the	O
Arabian	O
Gulf	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
Red	O
Sea	O
;	O
and	O
waiting	O
for	O
some	O
vessel	O
passing	O
or	O
repassing	O
there	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
there	O
is	O
plenty	O
,	O
have	O
seized	O
upon	O
the	O
first	O
we	O
came	O
at	O
by	O
force	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
only	O
have	O
enriched	O
ourselves	O
with	O
her	O
cargo	O
,	O
but	O
have	O
carried	O
ourselves	O
to	O
what	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
we	O
had	O
pleased	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
talk	O
to	O
me	O
of	O
a	O
march	O
of	O
2000	O
or	O
3000	O
miles	O
on	O
foot	O
,	O
of	O
wandering	O
in	O
deserts	O
among	O
lions	O
and	O
tigers	O
,	O
I	O
confess	O
my	O
blood	O
ran	O
chill	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
used	O
all	O
the	O
arguments	O
I	O
could	O
to	O
persuade	O
them	O
against	O
it	O
.	O

But	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
positive	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
might	O
as	O
well	O
have	O
held	O
my	O
tongue	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
submitted	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
them	O
I	O
would	O
keep	O
to	O
our	O
first	O
law	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
governed	O
by	O
the	O
majority	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
resolved	O
upon	O
our	O
journey	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
thing	O
we	O
did	O
was	O
to	O
take	O
an	O
observation	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
whereabouts	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
12	O
degrees	O
35	O
minutes	O
south	O
of	O
the	O
line	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
thing	O
was	O
to	O
look	O
on	O
the	O
charts	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
we	O
aimed	O
at	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
to	O
be	O
from	O
8	O
to	O
11	O
degrees	O
south	O
latitude	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
went	O
for	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Angola	PNM
,	O
or	O
in	O
12	O
to	O
29	O
degrees	O
north	O
latitude	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
made	O
for	O
the	O
river	O
Niger	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Guinea	PNM
.	O

Our	O
aim	O
was	O
for	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Angola	PNM
,	O
which	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
charts	O
we	O
had	O
,	O
lying	O
very	O
near	O
the	O
same	O
latitude	O
we	O
were	O
then	O
in	O
,	O
our	O
course	O
thither	O
was	O
due	O
west	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
assured	O
we	O
should	O
meet	O
with	O
rivers	O
,	O
we	O
doubted	O
not	O
but	O
that	O
by	O
their	O
help	O
we	O
might	O
ease	O
our	O
journey	O
,	O
especially	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
find	O
means	O
to	O
cross	O
the	O
great	O
lake	O
,	O
or	O
inland	O
sea	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
natives	O
call	O
Coalmucoa	PNM
,	O
out	O
of	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
said	O
the	O
river	O
Nile	O
has	O
its	O
source	O
or	O
beginning	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
reckoned	O
without	O
our	O
host	O
,	O
as	O
you	O
will	O
see	O
in	O
the	O
sequel	O
of	O
our	O
story	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
thing	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
consider	O
was	O
,	O
how	O
to	O
carry	O
our	O
baggage	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
first	O
of	O
all	O
determined	O
not	O
to	O
travel	O
without	O
;	O
neither	O
indeed	O
was	O
it	O
possible	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
,	O
for	O
even	O
our	O
ammunition	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
absolutely	O
necessary	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
on	O
which	O
our	O
subsistence	O
,	O
I	O
mean	O
for	O
food	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
our	O
safety	O
,	O
and	O
particularly	O
our	O
defence	O
against	O
wild	O
beasts	O
and	O
wild	O
men	O
,	O
depended	O
,	O
--	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
even	O
our	O
ammunition	O
was	O
a	O
load	O
too	O
heavy	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
carry	O
in	O
a	O
country	O
where	O
the	O
heat	O
was	O
such	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
load	O
enough	O
for	O
ourselves	O
.	O

We	O
inquired	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
beast	O
of	O
burthen	O
known	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
neither	O
horses	O
or	O
mules	O
,	O
or	O
asses	O
,	O
camels	O
,	O
or	O
dromedaries	O
;	O
the	O
only	O
creature	O
they	O
had	O
was	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
buffalo	O
,	O
or	O
tame	O
bull	O
,	O
such	O
a	O
one	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
killed	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
they	O
had	O
brought	O
so	O
to	O
their	O
hand	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
taught	O
them	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
come	O
with	O
their	O
voices	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
called	O
them	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
or	O
sent	O
them	O
from	O
them	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
made	O
them	O
carry	O
burthens	O
;	O
and	O
particularly	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
swim	O
over	O
rivers	O
and	O
lakes	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
the	O
creatures	O
swimming	O
very	O
high	O
and	O
strong	O
in	O
the	O
water	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
understood	O
nothing	O
of	O
the	O
management	O
of	O
guiding	O
such	O
a	O
creature	O
,	O
or	O
how	O
to	O
bind	O
a	O
burthen	O
upon	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
last	O
part	O
of	O
our	O
consultation	O
puzzled	O
us	O
extremely	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
I	O
proposed	O
a	O
method	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
after	O
some	O
consideration	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
very	O
convenient	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
,	O
to	O
quarrel	O
with	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
negro	O
natives	O
,	O
take	O
ten	O
or	O
twelve	O
of	O
them	O
prisoners	O
,	O
and	O
binding	O
them	O
as	O
slaves	O
,	O
cause	O
them	O
to	O
travel	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
them	O
carry	O
our	O
baggage	O
;	O
which	O
I	O
alleged	O
would	O
be	O
convenient	O
and	O
useful	O
many	O
ways	O
as	O
well	O
to	O
show	O
us	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
converse	O
with	O
other	O
natives	O
for	O
us	O
.	O

This	O
counsel	O
was	O
not	O
accepted	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
natives	O
soon	O
gave	O
them	O
reason	O
to	O
approve	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
also	O
gave	O
them	O
an	O
opportunity	O
to	O
put	O
it	O
in	O
practice	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
our	O
little	O
traffic	O
with	O
the	O
natives	O
was	O
hitherto	O
upon	O
the	O
faith	O
of	O
their	O
first	O
kindness	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
some	O
knavery	O
among	O
them	O
at	O
last	O
;	O
for	O
having	O
bought	O
some	O
cattle	O
of	O
them	O
for	O
our	O
toys	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
our	O
cutler	O
had	O
contrived	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
differing	O
with	O
his	O
chapman	O
,	O
truly	O
they	O
huffed	O
him	O
in	O
their	O
manner	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
keeping	O
the	O
things	O
he	O
had	O
offered	O
them	O
for	O
the	O
cattle	O
,	O
made	O
their	O
fellows	O
drive	O
away	O
the	O
cattle	O
before	O
his	O
face	O
,	O
and	O
laugh	O
at	O
him	O
.	O

Our	O
man	O
crying	O
out	O
loud	O
of	O
this	O
violence	O
,	O
and	O
calling	O
to	O
some	O
of	O
us	O
who	O
were	O
not	O
far	O
off	O
,	O
the	O
negro	O
he	O
was	O
dealing	O
with	O
threw	O
a	O
lance	O
at	O
him	O
,	O
which	O
came	O
so	O
true	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
with	O
great	O
agility	O
jumped	O
aside	O
,	O
and	O
held	O
up	O
his	O
hand	O
also	O
to	O
turn	O
the	O
lance	O
as	O
it	O
came	O
,	O
it	O
had	O
struck	O
through	O
his	O
body	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
it	O
wounded	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
arm	O
;	O
at	O
which	O
the	O
man	O
,	O
enraged	O
,	O
took	O
up	O
his	O
fuzee	O
,	O
and	O
shot	O
the	O
negro	O
through	O
the	O
heart	O
.	O

The	O
others	O
that	O
were	O
near	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
with	O
us	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
were	O
so	O
terribly	O
frighted	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
flash	O
of	O
fire	O
;	O
secondly	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
noise	O
;	O
and	O
thirdly	O
,	O
at	O
seeing	O
their	O
countryman	O
killed	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
stood	O
like	O
men	O
stupid	O
and	O
amazed	O
,	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
;	O
but	O
after	O
they	O
were	O
a	O
little	O
recovered	O
from	O
their	O
fright	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
at	O
a	O
good	O
distance	O
from	O
us	O
,	O
set	O
up	O
a	O
sudden	O
screaming	O
noise	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O

is	O
the	O
noise	O
they	O
make	O
when	O
they	O
go	O
to	O
fight	O
;	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
understanding	O
what	O

him	O

ran	O
together	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
he	O
was	O

and	O
we	O
not	O
knowing	O
what	O
it	O

stood	O
still	O
,	O
looking	O
upon	O
one	O

of	O

But	O
we	O

presently	O
undeceived	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
in	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
minutes	O

towns	O
;	O
nay	O
,	O
even	O
over	O
the	O
creek	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
naked	O
multitude	O
running	O
from	O
all	O
parts	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
the	O
first	O
man	O
began	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
a	O
rendezvous	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
there	O
was	O
near	O
500	O
of	O
them	O
gotten	O
together	O
,	O
armed	O
some	O
with	O
bows	O
and	O
arrows	O
,	O
but	O
most	O
with	O
lances	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
throw	O
at	O
a	O
good	O
distance	O
,	O
so	O
nicely	O
that	O
they	O
will	O
strike	O
a	O
bird	O
flying	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
but	O
a	O
very	O
little	O
time	O
for	O
consultation	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
multitude	O
was	O
increasing	O
every	O
moment	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
verily	O
believe	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
stayed	O
long	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
10,000	O
together	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
time	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
fly	O
to	O
our	O
ship	O
or	O
bark	O
,	O
where	O
indeed	O
we	O
could	O
have	O
defended	O
ourselves	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
or	O
to	O
advance	O
and	O
try	O
what	O
a	O
volley	O
or	O
two	O
of	O
small	O
shot	O
would	O
do	O
for	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
resolved	O
immediately	O
upon	O
the	O
latter	O
,	O
depending	O
upon	O
it	O
that	O
the	O
fire	O
and	O
terror	O
of	O
our	O
shot	O
would	O
soon	O
put	O
them	O
to	O
flight	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
drew	O
up	O
all	O
in	O
a	O
line	O
,	O
and	O
marched	O
boldly	O
up	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

They	O
stood	O
ready	O
to	O
meet	O
us	O
,	O
depending	O
,	O
I	O
suppose	O
,	O
to	O
destroy	O
us	O
all	O
with	O
their	O
lances	O
;	O
but	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
near	O
enough	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
throw	O
their	O
lances	O
,	O
we	O
halted	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
standing	O
at	O
a	O
good	O
distance	O
from	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
to	O
stretch	O
our	O
line	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
we	O
gave	O
them	O
a	O
salute	O
with	O
our	O
shot	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
besides	O
what	O
we	O
wounded	O
that	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
of	O
,	O
knocked	O
sixteen	O
of	O
them	O
down	O
upon	O
the	O
spot	O
,	O
and	O
three	O
more	O
were	O
so	O
lamed	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
fell	O
about	O
twenty	O
or	O
thirty	O
yards	O
from	O
them	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
fired	O
,	O
they	O
set	O
up	O
the	O
horridest	O
yell	O
,	O
or	O
howling	O
,	O
partly	O
raised	O
by	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
wounded	O
,	O
and	O
partly	O
by	O
those	O
that	O
pitied	O
and	O
condoled	O
the	O
bodies	O
they	O
saw	O
lie	O
dead	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
never	O
heard	O
anything	O
like	O
it	O
before	O
or	O
since	O
.	O

We	O
stood	O
stock	O
still	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
fired	O
,	O
to	O
load	O
our	O
guns	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
finding	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
stir	O
from	O
the	O
place	O
we	O
fired	O
among	O
them	O
again	O
;	O
we	O
killed	O
about	O
nine	O
of	O
them	O
at	O
the	O
second	O
fire	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
stand	O
so	O
thick	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
all	O
our	O
men	O
did	O
not	O
fire	O
,	O
seven	O
of	O
us	O
being	O
ordered	O
to	O
reserve	O
our	O
charge	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
advance	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
other	O
had	O
fired	O
,	O
while	O
the	O
rest	O
loaded	O
again	O
;	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
shall	O
speak	O
again	O
presently	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
fired	O
the	O
second	O
volley	O
,	O
we	O
shouted	O
as	O
loud	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
seven	O
men	O
advanced	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
coming	O
about	O
twenty	O
yards	O
nearer	O
,	O
fired	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
behind	O
having	O
loaded	O
again	O
with	O
all	O
expedition	O
,	O
followed	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
they	O
saw	O
us	O
advance	O
,	O
they	O
ran	O
screaming	O
away	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
bewitched	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
field	O
of	O
battle	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
bodies	O
lying	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
many	O
more	O
than	O
we	O
could	O
suppose	O
were	O
killed	O
or	O
wounded	O
;	O
nay	O
,	O
more	O
than	O
we	O
had	O
bullets	O
in	O
our	O
pieces	O
when	O
we	O
fired	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
what	O
to	O
make	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
at	O
length	O
we	O
found	O
how	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
frighted	O
out	O
of	O
all	O
manner	O
of	O
sense	O
;	O
nay	O
,	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
several	O
of	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
really	O
dead	O
,	O
were	O
frighted	O
to	O
death	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
no	O
wound	O
about	O
them	O
.	O

Of	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
thus	O
frighted	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
several	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
recovered	O
themselves	O
,	O
came	O
and	O
worshipped	O
us	O
-LRB-	O
taking	O
us	O
for	O
gods	O
or	O
devils	O
,	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
which	O
,	O
nor	O
did	O
it	O
much	O
matter	O
to	O
us	O
-RRB-	O
:	O
some	O
kneeling	O
,	O
some	O
throwing	O
themselves	O
flat	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
made	O
a	O
thousand	O
antic	O
gestures	O
,	O
but	O
all	O
with	O
tokens	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
profound	O
submission	O
.	O

It	O
presently	O
came	O
into	O
my	O
head	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
now	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
law	O
of	O
arms	O
,	O
take	O
as	O
many	O
prisoners	O
as	O
we	O
would	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
them	O
travel	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
carry	O
our	O
baggage	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
proposed	O
it	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
were	O
all	O
of	O
my	O
mind	O
;	O
and	O
accordingly	O
we	O
secured	O
about	O
sixty	O
lusty	O
young	O
fellows	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
them	O
know	O
they	O
must	O
go	O
with	O
us	O
;	O
which	O
they	O
seemed	O
very	O
willing	O
to	O
do	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
next	O
question	O
we	O
had	O
among	O
ourselves	O
,	O
was	O
,	O
how	O
we	O
should	O
do	O
to	O
trust	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
people	O
not	O
like	O
those	O
of	O
Madagascar	PNM
,	O
but	O
fierce	O
,	O
revengeful	O
,	O
and	O
treacherous	O
;	O
for	O
which	O
reason	O
we	O
were	O
sure	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
no	O
service	O
from	O
them	O
but	O
that	O
of	O
mere	O
slaves	O
;	O
no	O
subjection	O
that	O
would	O
continue	O
any	O
longer	O
than	O
the	O
fear	O
of	O
us	O
was	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
nor	O
any	O
labour	O
but	O
by	O
violence	O
.	O

Before	O
I	O
go	O
any	O
farther	O
,	O
I	O
must	O
hint	O
to	O
the	O
reader	O
,	O
that	O
from	O
this	O
time	O
forward	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
enter	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
seriously	O
into	O
the	O
circumstance	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
concerned	O
myself	O
more	O
in	O
the	O
conduct	O
of	O
our	O
affairs	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
my	O
comrades	O
were	O
all	O
older	O
men	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
find	O
them	O
void	O
of	O
counsel	O
,	O
or	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
now	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
presence	O
of	O
mind	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
a	O
thing	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
occasion	O
I	O
took	O
to	O
observe	O
this	O
,	O
was	O
in	O
their	O
late	O
engagement	O
with	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
had	O
taken	O
a	O
good	O
resolution	O
to	O
attack	O
them	O
and	O
fire	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
yet	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
had	O
fired	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
negroes	O
did	O
not	O
run	O
as	O
they	O
expected	O
,	O
their	O
hearts	O
began	O
to	O
fail	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
persuaded	O
,	O
if	O
their	O
bark	O
had	O
been	O
near	O
hand	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
every	O
man	O
have	O
run	O
away	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
occasion	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
take	O
upon	O
me	O
a	O
little	O
to	O
hearten	O
them	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
call	O
upon	O
them	O
to	O
load	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
give	O
them	O
another	O
volley	O
,	O
telling	O
them	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
engage	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
ruled	O
by	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
'd	O
make	O
the	O
negroes	O
run	O
fast	O
enough	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
this	O
heartened	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
fired	O
a	O
second	O
time	O
,	O
I	O
desired	O
them	O
to	O
reserve	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
shot	O
for	O
an	O
attempt	O
by	O
itself	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
mentioned	O
above	O
.	O

Having	O
fired	O
a	O
second	O
time	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
indeed	O
forced	O
to	O
command	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
may	O
call	O
it	O
.	O

``	O
Now	O
,	O
seigniors	O
,	O
''	O
said	O
I	O
,	O
``	O
let	O
us	O
give	O
them	O
a	O
cheer	O
.	O
''	O

So	O
I	O
opened	O
my	O
throat	O
,	O
and	O
shouted	O
three	O
times	O
,	O
as	O
our	O
English	O
sailors	O
do	O
on	O
like	O
occasions	O
.	O

``	O
And	O
now	O
follow	O
me	O
,	O
''	O
said	O
I	O
to	O
the	O
seven	O
that	O
had	O
not	O
fired	O
,	O
``	O
and	O
I	O
'll	O
warrant	O
you	O
we	O
will	O
make	O
work	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
''	O
and	O
so	O
it	O
proved	O
indeed	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
saw	O
us	O
coming	O
,	O
away	O
they	O
ran	O
,	O
as	O
above	O
.	O

From	O
this	O
day	O
forward	O
they	O
would	O
call	O
me	O
nothing	O
but	O
Seignior	O
Capitanio	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
called	O
seignior	O
.	O

``	O
Well	O
,	O
then	O
,	O
''	O
said	O
the	O
gunner	O
,	O
who	O
spoke	O
good	O
English	O
,	O
``	O
you	O
shall	O
be	O
called	O
Captain	O
Bob	O
;	O
''	O
and	O
so	O
they	O
gave	O
me	O
my	O
title	O
ever	O
after	O
.	O

Nothing	O
is	O
more	O
certain	O
of	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
than	O
this	O
,	O
take	O
them	O
nationally	O
or	O
personally	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
are	O
animated	O
and	O
heartened	O
up	O
by	O
anybody	O
to	O
go	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
encourage	O
them	O
by	O
example	O
,	O
they	O
will	O
behave	O
well	O
enough	O
;	O
but	O
if	O
they	O
have	O
nothing	O
but	O
their	O
own	O
measures	O
to	O
follow	O
,	O
they	O
sink	O
immediately	O
:	O
these	O
men	O
had	O
certainly	O
fled	O
from	O
a	O
parcel	O
of	O
naked	O
savages	O
,	O
though	O
even	O
by	O
flying	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
saved	O
their	O
lives	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
shouted	O
and	O
hallooed	O
,	O
and	O
rather	O
made	O
sport	O
with	O
the	O
thing	O
than	O
a	O
fight	O
,	O
to	O
keep	O
up	O
their	O
courage	O
.	O

Nor	O
was	O
there	O
less	O
need	O
of	O
it	O
upon	O
several	O
occasions	O
hereafter	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
do	O
confess	O
I	O
have	O
often	O
wondered	O
how	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
extremity	O
,	O
were	O
so	O
ill	O
supported	O
by	O
their	O
own	O
spirits	O
,	O
had	O
at	O
first	O
courage	O
to	O
propose	O
and	O
to	O
undertake	O
the	O
most	O
desperate	O
and	O
impracticable	O
attempt	O
that	O
ever	O
men	O
went	O
about	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
indeed	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
indefatigable	O
men	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
by	O
whose	O
courage	O
and	O
industry	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
were	O
upheld	O
;	O
and	O
indeed	O
those	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
were	O
the	O
managers	O
of	O
them	O
from	O
the	O
beginning	O
;	O
that	O
was	O
the	O
gunner	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
cutler	O
whom	O
I	O
call	O
the	O
artist	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
third	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
pretty	O
well	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
like	O
either	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
carpenters	O
.	O

These	O
indeed	O
were	O
the	O
life	O
and	O
soul	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
their	O
courage	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
owed	O
the	O
resolution	O
they	O
showed	O
upon	O
any	O
occasion	O
.	O

But	O
when	O
those	O
saw	O
me	O
take	O
a	O
little	O
upon	O
me	O
,	O
as	O
above	O
,	O
they	O
embraced	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
treated	O
me	O
with	O
particular	O
affection	O
ever	O
after	O
.	O

This	O
gunner	O
was	O
an	O
excellent	O
mathematician	O
,	O
a	O
good	O
scholar	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
complete	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
conversing	O
intimately	O
with	O
him	O
that	O
I	O
learned	O
afterwards	O
the	O
grounds	O
of	O
what	O
knowledge	O
I	O
have	O
since	O
had	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
sciences	O
useful	O
for	O
navigation	O
,	O
and	O
particularly	O
in	O
the	O
geographical	O
part	O
of	O
knowledge	O
.	O

Even	O
in	O
our	O
conversation	O
,	O
finding	O
me	O
eager	O
to	O
understand	O
and	O
learn	O
,	O
he	O
laid	O
the	O
foundation	O
of	O
a	O
general	O
knowledge	O
of	O
things	O
in	O
my	O
mind	O
,	O
gave	O
me	O
just	O
ideas	O
of	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
the	O
earth	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
the	O
situation	O
of	O
countries	O

the	O
course	O

the	O
doctrine	O
of	O

the	O
motion	O
of	O
the	O
stars	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
taught	O
me	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
system	O
of	O
astronomy	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
afterwards	O
improved	O
.	O

In	O
an	O
especial	O
manner	O
,	O
he	O
filled	O
my	O
head	O
with	O
aspiring	O
thoughts	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
an	O
earnest	O
desire	O
after	O
learning	O
everything	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
taught	O
me	O
;	O
convincing	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
nothing	O
could	O
qualify	O
me	O
for	O
great	O
undertakings	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
degree	O
of	O
learning	O
superior	O
to	O
what	O
was	O
usual	O
in	O
the	O
race	O
of	O
seamen	O
;	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
to	O
be	O
ignorant	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
certain	O
of	O
a	O
mean	O
station	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
knowledge	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
step	O
to	O
preferment	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
always	O
flattering	O
me	O
with	O
my	O
capacity	O
to	O
learn	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
that	O
fed	O
my	O
pride	O
,	O
yet	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
secret	O
ambition	O
,	O
which	O
just	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
fed	O
itself	O
in	O
my	O
mind	O
,	O
it	O
prompted	O
in	O
me	O
an	O
insatiable	O
thirst	O
after	O
learning	O
in	O
general	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
resolved	O
,	O
if	O
ever	O
I	O
came	O
back	O
to	O
Europe	PNM
,	O
and	O
had	O
anything	O
left	O
to	O
purchase	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
make	O
myself	O
master	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
parts	O
of	O
learning	O
needful	O
to	O
the	O
making	O
of	O
me	O
a	O
complete	O
sailor	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
just	O
to	O
myself	O
afterwards	O
as	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
when	O
I	O
had	O
an	O
opportunity	O
.	O

But	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
our	O
business	O
;	O
the	O
gunner	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
saw	O
the	O
service	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
in	O
the	O
fight	O
,	O
and	O
heard	O
my	O
proposal	O
for	O
keeping	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
prisoners	O
for	O
our	O
march	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
carrying	O
our	O
baggage	O
,	O
turns	O
to	O
me	O
before	O
them	O
all	O

``	O

says	O
he	O

``	O
I	O

you	O

So	O
,	O
in	O

we	O
all	O
agreed	O

he	O
would	O
not	O

would	O
have	O
me	O

with	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
agreeing	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
comply	O

The	O
first	O
piece	O
of	O
service	O
they	O
put	O
me	O
upon	O
in	O
this	O
new	O
command	O
was	O
as	O
difficult	O
as	O
any	O
they	O
could	O
think	O
of	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
to	O
manage	O
the	O
prisoners	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
cheerfully	O
undertook	O
,	O
as	O
you	O
shall	O
hear	O
presently	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
immediate	O
consultation	O
was	O
yet	O
of	O
more	O
consequence	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
which	O
way	O
we	O
should	O
go	O
;	O
and	O
secondly	O
,	O
how	O
to	O
furnish	O
ourselves	O
for	O
the	O
voyage	O
with	O
provisions	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
among	O
the	O
prisoners	O
one	O
tall	O
,	O
well-shaped	O
,	O
handsome	O
fellow	O
,	O
to	O
whom	O
the	O
rest	O
seemed	O
to	O
pay	O
great	O
respect	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
understood	O
afterwards	O
,	O
was	O
the	O
son	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
kings	O
;	O
his	O
father	O
was	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
killed	O
at	O
our	O
first	O
volley	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
wounded	O
with	O
a	O
shot	O
in	O
his	O
arm	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
another	O
just	O
on	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
hips	O
or	O
haunches	O
.	O

The	O
shot	O
in	O
his	O
haunch	O
being	O
in	O
a	O
fleshy	O
part	O
,	O
bled	O
much	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
was	O
half	O
dead	O
with	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
blood	O
.	O

As	O
to	O
the	O
shot	O
in	O
his	O
arm	O
,	O
it	O
had	O
broke	O
his	O
wrist	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
was	O
by	O
both	O
these	O
wounds	O
quite	O
disabled	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
once	O
going	O
to	O
turn	O
him	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
him	O
die	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
died	O
indeed	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
more	O
:	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
found	O
the	O
man	O
had	O
some	O
respect	O
showed	O
him	O
,	O
it	O
presently	O
occurred	O
to	O
my	O
thoughts	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
bring	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
useful	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
make	O
him	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
commander	O
over	O
them	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
caused	O
our	O
surgeon	O
to	O
take	O
him	O
in	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
the	O
poor	O
wretch	O
good	O
words	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
I	O
spoke	O
to	O
him	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
by	O
signs	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
him	O
understand	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
make	O
him	O
well	O
again	O
.	O

This	O
created	O
a	O
new	O
awe	O
in	O
their	O
minds	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
believing	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
kill	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
by	O
something	O
invisible	O
to	O
them	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
so	O
our	O
shot	O
was	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
could	O
make	O
them	O
well	O
again	O
too	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
the	O
young	O
prince	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
so	O
we	O
called	O
him	O
afterwards	O
-RRB-	O
called	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
something	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
we	O
know	O
not	O
,	O
but	O
immediately	O
all	O
the	O
seven	O
came	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
kneeled	O
down	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
holding	O
up	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
making	O
signs	O
of	O
entreaty	O
,	O
pointing	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
lay	O
whom	O
we	O
had	O
killed	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
before	O
I	O
or	O
any	O
of	O
us	O
could	O
understand	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
ran	O
and	O
lifted	O
up	O
a	O
dead	O
man	O
,	O
pointing	O
to	O
his	O
wound	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
in	O
his	O
eyes	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
was	O
shot	O
into	O
the	O
head	O
at	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
eyes	O
.	O

Then	O
another	O
pointed	O
to	O
the	O
surgeon	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
out	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
meaning	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
heal	O
the	O
prince	O
's	O
father	O
too	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
dead	O
,	O
being	O
shot	O
through	O
the	O
head	O
,	O
as	O
above	O
.	O

We	O
presently	O
took	O
the	O
hint	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
not	O
say	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
do	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
let	O
them	O
know	O
,	O
the	O
men	O
that	O
were	O
killed	O
were	O
those	O
that	O
had	O
first	O
fallen	O
upon	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
provoked	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
would	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
make	O
them	O
alive	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
any	O
others	O
did	O
so	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
kill	O
them	O
too	O
,	O
and	O
never	O
let	O
them	O
live	O
any	O
more	O
:	O
but	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
-LRB-	O
the	O
prince	O
-RRB-	O
would	O
be	O
willing	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
do	O
as	O
we	O
should	O
direct	O
him	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
not	O
let	O
him	O
die	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
make	O
his	O
arm	O
well	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
he	O
bid	O
his	O
men	O
go	O
and	O
fetch	O
a	O
long	O
stick	O
or	O
staff	O
,	O
and	O
lay	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
brought	O
it	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
it	O
was	O
an	O
arrow	O
;	O
he	O
took	O
it	O
with	O
his	O
left	O
hand	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
his	O
other	O
was	O
lame	O
with	O
the	O
wound	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
pointing	O
up	O
at	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
broke	O
the	O
arrow	O
in	O
two	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
the	O
point	O
against	O
his	O
breast	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
gave	O
it	O
to	O
me	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
understood	O
afterwards	O
,	O
wishing	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
whom	O
they	O
worship	O
,	O
might	O
shoot	O
him	O
into	O
the	O
breast	O
with	O
an	O
arrow	O
,	O
if	O
ever	O
he	O
failed	O
to	O
be	O
my	O
friend	O
;	O
and	O
giving	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
the	O
arrow	O
to	O
me	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
testimony	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
the	O
man	O
he	O
had	O
sworn	O
to	O
:	O
and	O
never	O
was	O
Christian	O
more	O
punctual	O
to	O
an	O
oath	O
than	O
he	O
was	O
to	O
this	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
sworn	O
servant	O
to	O
us	O
for	O
many	O
a	O
weary	O
month	O
after	O
that	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
brought	O
him	O
to	O
the	O
surgeon	O
,	O
he	O
immediately	O
dressed	O
the	O
wound	O
in	O
his	O
haunch	O
or	O
buttock	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
the	O
bullet	O
had	O
only	O
grazed	O
upon	O
the	O
flesh	O
,	O
and	O
passed	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
by	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
lodged	O
in	O
the	O
part	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
soon	O
healed	O
and	O
well	O
again	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
his	O
arm	O
,	O
he	O
found	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
bones	O
broken	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
in	O
the	O
fore-part	O
from	O
the	O
wrist	O
to	O
the	O
elbow	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
he	O
set	O
,	O
and	O
splintered	O
it	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
bound	O
his	O
arm	O
in	O
a	O
sling	O
,	O
hanging	O
it	O
about	O
his	O
neck	O
,	O
and	O
making	O
signs	O
to	O
him	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
not	O
stir	O
it	O
;	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
so	O
strict	O
an	O
observer	O
of	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
set	O
him	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
never	O
moved	O
one	O
way	O
or	O
other	O
but	O
as	O
the	O
surgeon	O
gave	O
him	O
leave	O
.	O

I	O
took	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
pains	O
to	O
acquaint	O
this	O
negro	O
what	O
we	O
intended	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
use	O
we	O
intended	O
to	O
make	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
;	O
and	O
particularly	O
to	O
teach	O
him	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
what	O
we	O
said	O
,	O
especially	O
to	O
teach	O
him	O
some	O
words	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
yes	O
and	O
no	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
they	O
meant	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
inure	O
him	O
to	O
our	O
way	O
of	O
talking	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
was	O
very	O
willing	O
and	O
apt	O
to	O
learn	O
anything	O
I	O
taught	O
him	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
easy	O
to	O
let	O
him	O
see	O
that	O
we	O
intended	O
to	O
carry	O
our	O
provision	O
with	O
us	O
from	O
the	O
first	O
day	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
us	O
to	O
tell	O
us	O
we	O
need	O
not	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
should	O
find	O
provision	O
enough	O
everywhere	O
for	O
forty	O
days	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
very	O
difficult	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
understand	O
how	O
he	O
expressed	O
forty	O
;	O
for	O
he	O
knew	O
no	O
figures	O
,	O
but	O
some	O
words	O
that	O
they	O
used	O
to	O
one	O
another	O
that	O
they	O
understood	O
it	O
by	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
one	O
of	O
the	O

by	O
his	O
order	O
,	O
laid	O
forty	O
little	O
stones	O
one	O
by	O
another	O
,	O
to	O
show	O
us	O
how	O
many	O
days	O
we	O
should	O
travel	O
,	O
and	O
find	O
provisions	O
sufficient	O
.	O

Then	O
I	O
showed	O
him	O
our	O
baggage	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
very	O
heavy	O
,	O
particularly	O
our	O
powder	O
,	O
shot	O
,	O
lead	O
,	O
iron	O
,	O
carpenters	O
'	O
tools	O
,	O
seamen	O
's	O
instruments	O
,	O
cases	O
of	O
bottles	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
lumber	O
.	O

He	O
took	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
up	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
to	O
feel	O
the	O
weight	O
,	O
and	O
shook	O
his	O
head	O
at	O
them	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
told	O
our	O
people	O
they	O
must	O
resolve	O
to	O
divide	O
their	O
things	O
into	O
small	O
parcels	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
them	O
portable	O
;	O
and	O
accordingly	O
they	O
did	O
so	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
means	O
we	O
were	O
fain	O
to	O
leave	O
all	O
our	O
chests	O
behind	O
us	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
eleven	O
in	O
number	O
.	O

Then	O
he	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
us	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
procure	O
some	O
buffaloes	O
,	O
or	O
young	O
bulls	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
called	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
carry	O
things	O
for	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
signs	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
weary	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
be	O
carried	O
too	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
we	O
slighted	O
,	O
only	O
were	O
willing	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
creatures	O
,	O
because	O
,	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
could	O
serve	O
us	O
no	O
farther	O
for	O
carriage	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
eat	O
them	O
all	O
up	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
any	O
occasion	O
for	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
carried	O
him	O
to	O
our	O
bark	O
,	O
and	O
showed	O
him	O
what	O
things	O
we	O
had	O
here	O
.	O

He	O
seemed	O
amazed	O
at	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
our	O
bark	O
,	O
having	O
never	O
seen	O
anything	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
before	O
,	O
for	O
their	O
boats	O
are	O
most	O
wretched	O
things	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
I	O
never	O
saw	O
before	O
,	O
having	O
no	O
head	O
or	O
stern	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
made	O
only	O
of	O
the	O
skins	O
of	O
goats	O
,	O
sewed	O
together	O
with	O
dried	O
guts	O
of	O
goats	O
and	O
sheep	O
,	O
and	O
done	O
over	O
with	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
slimy	O
stuff	O
like	O
rosin	O
and	O
oil	O
,	O
but	O
of	O
a	O
most	O
nauseous	O
,	O
odious	O
smell	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
are	O
poor	O
miserable	O
things	O
for	O
boats	O
,	O
the	O
worst	O
that	O
any	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
ever	O
saw	O
;	O
a	O
canoe	O
is	O
an	O
excellent	O
contrivance	O
compared	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

But	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
our	O
boat	O
.	O

We	O
carried	O
our	O
new	O
prince	O
into	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
helped	O
him	O
over	O
the	O
side	O
,	O
because	O
of	O
his	O
lameness	O
.	O

We	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
him	O
that	O
his	O
men	O
must	O
carry	O
our	O
goods	O
for	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
showed	O
him	O
what	O
we	O
had	O
;	O
he	O
answered	O
,	O
``	O
Si	O
,	O
Seignior	O
,	O
''	O
or	O
,	O
``	O
Yes	O
,	O
sir	O
''	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
taught	O
him	O
that	O
word	O
and	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
it	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
and	O
taking	O
up	O
a	O
bundle	O
,	O
he	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
when	O
his	O
arm	O
was	O
well	O
he	O
would	O
carry	O
some	O
for	O
us	O
.	O

I	O
made	O
signs	O
again	O
to	O
tell	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
make	O
his	O
men	O
carry	O
them	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
not	O
let	O
him	O
carry	O
anything	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
secured	O
all	O
the	O
prisoners	O
in	O
a	O
narrow	O
place	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
had	O
bound	O
them	O
with	O
mat	O
cords	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
up	O
stakes	O
like	O
a	O
palisado	O
round	O
them	O
;	O
so	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
carried	O
the	O
prince	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
with	O
him	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
him	O
to	O
ask	O
them	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
willing	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
us	O
to	O
the	O
country	O
of	O
lions	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
he	O
made	O
a	O
long	O
speech	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
could	O
understand	O
by	O
it	O
that	O
he	O
told	O
them	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
willing	O
,	O
they	O
must	O
say	O
,	O
``	O
Si	O
,	O
Seignior	O
,	O
''	O
telling	O
them	O
what	O
it	O
signified	O
.	O

They	O
immediately	O
answered	O
,	O
``	O
Si	O
,	O
Seignior	O
,	O
''	O
and	O
clapped	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
looking	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
the	O
prince	O
signified	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
was	O
swearing	O
to	O
be	O
faithful	O
.	O

But	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
said	O
so	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
made	O
a	O
long	O
speech	O
to	O
the	O
prince	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
it	O
we	O
perceived	O
,	O
by	O
his	O
gestures	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
very	O
antic	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
desired	O
something	O
from	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
great	O
concern	O
about	O
it	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
asked	O
him	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
they	O
desired	O
of	O
us	O
;	O
he	O
told	O
us	O
by	O
signs	O
that	O
they	O
desired	O
we	O
should	O
clap	O
our	O
hands	O
to	O
the	O
sun	O
-LRB-	O
that	O
was	O
,	O
to	O
swear	O
-RRB-	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
not	O
kill	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
give	O
them	O
chiaruck	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
bread	O
,	O
would	O
not	O
starve	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
not	O
let	O
the	O
lions	O
eat	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
we	O
would	O
promise	O
all	O
that	O
;	O
then	O
he	O
pointed	O
to	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
and	O
clapped	O
his	O
hands	O
,	O
signing	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
do	O
so	O
too	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
did	O
;	O
at	O
which	O
all	O
the	O
prisoners	O
fell	O
flat	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
rising	O
up	O
again	O
,	O
made	O
the	O
oddest	O
,	O
wildest	O
cries	O
that	O
ever	O
I	O
heard	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
in	O
my	O
life	O
that	O
ever	O
any	O
religious	O
thought	O
affected	O
me	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
refrain	O
some	O
reflections	O
,	O
and	O
almost	O
tears	O
,	O
in	O
considering	O
how	O
happy	O
it	O
was	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
born	O
among	O
such	O
creatures	O
as	O
these	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
stupidly	O
ignorant	O
and	O
barbarous	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
soon	O
went	O
off	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
troubled	O
again	O
with	O
any	O
qualms	O
of	O
that	O
sort	O
for	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
after	O
.	O

When	O
this	O
ceremony	O
was	O
over	O
,	O
our	O
concern	O
was	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
provisions	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
for	O
the	O
present	O
subsistence	O
of	O
our	O
prisoners	O
as	O
ourselves	O
;	O
and	O
making	O
signs	O
to	O
our	O
prince	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
thinking	O
upon	O
that	O
subject	O
,	O
he	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
let	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
prisoners	O
go	O
to	O
his	O
town	O
,	O
he	O
should	O
bring	O
provisions	O
,	O
and	O
should	O
bring	O
some	O
beasts	O
to	O
carry	O
our	O
baggage	O
.	O

I	O
seemed	O
loth	O
to	O
trust	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
supposing	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
run	O
away	O
,	O
he	O
made	O
great	O
signs	O
of	O
fidelity	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
his	O
own	O
hands	O
tied	O
a	O
rope	O
about	O
his	O
neck	O
,	O
offering	O
me	O
one	O
end	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
intimating	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
hang	O
him	O
if	O
the	O
man	O
did	O
not	O
come	O
again	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
consented	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
gave	O
him	O
abundance	O
of	O
instructions	O
,	O
and	O
sent	O
him	O
away	O
,	O
pointing	O
to	O
the	O
light	O
of	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
which	O
it	O
seems	O
was	O
to	O
tell	O
him	O
at	O
what	O
time	O
he	O
must	O
be	O
back	O
.	O

The	O
fellow	O
ran	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
was	O
mad	O
,	O
and	O
held	O
it	O
till	O
he	O
was	O
quite	O
out	O
of	O
sight	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
I	O
supposed	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
to	O
go	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
about	O
two	O
hours	O
before	O
the	O
time	O
appointed	O
,	O
the	O
black	O
prince	O
,	O
for	O
so	O
I	O
always	O
called	O
him	O
,	O
beckoning	O
with	O
his	O
hand	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
hallooing	O
after	O
his	O
manner	O
,	O
desired	O
me	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
did	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
pointing	O
to	O
a	O
little	O
hill	O
about	O
two	O
miles	O
off	O
,	O
I	O
saw	O
plainly	O
a	O
little	O
drove	O
of	O
cattle	O
,	O
and	O
several	O
people	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
those	O
,	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
by	O
signs	O
,	O
were	O
the	O
man	O
he	O
had	O
sent	O
,	O
and	O
several	O
more	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
cattle	O
for	O
us	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
time	O
appointed	O
,	O
he	O
came	O
quite	O
to	O
our	O
huts	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
with	O
him	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
cows	O
,	O
young	O
runts	O
,	O
about	O
sixteen	O
goats	O
,	O
and	O
four	O
young	O
bulls	O
,	O
taught	O
to	O
carry	O
burthens	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
supply	O
of	O
provisions	O
sufficient	O
;	O
as	O
for	O
bread	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
shift	O
with	O
some	O
roots	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
made	O
use	O
of	O
before	O
.	O

We	O
then	O
began	O
to	O
consider	O
of	O
making	O
some	O
large	O
bags	O
like	O
the	O
soldiers	O
'	O
knapsacks	O
,	O
for	O
their	O
men	O
to	O
carry	O
our	O
baggage	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
easy	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
goats	O
being	O
killed	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
skins	O
to	O
be	O
spread	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
as	O
dry	O
in	O
two	O
days	O
as	O
could	O
be	O
desired	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
make	O
such	O
little	O
bags	O
as	O
we	O
wanted	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
divide	O
our	O
baggage	O
into	O
them	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
black	O
prince	O
found	O
what	O
they	O
were	O
for	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
easy	O
they	O
were	O
of	O
carriage	O
when	O
we	O
put	O
them	O
on	O
,	O
he	O
smiled	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
and	O
sent	O
away	O
the	O
man	O
again	O
to	O
fetch	O
skins	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
brought	O
two	O
natives	O
more	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
all	O
loaded	O
with	O
skins	O
better	O
cured	O
than	O
ours	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
other	O
kinds	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
what	O
names	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
.	O

These	O
two	O
men	O
brought	O
the	O
black	O
prince	O
two	O
lances	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
sort	O
they	O
use	O
in	O
their	O
fights	O
,	O
but	O
finer	O
than	O
ordinary	O
,	O
being	O
made	O
of	O
black	O
smooth	O
wood	O
,	O
as	O
fine	O
as	O
ebony	O
,	O
and	O
headed	O
at	O
the	O
point	O
with	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
a	O
long	O
tooth	O
of	O
some	O
creature	O
--	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
of	O
what	O
creature	O
;	O
the	O
head	O
was	O
so	O
firm	O
put	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
tooth	O
so	O
strong	O
,	O
though	O
no	O
bigger	O
than	O
my	O
thumb	O
,	O
and	O
sharp	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
never	O
saw	O
anything	O
like	O
it	O
in	O
any	O
place	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

The	O
prince	O
would	O
not	O
take	O
them	O
till	O
I	O
gave	O
him	O
leave	O
,	O
but	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
give	O
them	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
him	O
leave	O
to	O
take	O
them	O
himself	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
saw	O
evident	O
signs	O
of	O
an	O
honourable	O
just	O
principle	O
in	O
him	O
.	O

We	O
now	O
prepared	O
for	O
our	O
march	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
prince	O
coming	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
pointing	O
towards	O
the	O
several	O
quarters	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
know	O
which	O
way	O
we	O
intended	O
to	O
go	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
showed	O
him	O
,	O
pointing	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
,	O
he	O
presently	O
let	O
me	O
know	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
river	O
a	O
little	O
further	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
carry	O
our	O
bark	O
many	O
leagues	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
due	O
west	O
.	O

I	O
presently	O
took	O
the	O
hint	O
,	O
and	O
inquired	O
for	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
understood	O
by	O
him	O
was	O
above	O
a	O
day	O
's	O
march	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
by	O
our	O
estimation	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
about	O
seven	O
leagues	O
further	O
.	O

I	O
take	O
this	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
great	O
river	O
marked	O
by	O
our	O
chart-makers	O
at	O
the	O
northmost	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Mozambique	PNM
,	O
and	O
called	O
there	O
Quilloa	PNM
.	O

Consulting	O
thus	O
with	O
ourselves	O
,	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
prince	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
prisoners	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
stow	O
in	O
our	O
frigate	O
,	O
and	O
go	O
about	O
by	O
the	O
bay	O
into	O
the	O
river	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
eight	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
with	O
our	O
arms	O
,	O
should	O
march	O
by	O
land	O
to	O
meet	O
them	O
on	O
the	O
river	O
side	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
prince	O
,	O
carrying	O
us	O
to	O
a	O
rising	O
ground	O
,	O
had	O
showed	O
us	O
the	O
river	O
very	O
plain	O
,	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
up	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
one	O
place	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
above	O
six	O
miles	O
to	O
it	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
my	O
lot	O
to	O
march	O
by	O
land	O
,	O
and	O
be	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
caravan	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
eight	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
seven-and-thirty	O
of	O
our	O
prisoners	O
,	O
without	O
any	O
baggage	O
,	O
for	O
all	O
our	O
luggage	O
was	O
yet	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

We	O
drove	O
the	O
young	O
bulls	O
with	O
us	O
;	O
nothing	O
was	O
ever	O
so	O
tame	O
,	O
so	O
willing	O
to	O
work	O
,	O
or	O
carry	O
anything	O
.	O

The	O
negroes	O
would	O
ride	O
upon	O
them	O
four	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
would	O
go	O
very	O
willingly	O
.	O

They	O
would	O
eat	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
hand	O
,	O
lick	O
our	O
feet	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
as	O
tractable	O
as	O
a	O
dog	O
.	O

We	O
drove	O
with	O
us	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
cows	O
for	O
food	O
;	O
but	O
our	O
negroes	O
knew	O
nothing	O
of	O
curing	O
the	O
flesh	O
by	O
salting	O
and	O
drying	O
it	O
till	O
we	O
showed	O
them	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
they	O
were	O
mighty	O
willing	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
any	O
salt	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
with	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
carry	O
salt	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
too	O
,	O
after	O
we	O
found	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
no	O
more	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
an	O
easy	O
march	O
to	O
the	O
river	O
side	O
for	O
us	O
that	O
went	O
by	O
land	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
came	O
thither	O
in	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
a	O
day	O
,	O
being	O
,	O
as	O
above	O
,	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
six	O
English	O
miles	O
;	O
whereas	O
it	O
was	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
five	O
days	O
before	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
us	O
by	O
water	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
in	O
the	O
bay	O
having	O
failed	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
way	O

by	O
reason	O
of	O
a	O
great	O
turn	O
or	O
reach	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
being	O
about	O
fifty	O
miles	O
about	O
.	O

We	O
spent	O
this	O
time	O
in	O
a	O
thing	O
which	O
the	O
two	O
strangers	O
,	O
which	O
brought	O
the	O
prince	O
the	O
two	O
lances	O
,	O
put	O
into	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
the	O
prisoners	O

viz.	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
bottles	O
of	O
the	O
goats	O
'	O
skins	O
to	O
carry	O
fresh	O
water	O
in	O
,	O
which	O
it	O
seems	O
they	O
knew	O
we	O
should	O
come	O
to	O
want	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
men	O
did	O
it	O
so	O
dexterously	O
,	O
having	O
dried	O
skins	O
fetched	O
them	O
by	O
those	O
two	O
men	O
,	O
that	O
before	O
our	O
vessel	O
came	O
up	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
every	O
man	O
a	O
pouch	O
like	O
a	O
bladder	O
,	O
to	O
carry	O
fresh	O
water	O
in	O
,	O
hanging	O
over	O
their	O
shoulders	O
by	O
a	O
thong	O
made	O
of	O
other	O
skins	O
,	O
about	O
three	O
inches	O
broad	O
,	O
like	O
the	O

of	O
a	O

Our	O
prince	O
,	O
to	O
assure	O
us	O
of	O
the	O
fidelity	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
in	O
this	O
march	O
,	O
had	O
ordered	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
tied	O
two	O
and	O
two	O
by	O
the	O
wrist	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
handcuff	O
prisoners	O
in	O
England	PNM
;	O
and	O
made	O
them	O
so	O
sensible	O
of	O
the	O
reasonableness	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
made	O
them	O
do	O
it	O
themselves	O
,	O
appointing	O
four	O
of	O
them	O
to	O
bind	O
the	O
rest	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
found	O
them	O
so	O
honest	O
,	O
and	O
particularly	O
so	O
obedient	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
after	O
we	O
were	O
gotten	O
a	O
little	O
further	O
off	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
country	O
,	O
we	O
set	O
them	O
at	O
liberty	O
,	O
though	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
them	O
tied	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
continued	O
so	O
a	O
good	O
while	O
.	O

All	O
the	O
country	O
on	O
the	O
bank	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
was	O
a	O
high	O
land	O
,	O
no	O
marshy	O
swampy	O
ground	O
in	O
it	O
;	O
the	O
verdure	O
good	O
,	O
and	O
abundance	O
of	O
cattle	O
feeding	O
upon	O
it	O
wherever	O
we	O
went	O
,	O
or	O
which	O
way	O
soever	O
we	O
looked	O
;	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
much	O
wood	O
indeed	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
not	O
near	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
further	O
up	O
we	O
saw	O
oak	O
,	O
cedar	O
,	O
and	O
pine-trees	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
which	O
were	O
very	O
large	O
.	O

The	O
river	O
was	O
a	O
fair	O
open	O
channel	O
,	O
about	O
as	O
broad	O
as	O
the	O
Thames	O
below	O
Gravesend	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
strong	O
tide	O
of	O
flood	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
held	O
us	O
about	O
sixty	O
miles	O
;	O
the	O
channel	O
deep	O
,	O
nor	O
did	O
we	O
find	O
any	O
want	O
of	O
water	O
for	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
merrily	O
up	O
the	O
river	O
with	O
the	O
flood	O
and	O
the	O
wind	O
blowing	O
still	O
fresh	O
at	O
E.	O
and	O
E.N.E.	O
.	O

We	O
stemmed	O
the	O
ebb	O
easily	O
also	O
,	O
especially	O
while	O
the	O
river	O
continued	O
broad	O
and	O
deep	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
past	O
the	O
swelling	O
of	O
the	O
tide	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
the	O
natural	O
current	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
to	O
go	O
against	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
too	O
strong	O
for	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
quitting	O
our	O
bark	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
prince	O
would	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
agree	O
to	O
that	O
,	O
for	O
,	O
finding	O
we	O
had	O
on	O
board	O
pretty	O
good	O
store	O
of	O
roping	O
made	O
of	O
mats	O
and	O
flags	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
described	O
before	O
,	O
he	O
ordered	O
all	O
the	O
prisoners	O
which	O
were	O
on	O
shore	O
to	O
come	O
and	O
take	O
hold	O
of	O
those	O
ropes	O
,	O
and	O
tow	O
us	O
along	O
by	O
the	O
shore	O
side	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
hoisted	O
our	O
sail	O
too	O
,	O
to	O
ease	O
them	O
,	O
the	O
men	O
ran	O
along	O
with	O
us	O
at	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
rate	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
manner	O
the	O
river	O
carried	O
us	O
up	O
,	O
by	O
our	O
computation	O
,	O
near	O
200	O
miles	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
it	O
narrowed	O
apace	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
not	O
above	O
as	O
broad	O
as	O
the	O
Thames	O
is	O
at	O
Windsor	O
,	O
or	O
thereabouts	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
after	O
another	O
day	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
great	O
waterfall	O
or	O
cataract	O
,	O
enough	O
to	O
fright	O
us	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
believe	O
the	O
whole	O
body	O
of	O
water	O
fell	O
at	O
once	O
perpendicularly	O
down	O
a	O
precipice	O
above	O
sixty	O
foot	O
high	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
noise	O
enough	O
to	O
deprive	O
men	O
of	O
their	O
hearing	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
heard	O
it	O
above	O
ten	O
miles	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
it	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
a	O
full	O
stop	O
,	O
and	O
now	O
our	O
prisoners	O
went	O
first	O
on	O
shore	O
;	O
they	O
had	O
worked	O
very	O
hard	O
and	O
very	O
cheerfully	O
,	O
relieving	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
weary	O
being	O
taken	O
into	O
the	O
bark	O
.	O

Had	O
we	O
had	O
canoes	O
or	O
any	O
boats	O
which	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
carried	O
by	O
men	O
's	O
strength	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
gone	O
two	O
hundred	O
miles	O
more	O
up	O
this	O
river	O
in	O
small	O
boats	O
,	O
but	O
our	O
great	O
boat	O
could	O
go	O
no	O
farther	O
.	O

All	O
this	O
way	O
the	O
country	O
looked	O
green	O
and	O
pleasant	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
full	O
of	O
cattle	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
people	O
we	O
saw	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
many	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
we	O
observed	O
now	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
did	O
no	O
more	O
understand	O
our	O
prisoners	O
here	O
than	O
we	O
could	O
understand	O
them	O
;	O
being	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
of	O
different	O
nations	O
and	O
of	O
different	O
speech	O

We	O
had	O
yet	O
seen	O
no	O
wild	O
beasts	O

or	O
,	O
at	O

,	O
none	O
that	O
came	O
very	O

us	O

except	O
two	O
days	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
waterfall	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
saw	O
three	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
beautiful	O
leopards	O
that	O
ever	O
were	O
seen	O
,	O
standing	O
upon	O
the	O

the	O

our	O

Our	O
gunner	O
espied	O
them	O

ran	O
to	O

The	O

shot	O
the	O

As	O

the	O

up	O
on	O

the	O

as	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
leaped	O
into	O
the	O
river	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
creature	O
killed	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
mind	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
skin	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
the	O
prince	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
send	O
some	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
over	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
skin	O
off	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
spoke	O
but	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
four	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
offered	O
themselves	O
,	O
were	O
untied	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
they	O
jumped	O
into	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
swam	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
him	O
.	O

The	O
prince	O
having	O
a	O
knife	O
that	O
we	O
gave	O
him	O
,	O
made	O
four	O
wooden	O
knives	O
so	O
clever	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
never	O
saw	O
anything	O
like	O
them	O
in	O
my	O
life	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
an	O
hour	O
's	O
time	O
they	O
brought	O
me	O
the	O
skin	O
of	O
the	O
leopard	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
monstrous	O
great	O
one	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
from	O
the	O
ears	O
to	O
the	O
tale	O
about	O
seven	O
foot	O
,	O
and	O
near	O
five	O
foot	O
broad	O
on	O
the	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
most	O
admirably	O
spotted	O
all	O
over	O
.	O

The	O
skin	O
of	O
this	O
leopard	O
I	O
brought	O
to	O
London	PNM
many	O
years	O
after	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
now	O
all	O
upon	O
a	O
level	O
as	O
to	O
our	O
travelling	O
,	O
being	O
unshipped	O
,	O
for	O
our	O
bark	O
would	O
swim	O
no	O
farther	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
was	O
too	O
heavy	O
to	O
carry	O
on	O
our	O
backs	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
went	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
farther	O
,	O
we	O
consulted	O
our	O
carpenters	O
whether	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
pull	O
the	O
bark	O
in	O
pieces	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
us	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
small	O
boats	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
with	O
.	O

They	O
told	O
us	O
we	O
might	O
do	O
so	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
very	O
long	O
a-doing	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
neither	O
pitch	O
or	O
tar	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
sound	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
water	O
out	O
,	O
or	O
nails	O
to	O
fasten	O
the	O
plank	O
.	O

But	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
could	O
come	O
at	O
any	O
large	O
tree	O
near	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
make	O
us	O
a	O
canoe	O
or	O
two	O
in	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
the	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
would	O
serve	O
us	O
as	O
well	O
for	O
all	O
the	O
uses	O
we	O
could	O
have	O
any	O
occasion	O
for	O
as	O
a	O
boat	O
;	O
and	O
such	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
any	O
waterfalls	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
take	O
them	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
carry	O
them	O
for	O
a	O
mile	O
or	O
two	O
by	O
land	O
upon	O
our	O
shoulders	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
we	O
gave	O
over	O
the	O
thoughts	O
of	O
our	O
frigate	O
,	O
and	O
hauling	O
her	O
into	O
a	O
little	O
cove	O
or	O
inlet	O
,	O
where	O
a	O
small	O
brook	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
main	O
river	O
,	O
we	O
laid	O
her	O
up	O
for	O
those	O
that	O
came	O
next	O
,	O
and	O
marched	O
forward	O
.	O

We	O
spent	O
indeed	O
two	O
days	O
dividing	O
our	O
baggage	O
,	O
and	O
loading	O
our	O
tame	O
buffaloes	O
and	O
our	O
negroes	O
.	O

Our	O
powder	O
and	O
shot	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
thing	O
we	O
were	O
most	O
careful	O
of	O
,	O
we	O
ordered	O
thus	O
:	O
--	O
First	O
,	O
the	O
powder	O
we	O
divided	O
into	O
little	O
leather	O
bags	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
bags	O
of	O
dried	O
skins	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
hair	O
inward	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
powder	O
might	O
not	O
grow	O
damp	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
put	O
those	O
bags	O
into	O
other	O
bags	O
,	O
made	O
of	O
bullocks	O
'	O
skins	O
,	O
very	O
thick	O
and	O
hard	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
hair	O
outward	O
,	O
that	O
no	O
wet	O
might	O
come	O
in	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
succeeded	O
so	O
well	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
greatest	O
rains	O
we	O
had	O
,	O
whereof	O
some	O
were	O
very	O
violent	O
and	O
very	O
long	O
,	O
we	O
always	O
kept	O
our	O
powder	O
dry	O
.	O

Besides	O
these	O
bags	O
,	O
which	O
held	O
our	O
chief	O
magazine	O
,	O
we	O
divided	O
to	O
every	O
one	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
pound	O
of	O
powder	O
,	O
and	O
half	O
a	O
pound	O
of	O
shot	O
,	O
to	O
carry	O
always	O
about	O
us	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
enough	O
for	O
our	O
present	O
use	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
were	O
willing	O
to	O
have	O
no	O
weight	O
to	O
carry	O
more	O
than	O
was	O
absolutely	O
necessary	O
,	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
heat	O
.	O

We	O
kept	O
still	O
on	O
the	O
bank	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
that	O
reason	O
had	O
but	O
very	O
little	O
communication	O
with	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
having	O
also	O
our	O
bark	O
stored	O
with	O
plenty	O
of	O
provisions	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
occasion	O
to	O
look	O
abroad	O
for	O
a	O
supply	O
;	O
but	O
now	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
march	O
on	O
foot	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
often	O
to	O
seek	O
out	O
for	O
food	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
place	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
on	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
that	O
gave	O
us	O
any	O
stop	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
negro	O
town	O
,	O
containing	O
about	O
fifty	O
huts	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
appeared	O
about	O
400	O
people	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
all	O
came	O
out	O
to	O
see	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
wonder	O
at	O
us	O
.	O

When	O
our	O
negroes	O
appeared	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
began	O
to	O
fly	O
to	O
arms	O
,	O
thinking	O
there	O
had	O
been	O
enemies	O
coming	O
upon	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
our	O
negroes	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
speak	O
their	O
language	O
,	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
them	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
weapons	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
tied	O
two	O
and	O
two	O
together	O
as	O
captives	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
people	O
behind	O
who	O
came	O
from	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
could	O
kill	O
them	O
all	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
them	O
alive	O
again	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
pleased	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
do	O
them	O
no	O
hurt	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
with	O
peace	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
understood	O
this	O
they	O
laid	O
down	O
their	O
lances	O
,	O
and	O
bows	O
and	O
arrows	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
and	O
stuck	O
twelve	O
large	O
stakes	O
in	O
the	O
ground	O
as	O
a	O
token	O
of	O
peace	O
,	O
bowing	O
themselves	O
to	O
us	O
in	O
token	O
of	O
submission	O
.	O

But	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
saw	O
white	O
men	O
with	O
beards	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
with	O
mustachios	O
,	O
they	O
ran	O
screaming	O
away	O
,	O
as	O
in	O
a	O
fright	O
.	O

We	O
kept	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
from	O
them	O
,	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
too	O
familiar	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
we	O
did	O
appear	O
it	O
was	O
but	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
of	O
us	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
.	O

But	O
our	O
prisoners	O
made	O
them	O
understand	O
that	O
we	O
required	O
some	O
provisions	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
brought	O
us	O
some	O
black	O
cattle	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
have	O
abundance	O
of	O
cows	O
and	O
buffaloes	O
all	O
over	O
that	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
as	O
also	O
great	O
numbers	O
of	O
deer	O

Our	O
cutler	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
now	O
a	O
great	O
stock	O
of	O
things	O
of	O
his	O
handiwork	O
,	O
gave	O
them	O
some	O
little	O
knick-knacks	O
,	O
as	O
plates	O
of	O
silver	O
and	O
of	O
iron	O

cut	O
diamond	O
fashion	O
,	O
and	O
cut	O
into	O
hearts	O
and	O
into	O
rings	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
mightily	O
pleased	O
.	O

They	O
also	O
brought	O
several	O
fruits	O
and	O
roots	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
,	O
but	O
our	O
negroes	O
fed	O
heartily	O
on	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
them	O
eat	O
them	O
,	O
we	O
did	O
so	O
too	O
.	O

Having	O
stocked	O
ourselves	O
here	O
with	O
flesh	O
and	O
root	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
well	O
carry	O
,	O
we	O
divided	O
the	O
burthens	O
among	O
our	O
negroes	O
,	O
appointing	O
about	O
thirty	O
to	O
forty	O
pounds	O
weight	O
to	O
a	O
man	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
thought	O
indeed	O
was	O
load	O
enough	O
in	O
a	O
hot	O
country	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
negroes	O
did	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
repine	O
at	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
would	O
sometimes	O
help	O
one	O
another	O
when	O
they	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
weary	O
,	O
which	O
did	O
happen	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
often	O
;	O
besides	O
,	O
as	O
most	O
of	O
their	O
luggage	O
was	O
our	O
provision	O
,	O
it	O
lightened	O
every	O
day	O
,	O
like	O
Aesop	O
's	O
basket	O
of	O

,	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
recruit	O

--	O
Note	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
loaded	O
them	O
we	O
untied	O
their	O
hands	O

and	O
tied	O
them	O
two	O
and	O

together	O
by	O

The	O
third	O
day	O
of	O
our	O
march	O
from	O
this	O
place	O
our	O
chief	O
carpenter	O
desired	O
us	O
to	O
halt	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
up	O
some	O
huts	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
had	O
found	O
out	O
some	O
trees	O
that	O
he	O
liked	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
to	O
make	O
us	O
some	O
canoes	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
he	O
knew	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
marching	O
enough	O
on	O
foot	O
after	O
we	O
left	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
was	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
no	O
farther	O
by	O
land	O
than	O
needs	O
must	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
no	O
sooner	O
given	O
orders	O
for	O
our	O
little	O
camp	O
,	O
and	O
given	O
leave	O
to	O
our	O
negroes	O
to	O
lay	O
down	O
their	O
loads	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
fell	O
to	O
work	O
to	O
build	O
our	O
huts	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
they	O
were	O
tied	O
as	O
above	O
,	O
yet	O
they	O
did	O
it	O
so	O
nimbly	O
as	O
surprised	O
us	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
set	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
negroes	O
quite	O
at	O
liberty	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
without	O
tying	O
them	O
,	O
having	O
the	O
prince	O
's	O
word	O
passed	O
for	O
their	O
fidelity	O
;	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
were	O
ordered	O
to	O
help	O
the	O
carpenters	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
did	O
very	O
handily	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
little	O
direction	O
,	O
and	O
others	O
were	O
sent	O
to	O
see	O
whether	O
they	O
could	O
get	O
any	O
provisions	O
near	O
hand	O
;	O
but	O
instead	O
of	O
provisions	O
,	O
three	O
of	O
them	O
came	O
in	O
with	O
two	O
bows	O
and	O
arrows	O
,	O
and	O
five	O
lances	O
.	O

They	O
could	O
not	O
easily	O
make	O
us	O
understand	O
how	O
they	O
came	O
by	O
them	O
,	O
only	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
surprised	O
some	O
negro	O
women	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
in	O
some	O
huts	O
,	O
the	O
men	O
being	O
from	O
home	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
had	O
found	O
the	O
lances	O
and	O
bows	O
in	O
the	O
huts	O
,	O
or	O
houses	O
,	O
the	O
women	O
and	O
children	O
flying	O
away	O
at	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
from	O
robbers	O
.	O

We	O
seemed	O
very	O
angry	O
at	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
the	O
prince	O
ask	O
them	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
not	O
killed	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
women	O
or	O
children	O
,	O
making	O
them	O
believe	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
killed	O
anybody	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
make	O
them	O
kill	O
themselves	O
too	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
protested	O
their	O
innocence	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
excused	O
them	O
.	O

Then	O
they	O
brought	O
us	O
the	O
bows	O
and	O
arrows	O
and	O
lances	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
at	O
a	O
motion	O
of	O
their	O
black	O
prince	O
,	O
we	O
gave	O
them	O
back	O
the	O
bows	O
and	O
arrows	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
them	O
leave	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
they	O
could	O
kill	O
for	O
food	O
;	O
and	O
here	O
we	O
gave	O
them	O
the	O
laws	O
of	O
arms	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
any	O
man	O
appeared	O
to	O

or	O
shoot	O

These	O

had	O
not	O
been	O
gone	O
out	O
above	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
hours	O
,	O
but	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
came	O
running	O
to	O
us	O
without	O
his	O
bow	O

The	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
negroes	O
rose	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
hurry	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
twos	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
,	O
ran	O
forward	O
towards	O
their	O
fellows	O
,	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
the	O
matter	O
was	O
.	O

As	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
it	O
,	O
nor	O
any	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
;	O
the	O
prince	O
looked	O
as	O
if	O
something	O
unlucky	O
had	O
fallen	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
took	O
up	O
their	O
arms	O
to	O
be	O
ready	O
on	O
occasion	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
negroes	O
soon	O
discovered	O
the	O
thing	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
saw	O
four	O
of	O
them	O
presently	O
after	O
coming	O
along	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
load	O
of	O
meat	O
upon	O
their	O
backs	O
.	O

The	O
case	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
two	O
who	O
went	O
out	O
with	O
their	O
bows	O
and	O
arrows	O
,	O
meeting	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
herd	O
of	O
deer	O
in	O
the	O
plain	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
nimble	O
as	O
to	O
shoot	O
three	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
came	O
running	O
to	O
us	O
for	O
help	O
to	O
fetch	O
them	O
away	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
venison	O
we	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
in	O
all	O
our	O
march	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
feasted	O
upon	O
it	O
very	O
plentifully	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
prevail	O
with	O
our	O
prince	O
to	O
eat	O
his	O
meat	O
dressed	O
our	O
way	O
;	O
after	O
which	O
his	O
men	O
were	O
prevailed	O
with	O
by	O
his	O
example	O
,	O
but	O
before	O
that	O
,	O
they	O
ate	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
flesh	O
they	O
had	O
quite	O
raw	O
.	O

We	O
wished	O
now	O
we	O
had	O
brought	O
some	O
bows	O
and	O
arrows	O
out	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
done	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
have	O
so	O
much	O
confidence	O
in	O
our	O
negroes	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
familiar	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
oftentimes	O
let	O
them	O
go	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
greatest	O
part	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
untied	O
,	O
being	O
well	O
assured	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
leave	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
what	O
course	O
to	O
take	O
without	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
one	O
thing	O
we	O
resolved	O
not	O
to	O
trust	O
them	O
with	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
the	O
charging	O
our	O
guns	O
:	O
but	O
they	O
always	O
believed	O
our	O
guns	O
had	O
some	O
heavenly	O
power	O
in	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
would	O
send	O
forth	O
fire	O
and	O
smoke	O
,	O
and	O
speak	O
with	O
a	O
dreadful	O
noise	O
,	O
and	O
kill	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
whenever	O
we	O
bid	O
them	O
.	O

In	O
about	O
eight	O
days	O
we	O
finished	O
three	O
canoes	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
them	O
we	O
embarked	O
our	O
white	O
men	O
and	O
our	O
baggage	O
,	O
with	O
our	O
prince	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
prisoners	O
.	O

We	O
also	O
found	O
it	O
needful	O
to	O
keep	O
some	O
of	O
ourselves	O
always	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
not	O
only	O
to	O
manage	O
the	O
negroes	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
defend	O
them	O
from	O
enemies	O
and	O
wild	O
beasts	O
.	O

Abundance	O
of	O
little	O
incidents	O
happened	O
upon	O
this	O
march	O
,	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
impossible	O
to	O
crowd	O
into	O
this	O
account	O
;	O
particularly	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
more	O
wild	O
beasts	O
now	O
than	O
we	O
did	O
before	O
,	O
some	O
elephants	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
lions	O
,	O
none	O
of	O
which	O
kinds	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
any	O
of	O
before	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
our	O
negroes	O
were	O
more	O
afraid	O
of	O
them	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
than	O
we	O
were	O
;	O
principally	O
,	O
because	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
bows	O
and	O
arrows	O
,	O
or	O
lances	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
the	O
particular	O
weapons	O
they	O
were	O
bred	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
exercise	O
of	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
cured	O
them	O
of	O
their	O
fears	O
by	O
being	O
always	O
ready	O
with	O
our	O
firearms	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
willing	O
to	O
be	O
sparing	O
of	O
our	O
powder	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
killing	O
of	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
creatures	O
now	O
was	O
no	O
advantage	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
seeing	O
their	O
skins	O
were	O
too	O
heavy	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
carry	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
flesh	O
not	O
good	O
to	O
eat	O
,	O
we	O
resolved	O
therefore	O
to	O
keep	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
pieces	O
uncharged	O
and	O
only	O
primed	O
;	O
and	O
causing	O
them	O
to	O
flash	O
in	O
the	O
pan	O
,	O
the	O
beasts	O
,	O
even	O
the	O
lions	O
themselves	O
,	O
would	O
always	O
start	O
and	O
fly	O
back	O
when	O
they	O
saw	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
march	O
off	O
.	O

We	O
passed	O
abundance	O
of	O
inhabitants	O
upon	O
this	O
upper	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
this	O
observation	O
,	O
that	O
almost	O
every	O
ten	O
miles	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
separate	O
nation	O
,	O
and	O
every	O
separate	O
nation	O
had	O
a	O
different	O
speech	O
,	O
or	O
else	O
their	O
speech	O
had	O
differing	O
dialects	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
one	O
another	O
.	O

They	O
all	O
abounded	O
in	O
cattle	O
,	O
especially	O
on	O
the	O
river-side	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
eighth	O
day	O
of	O
this	O
second	O
navigation	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
a	O
little	O
negro	O
town	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
growing	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
corn	O
like	O
rice	O
,	O
which	O
ate	O
very	O
sweet	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
got	O
some	O
of	O
it	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
very	O
good	O
cakes	O
of	O
bread	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
making	O
a	O
fire	O
,	O
baked	O
them	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
fire	O
was	O
swept	O
away	O
,	O
very	O
well	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
hitherto	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
want	O
of	O
provisions	O
of	O
any	O
kind	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
desire	O
.	O

Our	O
negroes	O
towing	O
our	O
canoes	O
,	O
we	O
travelled	O
at	O
a	O
considerable	O
rate	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
our	O
own	O
account	O
could	O
not	O
go	O
less	O
than	O
twenty	O
or	O
twenty-five	O
English	O
miles	O
a	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
river	O
continuing	O
to	O
be	O
much	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
breadth	O
and	O
very	O
deep	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
till	O
on	O
the	O
tenth	O
day	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
another	O
cataract	O
;	O
for	O
a	O
ridge	O
of	O
high	O
hills	O
crossing	O
the	O
whole	O
channel	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
the	O
water	O
came	O
tumbling	O
down	O
the	O
rocks	O
from	O
one	O
stage	O
to	O
another	O
in	O
a	O
strange	O
manner	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
continued	O
link	O
of	O
cataracts	O
from	O
one	O
to	O
another	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
a	O
cascade	O
,	O
only	O
that	O
the	O
falls	O
were	O
sometimes	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
noise	O
confused	O
and	O
frightful	O
.	O

We	O
thought	O
our	O
voyaging	O
was	O
at	O
a	O
full	O
stop	O
now	O
;	O
but	O
three	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
our	O
negroes	O
,	O
mounting	O
the	O
hills	O
another	O
way	O
,	O
to	O
view	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
fair	O
channel	O
again	O
after	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
's	O
march	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
like	O
to	O
hold	O
us	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
further	O
.	O

So	O
we	O
set	O
all	O
hands	O
to	O
work	O
,	O
unloaded	O
our	O
cargo	O
,	O
and	O
hauled	O
our	O
canoes	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
carry	O
them	O
.	O

Upon	O
examination	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
heavy	O
;	O
but	O
our	O
carpenters	O
,	O
spending	O
but	O
one	O
day	O
's	O
work	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
hewed	O
away	O
so	O
much	O
of	O
the	O
timber	O
from	O
their	O
outsides	O
as	O
reduced	O
them	O
very	O
much	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
they	O
were	O
as	O
fit	O
to	O
swim	O
as	O
before	O
.	O

When	O
this	O
was	O
done	O
,	O
ten	O
men	O
with	O
poles	O
took	O
up	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
canoes	O
and	O
made	O
nothing	O
to	O
carry	O
it	O
.	O

So	O
we	O
ordered	O
twenty	O
men	O
to	O
each	O
canoe	O
,	O
that	O
one	O
ten	O
might	O
relieve	O
the	O
other	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
we	O
carried	O
all	O
our	O
canoes	O
,	O
and	O
launched	O
them	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
fetched	O
our	O
luggage	O
and	O
loaded	O
it	O
all	O
again	O
into	O
the	O
canoes	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
in	O
an	O
afternoon	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
early	O
we	O
moved	O
forward	O
again	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
towed	O
about	O
four	O
days	O
more	O
,	O
our	O
gunner	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
our	O
pilot	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
observe	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
keep	O
our	O
right	O
course	O
so	O
exactly	O
as	O
we	O
ought	O
,	O
the	O
river	O
winding	O
away	O
a	O
little	O
towards	O
the	O
north	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
us	O
notice	O
of	O
it	O
accordingly	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
willing	O
to	O
lose	O
the	O
advantage	O
of	O
water-carriage	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
not	O
till	O
we	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
it	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
jogged	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
river	O
served	O
us	O
for	O
about	O
threescore	O
miles	O
further	O
;	O
but	O
then	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
grew	O
very	O
small	O
and	O
shallow	O
,	O
having	O
passed	O
the	O
mouths	O
of	O
several	O
little	O
brooks	O
or	O
rivulets	O
which	O
came	O
into	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
length	O
it	O
became	O
but	O
a	O
brook	O
itself	O
.	O

We	O
towed	O
up	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
ever	O
our	O
boats	O
would	O
swim	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
went	O
two	O
days	O
the	O
farther	O
--	O
having	O
been	O
about	O
twelve	O
days	O
in	O
this	O
last	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
--	O
by	O
lightening	O
the	O
boats	O
and	O
taking	O
our	O
luggage	O
out	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
made	O
the	O
negroes	O
carry	O
,	O
being	O
willing	O
to	O
ease	O
ourselves	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
;	O
but	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
these	O
two	O
days	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
water	O
enough	O
to	O
swim	O
a	O
London	O
wherry	O
.	O

We	O
now	O
set	O
forward	O
wholly	O
by	O
land	O
,	O
and	O
without	O
any	O
expectation	O
of	O
more	O
water-carriage	O
.	O

All	O
our	O
concern	O
for	O
more	O
water	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
supply	O
for	O
our	O
drinking	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
upon	O
every	O
hill	O
that	O
we	O
came	O
near	O
we	O
clambered	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
highest	O
part	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
country	O
before	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
best	O
judgment	O
we	O
could	O
which	O
way	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
lowest	O
grounds	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
near	O
some	O
stream	O
of	O
water	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
.	O

The	O
country	O
held	O
verdant	O

well	O
grown	O
with	O
trees	O

and	O
spread	O
with	O
rivers	O
and	O
brooks	O
,	O
and	O
tolerably	O
well	O
with	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
for	O
about	O
thirty	O
days	O
'	O
march	O
after	O
our	O
leaving	O
the	O
canoes	O

during	O
which	O
time	O
things	O
went	O
pretty	O
well	O
with	O
us	O

we	O
did	O
not	O
tie	O
ourselves	O
down	O
when	O
to	O
march	O
and	O
when	O
to	O
halt	O

ourselves	O

required	O

About	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
this	O
march	O
we	O
came	O
into	O
a	O
low	O
and	O
plain	O
country	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
we	O
perceived	O
a	O
greater	O
number	O
of	O
inhabitants	O
than	O
in	O
any	O
other	O
country	O
we	O
had	O
gone	O
through	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
which	O
was	O
worse	O
for	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
them	O
a	O
fierce	O
,	O
barbarous	O
,	O
treacherous	O
people	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
at	O
first	O
looked	O
upon	O
us	O
as	O
robbers	O
,	O
and	O
gathered	O
themselves	O
in	O
numbers	O
to	O
attack	O
us	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
were	O
terrified	O
at	O
them	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
discover	O
an	O
unusual	O
fear	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
our	O
black	O
prince	O
seemed	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
confusion	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
smiled	O
at	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
showing	O
him	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
guns	O
,	O
I	O
asked	O
him	O
if	O
he	O
thought	O
that	O
which	O
killed	O
the	O
spotted	O
cat	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
so	O
they	O
called	O
the	O
leopard	O
in	O
their	O
language	O
-RRB-	O
could	O
not	O
make	O
a	O
thousand	O
of	O
those	O
naked	O
creatures	O
die	O
at	O
one	O
blow	O
?	O

Then	O
he	O
laughed	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
,	O
yes	O
,	O
he	O
believed	O
it	O
would	O

``	O
Well	O

However	O

we	O
considered	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
a	O
vast	O
country	O

we	O
knew	O

to	O

Accordingly	O
the	O
two	O

had	O
gotten	O
bows	O

two	O
more	O
to	O

the	O

in	O

ten	O

the	O

next	O

all	O
stood	O

them	O

When	O
they	O
came	O
pretty	O
near	O
their	O

our	O

hallooed	O
in	O
their	O
screaming	O
way	O

called	O

Upon	O

the	O

not	O

the	O
two	O

with	O

down	O

went	O

laid	O
down	O
their	O

came	O

Our	O

all	O
the	O

of	O

to	O
them	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
think	O
of	O

putting	O
their	O

up	O

a	O
sign	O
that	O

the	O

went	O

the	O

I	O
mentioned	O

our	O

being	O
furnished	O
with	O
such	O

as	O
our	O

them	O
some	O

which	O
they	O

infinitely	O
pleased	O
with	O

promised	O
to	O

more	O

the	O
next	O
day	O

Accordingly	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
they	O
came	O
again	O

our	O

by	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
than	O
before	O

our	O

nine	O

under	O
a	O
show	O
of	O

when	O
they	O
saw	O
our	O

advance	O
almost	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
,	O
the	O
rogues	O
snatched	O
up	O
their	O
bows	O

arrows	O
and	O
came	O
running	O
upon	O
our	O
men	O
like	O
so	O
many	O
furies	O
,	O
at	O
which	O
our	O
ten	O
men	O
called	O
to	O
the	O
negroes	O
to	O
come	O
back	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
did	O
with	O
speed	O
enough	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
word	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
all	O
behind	O
our	O
men	O

As	O
they	O
fled	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
advanced	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
fly	O
near	O
a	O
hundred	O
of	O
their	O
arrows	O
at	O
them	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
two	O
of	O
our	O
negroes	O
were	O
wounded	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
we	O
thought	O
had	O
been	O
killed	O

When	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
five	O
poles	O
that	O
our	O
men	O
had	O
stuck	O
in	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
they	O
stood	O
still	O
awhile	O
,	O
and	O
gathering	O
about	O
the	O
poles	O
,	O
looked	O
at	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
handled	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
wondering	O
what	O
they	O
meant	O
.	O

We	O
then	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
drawn	O
up	O
behind	O
all	O
,	O
sent	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
number	O
to	O
our	O
ten	O
men	O
to	O
bid	O
them	O
fire	O
among	O
them	O
while	O
they	O
stood	O
so	O
thick	O

and	O
to	O
put	O
some	O

into	O

the	O

to	O
tell	O
them	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
be	O
up	O
with	O
them	O
immediately	O

Accordingly	O
they	O
made	O
ready	O
;	O
but	O
by	O
the	O
time	O
they	O
were	O
ready	O
to	O
fire	O
,	O
the	O
black	O
army	O
had	O
left	O
their	O
wandering	O
about	O
the	O
poles	O

and	O
began	O
to	O
stir	O
as	O
if	O

come	O
on	O

though	O
seeing	O
more	O
men	O

at	O

our	O

they	O
could	O
not	O

they	O

less	O
afterwards	O

for	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
ever	O
our	O
men	O
found	O
them	O
to	O
begin	O
to	O
move	O
forward	O
they	O
fired	O
among	O
the	O
thickest	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
being	O
about	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
120	O
yards	O
,	O
as	O
near	O
as	O
we	O
could	O

It	O

the	O
screaming	O
and	O
yelling	O
of	O
those	O
wretches	O
upon	O
this	O
first	O

We	O
killed	O
six	O
of	O
them	O

and	O
wounded	O
eleven	O

twelve	O

I	O
mean	O
as	O
we	O

the	O
small	O

as	O
we	O

it	O

scattered	O

we	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
we	O
wounded	O
more	O
that	O
stood	O

for	O

as	O
our	O

us	O

to	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
killed	O
and	O
wounded	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
frighted	O
creatures	O
were	O
under	O
the	O
greatest	O
amazement	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
to	O
think	O
what	O
should	O

them	O

for	O
they	O
could	O
see	O
nothing	O
but	O
holes	O
made	O
in	O
their	O
bodies	O
they	O
knew	O
not	O
how	O
.	O

Then	O
the	O
fire	O
and	O
noise	O
amazed	O
all	O
their	O
women	O
and	O
children	O
,	O
and	O
frighted	O
them	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
wits	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
ran	O
staring	O
and	O
howling	O
about	O
like	O
mad	O
creatures	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
all	O
this	O
did	O
not	O
make	O
them	O
fly	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
what	O
we	O
wanted	O
,	O
nor	O
did	O
we	O
find	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
die	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
with	O
fear	O
,	O
as	O
at	O
first	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
resolved	O
upon	O
a	O
second	O
volley	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
to	O
advance	O
as	O
we	O
did	O
before	O

Whereupon	O
our	O
reserved	O
men	O
advancing	O

we	O
resolved	O
to	O
fire	O
only	O
three	O
men	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
move	O
forward	O
like	O
an	O
army	O
firing	O
in	O
platoon	O
;	O
so	O
,	O
being	O
all	O
in	O
a	O
line	O
,	O
we	O
fired	O
,	O
first	O
three	O
on	O
the	O
right	O
,	O
then	O
three	O
on	O
the	O
left	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
on	O
;	O
and	O
every	O
time	O
we	O
killed	O
or	O
wounded	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
still	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
fly	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
frighted	O
that	O
they	O
used	O
none	O
of	O
their	O
bows	O
and	O
arrows	O
,	O
or	O
of	O
their	O
lances	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
thought	O
their	O
numbers	O
increased	O
upon	O
our	O
hands	O
,	O
particularly	O
we	O
thought	O
so	O
by	O
the	O
noise	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
called	O
to	O
our	O
men	O
to	O
halt	O
,	O
and	O
bid	O
them	O
pour	O
in	O
one	O
whole	O
volley	O
and	O
then	O
shout	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
did	O
in	O
our	O
first	O
fight	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
run	O
in	O
upon	O
them	O
and	O
knock	O
them	O
down	O
with	O
our	O
muskets	O
.	O

But	O
they	O
were	O
too	O
wise	O
for	O
that	O
too	O
,	O
for	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
fired	O
a	O
whole	O
volley	O
and	O
shouted	O
,	O
they	O
all	O
ran	O
away	O
,	O
men	O
,	O
women	O
,	O
and	O
children	O
,	O
so	O
fast	O
that	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
moments	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
see	O
one	O
creature	O
of	O
them	O
except	O
some	O
that	O
were	O
wounded	O
and	O
lame	O
,	O
who	O
lay	O
wallowing	O

screaming	O
here	O
and	O
there	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
as	O
they	O
happened	O
to	O
fall	O

Upon	O
this	O
we	O
came	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
field	O
of	O
battle	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
found	O
we	O
had	O

thirty-seven	O

them	O

among	O
which	O
were	O
three	O

a	O
cowardly	O
manner	O
in	O
cold	O
blood	O
,	O
for	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
angry	O
,	O
and	O
threatened	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
go	O
to	O
them	O
if	O
they	O
did	O
so	O
again	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
no	O
great	O
spoil	O
to	O
be	O
got	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
stark	O
naked	O
as	O
they	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
men	O
and	O
women	O
together	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
having	O
feathers	O
stuck	O
in	O
their	O
hair	O
,	O
and	O
others	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
bracelet	O
about	O
their	O
necks	O
,	O
but	O
nothing	O
else	O
;	O
but	O
our	O
negroes	O
got	O
a	O
booty	O
here	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
glad	O
of	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
bows	O
and	O
arrows	O
of	O
the	O
vanquished	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
found	O
more	O
than	O
they	O
knew	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
,	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
killed	O
and	O
wounded	O
men	O
;	O
these	O
we	O
ordered	O
them	O
to	O
pick	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
useful	O
to	O
us	O
afterwards	O
.	O

After	O
the	O
fight	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
negroes	O
had	O
gotten	O
bows	O
and	O
arrows	O
,	O
we	O
sent	O
them	O
out	O
in	O
parties	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
they	O
could	O
get	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
got	O
some	O
provisions	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
better	O
than	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
they	O
brought	O
us	O
four	O
more	O
young	O
bulls	O
,	O
or	O
buffaloes	O
,	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
brought	O
up	O
to	O
labour	O
and	O
to	O
carry	O
burthens	O
.	O

They	O
knew	O
them	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
burthens	O
they	O
had	O
carried	O
having	O
galled	O
their	O
backs	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
have	O
no	O
saddles	O
to	O
cover	O
them	O
with	O
in	O
that	O
country	O
.	O

Those	O
creatures	O
not	O
only	O
eased	O
our	O
negroes	O
,	O
but	O
gave	O
us	O
an	O
opportunity	O
to	O
carry	O
more	O
provisions	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
negroes	O
loaded	O
them	O
very	O
hard	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
with	O
flesh	O
and	O
roots	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
we	O
wanted	O
very	O
much	O
afterwards	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
town	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
very	O
little	O
young	O
leopard	O
,	O
about	O
two	O
spans	O
high	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
exceeding	O
tame	O
,	O
and	O
purred	O
like	O
a	O
cat	O
when	O
we	O
stroked	O
it	O
with	O
our	O
hands	O
,	O
being	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
suppose	O
,	O
bred	O
up	O
among	O
the	O
negroes	O
like	O
a	O
house-dog	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
our	O
black	O
prince	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
making	O
his	O
tour	O
among	O
the	O
abandoned	O
houses	O
or	O
huts	O
,	O
found	O
this	O
creature	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
making	O
much	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
giving	O
a	O
bit	O
or	O
two	O
of	O
flesh	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
the	O
creature	O
followed	O
him	O
like	O
a	O
dog	O
;	O
of	O
which	O
more	O
hereafter	O
.	O

Among	O
the	O
negroes	O
that	O
were	O
killed	O
in	O
this	O
battle	O
there	O
was	O
one	O
who	O
had	O
a	O
little	O
thin	O
bit	O
or	O
plate	O
of	O
gold	O
,	O
about	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
a	O
sixpence	O
,	O
which	O
hung	O
by	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
a	O
twisted	O
gut	O
upon	O
his	O
forehead	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
we	O
supposed	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
some	O
eminence	O
among	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
was	O
not	O
all	O
,	O
for	O
this	O
bit	O
of	O
gold	O
put	O
us	O
upon	O
searching	O
very	O
narrowly	O
if	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
more	O
of	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
had	O
thereabouts	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
found	O
none	O
at	O
all	O
.	O

From	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
for	O
about	O
fifteen	O
days	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
found	O
ourselves	O
obliged	O
to	O
march	O
up	O
a	O
high	O
ridge	O
of	O
mountains	O
,	O
frightful	O
to	O
behold	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
first	O
of	O
the	O
kind	O
that	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
no	O
guide	O
but	O
our	O
little	O
pocket-compass	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
advantage	O
of	O
information	O
as	O
to	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
best	O
or	O
the	O
worst	O
way	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
choose	O
by	O
what	O
we	O
saw	O
,	O
and	O
shift	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
.	O

We	O
met	O
with	O
several	O
nations	O
of	O
wild	O
and	O
naked	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
plain	O
country	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
those	O
hills	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
them	O
much	O
more	O
tractable	O
and	O
friendly	O
than	O
those	O
devils	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
forced	O
to	O
fight	O
with	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
we	O
could	O
learn	O
little	O
from	O
these	O
people	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
understood	O
by	O
the	O
signs	O
they	O
made	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
vast	O
desert	O
beyond	O
these	O
hills	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
our	O
negroes	O
called	O
them	O
,	O
much	O
lion	O
,	O
much	O
spotted	O
cat	O
-LRB-	O
so	O
they	O
called	O
the	O
leopard	O
-RRB-	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
signed	O
to	O
us	O
also	O
that	O
we	O
must	O
carry	O
water	O
with	O
us	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
last	O
of	O
these	O
nations	O
we	O
furnished	O
ourselves	O
with	O
as	O
much	O
provisions	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
possibly	O
carry	O
,	O
not	O
knowing	O
what	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
suffer	O
,	O
or	O
what	O
length	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
go	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
our	O
way	O
as	O
familiar	O
to	O
us	O
as	O
possible	O
,	O
I	O
proposed	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
last	O
inhabitants	O
we	O
could	O
find	O
we	O
should	O
make	O
some	O
prisoners	O
and	O
carry	O
them	O
with	O
us	O
for	O
guides	O
over	O
the	O
desert	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
assist	O
us	O
in	O
carrying	O
provision	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
in	O
getting	O
it	O
too	O
.	O

The	O
advice	O
was	O
too	O
necessary	O
to	O
be	O
slighted	O
;	O
so	O
finding	O
,	O
by	O
our	O
dumb	O
signs	O
to	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
some	O
people	O
that	O
dwelt	O
at	O
the	O
foot	O
of	O
the	O
mountains	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
desert	O
itself	O
,	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
furnish	O
ourselves	O
with	O
guides	O
by	O
fair	O
means	O
or	O
foul	O
.	O

Here	O
,	O
by	O
a	O
moderate	O
computation	O
,	O
we	O
concluded	O
ourselves	O
700	O
miles	O
from	O
the	O
sea-coast	O
where	O
we	O
began	O
.	O

Our	O
black	O
prince	O
was	O
this	O
day	O
set	O
free	O
from	O
the	O
sling	O
his	O
arm	O
hung	O
in	O
,	O
our	O
surgeon	O
having	O
perfectly	O
restored	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
showed	O
it	O
to	O
his	O
own	O
countrymen	O
quite	O
well	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
them	O
greatly	O
wonder	O
.	O

Also	O
our	O
two	O
negroes	O
began	O
to	O
recover	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
wounds	O
to	O
heal	O
apace	O
,	O
for	O
our	O
surgeon	O
was	O
very	O
skilful	O
in	O
managing	O
their	O
cure	O
.	O

Having	O
with	O
infinite	O
labour	O
mounted	O
these	O
hills	O
,	O
and	O
coming	O
to	O
a	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
beyond	O
them	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
indeed	O
enough	O
to	O
astonish	O
as	O
stout	O
a	O
heart	O
as	O
ever	O
was	O
created	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
vast	O
howling	O
wilderness	O
--	O
not	O
a	O
tree	O
,	O
a	O
river	O
,	O
or	O
a	O
green	O
thing	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
eye	O
could	O
look	O
,	O
nothing	O
but	O
a	O
scalding	O
sand	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
wind	O
blew	O
,	O
drove	O
about	O
in	O
clouds	O
enough	O
to	O
overwhelm	O
man	O
and	O
beast	O
.	O

Nor	O
could	O
we	O
see	O
any	O
end	O
of	O
it	O
either	O
before	O
us	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
our	O
way	O
,	O
or	O
to	O
the	O
right	O
hand	O
or	O
left	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
truly	O
our	O
men	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
discouraged	O
,	O
and	O
talk	O
of	O
going	O
back	O
again	O
.	O

Nor	O
could	O
we	O
indeed	O
think	O
of	O
venturing	O
over	O
such	O
a	O
horrid	O
place	O
as	O
that	O
before	O
us	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
we	O
saw	O
nothing	O
but	O
present	O
death	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
as	O
much	O
affected	O
at	O
the	O
sight	O
as	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
for	O
all	O
that	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
bear	O
the	O
thoughts	O
of	O
going	O
back	O
again	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
them	O
we	O
had	O
marched	O
700	O
miles	O
of	O
our	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
worse	O
than	O
death	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
going	O
back	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
thought	O
the	O
desert	O
was	O
not	O
passable	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
we	O
should	O
rather	O
change	O
our	O
course	O
,	O
and	O
travel	O
south	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
of	PNM
Good	PNM
Hope	PNM
,	O
or	O
north	O
to	O
the	O
country	O
that	O
lay	O
along	O
the	O
Nile	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
find	O
some	O
way	O
or	O
other	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
sea	O
;	O
for	O
sure	O
all	O
Africa	PNM
was	O
not	O
a	O
desert	O
.	O

Our	O
gunner	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
before	O
,	O
was	O
our	O
guide	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
situation	O
of	O
places	O
,	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
what	O
to	O
say	O
to	O
going	O
for	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
monstrous	O
length	O
,	O
being	O
from	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
now	O
were	O
not	O
less	O
than	O
1500	O
miles	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
by	O
his	O
account	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
come	O
a	O
third	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Angola	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
should	O
meet	O
the	O
western	O
ocean	O
,	O
and	O
find	O
ways	O
enough	O
for	O
our	O
escape	O
home	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
he	O
assured	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
showed	O
us	O
a	O
map	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
went	O
northward	O
,	O
the	O
western	O
shore	O
of	O
Africa	PNM
went	O
out	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
above	O
1000	O
miles	O
west	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
so	O
much	O
and	O
more	O
land	O
to	O
travel	O
afterwards	O
;	O
which	O
land	O
might	O
,	O
for	O
aught	O
we	O
knew	O
,	O
be	O
as	O
wild	O
,	O
barren	O
,	O
and	O
desert	O
as	O
this	O
.	O

And	O
therefore	O
,	O
upon	O
the	O
whole	O
,	O
he	O
proposed	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
attempt	O
this	O
desert	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
we	O
should	O
not	O
find	O
it	O
so	O
long	O
as	O
we	O
feared	O
;	O
and	O
however	O
,	O
he	O
proposed	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
see	O
how	O
far	O
our	O
provisions	O
would	O
carry	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
particular	O
,	O
our	O
water	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
should	O
venture	O
no	O
further	O
than	O
half	O
so	O
far	O
as	O
our	O
water	O
would	O
last	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
we	O
found	O
no	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
desert	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
come	O
safely	O
back	O
again	O
.	O

This	O
advice	O
was	O
so	O
reasonable	O
that	O
we	O
all	O
approved	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
accordingly	O
we	O
calculated	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
carry	O
provisions	O
for	O
forty-two	O
days	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
carry	O
water	O
for	O
above	O
twenty	O
days	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
suppose	O
it	O
to	O
stink	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
before	O
that	O
time	O
expired	O
.	O

So	O
that	O
we	O
concluded	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
come	O
at	O
some	O
water	O
in	O
ten	O
days	O
'	O
time	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
return	O
;	O
but	O
if	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
supply	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
then	O
travel	O
twenty-one	O
days	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
saw	O
no	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
wilderness	O
in	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
return	O
also	O
.	O

With	O
this	O
regulation	O
of	O
our	O
measures	O
,	O
we	O
descended	O
the	O
mountains	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
second	O
day	O
before	O
we	O
quite	O
reached	O
the	O
plain	O
;	O
where	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
us	O
amends	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
fine	O
little	O
rivulet	O
of	O
very	O
good	O
water	O
,	O
abundance	O
of	O
deer	O
,	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
creature	O
like	O
a	O
hare	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
so	O
nimble	O
,	O
but	O
whose	O
flesh	O
we	O
found	O
very	O
agreeable	O

But	O
we	O
were	O
deceived	O
in	O
our	O
intelligence	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
found	O
no	O
people	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
got	O
no	O
more	O
prisoners	O
to	O
assist	O
us	O
in	O
carrying	O
our	O
baggage	O

The	O
infinite	O
number	O
of	O
deer	O
and	O
other	O
creatures	O
which	O
we	O
saw	O
here	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
was	O
occasioned	O
by	O
the	O
neighbourhood	O
of	O
the	O
waste	O
or	O
desert	O
,	O
from	O
whence	O
they	O
retired	O
hither	O
for	O
food	O
and	O
refreshment	O

We	O
stored	O
ourselves	O
here	O
with	O
flesh	O
and	O
roots	O
of	O
divers	O
kinds	O
,	O
which	O
our	O
negroes	O
understood	O
better	O
than	O
we	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
served	O
us	O
for	O
bread	O
;	O
and	O
with	O
as	O
much	O
water	O
as	O

by	O

would	O
serve	O
us	O
twenty	O
days	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
loaded	O
for	O
a	O
long	O
miserable	O
march	O
,	O
we	O
set	O
forwards	O
,	O
being	O
all	O
sound	O
in	O
health	O
and	O
very	O
cheerful	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
alike	O
strong	O
for	O
so	O
great	O
a	O
fatigue	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
our	O
grievance	O
,	O
were	O
without	O
a	O
guide	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
very	O
first	O
entrance	O
of	O
the	O
waste	O
we	O
were	O
exceedingly	O
discouraged	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
sand	O
so	O
deep	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
scalded	O
our	O
feet	O
so	O
much	O
with	O
the	O
heat	O
,	O
that	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
may	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
waded	O
rather	O
than	O
walked	O
through	O
it	O
about	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
miles	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
heartily	O
tired	O
and	O
faint	O
;	O
even	O
the	O
very	O
negroes	O
laid	O
down	O
and	O
panted	O
like	O
creatures	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
pushed	O
beyond	O
their	O
strength	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
difference	O
of	O
lodging	O
greatly	O
injurious	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
we	O
always	O
made	O
us	O
huts	O
to	O
sleep	O
under	O
,	O
which	O
covered	O
us	O
from	O
the	O
night	O
air	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
particularly	O
unwholesome	O
in	O
those	O
hot	O
countries	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
had	O
here	O
no	O
shelter	O
,	O
no	O
lodging	O
,	O
after	O
so	O
hard	O
a	O
march	O
;	O
for	O
here	O
were	O
no	O
trees	O
,	O
no	O
,	O
not	O
a	O
shrub	O
near	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
still	O
more	O
frightful	O
,	O
towards	O
night	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
hear	O
the	O
wolves	O
howl	O
,	O
the	O
lions	O
bellow	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
wild	O
asses	O
braying	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
ugly	O
noises	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
we	O
reflected	O
upon	O
our	O
indiscretion	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
,	O
brought	O
poles	O
or	O
stakes	O
in	O
our	O
hands	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
palisadoed	O
ourselves	O
in	O
for	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
slept	O
secure	O
,	O
whatever	O
other	O
inconveniences	O
we	O
suffered	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
way	O
at	O
last	O
to	O
relieve	O
ourselves	O
a	O
little	O
;	O
for	O
first	O
we	O
set	O
up	O
the	O
lances	O
and	O
bows	O
we	O
had	O
,	O
and	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
bring	O
the	O
tops	O
of	O
them	O
as	O
near	O
to	O
one	O
another	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
hung	O
our	O
coats	O
on	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
us	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
sorry	O
tent	O
.	O

The	O
leopard	O
's	O
skin	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
few	O
other	O
skins	O
we	O
had	O
put	O
together	O
,	O
made	O
us	O
a	O
tolerable	O
covering	O
,	O
and	O
thus	O
we	O
laid	O
down	O
to	O
sleep	O
,	O
and	O
slept	O
very	O
heartily	O
too	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
night	O
;	O
setting	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
a	O
good	O
watch	O
,	O
being	O
two	O
of	O
our	O
own	O
men	O
with	O
their	O
fuzees	O
,	O
whom	O
we	O
relieved	O
in	O
an	O
hour	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
hours	O
afterwards	O
.	O

And	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
well	O
we	O
did	O
this	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
found	O
the	O
wilderness	O
swarmed	O
with	O
raging	O
creatures	O
of	O
all	O
kinds	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
which	O
came	O
directly	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
very	O
enclosure	O
of	O
our	O
tent	O
.	O

But	O
our	O
sentinels	O
were	O
ordered	O
not	O
to	O
alarm	O
us	O
with	O
firing	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
flash	O
in	O
the	O
pan	O
at	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
did	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
it	O
effectual	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
creatures	O
went	O
off	O
always	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
saw	O
it	O
,	O
perhaps	O
with	O
some	O
noise	O
or	O
howling	O
,	O
and	O
pursued	O
such	O
other	O
game	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
upon	O
.	O

If	O
we	O
were	O
tired	O
with	O
the	O
day	O
's	O
travel	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
as	O
much	O
tired	O
with	O
the	O
night	O
's	O
lodging	O
.	O

But	O
our	O
black	O
prince	O
told	O
us	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
he	O
would	O
give	O
us	O
some	O
counsel	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
counsel	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
us	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
all	O
killed	O
if	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
this	O
journey	O
,	O
and	O
through	O
this	O
desert	O
,	O
without	O
some	O
covering	O
for	O
us	O
at	O
night	O
;	O
so	O
he	O
advised	O
us	O
to	O
march	O
back	O
again	O
to	O
a	O
little	O
river-side	O
where	O
we	O
lay	O
the	O
night	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
stay	O
there	O
till	O
we	O
could	O
make	O
us	O
houses	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
called	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
carry	O
with	O
us	O
to	O
lodge	O
in	O
every	O
night	O
.	O

As	O
he	O
began	O
a	O
little	O
to	O
understand	O
our	O
speech	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
very	O
well	O
to	O
understand	O
his	O
signs	O
,	O
we	O
easily	O
knew	O
what	O
he	O
meant	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
there	O
make	O
mats	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
we	O
remembered	O
that	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
matting	O
or	O
bass	O
there	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
natives	O
make	O
mats	O
of	O
-RRB-	O
--	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
make	O
large	O
mats	O
there	O
for	O
covering	O
our	O
huts	O
or	O
tents	O
to	O
lodge	O
in	O
at	O
night	O
.	O

We	O
all	O
approved	O
this	O
advice	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
that	O
one	O
day	O
's	O
journey	O
,	O
resolving	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
carried	O
less	O
provisions	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
carry	O
mats	O
with	O
us	O
to	O
cover	O
us	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
.	O

Some	O
of	O
the	O
nimblest	O
of	O
us	O
got	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
river	O
with	O
more	O
ease	O
than	O
we	O
had	O
travelled	O
it	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
in	O
haste	O
,	O
the	O
rest	O
made	O
a	O
halt	O
,	O
encamped	O
another	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
us	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
.	O

In	O
our	O
return	O
of	O
this	O
day	O
's	O
journey	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
that	O
made	O
two	O
days	O
of	O
it	O
met	O
with	O
a	O
very	O
surprising	O
thing	O
,	O
that	O
gave	O
them	O
some	O
reason	O
to	O
be	O
careful	O
how	O
they	O
parted	O
company	O
again	O
.	O

The	O
case	O
was	O
this	O
:	O
--	O
The	O
second	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
before	O
they	O
had	O
gone	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
,	O
looking	O
behind	O
them	O
they	O
saw	O
a	O
vast	O
cloud	O
of	O
sand	O
or	O
dust	O
rise	O
in	O
the	O
air	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
see	O
sometimes	O
in	O
the	O
roads	O
in	O
summer	O
when	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
dusty	O
and	O
a	O
large	O
drove	O
of	O
cattle	O
are	O
coming	O
,	O
only	O
very	O
much	O
greater	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
could	O
easily	O
perceive	O
that	O
it	O
came	O
after	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
came	O
on	O
faster	O
as	O
they	O
went	O
from	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
cloud	O
of	O
sand	O
was	O
so	O
great	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
see	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
that	O
raised	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
concluded	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
some	O
army	O
of	O
enemies	O
that	O
pursued	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
then	O
considering	O
that	O
they	O
came	O
from	O
the	O
vast	O
uninhabited	O
wilderness	O
,	O
they	O
knew	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
any	O
nation	O
or	O
people	O
that	O
way	O
should	O
have	O
intelligence	O
of	O
them	O
or	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
their	O
march	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
an	O
army	O
,	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
of	O
such	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
travelling	O
that	O
way	O
by	O
accident	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
knew	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
horses	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
came	O
on	O
so	O
fast	O
,	O
they	O
concluded	O
that	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
some	O
vast	O
collection	O
of	O
wild	O
beasts	O
,	O
perhaps	O
making	O
to	O
the	O
hill	O
country	O
for	O
food	O
or	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
all	O
devoured	O
or	O
trampled	O
under	O
foot	O
by	O
their	O
multitude	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
thought	O
,	O
they	O
very	O
prudently	O
observed	O
which	O
way	O
the	O
cloud	O
seemed	O
to	O
point	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
turned	O
a	O
little	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
,	O
supposing	O
it	O
might	O
pass	O
by	O
them	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
were	O
about	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
,	O
they	O
halted	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
negroes	O
,	O
a	O
nimbler	O
fellow	O
than	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
went	O
back	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
running	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
the	O
heavy	O
sands	O
would	O
allow	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
signs	O
gave	O
them	O
to	O
know	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
herd	O
,	O
or	O
drove	O
,	O
or	O
whatever	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
called	O
,	O
of	O
vast	O
monstrous	O
elephants	O

As	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
sight	O
our	O
men	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
desirous	O
to	O
see	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
a	O
little	O
uneasy	O
at	O
the	O
danger	O
too	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
an	O
elephant	O
is	O
a	O
heavy	O
unwieldy	O
creature	O

yet	O
in	O
the	O
deep	O
sand	O

which	O
is	O
nothing	O
at	O
all	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
marched	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
rate	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
soon	O
have	O
tired	O
our	O
people	O

if	O
they	O
had	O
had	O
far	O
to	O
go	O

and	O
had	O
been	O

by	O
them	O

Our	O
gunner	O
was	O
with	O
them	O

and	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
mind	O
to	O
have	O
gone	O
close	O
up	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
outermost	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
have	O
clapped	O
his	O
piece	O
to	O
his	O
ear	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
have	O
fired	O
into	O
him	O
,	O
because	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
told	O
no	O
shot	O
would	O
penetrate	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
all	O
dissuaded	O
him	O
,	O
lest	O
upon	O
the	O
noise	O
they	O
should	O
all	O
turn	O
upon	O
and	O
pursue	O
us	O
;	O
so	O
he	O
was	O
reasoned	O
out	O
of	O
it	O

and	O
let	O
them	O
pass	O
,	O
which	O

in	O
our	O
people	O
's	O
circumstances	O
,	O
was	O
certainly	O
the	O
right	O
way	O

They	O
were	O
between	O
twenty	O
and	O
thirty	O
in	O
number	O
,	O
but	O
prodigious	O
great	O
ones	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
they	O
often	O
showed	O
our	O
men	O
that	O
they	O
saw	O
them	O
,	O
yet	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
turn	O
out	O

or	O
take	O
any	O

notice	O

we	O

We	O
that	O

our	O

this	O

We	O
were	O
now	O
upon	O
our	O
work	O

and	O
our	O
black	O
prince	O
was	O
head	O

for	O
he	O
was	O
an	O
excellent	O
mat-maker	O
himself	O

and	O
all	O
his	O

understood	O
it	O

so	O
that	O
they	O
soon	O
made	O
us	O

a	O

as	O
every	O

we	O
did	O
not	O
carry	O
an	O

The	O
greatest	O
burthen	O
was	O
to	O
carry	O
six	O
long	O
poles	O
,	O
besides	O
some	O
shorter	O

but	O
the	O

made	O
an	O
advantage	O

for	O

upon	O
two	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
saw	O
this	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
a	O
little	O
advantage	O
of	O
it	O
too	O
;	O
for	O
having	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
bags	O

I	O

to	O

-RRB-	O
,	O
more	O
than	O
the	O
men	O
could	O
carry	O
,	O
we	O
got	O
them	O
filled	O

carried	O
them	O
this	O

which	O
was	O
a	O

more	O

for	O

Having	O
now	O
ended	O
our	O

made	O
our	O
mats	O

and	O
fully	O

our	O

eight	O

in	O

upon	O
this	O

To	O
our	O
great	O
comfort	O
,	O
the	O
night	O
before	O
we	O
set	O
out	O
there	O
fell	O
a	O
very	O
violent	O
shower	O
of	O
rain	O
,	O
the	O
effects	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
sand	O
;	O
though	O
the	O
heat	O
of	O
one	O
day	O
dried	O
the	O
surface	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
was	O
harder	O
at	O
bottom	O
,	O
not	O
so	O
heavy	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
cooler	O
to	O
our	O
feet	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
means	O
we	O
marched	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
reckoned	O
,	O
about	O
fourteen	O
miles	O
instead	O
of	O
seven	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
much	O
more	O
ease	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
encamp	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
all	O
things	O
ready	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
fitted	O
our	O
tent	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
it	O
up	O
for	O
trial	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
made	O
it	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
large	O
tent	O
raised	O
,	O
with	O
an	O
inner	O
and	O
outer	O
apartment	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
entrances	O
.	O

In	O
one	O
we	O
lay	O
ourselves	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
other	O
our	O
negroes	O
,	O
having	O
light	O
pleasant	O
mats	O
over	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
others	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
under	O
us	O
.	O

Also	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
little	O
place	O
without	O
all	O
for	O
our	O
buffaloes	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
deserved	O
our	O
care	O
,	O
being	O
very	O
useful	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
besides	O
carrying	O
forage	O
and	O
water	O
for	O
themselves	O
.	O

Their	O
forage	O
was	O
a	O
root	O
,	O
which	O
our	O
black	O
prince	O
directed	O
us	O
to	O
find	O
,	O
not	O
much	O
unlike	O
a	O
parsnip	O
,	O
very	O
moist	O
and	O
nourishing	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
there	O
was	O
plenty	O
wherever	O
we	O
came	O
,	O
this	O
horrid	O
desert	O
excepted	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
to	O
decamp	O
,	O
our	O
negroes	O
took	O
down	O
the	O
tent	O
,	O
and	O
pulled	O
up	O
the	O
stakes	O
;	O
and	O
all	O
was	O
in	O
motion	O
in	O
as	O
little	O
time	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
set	O
up	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
posture	O
we	O
marched	O
eight	O
days	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
could	O
see	O
no	O
end	O
,	O
no	O
change	O
of	O
our	O
prospect	O
,	O
but	O
all	O
looking	O
as	O
wild	O
and	O
dismal	O
as	O
at	O
the	O
beginning	O
.	O

If	O
there	O
was	O
any	O
alteration	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
that	O
the	O
sand	O
was	O
nowhere	O
so	O
deep	O
and	O
heavy	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
three	O
days	O
.	O

This	O
we	O
thought	O
might	O
be	O
because	O
,	O
for	O
six	O
months	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
the	O
winds	O
blowing	O
west	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
for	O
the	O
other	O
six	O
they	O
blow	O
constantly	O
east	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
the	O
sand	O
was	O
driven	O
violently	O
to	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
desert	O
where	O
we	O
set	O
out	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
mountains	O
lying	O
very	O
high	O
,	O
the	O
easterly	O
monsoons	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
blew	O
,	O
had	O
not	O
the	O
same	O
power	O
to	O
drive	O
it	O
back	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
confirmed	O
by	O
our	O
finding	O
the	O
like	O
depth	O
of	O
sand	O
on	O
the	O
farthest	O
extent	O
of	O
the	O
desert	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
ninth	O
day	O
of	O
our	O
travel	O
in	O
this	O
wilderness	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
view	O
of	O
a	O
great	O
lake	O
of	O
water	O
;	O
and	O
you	O
may	O
be	O
sure	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
particular	O
satisfaction	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
water	O
left	O
for	O
above	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
more	O
,	O
at	O
our	O
shortest	O
allowance	O
;	O
I	O
mean	O
allowing	O
water	O
for	O
our	O
return	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
driven	O
to	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

Our	O
water	O
had	O
served	O
us	O
two	O
days	O
longer	O
than	O
expected	O
,	O
our	O
buffaloes	O
having	O
found	O
,	O
for	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
,	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
herb	O
like	O
a	O
broad	O
flat	O
thistle	O
,	O
though	O
without	O
any	O
prickle	O
,	O
spreading	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
growing	O
in	O
the	O
sand	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
ate	O
freely	O
of	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
supplied	O
them	O
for	O
drink	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
forage	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
tenth	O
from	O
our	O
setting	O
out	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
edge	O
of	O
this	O
lake	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
very	O
happily	O
for	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
it	O
at	O
the	O
south	O
point	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
no	O
end	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
passed	O
by	O
it	O
and	O
travelled	O
three	O
days	O
by	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
comfort	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
lightened	O
our	O
burthen	O
,	O
there	O
being	O
no	O
need	O
to	O
carry	O
water	O
when	O
we	O
had	O
it	O
in	O
view	O
.	O

And	O
yet	O
,	O
though	O
here	O
was	O
so	O
much	O
water	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
but	O
very	O
little	O
alteration	O
in	O
the	O
desert	O
;	O
no	O
trees	O
,	O
no	O
grass	O
or	O
herbage	O
,	O
except	O
that	O
thistle	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
called	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
more	O
plants	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
the	O
desert	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
pretty	O
full	O
.	O

But	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
refreshed	O
with	O
the	O
neighbourhood	O
of	O
this	O
lake	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
gotten	O
among	O
a	O
prodigious	O
number	O
of	O
ravenous	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
the	O
like	O
whereof	O

it	O
is	O
most	O
certain	O

the	O
eye	O
of	O
man	O
never	O

for	O
as	O
I	O
firmly	O
believe	O
that	O
never	O
man	O
nor	O
body	O
of	O
men	O
passed	O
this	O
desert	O
since	O
the	O
flood	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
believe	O
there	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
like	O
collection	O
of	O
fierce	O
,	O
ravenous	O
,	O
and	O
devouring	O
creatures	O
in	O
the	O

;	O
I	O
mean	O
not	O
in	O
any	O

For	O
a	O
day	O
's	O
journey	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
this	O
lake	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
three	O
days	O
we	O
were	O
passing	O
by	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
days	O
'	O
march	O
after	O
it	O
,	O
the	O
ground	O
was	O
scattered	O
with	O
elephants	O
'	O
teeth	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
number	O
as	O
is	O
incredible	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
have	O
lain	O
there	O
for	O
some	O
hundreds	O
of	O
years	O
,	O
so	O
,	O
seeing	O
the	O

them	O
scarce	O

The	O
size	O
of	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
is	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
to	O
those	O
to	O
whom	O
I	O
have	O
reported	O
it	O

as	O
incredible	O
as	O
the	O
number	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
can	O
assure	O
you	O
there	O
were	O
several	O
so	O
heavy	O
as	O
the	O
strongest	O
man	O
among	O
us	O
could	O

As	O
to	O
number	O
,	O
I	O
question	O
not	O
but	O
there	O
are	O
enough	O
to	O
load	O
a	O
thousand	O
sail	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O
ships	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
I	O
may	O
be	O
understood	O
to	O
mean	O
that	O
the	O
quantity	O
is	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
conceived	O
of	O
;	O
seeing	O
that	O
as	O
they	O
lasted	O
in	O
view	O
for	O
above	O
eighty	O
miles	O
'	O
travelling	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
might	O
continue	O
as	O
far	O
to	O
the	O
right	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
left	O
as	O

and	O
many	O
times	O
as	O

for	O
aught	O
we	O

for	O
it	O
seems	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
elephants	O
hereabouts	O
is	O
prodigiously	O
great	O
.	O

In	O
one	O
place	O
in	O
particular	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
an	O
elephant	O
,	O
with	O
several	O
teeth	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O
that	O
ever	O
I	O
saw	O
;	O
the	O
flesh	O
was	O
consumed	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
many	O
hundred	O
years	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
other	O
bones	O
;	O
but	O
three	O
of	O
our	O
strongest	O
men	O
could	O
not	O
lift	O
this	O
skull	O
and	O
teeth	O
;	O
the	O
great	O
tooth	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
,	O
weighed	O
at	O
least	O
three	O
hundredweight	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
particularly	O
remarkable	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
observed	O
the	O
whole	O
skull	O
was	O
as	O
good	O
ivory	O
as	O
the	O
teeth	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
,	O
altogether	O
weighed	O
at	O
least	O
six	O
hundredweight	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
know	O
but	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
same	O
rule	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
bones	O
of	O
the	O
elephant	O
may	O
be	O
ivory	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
think	O
there	O
is	O
this	O
just	O
objection	O
against	O
it	O
from	O
the	O
example	O
before	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
then	O
all	O
the	O
other	O
bones	O
of	O
this	O
elephant	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
there	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
head	O
.	O

I	O
proposed	O
to	O
our	O
gunner	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
seeing	O
we	O
had	O
travelled	O
now	O
fourteen	O
days	O
without	O
intermission	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
water	O
here	O
for	O
our	O
refreshment	O
,	O
and	O
no	O
want	O
of	O
food	O
yet	O
,	O
nor	O
any	O
fear	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
rest	O
our	O
people	O
a	O
little	O

and	O
see	O
,	O
at	O
the	O

time	O

if	O
perhaps	O
we	O
might	O
kill	O
some	O
creatures	O
that	O
were	O
proper	O
for	O
food	O

The	O
gunner	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
more	O
forecast	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
than	O
I	O
had	O
,	O
agreed	O
to	O
the	O
proposal	O
,	O
and	O
added	O
,	O
why	O
might	O
we	O
not	O
try	O
to	O
catch	O
some	O
fish	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
lake	O
?	O

The	O
first	O
thing	O
we	O
had	O
before	O
us	O
was	O
to	O
try	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
make	O
any	O
hooks	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
indeed	O
put	O
our	O
artificer	O
to	O
his	O
trumps	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
labour	O
and	O
difficulty	O
,	O
he	O
did	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
catched	O
fresh	O
fish	O
of	O
several	O
kinds	O
.	O

How	O
they	O
came	O
there	O
,	O
none	O
but	O
He	O
that	O
made	O
the	O
lake	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
world	O
knows	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
no	O
human	O
hands	O
ever	O
put	O
any	O
in	O
there	O
,	O
or	O
pulled	O
any	O
out	O
before	O
.	O

We	O
not	O
only	O
catched	O
enough	O
for	O
our	O
present	O
refreshment	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
dried	O
several	O
large	O
fishes	O
,	O
of	O
kinds	O
which	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
describe	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
we	O
lengthened	O
out	O
our	O
provision	O
considerably	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
heat	O
of	O
the	O
sun	O
dried	O
them	O
so	O
effectually	O
without	O
salt	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
perfectly	O
cured	O
,	O
dry	O
,	O
and	O
hard	O
,	O
in	O
one	O
day	O
's	O
time	O
.	O

We	O
rested	O
ourselves	O
here	O
five	O
days	O
;	O
during	O
which	O
time	O
we	O
had	O
abundance	O
of	O
pleasant	O
adventures	O
with	O
the	O
wild	O
creatures	O
,	O
too	O
many	O
to	O
relate	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
very	O
particular	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
chase	O
between	O
a	O
she-lion	O
,	O
or	O
lioness	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
large	O
deer	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
the	O
deer	O
is	O
naturally	O
a	O
very	O
nimble	O
creature	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
flew	O
by	O
us	O
like	O
the	O
wind	O
,	O
having	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
about	O
300	O
yards	O
the	O
start	O
of	O
the	O
lion	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
lion	O
,	O
by	O
her	O
strength	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
goodness	O
of	O
her	O
lungs	O
,	O
got	O
ground	O
of	O
her	O
.	O

They	O
passed	O
by	O
us	O
within	O
about	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
view	O
of	O
them	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
having	O
given	O
them	O
over	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
surprised	O
,	O
about	O
an	O
hour	O
after	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
them	O
come	O
thundering	O
back	O
again	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
lion	O
was	O
within	O
thirty	O
or	O
forty	O
yards	O
of	O
her	O
;	O
and	O
both	O
straining	O
to	O
the	O
extremity	O
of	O
their	O
speed	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
deer	O
,	O
coming	O
to	O
the	O
lake	O
,	O
plunged	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
swam	O
for	O
her	O
life	O
,	O
as	O
she	O
had	O
before	O
run	O
for	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
lioness	O
plunged	O
in	O
after	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
swam	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
,	O
but	O
came	O
back	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
she	O
was	O
got	O
upon	O
the	O
land	O
she	O
set	O
up	O
the	O
most	O
hideous	O
roar	O
that	O
ever	O
I	O
heard	O
in	O
my	O
life	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
done	O
in	O
the	O
rage	O
of	O
having	O
lost	O
her	O
prey	O
.	O

We	O
walked	O
out	O
morning	O
and	O
evening	O
constantly	O
;	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
we	O
refreshed	O
ourselves	O
under	O
our	O
tent	O
.	O

But	O
one	O
morning	O
early	O
we	O
saw	O
another	O
chase	O
,	O
which	O
more	O
nearly	O
concerned	O
us	O
than	O
the	O
other	O
;	O
for	O
our	O
black	O
prince	O
,	O
walking	O
by	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
lake	O
,	O
was	O
set	O
upon	O
by	O
a	O
vast	O
,	O
great	O
crocodile	O
,	O
which	O
came	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
lake	O
upon	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
he	O
was	O
very	O
light	O
of	O
foot	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
was	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
he	O
could	O
do	O
to	O
get	O
away	O
.	O

He	O
fled	O
amain	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
truth	O
is	O
,	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
told	O
no	O
bullet	O
would	O
enter	O
her	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
so	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
for	O
though	O
three	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
fired	O
at	O
her	O
,	O
yet	O
she	O
did	O
not	O
mind	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
my	O
friend	O
the	O
gunner	O
,	O
a	O
venturous	O
fellow	O
,	O
of	O
a	O
bold	O
heart	O
,	O
and	O
great	O
presence	O
of	O
mind	O
,	O
went	O
up	O
so	O
near	O
as	O
to	O
thrust	O
the	O
muzzle	O
of	O
his	O
piece	O
into	O
her	O
mouth	O
,	O
and	O
fired	O
,	O
but	O
let	O
his	O
piece	O
fall	O
,	O
and	O
ran	O
for	O
it	O
the	O
very	O
moment	O
he	O
had	O
fired	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
creature	O
raged	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
,	O
and	O
spent	O
its	O
fury	O
upon	O
the	O
gun	O
,	O
making	O
marks	O
upon	O
the	O
very	O
iron	O
with	O
its	O
teeth	O
,	O
but	O
after	O
some	O
time	O
fainted	O
and	O
died	O
.	O

Our	O
negroes	O
spread	O
the	O
banks	O
of	O
the	O
lake	O
all	O
this	O
while	O
for	O
game	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
length	O
killed	O
us	O
three	O
deer	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
very	O
large	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
very	O
small	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
water-fowl	O
also	O
in	O
the	O
lake	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
never	O
came	O
near	O
enough	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
shoot	O
any	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
for	O
the	O
desert	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
no	O
fowls	O
anywhere	O
in	O
it	O
but	O
at	O
the	O
lake	O
.	O

We	O
likewise	O
killed	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
civet	O
cats	O
;	O
but	O
their	O
flesh	O
is	O
the	O
worst	O
of	O
carrion	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
abundance	O
of	O
elephants	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
observed	O
they	O
always	O
go	O
in	O
very	O
good	O
company	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
abundance	O
of	O
them	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
always	O
extended	O
in	O
a	O
fair	O
line	O
of	O
battle	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
,	O
they	O
say	O
,	O
is	O
the	O
way	O
they	O
defend	O
themselves	O
from	O
their	O
enemies	O
;	O
for	O
if	O
lions	O
or	O
tigers	O
,	O
wolves	O
or	O
any	O
creatures	O
,	O
attack	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
being	O
drawn	O
in	O
a	O
line	O
,	O
sometimes	O
reaching	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
miles	O
in	O
length	O
,	O
whatever	O
comes	O
in	O
their	O
way	O
is	O
sure	O
to	O
be	O
trod	O
under	O
foot	O
,	O
or	O
beaten	O
in	O
pieces	O
with	O
their	O
trunks	O
,	O
or	O
lifted	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
air	O
with	O
their	O
trunks	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
if	O
a	O
hundred	O
lions	O
or	O
tigers	O
were	O
coming	O
along	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
meet	O
a	O
line	O
of	O
elephants	O
,	O
they	O
will	O
always	O
fly	O
back	O
till	O
they	O
see	O
room	O
to	O
pass	O
by	O
the	O
right	O
hand	O
or	O
the	O
left	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
impossible	O
for	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
to	O
escape	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
elephant	O
,	O
though	O
a	O
heavy	O
creature	O
,	O
is	O
yet	O
so	O
dexterous	O
and	O
nimble	O
with	O
his	O
trunk	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
will	O
not	O
fail	O
to	O
lift	O
up	O
the	O
heaviest	O
lion	O
,	O
or	O
any	O
other	O
wild	O
creature	O
,	O
and	O
throw	O
him	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
air	O
quite	O
over	O
his	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
trample	O
him	O
to	O
death	O
with	O
his	O
feet	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
several	O
lines	O
of	O
battle	O
thus	O
;	O
we	O
saw	O
one	O
so	O
long	O
that	O
indeed	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
end	O
of	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
believe	O
there	O
might	O
be	O
2000	O
elephants	O
in	O
row	O
or	O
line	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
not	O
beasts	O
of	O
prey	O
,	O
but	O
live	O
upon	O
the	O
herbage	O
of	O
the	O
field	O
,	O
as	O
an	O
ox	O
does	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
they	O
are	O
so	O
great	O
a	O
creature	O
,	O
yet	O
that	O
a	O
smaller	O
quantity	O
of	O
forage	O
supplies	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
than	O
will	O
suffice	O
a	O
horse	O
.	O

The	O
numbers	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
creature	O
that	O
are	O
in	O
those	O
parts	O
are	O
inconceivable	O
,	O
as	O
may	O
be	O
gathered	O
from	O
the	O
prodigious	O
quantity	O
of	O
teeth	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
in	O
this	O
vast	O
desert	O
;	O
and	O
indeed	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
hundred	O
of	O
them	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
any	O
other	O
kind	O
.	O

One	O
evening	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
much	O
surprised	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
most	O
of	O
us	O
laid	O
down	O
on	O
our	O
mats	O
to	O
sleep	O
,	O
when	O
our	O
watch	O
came	O
running	O
in	O
among	O
us	O
,	O
being	O
frighted	O
with	O
the	O
sudden	O
roaring	O
of	O
some	O
lions	O
just	O
by	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
not	O
seen	O
,	O
the	O
night	O
being	O
dark	O
,	O
till	O
they	O
were	O
just	O
upon	O
them	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
proved	O
,	O
an	O
old	O
lion	O
and	O
his	O
whole	O
family	O
,	O
for	O
there	O
was	O
the	O
lioness	O
and	O
three	O
young	O
lions	O
,	O
besides	O
the	O
old	O
king	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
a	O
monstrous	O
great	O
one	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
young	O
ones	O
--	O
who	O
were	O
good	O
,	O
large	O
,	O
well-grown	O
ones	O
too	O
--	O
leaped	O
up	O
upon	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
negroes	O
,	O
who	O
stood	O
sentinel	O
,	O
before	O
he	O
saw	O
him	O
,	O
at	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
heartily	O
frighted	O
,	O
cried	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
ran	O
into	O
the	O
tent	O
.	O

Our	O
other	O
man	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
a	O
gun	O
,	O
had	O
not	O
presence	O
of	O
mind	O
at	O
first	O
to	O
shoot	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
struck	O
him	O
with	O
the	O
butt-end	O
of	O
his	O
piece	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
him	O
whine	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
growl	O
at	O
him	O
fearfully	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
fellow	O
retired	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
we	O
being	O
all	O
alarmed	O
,	O
three	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
snatched	O
up	O
their	O
guns	O
,	O
ran	O
to	O
the	O
tent	O
door	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
saw	O
the	O
great	O
old	O
lion	O
by	O
the	O
fire	O
of	O
his	O
eyes	O
,	O
and	O
first	O
fired	O
at	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
we	O
supposed	O
,	O
missed	O
him	O
,	O
or	O
at	O
least	O
did	O
not	O
kill	O
him	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
went	O
all	O
off	O
,	O
but	O
raised	O
a	O
most	O
hideous	O
roar	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
called	O
for	O
help	O
,	O
brought	O
down	O
a	O
prodigious	O
number	O
of	O
lions	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
furious	O
creatures	O
,	O
we	O
know	O
not	O
what	O
,	O
about	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
see	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
noise	O
,	O
and	O
yelling	O
and	O
howling	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
sorts	O
of	O
such	O
wilderness	O
music	O
on	O
every	O
side	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
all	O
the	O
beasts	O
of	O
the	O
desert	O
were	O
assembled	O
to	O
devour	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
asked	O
our	O
black	O
prince	O
what	O
we	O
should	O
do	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

``	O
Me	O
go	O
,	O
''	O
says	O
he	O
,	O
``	O
and	O
fright	O
them	O
all	O

''	O

So	O
he	O
snatches	O
up	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
of	O
the	O
worst	O
of	O
our	O
mats	O
,	O
and	O
getting	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
to	O
strike	O
some	O
fire	O
,	O
he	O
hangs	O
the	O
mat	O
up	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
a	O
pole	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
it	O
on	O
fire	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
blazed	O
abroad	O
a	O
good	O
while	O
;	O
at	O
which	O
the	O
creatures	O
all	O
moved	O
off	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
heard	O
them	O
roar	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
their	O
bellowing	O
noise	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O

``	O

says	O
our	O
gunner	O

``	O

which	O
are	O

lay	O
under	O

and	O
our	O

to	O
cover	O
us	O

Let	O
me	O
alone	O

''	O
says	O
he	O

So	O
he	O
comes	O
back	O
into	O
our	O
tent	O
,	O
and	O
falls	O
to	O
making	O
some	O
artificial	O
fireworks	O
and	O
the	O
like	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
gave	O
our	O
sentinels	O
some	O
to	O
be	O
ready	O
at	O
hand	O
upon	O
occasion	O
,	O
and	O
particularly	O
he	O
placed	O
a	O
great	O
piece	O
of	O
wild-fire	O
upon	O
the	O
same	O
pole	O
that	O
the	O
mat	O
had	O
been	O
tied	O
to	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
it	O
on	O
fire	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
burnt	O
there	O
so	O
long	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
wild	O
creatures	O
left	O
us	O
for	O
that	O
time	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
weary	O
of	O
such	O
company	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
rid	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
we	O
set	O
forward	O
again	O
two	O
days	O
sooner	O
than	O
we	O
intended	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
now	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
the	O
desert	O
did	O
not	O
end	O
,	O
nor	O
could	O
we	O
see	O
any	O
appearance	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
yet	O
that	O
the	O
earth	O
was	O
pretty	O
full	O
of	O
green	O
stuff	O
of	O
one	O
sort	O
or	O
another	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
our	O
cattle	O
had	O
no	O
want	O
;	O
and	O
secondly	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
several	O
little	O
rivers	O
which	O
ran	O
into	O
the	O
lake	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
long	O
as	O
the	O
country	O
continued	O
low	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
water	O
sufficient	O
,	O
which	O
eased	O
us	O
very	O
much	O
in	O
our	O
carriage	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
still	O
sixteen	O
days	O
more	O
without	O
yet	O
coming	O
to	O
any	O
appearance	O
of	O
better	O
soil	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
country	O
rise	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
that	O
we	O
perceived	O
that	O
the	O
water	O
would	O
fail	O
us	O
;	O
so	O
,	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
the	O
worst	O
,	O
we	O
filled	O
our	O
bladder-bottles	O
with	O
water	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
the	O
country	O
rising	O
gradually	O
thus	O
for	O
three	O
days	O
continually	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
sudden	O
,	O
we	O
perceived	O
that	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
mounted	O
up	O
insensibly	O
,	O
yet	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
on	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
high	O
ridge	O
of	O
hills	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
such	O
as	O
at	O
first	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
look	O
down	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
hills	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
great	O
joy	O
of	O
all	O
our	O
hearts	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
desert	O
was	O
at	O
an	O
end	O
;	O
that	O
the	O
country	O
was	O
clothed	O
with	O
green	O
,	O
abundance	O
of	O
trees	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
large	O
river	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
made	O
no	O
doubt	O
but	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
find	O
people	O
and	O
cattle	O
also	O
;	O
and	O
here	O
,	O
by	O
our	O
gunner	O
's	O
account	O
,	O
who	O
kept	O
our	O
computations	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
marched	O
about	O
400	O
miles	O
over	O
this	O
dismal	O
place	O
of	O
horror	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
four-and-thirty	O
days	O
a-doing	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
were	O
come	O
about	O
1100	O
miles	O
of	O
our	O
journey	O
.	O

We	O
would	O
willingly	O
have	O
descended	O
the	O
hills	O
that	O
night	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
late	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
we	O
saw	O
everything	O
more	O
plain	O
,	O
and	O
rested	O
ourselves	O
under	O
the	O
shade	O
of	O
some	O
trees	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
now	O
the	O
most	O
refreshing	O
things	O
imaginable	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
scorched	O
above	O
a	O
month	O
without	O
a	O
tree	O
to	O
cover	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
the	O
country	O
here	O
very	O
pleasant	O
,	O
especially	O
considering	O
that	O
we	O
came	O
from	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
killed	O
some	O
deer	O
here	O
also	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
very	O
frequent	O
under	O
the	O
cover	O
of	O
the	O
woods	O
.	O

Also	O
we	O
killed	O
a	O
creature	O
like	O
a	O
goat	O
,	O
whose	O
flesh	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
to	O
eat	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
no	O
goat	O
;	O
we	O
found	O
also	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
fowls	O
like	O
partridge	O
,	O
but	O
something	O
smaller	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
very	O
tame	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
lived	O
here	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
but	O
found	O
no	O
people	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
none	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
seen	O
,	O
no	O
,	O
not	O
for	O
several	O
days	O
'	O
journey	O
;	O
and	O
to	O
allay	O
our	O
joy	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
almost	O
every	O
night	O
disturbed	O
with	O
lions	O
and	O
tigers	O
;	O
elephants	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
none	O
here	O
.	O

In	O
three	O
days	O
'	O
march	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
saw	O
from	O
the	O
hills	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
we	O
called	O
the	O
Golden	PNM
River	PNM
;	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
ran	O
northward	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
stream	O
we	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
that	O
did	O
so	O
.	O

It	O
ran	O
with	O
a	O
very	O
rapid	O
current	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
gunner	O
,	O
pulling	O
out	O
his	O
map	O
,	O
assured	O
me	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
either	O
the	O
river	O
Nile	O
,	O
or	O
run	O
into	O
the	O
great	O
lake	O
out	O
of	O
which	O
the	O
river	O
Nile	O
was	O
said	O
to	O
take	O
its	O
beginning	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
brought	O
out	O
his	O
charts	O
and	O
maps	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
by	O
his	O
instruction	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
understand	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
would	O
convince	O
me	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
he	O
seemed	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
so	O
plain	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
opinion	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
enter	O
into	O
the	O
gunner	O
's	O
reason	O
for	O
this	O
inquiry	O
,	O
not	O
in	O
the	O
least	O
,	O
till	O
he	O
went	O
on	O
with	O
it	O
farther	O
,	O
and	O
stated	O
it	O
thus	O
:	O
--	O
``	O
If	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
river	O
Nile	O
,	O
why	O
should	O
not	O
we	O
build	O
some	O
more	O
canoes	O
,	O
and	O
go	O
down	O
this	O
stream	O
,	O
rather	O
than	O
expose	O
ourselves	O
to	O
any	O
more	O
deserts	O
and	O
scorching	O
sands	O
in	O
quest	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
which	O
when	O
we	O
are	O
come	O
to	O
,	O
we	O
shall	O
be	O
as	O
much	O
at	O
a	O
loss	O
how	O
to	O
get	O
home	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
Madagascar	PNM
?	O
''	O

The	O
argument	O
was	O
good	O
,	O
had	O
there	O
been	O
no	O
objections	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
a	O
kind	O
which	O
none	O
of	O
us	O
were	O
capable	O
of	O
answering	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
upon	O
the	O
whole	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
an	O
undertaking	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
nature	O
that	O
every	O
one	O
of	O
us	O
thought	O
it	O
impracticable	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
upon	O
several	O
accounts	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
surgeon	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
himself	O
a	O
good	O
scholar	O
and	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
reading	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
acquainted	O
with	O
the	O
business	O
of	O
sailing	O
,	O
opposed	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
his	O
reasons	O
,	O
I	O
remember	O
,	O
were	O
such	O
as	O
these	O
:	O
--	O
First	O
,	O
the	O
length	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
which	O
both	O
he	O
and	O
the	O
gunner	O
allowed	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
turnings	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
would	O
be	O
at	O
least	O
4000	O
miles	O
.	O

Secondly	O
,	O
the	O
innumerable	O
crocodiles	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
should	O
never	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
escape	O
.	O

Thirdly	O
,	O
the	O
dreadful	O
deserts	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
;	O
and	O
lastly	O
,	O
the	O
approaching	O
rainy	O
season	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
streams	O
of	O
the	O
Nile	O
would	O
be	O
so	O
furious	O
,	O
and	O
rise	O
so	O
high	O
--	O
spreading	O
far	O
and	O
wide	O
over	O
all	O
the	O
plain	O
country	O
--	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
never	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
know	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
channel	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
and	O
when	O
not	O
,	O
and	O
should	O
certainly	O
be	O
cast	O
away	O
,	O
overset	O
,	O
or	O
run	O
aground	O
so	O
often	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
impossible	O
to	O
proceed	O
by	O
a	O
river	O
so	O
excessively	O
dangerous	O
.	O

This	O
last	O
reason	O
he	O
made	O
so	O
plain	O
to	O
us	O
that	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
sensible	O
of	O
it	O
ourselves	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
agreed	O
to	O
lay	O
that	O
thought	O
aside	O
,	O
and	O
proceed	O
in	O
our	O
first	O
course	O
,	O
westwards	O
towards	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
loth	O
to	O
depart	O
,	O
we	O
continued	O
,	O
by	O
way	O
of	O
refreshing	O
ourselves	O
,	O
to	O
loiter	O
two	O
days	O
upon	O
this	O
river	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
time	O
our	O
black	O
prince	O
,	O
who	O
delighted	O
much	O
in	O
wandering	O
up	O
and	O
down	O
,	O
came	O
one	O
evening	O
and	O
brought	O
us	O
several	O
little	O
bits	O
of	O
something	O
,	O
he	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
found	O
it	O
felt	O
heavy	O
and	O
looked	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
showed	O
it	O
to	O
me	O
as	O
what	O
he	O
thought	O
was	O
some	O
rarity	O
.	O

I	O
took	O
not	O
much	O
notice	O
of	O
it	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
stepping	O
out	O
and	O
calling	O
the	O
gunner	O
to	O
me	O
I	O
showed	O
it	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
what	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
certainly	O
gold	O
.	O

He	O
agreed	O
with	O
me	O
in	O
that	O
,	O
and	O
also	O
in	O
what	O
followed	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
take	O
the	O
black	O
prince	O
out	O
with	O
us	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
him	O
show	O
us	O
where	O
he	O
found	O
it	O
;	O
that	O
if	O
there	O
was	O
any	O
quantity	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
we	O
would	O
tell	O
our	O
company	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
if	O
there	O
was	O
but	O
little	O
we	O
would	O
keep	O
counsel	O
,	O
and	O
have	O
it	O
to	O
ourselves	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
forgot	O
to	O
engage	O
the	O
prince	O
in	O
the	O
secret	O
,	O
who	O
innocently	O
told	O
so	O
much	O
to	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
as	O
that	O
they	O
guessed	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
us	O
to	O
see	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
was	O
public	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
more	O
concerned	O
to	O
prevent	O
their	O
suspecting	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
any	O
design	O
to	O
conceal	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
openly	O
telling	O
our	O
thoughts	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
we	O
called	O
our	O
artificer	O
,	O
who	O
agreed	O
presently	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
gold	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
proposed	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
all	O
go	O
with	O
the	O
prince	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
he	O
found	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
any	O
quantity	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
had	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
lie	O
here	O
some	O
time	O
and	O
see	O
what	O
we	O
could	O
make	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
we	O
went	O
every	O
man	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
for	O
no	O
man	O
was	O
willing	O
to	O
be	O
left	O
behind	O
in	O
a	O
discovery	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
nature	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
not	O
in	O
the	O
main	O
river	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
another	O
small	O
river	O
or	O
stream	O
which	O
came	O
from	O
the	O
west	O
,	O
and	O
ran	O
into	O
the	O
other	O
at	O
that	O
place	O
.	O

We	O
fell	O
to	O
raking	O
in	O
the	O
sand	O
,	O
and	O
washing	O
it	O
in	O
our	O
hands	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
seldom	O
took	O
up	O
a	O
handful	O
of	O
sand	O
but	O
we	O
washed	O
some	O
little	O
round	O
lumps	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
a	O
pin	O
's	O
head	O
,	O
or	O
sometimes	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
a	O
grape	O
stone	O
,	O
into	O
our	O
hands	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
,	O
in	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
hours	O
'	O
time	O
,	O
that	O
every	O
one	O
had	O
got	O
some	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
agreed	O
to	O
leave	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
go	O

While	O
we	O
were	O
eating	O
,	O
it	O
came	O
into	O
my	O
thoughts	O
that	O
while	O
we	O
worked	O
at	O
this	O
rate	O
in	O
a	O
thing	O
of	O
such	O
nicety	O
and	O
consequence	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
ten	O
to	O
one	O
if	O
the	O
gold	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
make-bait	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
did	O
not	O
,	O
first	O
or	O
last	O
,	O
set	O
us	O
together	O
by	O
the	O
ears	O

to	O
break	O
our	O
good	O
articles	O
and	O
our	O
understanding	O
one	O
among	O
another	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
cause	O
us	O
to	O
part	O
companies	O
,	O
or	O
worse	O
;	O
I	O
therefore	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
indeed	O
the	O
youngest	O
man	O
in	O
the	O
company	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
always	O
allowed	O
me	O
to	O
give	O
my	O
opinion	O
in	O
things	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
sometimes	O
been	O
pleased	O
to	O
follow	O
my	O
advice	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
had	O
something	O
to	O
propose	O
now	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
thought	O
would	O
be	O
for	O
all	O
our	O
advantages	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
believed	O
they	O
would	O
all	O
like	O
it	O
very	O
well	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
them	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
a	O
country	O
where	O
we	O
all	O
knew	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
gold	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
world	O
sent	O
ships	O
thither	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
;	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
indeed	O
know	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
we	O
might	O
get	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
,	O
or	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
whether	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
offered	O
it	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
consider	O
whether	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
for	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
preserve	O
the	O
good	O
harmony	O
and	O
friendship	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
always	O
kept	O
among	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
was	O
so	O
absolutely	O
necessary	O
to	O
our	O
safety	O
,	O
that	O
what	O
we	O
found	O
should	O
be	O
brought	O
together	O
to	O
one	O
common	O
stock	O
,	O
and	O
be	O
equally	O
divided	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
rather	O
than	O
to	O
run	O
the	O
hazard	O
of	O
any	O
difference	O
which	O
might	O
happen	O
among	O
us	O
from	O
any	O
one	O
's	O
having	O
found	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
than	O
another	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
upon	O
one	O
bottom	O
we	O
should	O
all	O
apply	O
ourselves	O
heartily	O
to	O
the	O
work	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
besides	O
that	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
then	O
set	O
our	O
negroes	O
all	O
to	O
work	O
for	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
receive	O
equally	O
the	O
fruit	O
of	O
their	O
labour	O
and	O
of	O
our	O
own	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
all	O
exactly	O
alike	O
sharers	O
,	O
there	O
could	O
be	O
no	O
just	O
cause	O
of	O
quarrel	O
or	O
disgust	O
among	O
us	O
.	O

They	O
all	O
approved	O
the	O
proposal	O
,	O
and	O
every	O
one	O
jointly	O
swore	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
their	O
hands	O
to	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
conceal	O
the	O
least	O
grain	O
of	O
gold	O
from	O
the	O
rest	O
;	O
and	O
consented	O
that	O
if	O
any	O
one	O
or	O
more	O
should	O
be	O
found	O
to	O
conceal	O
any	O
,	O
all	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
should	O
be	O
taken	O
from	O
him	O
and	O
divided	O
among	O
the	O
rest	O
;	O
and	O
one	O
thing	O
more	O
was	O
added	O
to	O
it	O
by	O
our	O
gunner	O
,	O
from	O
considerations	O
equally	O
good	O
and	O
just	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
any	O

by	O

our	O
whole	O
voyage	O

till	O
our	O
return	O
quite	O
to	O
Portugal	PNM
,	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
obliged	O
by	O
us	O
all	O
to	O
restore	O
it	O
again	O
on	O
the	O
penalty	O
of	O
being	O
disarmed	O
and	O
turned	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
company	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
having	O
no	O
relief	O
from	O
us	O
on	O
any	O
account	O
whatever	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
to	O
prevent	O
wagering	O
and	O
playing	O
for	O
money	O
,	O
which	O
our	O
men	O
were	O
apt	O
to	O
do	O
by	O
several	O
means	O
and	O
at	O
several	O
games	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
had	O
neither	O
cards	O
nor	O
dice	O
.	O

Having	O
made	O
this	O
wholesome	O
agreement	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
cheerfully	O
to	O
work	O
,	O
and	O
showed	O
our	O
negroes	O
how	O
to	O
work	O
for	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
working	O
up	O
the	O
stream	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
we	O
spent	O
about	O
three	O
weeks	O
'	O
time	O
dabbling	O
in	O
the	O
water	O
;	O
by	O
which	O
time	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
lay	O
all	O
in	O
our	O
way	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
gone	O
about	O
six	O
miles	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
more	O
;	O
and	O
still	O
the	O
higher	O
we	O
went	O
,	O
the	O
more	O
gold	O
we	O
found	O
;	O
till	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
having	O
passed	O
by	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
a	O
hill	O
,	O
we	O
perceived	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
that	O
the	O
gold	O
stopped	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
bit	O
taken	O
up	O
beyond	O
that	O
place	O
.	O

It	O
presently	O
occurred	O
to	O
my	O
mind	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
must	O
then	O
be	O
from	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
that	O
little	O
hill	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
gold	O
we	O
found	O
was	O
worked	O
down	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
hill	O
,	O
and	O
fell	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
that	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
the	O
earth	O
loose	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
a	O
yellowish	O
loamy	O
colour	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
some	O
places	O
a	O
white	O
hard	O
kind	O
of	O
stone	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
in	O
describing	O
since	O
to	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
artists	O
,	O
they	O
tell	O
me	O
was	O
the	O
spar	O
which	O
is	O
found	O
by	O
ore	O
,	O
and	O
surrounds	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
mine	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
all	O
gold	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
instrument	O
to	O
force	O
it	O
out	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
passed	O
that	O
.	O

But	O
scratching	O
into	O
the	O
loose	O
earth	O
with	O
our	O
fingers	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
surprising	O
place	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
earth	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
quantity	O
of	O
two	O
bushels	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
,	O
or	O
thereabouts	O
,	O
crumbled	O
down	O
with	O
little	O
more	O
than	O
touching	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
apparently	O
showed	O
us	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
gold	O
in	O
it	O
.	O

We	O
took	O
it	O
all	O
carefully	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
washing	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
the	O
loamy	O
earth	O
washed	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
the	O
gold	O
dust	O
free	O
in	O
our	O
hands	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
which	O
was	O
more	O
remarkable	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
when	O
this	O
loose	O
earth	O
was	O
all	O
taken	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
rock	O
or	O
hard	O
stone	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
one	O
grain	O
of	O
gold	O
more	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
.	O

At	O
night	O
we	O
all	O
came	O
together	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
we	O
had	O
got	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
appeared	O
we	O
had	O
found	O
,	O
in	O
that	O
day	O
's	O
heap	O
of	O
earth	O
,	O
about	O
fifty	O
pounds	O
'	O
weight	O
of	O
gold	O
dust	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
thirty-four	O
pounds	O
'	O
weight	O
more	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
our	O
works	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
happy	O
kind	O
of	O
disappointment	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
full	O
stop	O
put	O
to	O
our	O
work	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
had	O
the	O
quantity	O
of	O
gold	O
been	O
ever	O
so	O
small	O
,	O
yet	O
,	O
had	O
any	O
at	O
all	O
come	O
,	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
know	O
when	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
given	O
over	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
having	O
rummaged	O
this	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
finding	O
the	O
least	O
grain	O
of	O
gold	O
in	O
any	O
other	O
place	O
,	O
or	O
in	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
earth	O
there	O
,	O
except	O
in	O
that	O
loose	O
parcel	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
quite	O
back	O
down	O
the	O
small	O
river	O
again	O
,	O
working	O
it	O
over	O
and	O
over	O
again	O
,	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
find	O
anything	O
,	O
how	O
small	O
soever	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
did	O
get	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
pounds	O
more	O
the	O
second	O
time	O
.	O

Then	O
we	O
went	O
into	O
the	O
first	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
tried	O
it	O
up	O
the	O
stream	O
and	O
down	O
the	O
stream	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
one	O
side	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
.	O

Up	O
the	O
stream	O
we	O
found	O
nothing	O
,	O
no	O
,	O
not	O
a	O
grain	O
;	O
down	O
the	O
stream	O
we	O
found	O
very	O
little	O
,	O
not	O
above	O
the	O
quantity	O
of	O
half	O
an	O
ounce	O
in	O
two	O
miles	O
'	O
working	O
;	O
so	O
back	O
we	O
came	O
again	O
to	O
the	O
Golden	PNM
River	PNM
,	PNM
as	O
we	O
justly	O
called	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
worked	O
it	O
up	O
the	O
stream	O
and	O
down	O
the	O
stream	O
twice	O
more	O
apiece	O
,	O
and	O
every	O
time	O
we	O
found	O
some	O
gold	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
might	O
have	O
done	O
so	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
stayed	O
there	O
till	O
this	O
time	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
quantity	O
was	O
at	O
last	O
so	O
small	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
work	O
so	O
much	O
the	O
harder	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
agreed	O
by	O
consent	O
to	O
give	O
it	O
over	O
,	O
lest	O
we	O
should	O
fatigue	O
ourselves	O
and	O
our	O
negroes	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
be	O
quite	O
unfit	O
for	O
our	O
journey	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
brought	O
all	O
our	O
purchase	O
together	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
whole	O
three	O
pounds	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
of	O
gold	O
to	O
a	O
man	O
,	O
share	O
and	O
share	O
alike	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
such	O
a	O
weight	O
and	O
scale	O
as	O
our	O
ingenious	O
cutler	O
made	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
weigh	O
it	O
by	O
,	O
which	O
indeed	O
he	O
did	O
by	O
guess	O
,	O
but	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
sure	O
was	O
rather	O
more	O
than	O
less	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
it	O
proved	O
at	O
last	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
near	O
two	O
ounces	O
more	O
than	O
weight	O
in	O
a	O
pound	O
.	O

Besides	O
this	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
pounds	O
'	O
weight	O
left	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
agreed	O
to	O
leave	O
in	O
his	O
hands	O

to	O
work	O
it	O
into	O
such	O
shapes	O
as	O
we	O
thought	O
fit	O

to	O
give	O

to	O
such	O
people	O
as	O
we	O
might	O
yet	O
meet	O
with	O

we	O
might	O
have	O
occasion	O
to	O

even	O
to	O
buy	O
friendship	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
like	O
;	O
and	O
particularly	O
we	O
gave	O
about	O
a	O
pound	O
to	O
our	O
black	O
prince	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
hammered	O
and	O
worked	O
by	O
his	O
own	O
indefatigable	O
hand	O

and	O
some	O
tools	O
our	O
artificer	O
lent	O
him	O

into	O
little	O
round	O

as	O
round	O
almost	O

not	O
exact	O
in	O

drilling	O
holes	O
through	O

put	O
them	O
all	O
upon	O
a	O

wore	O
them	O
about	O
his	O

and	O
they	O
looked	O
very	O
well	O
there	O
,	O
I	O
assure	O
you	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
many	O
months	O
a-doing	O
it	O

And	O
thus	O
ended	O
our	O
first	O
golden	O
adventure	O
.	O

We	O
now	O
began	O
to	O
discover	O
what	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
troubled	O
our	O
heads	O
much	O
about	O
before	O

and	O
that	O

be	O

we	O
could	O
not	O
travel	O
much	O

for	O
a	O

We	O
had	O

now	O
five	O
months	O

upwards	O
in	O
our	O
journey	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
seasons	O
began	O
to	O

different	O
kind	O
from	O
what	O
our	O
country	O
produced	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
expect	O
a	O
wet	O
season	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
as	O
we	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
travel	O
in	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
by	O
reason	O
of	O
the	O
rain	O
itself	O
,	O
as	O
of	O
the	O
floods	O
which	O
it	O
would	O
occasion	O
wherever	O
we	O
should	O
come	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
no	O
strangers	O
to	O
those	O
wet	O
seasons	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Madagascar	PNM
,	O
yet	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
thought	O
much	O
of	O
them	O
since	O
we	O
began	O
our	O
travels	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
setting	O
out	O
when	O
the	O
sun	O
was	O
about	O
the	O
solstice	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
at	O
the	O
greatest	O
northern	O
distance	O
from	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
found	O
the	O
benefit	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
our	O
travels	O
.	O

But	O
now	O
it	O
drew	O
near	O
us	O
apace	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
began	O
to	O
rain	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
we	O
called	O
another	O
general	O
council	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
we	O
debated	O
our	O
present	O
circumstances	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
particular	O
,	O
whether	O
we	O
should	O
go	O
forward	O
,	O
or	O
seek	O
for	O
a	O
proper	O
place	O
upon	O
the	O
bank	O
of	O
our	O
Golden	PNM
River	PNM
,	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
lucky	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
to	O
fix	O
our	O
camp	O
for	O
the	O
winter	O
.	O

Upon	O
the	O
whole	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
resolved	O
to	O
abide	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
least	O
part	O
of	O
our	O
happiness	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
so	O
,	O
as	O
shall	O
appear	O
in	O
its	O
place	O
.	O

Having	O
resolved	O
upon	O
this	O
,	O
our	O
first	O
measures	O
were	O
to	O
set	O
our	O
negroes	O
to	O
work	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
huts	O
or	O
houses	O
for	O
our	O
habitation	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
they	O
did	O
very	O
dexterously	O
;	O
only	O
that	O
we	O
changed	O
the	O
ground	O
where	O
we	O
at	O
first	O
intended	O
it	O
,	O
thinking	O
,	O
as	O
indeed	O
it	O
happened	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
river	O
might	O
reach	O
it	O
upon	O
any	O
sudden	O
rain	O
.	O

Our	O
camp	O
was	O
like	O
a	O
little	O
town	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
our	O
huts	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
centre	O
,	O
having	O
one	O
large	O
one	O
in	O
the	O
centre	O
of	O
them	O
also	O
,	O
into	O
which	O
all	O
our	O
particular	O
lodgings	O
opened	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
none	O
of	O
us	O
went	O
into	O
our	O
apartments	O
but	O
through	O
a	O
public	O
tent	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
all	O
ate	O
and	O
drank	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
kept	O
our	O
councils	O
and	O
society	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
carpenters	O
made	O
us	O
tables	O
,	O
benches	O
,	O
and	O
stools	O
in	O
abundance	O
,	O
as	O
many	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
make	O
use	O
of	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
no	O
need	O
of	O
chimneys	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
hot	O
enough	O
without	O
fire	O
;	O
but	O
yet	O
we	O
found	O
ourselves	O
at	O
last	O
obliged	O
to	O
keep	O
a	O
fire	O
every	O
night	O
upon	O
a	O
particular	O
occasion	O
.	O

For	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
in	O
all	O
other	O
respects	O
a	O
very	O
pleasant	O
and	O
agreeable	O
situation	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
were	O
rather	O
worse	O
troubled	O
with	O
the	O
unwelcome	O
visits	O
of	O
wild	O
beasts	O
here	O
than	O
in	O
the	O
wilderness	O
itself	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
the	O
deer	O
and	O
other	O
gentle	O
creatures	O
came	O
hither	O
for	O
shelter	O
and	O
food	O
,	O
so	O
the	O
lions	O
and	O
tigers	O
and	O
leopards	O
haunted	O
these	O
places	O
continually	O
for	O
prey	O
.	O

When	O
first	O
we	O
discovered	O
this	O
we	O
were	O
so	O
uneasy	O
at	O
it	O
that	O
we	O
thought	O
of	O
removing	O
our	O
situation	O
;	O
but	O
after	O
many	O
debates	O
about	O
it	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
fortify	O
ourselves	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
manner	O
as	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
any	O
danger	O
from	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
our	O
carpenters	O
undertook	O
,	O
who	O
first	O
palisaded	O
our	O
camp	O
quite	O
round	O
with	O
long	O
stakes	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
wood	O
enough	O
,	O
which	O
stakes	O
were	O
not	O
stuck	O
in	O
one	O
by	O
another	O
like	O
pales	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
an	O
irregular	O
manner	O
;	O
a	O
great	O
multitude	O
of	O
them	O
so	O
placed	O
that	O
they	O
took	O
up	O
near	O
two	O
yards	O
in	O
thickness	O
,	O
some	O
higher	O
,	O
some	O
lower	O
,	O
all	O
sharpened	O
at	O
the	O
top	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
a	O
foot	O
asunder	O
:	O
so	O
that	O
had	O
any	O
creature	O
jumped	O
at	O
them	O
,	O
unless	O
he	O
had	O
gone	O
clean	O
over	O
,	O
which	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
hard	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
be	O
hung	O
upon	O
twenty	O
or	O
thirty	O
spikes	O
.	O

The	O
entrance	O
into	O
this	O
had	O
larger	O
stakes	O
than	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
so	O
placed	O
before	O
one	O
another	O
as	O
to	O
make	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
short	O
turnings	O
which	O
no	O
four-footed	O
beast	O
bigger	O
than	O
a	O
dog	O
could	O
possibly	O
come	O
in	O
at	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
attacked	O
by	O
any	O
multitude	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
be	O
alarmed	O
in	O
our	O
sleep	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
,	O
or	O
be	O
obliged	O
to	O
waste	O
our	O
ammunition	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
chary	O
of	O
,	O
we	O
kept	O
a	O
great	O
fire	O
every	O
night	O
without	O
the	O
entrance	O
of	O
our	O
palisade	O
,	O
having	O
a	O
hut	O
for	O
our	O
two	O
sentinels	O
to	O
stand	O
in	O
free	O
from	O
the	O
rain	O
,	O
just	O
within	O
the	O
entrance	O
,	O
and	O
right	O
against	O
the	O
fire	O
.	O

To	O
maintain	O
this	O
fire	O
we	O
cut	O
a	O
prodigious	O
deal	O
of	O
wood	O
,	O
and	O
piled	O
it	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
heap	O
to	O
dry	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
the	O
green	O
boughs	O
made	O
a	O
second	O
covering	O
over	O
our	O
huts	O
,	O
so	O
high	O
and	O
thick	O
that	O
it	O
might	O
cast	O
the	O
rain	O
from	O
the	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
keep	O
us	O
effectually	O
dry	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
scarcely	O
finished	O
all	O
these	O
works	O
but	O
the	O
rain	O
came	O
on	O
so	O
fierce	O
and	O
so	O
continued	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
little	O
time	O
to	O
stir	O
abroad	O
for	O
food	O
,	O
except	O
indeed	O
that	O
our	O
negroes	O
,	O
who	O
wore	O
no	O
clothes	O
,	O
seemed	O
to	O
make	O
nothing	O
of	O
the	O
rain	O
;	O
though	O
to	O
us	O
Europeans	O
,	O
in	O
those	O
hot	O
climates	O
,	O
nothing	O
is	O
more	O
dangerous	O
.	O

We	O
continued	O
in	O
this	O
posture	O
for	O
four	O
months	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
June	O
to	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
October	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
the	O
rains	O
went	O
off	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
the	O
greatest	O
violence	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
about	O
the	O
equinox	O
,	O
yet	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
sun	O
was	O
then	O
just	O
over	O
our	O
heads	O
,	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
stay	O
awhile	O
till	O
it	O
passed	O
a	O
little	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
.	O

During	O
our	O
encampment	O
here	O
we	O
had	O
several	O
adventures	O
with	O
the	O
ravenous	O
creatures	O
of	O
that	O
country	O
;	O
and	O
had	O
not	O
our	O
fire	O
been	O
always	O
kept	O
burning	O
,	O
I	O
question	O
much	O
whether	O
all	O
our	O
fence	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
strengthened	O
it	O
afterwards	O
with	O
twelve	O
or	O
fourteen	O
rows	O
of	O
stakes	O
or	O
more	O
,	O
would	O
have	O
kept	O
us	O
secure	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
always	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
disturbance	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
they	O
came	O
in	O
such	O
multitudes	O
that	O
we	O
thought	O
all	O
the	O
lions	O
and	O
tigers	O
,	O
and	O
leopards	O
and	O
wolves	O
of	O
Africa	PNM
were	O
come	O
together	O
to	O
attack	O
us	O
.	O

One	O
night	O
,	O
being	O
clear	O
moonshine	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
being	O
upon	O
the	O
watch	O
,	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
he	O
verily	O
believed	O
he	O
saw	O
ten	O
thousand	O
wild	O
creatures	O
of	O
one	O
sort	O
or	O
another	O
pass	O
by	O
our	O
little	O
camp	O
,	O
and	O
ever	O
as	O
they	O
saw	O
the	O
fire	O
they	O
sheered	O
off	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
sure	O
to	O
howl	O
or	O
roar	O
,	O
or	O
whatever	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
past	O
.	O

The	O
music	O
of	O
their	O
voices	O
was	O
very	O
far	O
from	O
being	O
pleasant	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
would	O
be	O
so	O
very	O
disturbing	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
sleep	O
for	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
often	O
our	O
sentinels	O
would	O
call	O
us	O
that	O
were	O
awake	O
to	O
come	O
and	O
look	O
at	O
them	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
one	O
windy	O
,	O
tempestuous	O
night	O
,	O
after	O
a	O
rainy	O
day	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
indeed	O
called	O
up	O
;	O
for	O
such	O
innumerable	O
numbers	O
of	O
devilish	O
creatures	O
came	O
about	O
us	O
that	O
our	O
watch	O
really	O
thought	O
they	O
would	O
attack	O
us	O

They	O
would	O
not	O
come	O
on	O
the	O
side	O
where	O
the	O
fire	O
was	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
we	O
thought	O
ourselves	O
secure	O
everywhere	O
else	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
all	O
got	O
up	O
and	O
took	O
to	O
our	O
arms	O
.	O

The	O
moon	O
was	O
near	O
the	O
full	O

but	O
the	O
air	O
full	O
of	O
flying	O
clouds	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
strange	O
hurricane	O
of	O
wind	O
to	O
add	O
to	O
the	O
terror	O
of	O
the	O
night	O
;	O
when	O
,	O
looking	O
on	O
the	O
back	O
part	O
of	O
our	O
camp	O

I	O
thought	O
I	O
saw	O
a	O
creature	O
within	O
our	O
fortification	O

and	O
so	O
indeed	O
he	O
was	O
,	O
except	O
his	O
haunches	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
had	O
taken	O
a	O
running	O
leap	O
,	O
I	O
suppose	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
all	O
his	O
might	O
had	O
thrown	O
himself	O
clear	O
over	O
our	O
palisades	O
,	O
except	O
one	O
strong	O
pile	O
,	O
which	O
stood	O
higher	O
than	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
had	O
caught	O
hold	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
his	O
weight	O
he	O
had	O
hanged	O
himself	O
upon	O
it	O
,	O
the	O
spike	O
of	O
the	O
pile	O
running	O
into	O
his	O
hinder	O
haunch	O

thigh	O

on	O
the	O

and	O
by	O
that	O
he	O
hung	O
,	O
growling	O

biting	O
the	O
wood	O
for	O
rage	O

I	O
snatched	O
up	O
a	O
lance	O
from	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
negroes	O
that	O
stood	O
just	O
by	O
me	O

and	O
running	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
struck	O
it	O
three	O

four	O
times	O
into	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
despatched	O
him	O
,	O
being	O
unwilling	O
to	O
shoot	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
mind	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
volley	O
fired	O
among	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
could	O
see	O
standing	O
without	O

as	O
thick	O
as	O
a	O
drove	O
of	O
bullocks	O
going	O
to	O
a	O
fair	O
.	O

I	O
immediately	O
called	O
our	O
people	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
showed	O
them	O
the	O
object	O
of	O
terror	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
without	O
any	O
further	O
consultation	O
,	O
fired	O
a	O
full	O
volley	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
our	O
pieces	O
being	O
loaded	O
with	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
slugs	O
or	O
bullets	O
apiece	O

It	O
made	O
a	O
horrible	O
clutter	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
general	O
they	O
all	O
took	O
to	O
their	O
heels	O
,	O
only	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
observe	O
that	O
some	O
walked	O
off	O
with	O
more	O
gravity	O
and	O
majesty	O
than	O
others	O
,	O
being	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
frighted	O
at	O
the	O
noise	O

fire	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
could	O
perceive	O
that	O
some	O
were	O
left	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
struggling	O
as	O
for	O
life	O

but	O
we	O
durst	O
not	O
stir	O
out	O
to	O
see	O
what	O

Indeed	O
they	O

so	O
thick	O

were	O
so	O

that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
well	O
miss	O
killing	O
or	O

some	O
of	O
them	O

we	O

the	O
smell	O
of	O
us	O

our	O

a	O

been	O
thrown	O
out	O
behind	O
our	O
camp	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
,	O
we	O
suppose	O
,	O
drew	O
them	O
so	O
much	O
about	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
avoided	O
it	O
for	O
the	O
future	O
.	O

Though	O
the	O
creatures	O
fled	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
heard	O
a	O
frightful	O
roaring	O
all	O
night	O
at	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
they	O
stood	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
supposed	O
was	O
from	O
some	O
that	O
were	O
wounded	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
day	O
came	O
we	O
went	O
out	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
execution	O
we	O
had	O
done	O
.	O

And	O
indeed	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
strange	O
sight	O
;	O
there	O
were	O
three	O
tigers	O
and	O
two	O
wolves	O
quite	O
killed	O
,	O
besides	O
the	O
creature	O
I	O
had	O
killed	O
within	O
our	O
palisade	O
,	O
which	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
of	O
an	O
ill-gendered	O
kind	O
,	O
between	O
a	O
tiger	O
and	O
a	O
leopard	O
.	O

Besides	O
this	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
noble	O
old	O
lion	O
alive	O
,	O
but	O
with	O
both	O
his	O
fore-legs	O
broke	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
stir	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
had	O
almost	O
beat	O
himself	O
to	O
death	O
with	O
struggling	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
wounded	O
soldier	O
that	O
had	O
roared	O
so	O
loud	O
and	O
given	O
us	O
so	O
much	O
disturbance	O
.	O

Our	O
surgeon	O
,	O
looking	O
at	O
him	O
,	O
smiled	O
.	O

``	O
Now	O
,	O
''	O
says	O
he	O
,	O
``	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
be	O
sure	O
this	O
lion	O
would	O
be	O
as	O
grateful	O
to	O

as	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
majesty	O

Androcles	O

the	O
Roman	O
slave	O

I	O
would	O
certainly	O
set	O
both	O
his	O

and	O
cure	O
him	O

''	O

I	O
had	O
not	O
heard	O
the	O
story	O
of	O
Androcles	O
,	O
so	O
he	O
told	O
it	O
me	O
at	O
large	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
surgeon	O
,	O
we	O
told	O
him	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
way	O
to	O
know	O
whether	O
the	O
lion	O
would	O
do	O
so	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
cure	O
him	O
first	O
and	O
trust	O
to	O
his	O
honour	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
faith	O
,	O
so	O
to	O
despatch	O
him	O
and	O
put	O
him	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
torment	O
,	O
he	O
shot	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
head	O
and	O
killed	O
him	O
,	O
for	O
which	O
we	O
called	O
him	O
the	O
king-killer	O
ever	O
after	O
.	O

Our	O
negroes	O
found	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
five	O
of	O
these	O
ravenous	O
creatures	O
wounded	O
and	O
dropped	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
from	O
our	O
quarters	O
;	O
whereof	O
,	O
one	O
was	O
a	O
wolf	O
,	O
one	O
a	O
fine	O
spotted	O
young	O
leopard	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
were	O
creatures	O
that	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
to	O
call	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
several	O
more	O
of	O
these	O
gentlefolks	O
about	O
after	O
that	O
,	O
but	O
no	O
such	O
general	O
rendezvous	O
of	O
them	O
as	O
that	O
was	O
any	O
more	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
ill	O
effect	O
it	O
had	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
frighted	O
the	O
deer	O
and	O
other	O
creatures	O
from	O
our	O
neighbourhood	O
,	O
of	O
whose	O
company	O
we	O
were	O
much	O
more	O
desirous	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
were	O
necessary	O
for	O
our	O
subsistence	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
our	O
negroes	O
went	O
out	O
every	O
day	O
a-hunting	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
called	O
it	O
,	O
with	O
bow	O
and	O
arrow	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
scarce	O
ever	O
failed	O
of	O
bringing	O
us	O
home	O
something	O
or	O
other	O
;	O
and	O
particularly	O
we	O
found	O
in	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
rains	O
had	O
fallen	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
abundance	O
of	O
wild	O
fowl	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
we	O
have	O
in	O
England	PNM
,	O
duck	O
,	O
teal	O
,	O
widgeon	O
,	O
etc.	O
;	O
some	O
geese	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
kinds	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
before	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
frequently	O
killed	O
them	O
.	O

Also	O
we	O
catched	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
fresh	O
fish	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
wanted	O
no	O
provision	O
.	O

If	O
we	O
wanted	O
anything	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
salt	O
to	O
eat	O
with	O
our	O
fresh	O
meat	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
little	O
left	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
used	O
it	O
sparingly	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
to	O
our	O
negroes	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
taste	O
it	O
,	O
nor	O
did	O
they	O
care	O
to	O
eat	O
any	O
meat	O
that	O
was	O
seasoned	O
with	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
weather	O
began	O
now	O
to	O
clear	O
up	O
,	O
the	O
rains	O
were	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
floods	O
abated	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
passed	O
our	O
zenith	O
,	O
was	O
gone	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
prepared	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
our	O
way	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
12th	O
of	O
October	O
,	O
or	O
thereabouts	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
set	O
forward	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
an	O
easy	O
country	O
to	O
travel	O
in	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
to	O
supply	O
us	O
with	O
provisions	O
,	O
though	O
still	O
without	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
more	O
despatch	O
,	O
travelling	O
sometimes	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
calculated	O
it	O
,	O
twenty	O
or	O
twenty-five	O
miles	O
a	O
day	O
;	O
nor	O
did	O
we	O
halt	O
anywhere	O
in	O
eleven	O
days	O
'	O
march	O
,	O
one	O
day	O
excepted	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
raft	O
to	O
carry	O
us	O
over	O
a	O
small	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
having	O
swelled	O
with	O
the	O
rains	O
,	O
was	O
not	O
yet	O
quite	O
down	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
were	O
past	O
this	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
ran	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
too	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
great	O
row	O
of	O
hills	O
in	O
our	O
way	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
the	O
country	O
open	O
to	O
the	O
right	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
kept	O
true	O
to	O
our	O
course	O
,	O
due	O
west	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
willing	O
to	O
go	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
way	O
,	O
only	O
to	O
shun	O
a	O
few	O
hills	O
.	O

So	O
we	O
advanced	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
were	O
surprised	O
when	O
,	O
being	O
not	O
quite	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
top	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
company	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
with	O
two	O
negroes	O
,	O
was	O
got	O
up	O
before	O
us	O
,	O
cried	O
out	O
,	O
``	O
The	O
sea	O
!	O

the	O
sea	O
!	O
''	O

and	O
fell	O
a-dancing	O
and	O
jumping	O
,	O
as	O
signs	O
of	O
joy	O
.	O

The	O
gunner	O
and	O
I	O
were	O
most	O
surprised	O
at	O
it	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
had	O
but	O
that	O
morning	O
been	O
calculating	O
that	O
we	O
must	O
have	O
yet	O
above	O
1000	O
miles	O
on	O
the	O
sea	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
expect	O
to	O
reach	O
it	O
till	O
another	O
rainy	O
season	O
would	O
be	O
upon	O
us	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
when	O
our	O
man	O
cried	O
out	O
,	O
``	O
The	O
sea	O
,	O
''	O
the	O
gunner	O
was	O
angry	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
he	O
was	O
mad	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
were	O
both	O
in	O
the	O
greatest	O
surprise	O
imaginable	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
coming	O
to	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
,	O
and	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
high	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
nothing	O
but	O
water	O
,	O
either	O
before	O
us	O
or	O
to	O
the	O
right	O
hand	O
or	O
the	O
left	O
,	O
being	O
a	O
vast	O
sea	O
,	O
without	O
any	O
bounds	O
but	O
the	O
horizon	O
.	O

We	O
went	O
down	O
the	O
hill	O
full	O
of	O
confusion	O
of	O
thought	O
,	O
not	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
conceive	O
whereabouts	O
we	O
were	O
or	O
what	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
,	O
seeing	O
by	O
all	O
our	O
charts	O
the	O
sea	O
was	O
yet	O
a	O
vast	O
way	O
off	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
above	O
three	O
miles	O
from	O
the	O
hills	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
or	O
water-edge	O
of	O
this	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
further	O
surprise	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
water	O
fresh	O
and	O
pleasant	O
to	O
drink	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
course	O
to	O
take	O
.	O

The	O
sea	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
thought	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
,	O
put	O
a	O
full	O
stop	O
to	O
our	O
journey	O
-LRB-	O
I	O
mean	O
westward	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
lay	O
just	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
.	O

Our	O
next	O
question	O
was	O
,	O
which	O
hand	O
to	O
turn	O
to	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
right	O
hand	O
or	O
the	O
left	O
,	O
but	O
this	O
was	O
soon	O
resolved	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
the	O
extent	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
we	O
considered	O
that	O
our	O
way	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
the	O
sea	O
really	O
,	O
must	O
be	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
now	O
,	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
just	O
so	O
much	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
way	O
at	O
last	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
having	O
spent	O
a	O
good	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
in	O
our	O
surprise	O
at	O
the	O
thing	O
,	O
and	O
consulting	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
we	O
set	O
forward	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
.	O

We	O
travelled	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
of	O
this	O
sea	O
full	O
twenty-three	O
days	O
before	O
we	O
could	O
come	O
to	O
any	O
resolution	O
about	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
;	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
which	O
,	O
early	O
one	O
morning	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
seamen	O
cried	O
out	O
,	O
``	O
Land	O
!	O
''	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
no	O
false	O
alarm	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
saw	O
plainly	O
the	O
tops	O
of	O
some	O
hills	O
at	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
distance	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
further	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
due	O
west	O
;	O
but	O
though	O
this	O
satisfied	O
us	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
ocean	O
,	O
but	O
an	O
inland	O
sea	O
or	O
lake	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
saw	O
no	O
land	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
no	O
end	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
travel	O
eight	O
days	O
more	O
,	O
and	O
near	O
100	O
miles	O
farther	O
,	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
found	O
this	O
lake	O
or	O
sea	O
ended	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
river	O
which	O
ran	O
N.	O
or	O
N.	O
by	O
E.	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
other	O
river	O
had	O
done	O
which	O
I	O
mentioned	O
before	O
.	O

My	O
friend	O
the	O
gunner	O
,	O
upon	O
examining	O
,	O
said	O
that	O
he	O
believed	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
mistaken	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
river	O
Nile	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
still	O
of	O
the	O
mind	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
of	O
before	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
not	O
think	O
of	O
a	O
voyage	O
into	O
Egypt	O
that	O
way	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
resolved	O
upon	O
crossing	O
this	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
easy	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
the	O
river	O
being	O
very	O
rapid	O
and	O
the	O
channel	O
very	O
broad	O
.	O

It	O
cost	O
us	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
a	O
week	O
here	O
to	O
get	O
materials	O
to	O
waft	O
ourselves	O
and	O
cattle	O
over	O
this	O
river	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
here	O
were	O
stores	O
of	O
trees	O
,	O
yet	O
there	O
was	O
none	O
of	O
any	O
considerable	O
growth	O
sufficient	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
canoe	O
.	O

During	O
our	O
march	O
on	O
the	O
edge	O
of	O
this	O
bank	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
great	O
fatigue	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
travelled	O
a	O
fewer	O
miles	O
in	O
a	O
day	O
than	O
before	O
,	O
there	O
being	O
such	O
a	O
prodigious	O
number	O
of	O
little	O
rivers	O
that	O
came	O
down	O
from	O
the	O
hills	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
,	O
emptying	O
themselves	O
into	O
this	O
gulf	O
,	O
all	O
which	O
waters	O
were	O
pretty	O
high	O
,	O
the	O
rains	O
having	O
been	O
but	O
newly	O
over	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
last	O
three	O
days	O
of	O
our	O
travel	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
some	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
found	O
they	O
lived	O
upon	O
the	O
little	O
hills	O
and	O
not	O
by	O
the	O
water-side	O
;	O
nor	O
were	O
we	O
a	O
little	O
put	O
to	O
it	O
for	O
food	O
in	O
this	O
march	O
,	O
having	O
killed	O
nothing	O
for	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
days	O
but	O
some	O
fish	O
we	O
caught	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
lake	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
not	O
in	O
such	O
plenty	O
as	O
we	O
found	O
before	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
us	O
some	O
amends	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
disturbance	O
upon	O
all	O
the	O
shores	O
of	O
this	O
lake	O
from	O
any	O
wild	O
beasts	O
;	O
the	O
only	O
inconveniency	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
met	O
an	O
ugly	O
,	O
venomous	O
,	O
deformed	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
snake	O
or	O
serpent	O
in	O
the	O
wet	O
grounds	O
near	O
the	O
lake	O
,	O
that	O
several	O
times	O
pursued	O
us	O
as	O
if	O
it	O
would	O
attack	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
we	O
struck	O
or	O
threw	O
anything	O
at	O
it	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
raise	O
itself	O
up	O
and	O
hiss	O
so	O
loud	O
that	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
heard	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
.	O

It	O
had	O
a	O
hellish	O
ugly	O
deformed	O
look	O
and	O
voice	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
persuaded	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
devil	O
,	O
only	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
what	O
business	O
Satan	O
could	O
have	O
there	O
,	O
where	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
people	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
very	O
remarkable	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
now	O
travelled	O
1000	O
miles	O
without	O
meeting	O
with	O
any	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
heart	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
continent	O
of	O
Africa	PNM
,	O
where	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
never	O
man	O
set	O
his	O
foot	O
since	O
the	O
sons	O
of	O
Noah	O
spread	O
themselves	O
over	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
earth	O
.	O

Here	O
also	O
our	O
gunner	O
took	O
an	O
observation	O
with	O
his	O
forestaff	O
,	O
to	O
determine	O
our	O
latitude	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
found	O
now	O
,	O
that	O
having	O
marched	O
about	O
thirty-three	O
days	O
northward	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
6	O
degrees	O
22	O
minutes	O
south	O
latitude	O
.	O

After	O
having	O
with	O
great	O
difficulty	O
got	O
over	O
this	O
river	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
into	O
a	O
strange	O
wild	O
country	O
that	O
began	O
a	O
little	O
to	O
affright	O
us	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
the	O
country	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
desert	O
of	O
dry	O
scalding	O
sand	O
as	O
that	O
was	O
we	O
had	O
passed	O
before	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
was	O
mountainous	O
,	O
barren	O
,	O
and	O
infinitely	O
full	O
of	O
most	O
furious	O
wild	O
beasts	O
,	O
more	O
than	O
any	O
place	O
we	O
had	O
passed	O
yet	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
indeed	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
coarse	O
herbage	O
on	O
the	O
surface	O
,	O
and	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
a	O
few	O
trees	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
shrubs	O
.	O

But	O
people	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
none	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
great	O
suspense	O
about	O
victuals	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
killed	O
a	O
deer	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
,	O
but	O
had	O
lived	O
chiefly	O
upon	O
fish	O
and	O
fowl	O
,	O
always	O
by	O
the	O
water-side	O
,	O
both	O
which	O
seemed	O
to	O
fail	O
us	O
now	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
more	O
consternation	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
lay	O
in	O
a	O
stock	O
here	O
to	O
proceed	O
upon	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
did	O
before	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
set	O
out	O
with	O
scarcity	O
,	O
and	O
without	O
any	O
certainty	O
of	O
a	O
supply	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
no	O
remedy	O
but	O
patience	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
killed	O
some	O
fowls	O
and	O
dried	O
some	O
fish	O
,	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
,	O
with	O
short	O
allowance	O
,	O
we	O
reckoned	O
would	O
last	O
us	O
five	O
days	O
,	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
venture	O
,	O
and	O
venture	O
we	O
did	O
;	O
nor	O
was	O
it	O
without	O
cause	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
apprehensive	O
of	O
the	O
danger	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
travelled	O
the	O
five	O
days	O
and	O
met	O
neither	O
with	O
fish	O
nor	O
fowl	O
,	O
nor	O
four-footed	O
beast	O
,	O
whose	O
flesh	O
was	O
fit	O
to	O
eat	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
a	O
most	O
dreadful	O
apprehension	O
of	O
being	O
famished	O
to	O
death	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
sixth	O
day	O
we	O
almost	O
fasted	O
,	O
or	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
may	O
say	O
,	O
we	O
ate	O
up	O
all	O
the	O
scraps	O
of	O
what	O
we	O
had	O
left	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
night	O
lay	O
down	O
supperless	O
upon	O
our	O
mats	O
,	O
with	O
heavy	O
hearts	O
,	O
being	O
obliged	O
the	O
eighth	O
day	O
to	O
kill	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
poor	O
faithful	O
servants	O
,	O
the	O
buffaloes	O
that	O
carried	O
our	O
baggage	O
.	O

The	O
flesh	O
of	O
this	O
creature	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
sparingly	O
did	O
we	O
eat	O
of	O
it	O
that	O
it	O
lasted	O
us	O
all	O
three	O
days	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
just	O
spent	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
on	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
killing	O
another	O
when	O
we	O
saw	O
before	O
us	O
a	O
country	O
that	O
promised	O
better	O
,	O
having	O
high	O
trees	O
and	O
a	O
large	O
river	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

This	O
encouraged	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
quickened	O
our	O
march	O
for	O
the	O
river-side	O
,	O
though	O
with	O
empty	O
stomachs	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
faint	O
and	O
weak	O
;	O
but	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
this	O
river	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
good	O
hap	O
to	O
meet	O
with	O
some	O
young	O
deer	O
,	O
a	O
thing	O
we	O
had	O
long	O
wished	O
for	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
having	O
shot	O
three	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
full	O
stop	O
to	O
fill	O
our	O
bellies	O
,	O
and	O
never	O
gave	O
the	O
flesh	O
time	O
to	O
cool	O
before	O
we	O
ate	O
it	O
;	O
nay	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
much	O
we	O
could	O
stay	O
to	O
kill	O
it	O
and	O
had	O
not	O
eaten	O
it	O
alive	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
almost	O
famished	O
.	O

Through	O
all	O
that	O
inhospitable	O
country	O
we	O
saw	O
continually	O
lions	O
,	O
tigers	O
,	O
leopards	O
,	O
civet	O
cats	O
,	O
and	O
abundance	O
of	O
kinds	O
of	O
creatures	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
;	O
we	O
saw	O
no	O
elephants	O
,	O
but	O
every	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
an	O
elephant	O
's	O
tooth	O
lying	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
lying	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
half	O
buried	O
by	O
the	O
length	O
of	O
time	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
lain	O
there	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
of	O
this	O
river	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
ran	O
northerly	O
still	O
,	O
as	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
but	O
with	O
this	O
difference	O
,	O
that	O
as	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
rivers	O
were	O
N.	O
by	O
E.	O
or	O
N.N.E.	O
,	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
this	O
lay	O
N.W.N.	O
On	O
the	O
farther	O
bank	O
of	O
this	O
river	O
we	O
saw	O
some	O
sign	O
of	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
but	O
met	O
with	O
none	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
day	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
we	O
came	O
into	O
an	O
inhabited	O
country	O
,	O
the	O
people	O
all	O
negroes	O
,	O
and	O
stark	O
naked	O
,	O
without	O
shame	O
,	O
both	O
men	O
and	O
women	O
.	O

We	O
made	O
signs	O
of	O
friendship	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
them	O
a	O
very	O
frank	O
,	O
civil	O
,	O
and	O
friendly	O
sort	O
of	O
people	O
.	O

They	O
came	O
to	O
our	O
negroes	O
without	O
any	O
suspicion	O
,	O
nor	O
did	O
they	O
give	O
us	O
any	O
reason	O
to	O
suspect	O
them	O
of	O
any	O
villainy	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
others	O
had	O
done	O
;	O
we	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
them	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
hungry	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
some	O
naked	O
women	O
ran	O
and	O
fetched	O
us	O
great	O
quantities	O
of	O
roots	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
things	O
like	O
pumpkins	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
made	O
no	O
scruple	O
to	O
eat	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
artificer	O
showed	O
them	O
some	O
of	O
his	O
trinkets	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
made	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
iron	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
silver	O
,	O
but	O
none	O
of	O
gold	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
so	O
much	O
judgment	O
as	O
to	O
choose	O
that	O
of	O
silver	O
before	O
the	O
iron	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
we	O
showed	O
them	O
some	O
gold	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
value	O
it	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
either	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
.	O

For	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
things	O
they	O
brought	O
us	O
more	O
provisions	O
,	O
and	O
three	O
living	O
creatures	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
calves	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
;	O
neither	O
did	O
we	O
ever	O
see	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
before	O
;	O
their	O
flesh	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
;	O
and	O
after	O
that	O
they	O
brought	O
us	O
twelve	O
more	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
smaller	O
creatures	O
like	O
hares	O
;	O
all	O
which	O
were	O
very	O
welcome	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
indeed	O
at	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
loss	O
for	O
provisions	O
.	O

We	O
grew	O
very	O
intimate	O
with	O
these	O
people	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
they	O
were	O
the	O
civillest	O
and	O
most	O
friendly	O
people	O
that	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
and	O
mightily	O
pleased	O
with	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
very	O
particular	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
much	O
easier	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
to	O
understand	O
our	O
meaning	O
than	O
any	O
we	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
before	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
inquire	O
our	O
way	O
,	O
pointing	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
.	O

They	O
made	O
us	O
understand	O
easily	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
go	O
that	O
way	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
pointed	O
to	O
us	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
go	O
north-west	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
presently	O
understood	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
another	O
lake	O
in	O
our	O
way	O
,	O
which	O
proved	O
to	O
be	O
true	O
;	O
for	O
in	O
two	O
days	O
more	O
we	O
saw	O
it	O
plain	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
held	O
us	O
till	O
we	O
passed	O
the	O
equinoctial	O
line	O
,	O
lying	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
on	O
our	O
left	O
hand	O
,	O
though	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
.	O

Travelling	O
thus	O
northward	O
,	O
our	O
gunner	O
seemed	O
very	O
anxious	O
about	O
our	O
proceedings	O
;	O
for	O
he	O
assured	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
me	O
sensible	O
of	O
it	O
by	O
the	O
maps	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
teaching	O
me	O
out	O
of	O
,	O
that	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
six	O
degrees	O
,	O
or	O
thereabouts	O
,	O
north	O
of	O
the	O
line	O
,	O
the	O
land	O
trended	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
to	O
such	O
a	O
length	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
not	O
come	O
at	O
the	O
sea	O
under	O
a	O
march	O
of	O
above	O
1500	O
miles	O
farther	O
westward	O
than	O
the	O
country	O
we	O
desired	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
if	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
navigable	O
rivers	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
meet	O
with	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
running	O
into	O
the	O
west	O
ocean	O
,	O
might	O
perhaps	O
carry	O
us	O
down	O
their	O
stream	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
were	O
1500	O
miles	O
,	O
or	O
twice	O
1500	O
miles	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
do	O
well	O
enough	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
but	O
get	O
provisions	O
.	O

Here	O
he	O
showed	O
me	O
the	O
maps	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
appeared	O
no	O
river	O
whose	O
stream	O
was	O
of	O
any	O
such	O
a	O
length	O
as	O
to	O
do	O
any	O
kindness	O
,	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
perhaps	O
within	O
200	O
or	O
300	O
miles	O
of	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
except	O
the	O
Rio	PNM
Grande	PNM
,	O
as	O
they	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
lay	O
farther	O
northward	O
from	O
us	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
700	O
miles	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
then	O
he	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
country	O
it	O
might	O
carry	O
us	O
through	O
;	O
for	O
he	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
his	O
opinion	O
that	O
the	O
heats	O
on	O

were	O
violent	O

and	O
the	O
country	O
more	O
desolate	O
,	O
barren	O
,	O
and	O
barbarous	O
,	O
than	O
those	O
of	O
the	O
south	O

and	O
that	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
among	O
the	O
negroes	O
in	O
the	O
north	O
part	O
of	O
Africa	PNM
,	O
next	O
the	O

,	O
especially	O
those	O
who	O
had	O
seen	O
and	O
trafficked	O
with	O
the	O
Europeans	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
Dutch	O
,	O
English	O
,	O
Portuguese	O
,	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
etc.	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
been	O
so	O
ill-used	O
at	O
some	O
time	O
or	O
other	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
certainly	O
put	O
all	O
the	O
spite	O
they	O
could	O
upon	O
us	O
in	O
mere	O
revenge	O
.	O

Upon	O
these	O
considerations	O
he	O
advised	O
us	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
passed	O
this	O
lake	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
proceed	O
W.S.W.	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
a	O
little	O
inclining	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
in	O
time	O
we	O
should	O
meet	O
with	O
the	O
great	O
river	O
Congo	PNM
,	O
from	O
whence	O
the	O
coast	O
is	O
called	O
Congo	PNM
,	O
being	O
a	O
little	O
north	O
of	O
Angola	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
intended	O
at	O
first	O
to	O
go	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
if	O
ever	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Congo	PNM
.	O

He	O
said	O
,	O
yes	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
never	O
on	O
shore	O
there	O
.	O

Then	O
I	O
asked	O
him	O
how	O
we	O
should	O
get	O
from	O
thence	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O
where	O
the	O
European	O
ships	O
came	O
,	O
seeing	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
land	O
trended	O
away	O
west	O
for	O
1500	O
miles	O
,	O
we	O
must	O
have	O
all	O
that	O
shore	O
to	O
traverse	O
before	O
we	O
could	O
double	O
the	O
west	O
point	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
it	O
was	O
ten	O
to	O
one	O
but	O
we	O
should	O
hear	O
of	O
some	O
European	O
ships	O
to	O
take	O
us	O
in	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
they	O
often	O
visited	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Congo	PNM
and	O
Angola	PNM
,	O
in	O
trade	O
with	O
the	O
negroes	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
,	O
yet	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
but	O
find	O
provisions	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
make	O
our	O
way	O
as	O
well	O
along	O
the	O
sea-shore	O
as	O
along	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
Gold	PNM
Coast	PNM
,	O
which	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
was	O
not	O
above	O
400	O
or	O
500	O
miles	O
north	O
of	O
Congo	PNM
,	O
besides	O
the	O
turning	O
of	O
the	O
coast	O
west	O
about	O
300	O
more	O
;	O
that	O
shore	O
being	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
degrees	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
the	O
English	O
,	O
or	O
Dutch	O
,	O
or	O
French	O
had	O
settlements	O
or	O
factories	O
,	O
perhaps	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
confess	O
I	O
had	O
more	O
mind	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
while	O
he	O
argued	O
,	O
to	O
have	O
gone	O
northward	O
,	O
and	O
shipped	O
ourselves	O
in	O
the	O
Rio	PNM
Grande	PNM
,	O
or	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
traders	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
the	O
river	O
Negro	PNM
or	O
Niger	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
knew	O
that	O
at	O
last	O
it	O
would	O
bring	O
us	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
de	PNM
Verd	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
sure	O
of	O
relief	O
;	O
whereas	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
coast	O
we	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
now	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
prodigious	O
way	O
still	O
to	O
go	O
,	O
either	O
by	O
sea	O
or	O
land	O
,	O
and	O
no	O
certainty	O
which	O
way	O
to	O
get	O
provisions	O
but	O
by	O
force	O
;	O
but	O
for	O
the	O
present	O
I	O
held	O
my	O
tongue	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
my	O
tutor	O
's	O
opinion	O
.	O

But	O
when	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
his	O
desire	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
turn	O
southward	O
,	O
having	O
passed	O
beyond	O
the	O
second	O
great	O
lake	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
began	O
all	O
to	O
be	O
uneasy	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
way	O
for	O
certain	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
going	O
farther	O
from	O
home	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
indeed	O
far	O
enough	O
off	O
already	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
marched	O
above	O
twelve	O
days	O
more	O
,	O
eight	O
whereof	O
were	O
taken	O
up	O
in	O
rounding	O
the	O
lake	O
,	O
and	O
four	O
more	O
south-west	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
make	O
for	O
the	O
river	O
Congo	PNM
,	O
but	O
we	O
were	O
put	O
to	O
another	O
full	O
stop	O
,	O
by	O
entering	O
a	O
country	O
so	O
desolate	O
,	O
so	O
frightful	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
wild	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
to	O
think	O
or	O
do	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
besides	O
that	O
it	O
appeared	O
as	O
a	O
terrible	O
and	O
boundless	O
desert	O
,	O
having	O
neither	O
woods	O
,	O
trees	O
,	O
rivers	O
,	O
or	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
so	O
even	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
was	O
desolate	O
of	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
nor	O
had	O
we	O
any	O
way	O
to	O
gather	O
in	O
a	O
stock	O
of	O
provisions	O
for	O
the	O
passing	O
of	O
this	O
desert	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
did	O
before	O
at	O
our	O
entering	O
the	O
first	O
,	O
unless	O
we	O
had	O
marched	O
back	O
four	O
days	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
turned	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
the	O
lake	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
this	O
,	O
we	O
ventured	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
to	O
men	O
that	O
had	O
passed	O
such	O
wild	O
places	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
nothing	O
could	O
seem	O
too	O
desperate	O
to	O
undertake	O
.	O

We	O
ventured	O
,	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
rather	O
because	O
we	O
saw	O
very	O
high	O
mountains	O
in	O
our	O
way	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
imagined	O
,	O
wherever	O
there	O
were	O
mountains	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
springs	O
and	O
rivers	O
;	O
where	O
rivers	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
trees	O
and	O
grass	O
;	O
where	O
trees	O
and	O
grass	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
cattle	O
;	O
and	O
where	O
cattle	O
,	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
inhabitants	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
,	O
in	O
consequence	O
of	O
this	O
speculative	O
philosophy	O
,	O
we	O
entered	O
this	O
waste	O
,	O
having	O
a	O
great	O
heap	O
of	O
roots	O
and	O
plants	O
for	O
our	O
bread	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
Indians	O
gave	O
us	O
,	O
a	O
very	O
little	O
flesh	O
or	O
salt	O
,	O
and	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
water	O
.	O

We	O
travelled	O
two	O
days	O
towards	O
those	O
hills	O
,	O
and	O
still	O
they	O
seemed	O
as	O
far	O
off	O
as	O
they	O
did	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
fifth	O
day	O
before	O
we	O
got	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
indeed	O
,	O
we	O
travelled	O
but	O
softly	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
excessively	O
hot	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
much	O
about	O
the	O
very	O
equinoctial	O
line	O
,	O
we	O
hardly	O
knew	O
whether	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
or	O
the	O
north	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
had	O
concluded	O
,	O
that	O
where	O
there	O
were	O
hills	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
springs	O
,	O
so	O
it	O
happened	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
only	O
surprised	O
,	O
but	O
really	O
frighted	O
,	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
first	O
spring	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
looked	O
admirably	O
clear	O
and	O
beautiful	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
salt	O
as	O
brine	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
terrible	O
disappointment	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
us	O
under	O
melancholy	O
apprehensions	O
at	O
first	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
gunner	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
of	O
a	O
spirit	O
never	O
discouraged	O
,	O
told	O
us	O
we	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
disturbed	O
at	O
that	O
,	O
but	O
be	O
very	O
thankful	O
,	O
for	O
salt	O
was	O
a	O
bait	O
we	O
stood	O
in	O
as	O
much	O
need	O
of	O
as	O
anything	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
question	O
but	O
we	O
should	O
find	O
fresh	O
water	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
salt	O
;	O
and	O
here	O
our	O
surgeon	O
stepped	O
in	O
to	O
encourage	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
he	O
would	O
show	O
us	O
a	O
way	O
how	O
to	O
make	O
that	O
salt	O
water	O
fresh	O
,	O
which	O
indeed	O
made	O
us	O
all	O
more	O
cheerful	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
wondered	O
what	O
he	O
meant	O
.	O

Meantime	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
without	O
bidding	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
seeking	O
about	O
for	O
other	O
springs	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
several	O
;	O
but	O
still	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
salt	O
;	O
from	O
whence	O
we	O
concluded	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
salt	O
rock	O
or	O
mineral	O
stone	O
in	O
those	O
mountains	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
all	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
substance	O
;	O
but	O
still	O
I	O
wondered	O
by	O
what	O
witchcraft	O
it	O
was	O
that	O
our	O
artist	O
the	O
surgeon	O
would	O
make	O
this	O
salt	O
water	O
turn	O
fresh	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
longed	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
experiment	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
indeed	O
a	O
very	O
odd	O
one	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
as	O
much	O
assurance	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
tried	O
it	O
on	O
the	O
very	O
spot	O
before	O
.	O

He	O
took	O
two	O
of	O
our	O
large	O
mats	O
and	O
sewed	O
them	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
made	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
bag	O
four	O
feet	O
broad	O
,	O
three	O
feet	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
high	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
a	O
foot	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
thick	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
full	O
.	O

He	O
caused	O
us	O
to	O
fill	O
this	O
bag	O
with	O
dry	O
sand	O
and	O
tread	O
it	O
down	O
as	O
close	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
not	O
to	O
burst	O
the	O
mats	O
.	O

When	O
thus	O
the	O
bag	O
was	O
full	O
within	O
a	O
foot	O
,	O
he	O
sought	O
some	O
other	O
earth	O
and	O
filled	O
up	O
the	O
rest	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
still	O
trod	O
all	O
in	O
as	O
hard	O
as	O
he	O
could	O
.	O

When	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
he	O
made	O
a	O
hole	O
in	O
the	O
upper	O
earth	O
about	O
as	O
broad	O
as	O
the	O
crown	O
of	O
a	O
large	O
hat	O
,	O
or	O
something	O
bigger	O
about	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
so	O
deep	O
,	O
and	O
bade	O
a	O
negro	O
fill	O
it	O
with	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
still	O
as	O
it	O
shrunk	O
away	O
to	O
fill	O
it	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
keep	O
it	O
full	O
.	O

The	O
bag	O
he	O
had	O
placed	O
at	O
first	O
across	O
two	O
pieces	O
of	O
wood	O
,	O
about	O
a	O
foot	O
from	O
the	O
ground	O
;	O
and	O
under	O
it	O
he	O
ordered	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
skins	O
to	O
be	O
spread	O
that	O
would	O
hold	O
water	O
.	O

In	O
about	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
sooner	O
,	O
the	O
water	O
began	O
to	O
come	O
dropping	O
through	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
the	O
bag	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
surprise	O
,	O
was	O
perfectly	O
fresh	O
and	O
sweet	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
continued	O
for	O
several	O
hours	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
end	O
the	O
water	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
brackish	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
,	O
``	O
Well	O
,	O
then	O
,	O
''	O
said	O
he	O
,	O
``	O
turn	O
the	O
sand	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
fill	O
it	O
again	O
.	O
''	O

Whether	O
he	O
did	O
this	O
by	O
way	O
of	O
experiment	O
from	O
his	O
own	O
fancy	O
,	O
or	O
whether	O
he	O
had	O
seen	O
it	O
done	O
before	O
,	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
remember	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
we	O
mounted	O
the	O
tops	O
of	O
the	O
hills	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
prospect	O
was	O
indeed	O
astonishing	O
,	O
for	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
eye	O
could	O
look	O
,	O
south	O
,	O
or	O
west	O
,	O
or	O
northwest	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
nothing	O
to	O
be	O

but	O
a	O
vast	O
howling	O
wilderness	O
,	O
with	O
neither	O

nor	O
any	O

The	O
surface	O
we	O
found	O

as	O
the	O
part	O
we	O
passed	O
the	O
day	O

had	O
a	O

for	O
man	O
or	O

Had	O
we	O
been	O
stored	O
with	O
provisions	O
to	O
have	O
entered	O
for	O
ten	O
or	O
twenty	O
days	O
upon	O
this	O
wilderness	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
formerly	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
fresh	O
water	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
hearts	O
good	O
enough	O
to	O
have	O
ventured	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
obliged	O
to	O
come	O
back	O
again	O
,	O
for	O
if	O
we	O
went	O
north	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
but	O
we	O
might	O
meet	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
neither	O
had	O
provisions	O
,	O
neither	O
were	O
we	O
in	O
any	O
place	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
possible	O
to	O
get	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
killed	O
some	O
wild	O
ferine	O
creatures	O
at	O
the	O
foot	O
of	O
these	O
hills	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
except	O
two	O
things	O
,	O
like	O
to	O
nothing	O
that	O
we	O
ever	O
saw	O
before	O
,	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
nothing	O
that	O
was	O
fit	O
to	O
eat	O
.	O

These	O
were	O
creatures	O
that	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
between	O
the	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
buffalo	O
and	O
a	O
deer	O
,	O
but	O
indeed	O
resembled	O
neither	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
horns	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
great	O
legs	O
like	O
a	O
cow	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
fine	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
neck	O
like	O
a	O
deer	O
.	O

We	O
killed	O
also	O
,	O
at	O
several	O
times	O
,	O
a	O
tiger	O
,	O
two	O
young	O
lions	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
wolf	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
God	O
be	O
thanked	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
so	O
reduced	O
as	O
to	O
eat	O
carrion	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
terrible	O
prospect	O
I	O
renewed	O
my	O
motion	O
of	O
turning	O
northward	O
,	O
and	O
making	O
towards	O
the	O
river	O
Niger	O
or	O
Rio	PNM
Grande	PNM
,	O
then	O
to	O
turn	O
west	O
towards	O
the	O
English	O
settlements	O
on	O
the	O
Gold	PNM
Coast	PNM
;	O
to	O
which	O
every	O
one	O
most	O
readily	O
consented	O
,	O
only	O
our	O
gunner	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
indeed	O
our	O
best	O
guide	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
happened	O
to	O
be	O
mistaken	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
.	O

He	O
moved	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
our	O
coast	O
was	O
now	O
northward	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
might	O
slant	O
away	O
north-west	O
,	O
that	O
so	O
,	O
by	O
crossing	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
perhaps	O
meet	O
with	O
some	O
other	O
river	O
that	O
run	O
into	O
the	O
Rio	PNM
Grande	PNM
northward	O
,	O
or	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
Gold	PNM
Coast	PNM
southward	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
both	O
direct	O
our	O
way	O
and	O
shorten	O
the	O
labour	O
;	O
as	O
also	O
because	O
,	O
if	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
was	O
inhabited	O
and	O
fruitful	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
probably	O
find	O
it	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
of	O
the	O
rivers	O
,	O
where	O
alone	O
we	O
could	O
be	O
furnished	O
with	O
provisions	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
good	O
advice	O
,	O
and	O
too	O
rational	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
;	O
but	O
our	O
present	O
business	O
was	O
,	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
this	O
dreadful	O
place	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
.	O

Behind	O
us	O
was	O
a	O
waste	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
already	O
cost	O
us	O
five	O
days	O
'	O
march	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
provisions	O
for	O
five	O
days	O
left	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
again	O
the	O
same	O
way	O
.	O

Before	O
us	O
was	O
nothing	O
but	O
horror	O
,	O
as	O
above	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
resolved	O
,	O
seeing	O
the	O
ridge	O
of	O
the	O
hills	O
we	O
were	O
upon	O
had	O
some	O
appearance	O
of	O
fruitfulness	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
lead	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
,	O
to	O
keep	O
under	O
the	O
foot	O
of	O
them	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
,	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
meantime	O
to	O
look	O
diligently	O
out	O
for	O
food	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
we	O
moved	O
on	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
time	O
to	O
lose	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
comfort	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
in	O
our	O
first	O
morning	O
's	O
march	O
to	O
very	O
good	O
springs	O
of	O
fresh	O
water	O
;	O
and	O
lest	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
a	O
scarcity	O
again	O
,	O
we	O
filled	O
all	O
our	O
bladder	O
bottles	O
and	O
carried	O
it	O
with	O
us	O
.	O

I	O
should	O
also	O
have	O
observed	O
that	O
our	O
surgeon	O
,	O
who	O
made	O
the	O
salt	O
water	O
fresh	O
,	O
took	O
the	O
opportunity	O
of	O
those	O
salt	O
springs	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
us	O
the	O
quantity	O
of	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
pecks	O
of	O
very	O
good	O
salt	O
.	O

In	O
our	O
third	O
march	O
we	O
found	O
an	O
unexpected	O
supply	O
of	O
food	O
,	O
the	O
hills	O
being	O
full	O
of	O
hares	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
of	O
a	O
kind	O
something	O
different	O
from	O
ours	O
in	O
England	PNM
,	O
larger	O
and	O
not	O
as	O
swift	O
of	O
foot	O
,	O
but	O
very	O
good	O
meat	O
.	O

We	O
shot	O
several	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
little	O
tame	O
leopard	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
told	O
you	O
we	O
took	O
at	O
the	O
negro	O
town	O
that	O
we	O
plundered	O
,	O
hunted	O
them	O
like	O
a	O
dog	O
,	O
and	O
killed	O
us	O
several	O
every	O
day	O
;	O
but	O
she	O
would	O
eat	O
nothing	O
of	O
them	O
unless	O
we	O
gave	O
it	O
her	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
in	O
our	O
circumstance	O
,	O
was	O
very	O
obliging	O
.	O

We	O
salted	O
them	O
a	O
little	O
and	O
dried	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
whole	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
a	O
strange	O
parcel	O
along	O
with	O
us	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
almost	O
three	O
hundred	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
when	O
we	O
might	O
find	O
any	O
more	O
,	O
either	O
of	O
these	O
or	O
any	O
other	O
food	O
.	O

We	O
continued	O
our	O
course	O
under	O
these	O
hills	O
very	O
comfortably	O
for	O
eight	O
or	O
nine	O
days	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
found	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
the	O
country	O
beyond	O
us	O
began	O
to	O
look	O
with	O
something	O
of	O
a	O
better	O
countenance	O
.	O

As	O
for	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
hills	O
,	O
we	O
never	O
examined	O
it	O
till	O
this	O
day	O
,	O
when	O
three	O
of	O
our	O
company	O
,	O
the	O
rest	O
halting	O
for	O
refreshment	O
,	O
mounted	O
the	O
hills	O
again	O
to	O
satisfy	O
their	O
curiosity	O
,	O
but	O
found	O
it	O
all	O
the	O
same	O
,	O
nor	O
could	O
they	O
see	O
any	O
end	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
no	O
,	O
not	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
,	O
the	O
way	O
we	O
were	O
going	O
;	O
so	O
the	O
tenth	O
day	O
,	O
finding	O
the	O
hills	O
made	O
a	O
turn	O
,	O
and	O
led	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
into	O
the	O
vast	O
desert	O
,	O
we	O
left	O
them	O
and	O
continued	O
our	O
course	O
north	O
,	O
the	O
country	O
being	O
very	O
tolerably	O
full	O
of	O
woods	O
,	O
some	O
waste	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
tediously	O
long	O
,	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
,	O
by	O
our	O
gunner	O
's	O
observation	O
,	O
into	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
eight	O
degrees	O
five	O
minutes	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
nineteen	O
days	O
more	O
in	O
performing	O
.	O

All	O
this	O
way	O
we	O
found	O
no	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
but	O
abundance	O
of	O
wild	O
ravenous	O
creatures	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
we	O
became	O
so	O
well	O
acquainted	O
now	O
that	O
really	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
much	O
mind	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
lions	O
and	O
tigers	O
and	O
leopards	O
every	O
night	O
and	O
morning	O
in	O
abundance	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
they	O
seldom	O
came	O
near	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
let	O
them	O
go	O
about	O
their	O
business	O
:	O
if	O
they	O
offered	O
to	O
come	O
near	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
false	O
fire	O
with	O
any	O
gun	O
that	O
was	O
uncharged	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
would	O
walk	O
off	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
saw	O
the	O
flash	O
.	O

We	O
made	O
pretty	O
good	O
shift	O
for	O
food	O
all	O
this	O
way	O
;	O
for	O
sometimes	O
we	O
killed	O
hares	O
,	O
sometimes	O
some	O
fowls	O
,	O
but	O
for	O
my	O
life	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
give	O
names	O
to	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
except	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
partridge	O
,	O
and	O
another	O
that	O
was	O
like	O
our	O
turtle	O
.	O

Now	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
meet	O
with	O
elephants	O
again	O
in	O
great	O
numbers	O
;	O
those	O
creatures	O
delighted	O
chiefly	O
in	O
the	O
woody	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
.	O

This	O
long-continued	O
march	O
fatigued	O
us	O
very	O
much	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
fell	O
sick	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
so	O
very	O
sick	O
that	O
we	O
thought	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
died	O
;	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
negroes	O
died	O
suddenly	O
.	O

Our	O
surgeon	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
an	O
apoplexy	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
wondered	O
at	O
it	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
could	O
never	O
complain	O
of	O
his	O
high	O
feeding	O
.	O

Another	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
very	O
ill	O
;	O
but	O
our	O
surgeon	O
with	O
much	O
ado	O
persuading	O
him	O
,	O
indeed	O
it	O
was	O
almost	O
forcing	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
let	O
blood	O
,	O
he	O
recovered	O
.	O

We	O
halted	O
here	O
twelve	O
days	O
for	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
our	O
sick	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
surgeon	O
persuaded	O
me	O
and	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
more	O
of	O
us	O
to	O
be	O
let	O
blood	O
during	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
rest	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
with	O
other	O
things	O
he	O
gave	O
us	O
,	O
contributed	O
very	O
much	O
to	O
our	O
continued	O
health	O
in	O
so	O
tedious	O
a	O
march	O
and	O
in	O
so	O
hot	O
a	O
climate	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
march	O
we	O
pitched	O
our	O
matted	O
tents	O
every	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
comfortable	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
trees	O
and	O
woods	O
to	O
shelter	O
us	O
in	O
most	O
places	O
.	O

We	O
thought	O
it	O
very	O
strange	O
that	O
in	O
all	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
we	O
yet	O
met	O
with	O
no	O
inhabitants	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
principal	O
reason	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
found	O
afterwards	O
,	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
,	O
having	O
kept	O
a	O
western	O
course	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
a	O
northern	O
course	O
,	O
were	O
gotten	O
too	O
much	O
into	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
and	O
among	O
the	O
deserts	O
;	O
whereas	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
are	O
principally	O
found	O
among	O
the	O
rivers	O
,	O
lakes	O
,	O
and	O
lowlands	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
to	O
the	O
south-west	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
.	O

What	O
little	O
rivulets	O
we	O
found	O
here	O
were	O
so	O
empty	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
that	O
except	O
some	O
pits	O
,	O
and	O
little	O
more	O
than	O
ordinary	O
pools	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
scarcely	O
any	O
water	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
in	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
rather	O
showed	O
that	O
during	O
the	O
rainy	O
months	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
channel	O
,	O
than	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
really	O
running	O
water	O
in	O
them	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
it	O
was	O
easy	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
judge	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
to	O
go	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
was	O
no	O
discouragement	O
so	O
long	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
but	O
provisions	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
seasonable	O
shelter	O
from	O
the	O
violent	O
heat	O
,	O
which	O
indeed	O
I	O
thought	O
was	O
much	O
greater	O
now	O
than	O
when	O
the	O
sun	O
was	O
just	O
over	O
our	O
heads	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
being	O
recovered	O
,	O
we	O
set	O
forward	O
again	O
,	O
very	O
well	O
stored	O
with	O
provisions	O
,	O
and	O
water	O
sufficient	O
,	O
and	O
bending	O
our	O
course	O
a	O
little	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
of	O
the	O
north	O
,	O
travelled	O
in	O
hopes	O
of	O
some	O
favourable	O
stream	O
which	O
might	O
bear	O
a	O
canoe	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
found	O
none	O
till	O
after	O
twenty	O
days	O
'	O
travel	O
,	O
including	O
eight	O
days	O
'	O
rest	O
;	O
for	O
our	O
men	O
being	O
weak	O
,	O
we	O
rested	O
very	O
often	O
,	O
especially	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
places	O
which	O
were	O
proper	O
for	O
our	O
purpose	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
found	O
cattle	O
,	O
fowl	O
,	O
or	O
anything	O
to	O
kill	O
for	O
our	O
food	O
.	O

In	O
those	O
twenty	O
days	O
'	O
march	O
we	O
advanced	O
four	O
degrees	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
,	O
besides	O
some	O
meridian	O
distance	O
westward	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
abundance	O
of	O
elephants	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
a	O
good	O
number	O
of	O
elephants	O
'	O
teeth	O
scattered	O
up	O
and	O
down	O
,	O
here	O
and	O
there	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
woody	O
grounds	O
especially	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
which	O
were	O
very	O
large	O
.	O

But	O
they	O
were	O
no	O
booty	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
our	O
business	O
was	O
provisions	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
good	O
passage	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
much	O
more	O
to	O
our	O
purpose	O
to	O
have	O
found	O
a	O
good	O
fat	O
deer	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
have	O
killed	O
it	O
for	O
our	O
food	O
,	O
than	O
a	O
hundred	O
ton	O
of	O
elephants	O
'	O
teeth	O
;	O
and	O
yet	O
,	O
as	O
you	O
shall	O
presently	O
hear	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
begin	O
our	O
passage	O
by	O
water	O
,	O
we	O
once	O
thought	O
to	O
have	O
built	O
a	O
large	O
canoe	O
,	O
on	O
purpose	O
to	O
have	O
loaded	O
it	O
with	O
ivory	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
was	O
when	O
we	O
knew	O
nothing	O
of	O
the	O
rivers	O
,	O
nor	O
knew	O
anything	O
how	O
dangerous	O
and	O
how	O
difficult	O
a	O
passage	O
it	O
was	O
we	O
were	O
likely	O
to	O
have	O
in	O
them	O
,	O
nor	O
had	O
considered	O
the	O
weight	O
of	O
carriage	O
to	O
lug	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
rivers	O
where	O
we	O
might	O
embark	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
twenty	O
days	O
'	O
travel	O
,	O
as	O
above	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
three	O
degrees	O
sixteen	O
minutes	O
,	O
we	O
discovered	O
in	O
a	O
valley	O
,	O
at	O
some	O
distance	O
from	O
us	O
,	O
a	O
pretty	O
tolerable	O
stream	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
thought	O
deserved	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
a	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
ran	O
its	O
course	O
N.N.W.	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
just	O
what	O
we	O
wanted	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
had	O
fixed	O
our	O
thoughts	O
upon	O
our	O
passage	O
by	O
water	O
,	O
we	O
took	O
this	O
for	O
the	O
place	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
experiment	O
,	O
and	O
bent	O
our	O
march	O
directly	O
to	O
the	O
valley	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
small	O
thicket	O
of	O
trees	O
just	O
in	O
our	O
way	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
went	O
by	O
,	O
thinking	O
no	O
harm	O
,	O
when	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
negroes	O
was	O
dangerously	O
wounded	O
with	O
an	O
arrow	O
shot	O
into	O
his	O
back	O
,	O
slanting	O
between	O
his	O
shoulders	O
.	O

This	O
put	O
us	O
to	O
a	O
full	O
stop	O
;	O
and	O
three	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
with	O
two	O
negroes	O
,	O
spreading	O
the	O
wood	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
but	O
a	O
small	O
one	O
,	O
found	O
a	O
negro	O
with	O
a	O
bow	O
,	O
but	O
no	O
arrow	O
,	O
who	O
would	O
have	O
escaped	O
,	O
but	O
our	O
men	O
that	O
discovered	O
him	O
shot	O
him	O
in	O
revenge	O
of	O
the	O
mischief	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
lost	O
the	O
opportunity	O
of	O
taking	O
him	O
prisoner	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
and	O
sent	O
him	O
home	O
with	O
good	O
usage	O
,	O
it	O
might	O
have	O
brought	O
others	O
to	O
us	O
in	O
a	O
friendly	O
manner	O
.	O

Going	O
a	O
little	O
farther	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
five	O
negro	O
huts	O
or	O
houses	O
,	O
built	O
after	O
a	O
different	O
manner	O
from	O
any	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
yet	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
door	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
lay	O
seven	O
elephants	O
'	O
teeth	O
,	O
piled	O
up	O
against	O
the	O
wall	O
or	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
hut	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
provided	O
against	O
a	O
market	O
.	O

Here	O
were	O
no	O
men	O
,	O
but	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
women	O
,	O
and	O
near	O
twenty	O
children	O
.	O

We	O
offered	O
them	O
no	O
incivility	O
of	O
any	O
kind	O
,	O
but	O
gave	O
them	O
every	O
one	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
silver	O
beaten	O
out	O
thin	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
observed	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
cut	O
diamond	O
fashion	O
,	O
or	O
in	O
the	O
shape	O
of	O
a	O
bird	O
,	O
at	O
which	O
the	O
women	O
were	O
overjoyed	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
out	O
to	O
us	O
several	O
sorts	O
of	O
food	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
,	O
being	O
cakes	O
of	O
a	O
meal	O
made	O
of	O
roots	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
bake	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
ate	O
very	O
well	O
.	O

We	O
went	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
farther	O
and	O
pitched	O
our	O
camp	O
for	O
that	O
night	O
,	O
not	O
doubting	O
but	O
our	O
civility	O
to	O
the	O
women	O
would	O
produce	O
some	O
good	O
effect	O
when	O
their	O
husbands	O
might	O
come	O
home	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
the	O
women	O
,	O
with	O
eleven	O
men	O
,	O
five	O
young	O
boys	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
good	O
big	O
girls	O
,	O
came	O
to	O
our	O
camp	O
.	O

Before	O
they	O
came	O
quite	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
the	O
women	O
called	O
aloud	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
an	O
odd	O
screaming	O
noise	O
to	O
bring	O
us	O
out	O
;	O
and	O
accordingly	O
we	O
came	O
out	O
,	O
when	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
women	O
,	O
showing	O
us	O
what	O
we	O
had	O
given	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
pointing	O
to	O
the	O
company	O
behind	O
,	O
made	O
such	O
signs	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
easily	O
understand	O
signified	O
friendship	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
men	O
advanced	O
,	O
having	O
bows	O
and	O
arrows	O
,	O
they	O
laid	O
them	O
down	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
scraped	O
and	O
threw	O
sand	O
over	O
their	O
heads	O
,	O
and	O
turned	O
round	O
three	O
times	O
with	O
their	O
hands	O
laid	O
up	O
upon	O
the	O
tops	O
of	O
their	O
heads	O
.	O

This	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
solemn	O
vow	O
of	O
friendship	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
we	O
beckoned	O
them	O
with	O
our	O
hands	O
to	O
come	O
nearer	O
;	O
then	O
they	O
sent	O
the	O
boys	O
and	O
girls	O
to	O
us	O
first	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
was	O
to	O
bring	O
us	O
more	O
cakes	O
of	O
bread	O
and	O
some	O
green	O
herbs	O
to	O
eat	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
received	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
the	O
boys	O
up	O
and	O
kissed	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
little	O
girls	O
too	O
;	O
then	O
the	O
men	O
came	O
up	O
close	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
sat	O
them	O
down	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
making	O
signs	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
sit	O
down	O
by	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
.	O

They	O
said	O
much	O
to	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
understand	O
them	O
,	O
nor	O
could	O
we	O
find	O
any	O
way	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
understand	O
us	O
,	O
much	O
less	O
whither	O
we	O
were	O
going	O
,	O
or	O
what	O
we	O
wanted	O
,	O
only	O
that	O
we	O
easily	O
made	O
them	O
understand	O
we	O
wanted	O
victuals	O
;	O
whereupon	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
casting	O
his	O
eyes	O
about	O
him	O
towards	O
a	O
rising	O
ground	O
that	O
was	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
off	O
,	O
started	O
up	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
was	O
frighted	O
,	O
flew	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
laid	O
down	O
their	O
bows	O
and	O
arrows	O
,	O
snatched	O
up	O
a	O
bow	O
and	O
two	O
arrows	O
,	O
and	O
ran	O
like	O
a	O
racehorse	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
.	O

When	O
he	O
came	O
there	O
,	O
he	O
let	O
fly	O
both	O
his	O
arrows	O
,	O
and	O
comes	O
back	O
again	O
to	O
us	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
speed	O
.	O

We	O
,	O
seeing	O
he	O
came	O
with	O
the	O
bow	O
,	O
but	O
without	O
the	O
arrows	O
,	O
were	O
the	O
more	O
inquisitive	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
fellow	O
,	O
saying	O
nothing	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
beckons	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
negroes	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
bid	O
him	O
go	O
;	O
so	O
he	O
led	O
him	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
where	O
lay	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
deer	O
,	O
shot	O
with	O
two	O
arrows	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
quite	O
dead	O
,	O
and	O
between	O
them	O
they	O
brought	O
it	O
down	O
to	O
us	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
for	O
a	O
gift	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
very	O
welcome	O
,	O
I	O
assure	O
you	O
,	O
for	O
our	O
stock	O
was	O
low	O
.	O

These	O
people	O
were	O
all	O
stark	O
naked	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
there	O
came	O
about	O
a	O
hundred	O
men	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
women	O
making	O
the	O
same	O
awkward	O
signals	O
of	O
friendship	O
,	O
and	O
dancing	O
,	O
and	O
showing	O
themselves	O
very	O
well	O
pleased	O
,	O
and	O
anything	O
they	O
had	O
they	O
gave	O
us	O
.	O

How	O
the	O
man	O
in	O
the	O
wood	O
came	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
butcherly	O
and	O
rude	O
as	O
to	O
shoot	O
at	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
without	O
making	O
any	O
breach	O
first	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
imagine	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
people	O
were	O
simple	O
,	O
plain	O
,	O
and	O
inoffensive	O
in	O
all	O
our	O
other	O
conversation	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

From	O
hence	O
we	O
went	O
down	O
the	O
banks	O
of	O
the	O
little	O
river	O
I	O
mentioned	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
see	O
the	O
whole	O
nation	O
of	O
negroes	O
,	O
but	O
whether	O
friendly	O
to	O
us	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
make	O
no	O
judgment	O
of	O
yet	O
.	O

The	O
river	O
was	O
no	O
use	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
design	O
of	O
making	O
canoes	O
,	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
traversed	O
the	O
country	O
on	O
the	O
edge	O
of	O
it	O
about	O
five	O
days	O
more	O
,	O
when	O
our	O
carpenters	O
,	O
finding	O
the	O
stream	O
increased	O
,	O
proposed	O
to	O
pitch	O
our	O
tents	O
,	O
and	O
fall	O
to	O
work	O
to	O
make	O
canoes	O
;	O
but	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
begun	O
the	O
work	O
,	O
and	O
cut	O
down	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
trees	O
,	O
and	O
spent	O
five	O
days	O
in	O
the	O
labour	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
wandering	O
further	O
down	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
brought	O
us	O
word	O
that	O
the	O
stream	O
rather	O
decreased	O
than	O
increased	O
,	O
sinking	O
away	O
into	O
the	O
sands	O
,	O
or	O
drying	O
up	O
by	O
the	O
heat	O
of	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
river	O
appeared	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
carry	O
the	O
least	O
canoe	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
any	O
way	O
useful	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
give	O
over	O
our	O
enterprise	O
and	O
move	O
on	O
.	O

In	O
our	O
further	O
prospect	O
this	O
way	O
,	O
we	O
marched	O
three	O
days	O
full	O
west	O
,	O
the	O
country	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
being	O
extraordinary	O
mountainous	O
,	O
and	O
more	O
parched	O
and	O
dry	O
than	O
any	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
yet	O
;	O
whereas	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
part	O
which	O
looks	O
due	O
west	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
pleasant	O
valley	O
running	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
between	O
two	O
great	O
ridges	O
of	O
mountains	O
.	O

The	O
hills	O
looked	O
frightful	O
,	O
being	O
entirely	O
bare	O
of	O
trees	O
or	O
grass	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
white	O
with	O
the	O
dryness	O
of	O
the	O
sand	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
valley	O
we	O
had	O
trees	O
,	O
grass	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
creatures	O
that	O
were	O
fit	O
for	O
food	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
inhabitants	O
.	O

We	O
passed	O
by	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
huts	O
or	O
houses	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
people	O
about	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
ran	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
hills	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
saw	O
us	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
this	O
valley	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
a	O
peopled	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
first	O
it	O
put	O
us	O
to	O
some	O
doubt	O
whether	O
we	O
should	O
go	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
or	O
keep	O
up	O
towards	O
the	O
hills	O
northerly	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
our	O
aim	O
was	O
principally	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
our	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
river	O
Niger	O
,	O
we	O
inclined	O
to	O
the	O
latter	O
,	O
pursuing	O
our	O
course	O
by	O
the	O
compass	O
to	O
the	O
N.W.	O
.	O

We	O
marched	O
thus	O
without	O
interruption	O
seven	O
days	O
more	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
a	O
surprising	O
circumstance	O
much	O
more	O
desolate	O
and	O
disconsolate	O
than	O
our	O
own	O

and	O
which	O
,	O
in	O
time	O
to	O
come	O

will	O
scarce	O
seem	O
credible	O

We	O
did	O
not	O
much	O
seek	O
the	O
conversing	O
,	O
or	O
acquainting	O
ourselves	O
with	O
the	O
natives	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
except	O
where	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
them	O
for	O
our	O
provision	O
,	O
or	O
their	O
direction	O
for	O
our	O
way	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
whereas	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
country	O
here	O
begin	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
populous	O
,	O
especially	O
towards	O
our	O
left	O
hand	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
,	O
we	O
kept	O
at	O
the	O
more	O
distance	O
northerly	O
,	O
still	O
stretching	O
towards	O
the	O
west	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
tract	O
we	O
found	O
something	O
or	O
other	O
to	O
kill	O
and	O
eat	O
,	O
which	O
always	O
supplied	O
our	O
necessity	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
so	O
well	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
provided	O
in	O
our	O
first	O
setting	O
out	O
;	O
being	O
thus	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
pushing	O
to	O
avoid	O
a	O
peopled	O
country	O
,	O
we	O
at	O
last	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
very	O
pleasant	O
,	O
agreeable	O
stream	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
not	O
big	O
enough	O
to	O
be	O
called	O
a	O
river	O
,	O
but	O
running	O
to	O
the	O
N.N.W.	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
very	O
course	O
we	O
desired	O
to	O
go	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
farthest	O
bank	O
of	O
this	O
brook	O
,	O
we	O
perceived	O
some	O
huts	O
of	O
negroes	O
,	O
not	O
many	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
low	O
spot	O
of	O
ground	O
,	O
some	O
maize	O
,	O
or	O
Indian	O
corn	O
,	O
growing	O
,	O
which	O
intimated	O
presently	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
some	O
inhabitants	O
on	O
that	O
side	O
less	O
barbarous	O
than	O
what	O
we	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
in	O
other	O
places	O
where	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
went	O
forward	O
,	O
our	O
whole	O
caravan	O
being	O
in	O
a	O
body	O
,	O
our	O
negroes	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
front	O
,	O
cried	O
out	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
saw	O
a	O
white	O
man	O
!	O

We	O
were	O
not	O
much	O
surprised	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
it	O
being	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
thought	O
,	O
a	O
mistake	O
of	O
the	O
fellows	O
,	O
and	O
asked	O
them	O
what	O
they	O
meant	O
;	O
when	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
stepped	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
pointing	O
to	O
a	O
hut	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
astonished	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
white	O
man	O
indeed	O
,	O
but	O
stark	O
naked	O
,	O
very	O
busy	O
near	O
the	O
door	O
of	O
his	O
hut	O
,	O
and	O
stooping	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
ground	O
with	O
something	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
at	O
some	O
work	O
;	O
and	O
his	O
back	O
being	O
towards	O
us	O
,	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
see	O
us	O
.	O

I	O
gave	O
notice	O
to	O
our	O
negroes	O
to	O
make	O
no	O
noise	O
,	O
and	O
waited	O
till	O
some	O
more	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
were	O
come	O
up	O
,	O
to	O
show	O
the	O
sight	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
sure	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
mistaken	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
soon	O
satisfied	O
of	O
the	O
truth	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
man	O
,	O
having	O
heard	O
some	O
noise	O
,	O
started	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
looked	O
full	O
at	O
us	O
,	O
as	O
much	O
surprised	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
but	O
whether	O
with	O
fear	O
or	O
hope	O
,	O
we	O
then	O
knew	O
not	O
.	O

As	O
he	O
discovered	O
us	O
,	O
so	O
did	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
huts	O
about	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
crowded	O
together	O
,	O
looking	O
at	O
us	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
a	O
little	O
bottom	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
brook	O
ran	O
,	O
lying	O
between	O
us	O
;	O
the	O
white	O
man	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
told	O
us	O
afterwards	O
,	O
not	O
knowing	O
well	O
whether	O
they	O
should	O
stay	O
or	O
run	O
away	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
it	O
presently	O
came	O
into	O
my	O
thoughts	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
there	O
were	O
white	O
men	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
much	O
easier	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
understand	O
what	O
we	O
meant	O
as	O
to	O
peace	O
or	O
war	O
,	O
than	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
with	O
others	O
;	O
so	O
tying	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
white	O
rag	O
to	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
a	O
stick	O
,	O
we	O
sent	O
two	O
negroes	O
with	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
bank	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
carrying	O
the	O
pole	O
up	O
as	O
high	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
presently	O
understood	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
of	O
their	O
men	O
and	O
the	O
white	O
man	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
white	O
man	O
spoke	O
no	O
Portuguese	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
understand	O
nothing	O
of	O
one	O
another	O
but	O
by	O
signs	O
;	O
but	O
our	O
men	O
made	O
the	O
white	O
man	O
understand	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
white	O
men	O
with	O
them	O
too	O
,	O
at	O
which	O
they	O
said	O
the	O
white	O
man	O
laughed	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
short	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
came	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
us	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
good	O
friends	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
about	O
an	O
hour	O
four	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
two	O
negroes	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
black	O
prince	O
,	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
river-side	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
white	O
man	O
came	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
half	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
negro	O
came	O
running	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
the	O
white	O
man	O
was	O
Inglese	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
called	O
him	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
I	O
ran	O
back	O
,	O
eagerly	O
enough	O
,	O
you	O
may	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
an	O
Englishman	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
he	O
embraced	O
me	O
very	O
passionately	O
,	O
the	O
tears	O
running	O
down	O
his	O
face	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
surprise	O
of	O
his	O
seeing	O
us	O
was	O
over	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
,	O
but	O
any	O
one	O
may	O
conceive	O
it	O
by	O
the	O
brief	O
account	O
he	O
gave	O
us	O
afterwards	O
of	O
his	O
very	O
unhappy	O
circumstances	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
so	O
unexpected	O
a	O
deliverance	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
perhaps	O
never	O
happened	O
to	O
any	O
man	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
million	O
to	O
one	O
odds	O
that	O
ever	O
he	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
relieved	O
;	O
nothing	O
but	O
an	O
adventure	O
that	O
never	O
was	O
heard	O
or	O
read	O
of	O
before	O
could	O
have	O
suited	O
his	O
case	O
,	O
unless	O
Heaven	O
,	O
by	O
some	O
miracle	O
that	O
never	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
expected	O
,	O
had	O
acted	O
for	O
him	O
.	O

He	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
gentleman	O
,	O
not	O
an	O
ordinary-bred	O
fellow	O
,	O
seaman	O
,	O
or	O
labouring	O
man	O
;	O
this	O
showed	O
itself	O
in	O
his	O
behaviour	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
moment	O
of	O
our	O
conversing	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
spite	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
disadvantages	O
of	O
his	O
miserable	O
circumstances	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
a	O
middle-aged	O
man	O
,	O
not	O
above	O
thirty-seven	O
or	O
thirty-eight	O
,	O
though	O
his	O
beard	O
was	O
grown	O
exceedingly	O
long	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
hair	O
of	O
his	O
head	O
and	O
face	O
strangely	O
covered	O
him	O
to	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
his	O
back	O
and	O
breast	O
;	O
he	O
was	O
white	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
skin	O
very	O
fine	O
,	O
though	O
discoloured	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
some	O
places	O
blistered	O
,	O
and	O
covered	O
with	O
a	O
brown	O
blackish	O
substance	O
,	O
scurfy	O
,	O
scaly	O
,	O
and	O
hard	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
effect	O
of	O
the	O
scorching	O
heat	O
of	O
the	O
sun	O
;	O
he	O
was	O
stark	O
naked	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
told	O
us	O
,	O
upwards	O
of	O
two	O
years	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
so	O
exceedingly	O
transported	O
at	O
our	O
meeting	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
scarce	O
enter	O
into	O
any	O
discourse	O
at	O
all	O
with	O
us	O
that	O
day	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
he	O
could	O
get	O
away	O
from	O
us	O
for	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
him	O
walking	O
alone	O
,	O
and	O
showing	O
all	O
the	O
most	O
extravagant	O
tokens	O
of	O
an	O
ungovernable	O
joy	O
;	O
and	O
even	O
afterwards	O
he	O
was	O
never	O
without	O
tears	O
in	O
his	O
eyes	O
for	O
several	O
days	O
,	O
upon	O
the	O
least	O
word	O
spoken	O
by	O
us	O
of	O
his	O
circumstances	O
,	O
or	O
by	O
him	O
of	O
his	O
deliverance	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
his	O
behaviour	O
the	O
most	O
courteous	O
and	O
endearing	O
I	O
ever	O
saw	O
in	O
any	O
man	O
whatever	O
,	O
and	O
most	O
evident	O
tokens	O
of	O
a	O
mannerly	O
,	O
well-bred	O
person	O
appeared	O
in	O
all	O
things	O
he	O
did	O
or	O
said	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
people	O
were	O
exceedingly	O
taken	O
with	O
him	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
a	O
scholar	O
and	O
a	O
mathematician	O
;	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
speak	O
Portuguese	O
indeed	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
spoke	O
Latin	O
to	O
our	O
surgeon	O
,	O
French	O
to	O
another	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
Italian	O
to	O
a	O
third	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
no	O
leisure	O
in	O
his	O
thoughts	O
to	O
ask	O
us	O
whence	O
we	O
came	O
,	O
whither	O
we	O
were	O
going	O
,	O
or	O
who	O
we	O
were	O
;	O
but	O
would	O
have	O
it	O
always	O
as	O
an	O
answer	O
to	O
himself	O
,	O
that	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
wherever	O
we	O
were	O
a-going	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
from	O
Heaven	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
sent	O
on	O
purpose	O
to	O
save	O
him	O
from	O
the	O
most	O
wretched	O
condition	O
that	O
ever	O
man	O
was	O
reduced	O
to	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
pitching	O
their	O
camp	O
on	O
the	O
bank	O
of	O
a	O
little	O
river	O
opposite	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
inquire	O
what	O
store	O
of	O
provisions	O
we	O
had	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
we	O
proposed	O
to	O
be	O
supplied	O
.	O

When	O
he	O
found	O
that	O
our	O
store	O
was	O
but	O
small	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
he	O
would	O
talk	O
with	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
provisions	O
enough	O
;	O
for	O
he	O
said	O
they	O
were	O
the	O
most	O
courteous	O
,	O
good-natured	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
in	O
all	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
might	O
suppose	O
by	O
his	O
living	O
so	O
safe	O
among	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
things	O
this	O
gentleman	O
did	O
for	O
us	O
were	O
indeed	O
of	O
the	O
greatest	O
consequence	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
he	O
perfectly	O
informed	O
us	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
properest	O
course	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
steer	O
;	O
secondly	O
,	O
he	O
put	O
us	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
how	O
to	O
furnish	O
ourselves	O
effectually	O
with	O
provisions	O
;	O
and	O
thirdly	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
our	O
complete	O
interpreter	O
and	O
peacemaker	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
who	O
now	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
numerous	O
about	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
were	O
a	O
more	O
fierce	O
and	O
politic	O
people	O
than	O
those	O
we	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
before	O
;	O
not	O
so	O
easily	O
terrified	O
with	O
our	O
arms	O
as	O
those	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
so	O
ignorant	O
as	O
to	O
give	O
their	O
provisions	O
and	O
corn	O
for	O
our	O
little	O
toys	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
,	O
I	O
said	O
before	O
,	O
our	O
artificer	O
made	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
frequently	O
traded	O
and	O
conversed	O
with	O
the	O
Europeans	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
or	O
with	O
other	O
negro	O
nations	O
that	O
had	O
traded	O
and	O
been	O
concerned	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
the	O
less	O
ignorant	O
and	O
the	O
less	O
fearful	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
nothing	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
had	O
from	O
them	O
but	O
by	O
exchange	O
for	O
such	O
things	O
as	O
they	O
liked	O
.	O

This	O
I	O
say	O
of	O
the	O
negro	O
natives	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
soon	O
came	O
among	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
to	O
these	O
poor	O
people	O

he	O

He	O

that	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
had	O
so	O
often	O

for	O
death	O

was	O
not	O

that	O

as	O
he	O

at	O

the	O

for	O

,	O
he	O
was	O
not	O

about	O
that	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
scarce	O
ever	O
went	O
from	O
his	O

;	O
but	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
,	O
the	O
negro	O
king	O
and	O
his	O
men	O
went	O
all	O
with	O
him	O

they	O
were	O
all	O
armed	O
with	O
bows	O

with	O
which	O
they	O

the	O

as	O

others	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
seldom	O
came	O
abroad	O
in	O
the	O
day	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
the	O
negroes	O
wander	O
anywhere	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
they	O
always	O
build	O
a	O

We	O

of	O
him	O
what	O
we	O
should	O
next	O
do	O
towards	O
getting	O
to	O
the	O

He	O
told	O
us	O
we	O
were	O
about	O
one	O
hundred	O
and	O
twenty	O
English	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
coast	O

where	O
almost	O
all	O
the	O
European	O

were	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
is	O
called	O
the	O
Gold	PNM

but	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
so	O
many	O
different	O
nations	O
of	O
negroes	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
ten	O
to	O
one	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
either	O
fought	O
with	O
continually	O
,	O
or	O
starved	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
provisions	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
two	O
other	O
ways	O
to	O
go	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
had	O
any	O
company	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
often	O
contrived	O
to	O
make	O
his	O
escape	O
by	O
.	O

The	O
one	O
was	O
to	O
travel	O
full	O
west	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
farther	O
to	O
go	O
,	O
yet	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
full	O
of	O
people	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
people	O
we	O
should	O
find	O
would	O
be	O
so	O
much	O
the	O
civiller	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
or	O
be	O
so	O
much	O
the	O
easier	O
to	O
fight	O
with	O
;	O
or	O
that	O
the	O
other	O
way	O
was	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
to	O
get	O
to	O
the	O
Rio	PNM
Grande	PNM
,	O
and	O
go	O
down	O
the	O
stream	O
in	O

We	O
told	O
him	O

that	O
was	O
the	O
way	O
we	O
had	O
resolved	O
on	O
before	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
him	O
;	O
but	O
then	O
he	O
told	O
us	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
prodigious	O
desert	O
to	O
go	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
prodigious	O
woods	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
,	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
both	O
together	O
were	O
at	O

twenty	O

for	O
us	O

as	O
hard	O
as	O
we	O
could	O

We	O
asked	O
him	O
if	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
horses	O
in	O
the	O
country	O

or	O
asses	O

we	O
showed	O
him	O
ours	O

of	O

we	O
had	O

three	O

He	O

no	O

all	O
the	O
country	O
did	O
not	O

anything	O
of	O

He	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
in	O
this	O
great	O
wood	O
there	O
were	O
immense	O
numbers	O
of	O
elephants	O

where	O
they	O
never	O

We	O

still	O
more	O

the	O

to	O
the	O
Gold	PNM

there	O

no	O

to	O

us	O

and	O
told	O
him	O

as	O
to	O
the	O

we	O
were	O
not	O

there	O

we	O

it	O

in	O

not	O

one	O
from	O

In	O
the	O

we	O
acquainted	O
him	O

how	O

had	O
a	O
larger	O

therefore	O

instead	O

any	O
from	O
him	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
resolved	O
every	O
one	O
to	O
add	O
a	O
little	O
to	O
him	O

He	O
appeared	O
very	O
glad	O
that	O

had	O
met	O
with	O
such	O
good	O
success	O

would	O
not	O
take	O

us	O

at	O
last	O

pressing	O
him	O

would	O
take	O
it	O
thus	O

that	O
,	O
when	O

came	O
to	O

any	O
more	O

he	O
would	O
have	O
so	O
much	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
as	O
should	O
make	O
him	O
even	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
would	O
go	O
on	O
as	O
equal	O
adventurers	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
we	O
agreed	O

He	O
then	O
told	O
us	O

thought	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
an	O
unprofitable	O
adventure	O
if	O
,	O
before	O
we	O
set	O
forward	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
got	O
a	O
stock	O
of	O
provisions	O

we	O
should	O
make	O
a	O
journey	O
north	O
to	O
the	O
edge	O
of	O
the	O
desert	O

had	O
told	O
us	O
of	O
,	O
from	O
whence	O
our	O
negroes	O
might	O
bring	O
every	O
one	O
a	O
large	O
elephant	O
's	O
tooth	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
get	O
some	O
more	O
to	O
assist	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
after	O
a	O
certain	O
length	O
of	O
carriage	O
,	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
conveyed	O
by	O
canoes	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
would	O
yield	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
profit	O
.	O

I	O
objected	O
against	O
this	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
our	O
other	O
design	O
we	O
had	O
of	O
getting	O
gold-dust	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
our	O
negroes	O
,	O
who	O
we	O
knew	O
would	O
be	O
faithful	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
would	O
get	O
much	O
more	O
by	O
searching	O
the	O
rivers	O
for	O
gold	O
for	O
us	O
than	O
by	O
lugging	O
a	O
great	O
tooth	O
of	O
a	O
hundred	O
and	O
fifty	O
pounds	O
weight	O
a	O
hundred	O
miles	O
or	O
more	O

which	O
would	O
be	O
an	O
insufferable	O
labour	O
to	O
them	O
after	O
so	O
hard	O
a	O
journey	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
certainly	O
kill	O
them	O
.	O

He	O
acquiesced	O
in	O
the	O
justice	O
of	O
this	O
answer	O
,	O
but	O
fain	O
would	O
have	O
had	O
us	O
gone	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
woody	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
and	O
the	O
edge	O
of	O
the	O
desert	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
see	O
how	O
the	O
elephants	O
'	O
teeth	O
lay	O
scattered	O
up	O
and	O
down	O
there	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
we	O
told	O
him	O
the	O
story	O
of	O
what	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
before	O
,	O
as	O
is	O
said	O
above	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
no	O
more	O

We	O
stayed	O
here	O
twelve	O
days	O
,	O
during	O
which	O
time	O
the	O
natives	O
were	O
very	O
obliging	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
us	O
fruits	O
,	O
pompions	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
root	O
like	O
carrots	O
,	O
though	O
of	O
quite	O
another	O
taste	O

but	O
not	O
unpleasant	O
neither	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
guinea-fowls	O
,	O
whose	O
names	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
they	O
brought	O
us	O
plenty	O
of	O
what	O
they	O
had	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
lived	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
gave	O
them	O
all	O
such	O
little	O
things	O
as	O
our	O
cutler	O
had	O
made	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
had	O
now	O
a	O
whole	O
bag	O
full	O
of	O
them	O

On	O
the	O
thirteenth	O
day	O
we	O
set	O
forward	O
,	O
taking	O
our	O
new	O
gentleman	O
with	O
us	O
.	O

At	O
parting	O
,	O
the	O
negro	O
king	O
sent	O
two	O
savages	O
with	O
a	O
present	O
to	O
him	O
of	O
some	O
dried	O
flesh	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
remember	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
gave	O
him	O
again	O
three	O
silver	O
birds	O
which	O
our	O
cutler	O
helped	O
him	O
to	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
assure	O
you	O
was	O
a	O
present	O
for	O
a	O
king	O

We	O
travelled	O
now	O
south	O
,	O
a	O
little	O
west	O
,	O
and	O
here	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
first	O
river	O
for	O
above	O
2000	O
miles	O
'	O
march	O

whose	O
waters	O
run	O
south	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
running	O
north	O

We	O
followed	O
this	O
river	O

was	O

Every	O

we	O

our	O

went	O
down	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
privately	O
to	O
the	O
water	O

was	O

at	O
length	O

came	O
running	O
up	O
to	O
us	O
with	O
his	O
hands	O
full	O
of	O
sand	O
,	O
and	O
saying	O
,	O
``	O
Look	O
here	O

Upon	O
looking	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
a	O
good	O
deal	O
of	O

lay	O
spangled	O
among	O

In	O
the	O
first	O

a	O
quarter	O
our	O
men	O
all	O
together	O
had	O
gathered	O
a	O

two	O
ounces	O
of	O
gold	O
or	O
thereabouts	O

and	O
as	O
we	O
found	O
the	O

the	O
farther	O
we	O
went	O

we	O
followed	O
it	O
about	O
three	O

till	O
another	O

joined	O
the	O
first	O

then	O
searching	O
up	O
the	O
stream	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
gold	O
there	O
too	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
pitched	O
our	O
camp	O
in	O
the	O
angle	O
where	O
the	O
rivers	O
joined	O

and	O
we	O
diverted	O
ourselves	O

as	O
I	O

call	O
it	O

in	O
washing	O
the	O
gold	O
out	O

Here	O
we	O

thirteen	O

we	O
had	O

with	O

some	O

them	O
too	O
homely	O
to	O
tell	O
of	O
,	O
for	O
some	O
of	O
our	O

had	O
made	O
something	O

with	O

which	O

All	O
the	O

At	O
one	O

the	O

They	O
stayed	O
out	O
two-and-fifty	O
days	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
brought	O
us	O
seventeen	O
pound	O
and	O
something	O
more	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
exact	O
weight	O
-RRB-	O
of	O
gold-dust	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
much	O
larger	O
pieces	O
than	O
any	O
we	O
had	O
found	O
before	O
,	O
besides	O
about	O
fifteen	O
ton	O
of	O
elephants	O
'	O
teeth	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
,	O
partly	O
by	O
good	O
usage	O
and	O
partly	O
by	O
bad	O
,	O
obliged	O
the	O
savages	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
to	O
fetch	O
,	O
and	O
bring	O
down	O
to	O
him	O
from	O
the	O
mountains	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
he	O
made	O
others	O
bring	O
with	O
him	O
quite	O
down	O
to	O
our	O
camp	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
we	O
wondered	O
what	O
was	O
coming	O
to	O
us	O
when	O
we	O
saw	O
him	O
attended	O
with	O
above	O
200	O
negroes	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
soon	O
undeceived	O
us	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
made	O
them	O
all	O
throw	O
down	O
their	O
burdens	O
on	O
a	O
heap	O
at	O
the	O
entrance	O
of	O
our	O
camp	O
.	O

Besides	O
this	O
,	O
they	O
brought	O
two	O
lions	O
'	O
skins	O
,	O
and	O
five	O
leopards	O
'	O
skins	O
,	O
very	O
large	O
and	O
very	O
fine	O
.	O

He	O
asked	O
our	O
pardon	O
for	O
his	O
long	O
stay	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
made	O
no	O
greater	O
a	O
booty	O
,	O
but	O
told	O
us	O
he	O
had	O
one	O
excursion	O
more	O
to	O
make	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
hoped	O
should	O
turn	O
to	O
a	O
better	O
account	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
having	O
rested	O
himself	O
and	O
rewarded	O
the	O
savages	O
that	O
brought	O
the	O
teeth	O
for	O
him	O
with	O
some	O
bits	O
of	O
silver	O
and	O
iron	O
cut	O
out	O
diamond	O
fashion	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
two	O
shaped	O
like	O
little	O
dogs	O
,	O
he	O
sent	O
them	O
away	O
mightily	O
pleased	O

The	O
second	O
journey	O
he	O
went	O
,	O
some	O
more	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
desired	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
made	O
a	O
troop	O
of	O
ten	O
white	O
men	O
and	O
ten	O
savages	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
two	O
buffaloes	O
to	O
carry	O
their	O
provisions	O
and	O
ammunition	O
.	O

They	O
took	O
the	O
same	O
course	O
,	O
only	O
not	O
exactly	O
the	O
same	O
track	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
stayed	O
thirty-two	O
days	O
only	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
time	O
they	O
killed	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
fifteen	O
leopards	O
,	O
three	O
lions	O
,	O
and	O
several	O
other	O
creatures	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
us	O
home	O
four-and-twenty	O

some	O
ounces	O
of	O
gold-dust	O
,	O
and	O
only	O
six	O
elephants	O

but	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
great	O
ones	O

Our	O
friend	O
the	O
Englishman	O
showed	O
us	O
that	O
now	O
our	O
time	O
was	O
well	O
bestowed	O
,	O
for	O
in	O
five	O
months	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
stayed	O
here	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
gathered	O
so	O
much	O
gold-dust	O
that	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
share	O
it	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
five	O
pound	O
and	O
a	O
quarter	O
to	O
a	O
man	O
,	O
besides	O
what	O
we	O
had	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
besides	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
pound	O
weight	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
at	O
several	O
times	O
given	O
our	O
artificer	O
to	O
make	O
baubles	O
with	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
we	O
talked	O
of	O
going	O
forward	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O
to	O
put	O
an	O
end	O
to	O
our	O
journey	O
;	O
but	O
our	O
guide	O
laughed	O
at	O
us	O
then	O
.	O

``	O
Nay	O
,	O
you	O
ca	O
n't	O
go	O
now	O
,	O
''	O
says	O
he	O
,	O
``	O
for	O
the	O
rainy	O
season	O
begins	O
next	O

,	O
and	O
there	O
will	O
be	O
no	O
stirring	O
then	O
.	O
''	O

This	O
we	O
found	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
reasonable	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
furnish	O
ourselves	O
with	O
provisions	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
obliged	O
to	O
go	O
abroad	O
too	O
much	O
in	O
the	O
rain	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
spread	O
ourselves	O
some	O
one	O
way	O
and	O
some	O
another	O
,	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
we	O
cared	O
to	O
venture	O
,	O
to	O
get	O
provisions	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
negroes	O
killed	O
us	O
some	O
deer	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
cured	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
now	O
no	O
salt	O
.	O

By	O
this	O
time	O
the	O
rainy	O
months	O
were	O
set	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
could	O
scarce	O
,	O
for	O
above	O
two	O
months	O
,	O
look	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
huts	O
.	O

But	O
that	O
was	O
not	O
all	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
rivers	O
were	O
so	O
swelled	O
with	O
the	O
land-floods	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
scarce	O
knew	O
the	O
little	O
brooks	O
and	O
rivulets	O
from	O
the	O
great	O
navigable	O
rivers	O
.	O

This	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
opportunity	O
to	O
have	O
conveyed	O
by	O
water	O
,	O
upon	O
rafts	O
,	O
our	O
elephants	O
'	O
teeth	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
pile	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
always	O
gave	O
the	O
savages	O
some	O
reward	O
for	O
their	O
labour	O
,	O
the	O
very	O
women	O
would	O
bring	O
us	O
teeth	O
upon	O
every	O
opportunity	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
a	O
great	O
tooth	O
carried	O
between	O
two	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
our	O
quantity	O
was	O
increased	O
to	O
about	O
two-and-twenty	O
ton	O
of	O
teeth	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
weather	O
proved	O
fair	O
again	O
,	O
he	O
told	O
us	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
press	O
us	O
to	O
any	O
further	O
stay	O
,	O
since	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
care	O
whether	O
we	O
got	O
any	O
more	O
gold	O
or	O
no	O
;	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
indeed	O
the	O
first	O
men	O
he	O
ever	O
met	O
with	O
in	O
his	O
life	O
that	O
said	O
they	O
had	O
gold	O
enough	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
whom	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
truly	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
when	O
it	O
lay	O
under	O
our	O
feet	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
not	O
stoop	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
up	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
since	O
he	O
had	O
made	O
us	O
a	O
promise	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
break	O
it	O
,	O
nor	O
press	O
us	O
to	O
make	O
any	O
further	O
stay	O
;	O
only	O
he	O
thought	O
he	O
ought	O
to	O
tell	O
us	O
that	O
now	O
was	O
the	O
time	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
land-flood	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
greatest	O
quantity	O
of	O
gold	O
was	O
found	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
stayed	O
but	O
one	O
month	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
see	O
thousands	O
of	O
savages	O
spread	O
themselves	O
over	O
the	O
whole	O
country	O
to	O
wash	O
the	O
gold	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
sand	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
European	O
ships	O
which	O
would	O
come	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
it	O
then	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
rage	O
of	O
the	O
floods	O
always	O
works	O
down	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
gold	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
hills	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
took	O
the	O
advantage	O
to	O
be	O
there	O
before	O
them	O
,	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
what	O
extraordinary	O
things	O
we	O
might	O
find	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
so	O
forcible	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
well	O
argued	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
appeared	O
in	O
all	O
our	O
faces	O
we	O
were	O
prevailed	O
upon	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
told	O
him	O
we	O
would	O
all	O
stay	O
:	O
for	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
true	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
eager	O
to	O
be	O
gone	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
evident	O
prospect	O
of	O
so	O
much	O
advantage	O
could	O
not	O
well	O
be	O
resisted	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
greatly	O
mistaken	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
suggested	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
desire	O
to	O
increase	O
our	O
store	O
of	O
gold	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
resolved	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
utmost	O
use	O
of	O
the	O
advantage	O
that	O
was	O
in	O
our	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
stay	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
any	O
gold	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
had	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
another	O
year	O
.	O

He	O
could	O
hardly	O
express	O
the	O
joy	O
he	O
was	O
in	O
on	O
this	O
occasion	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
fair	O
weather	O
coming	O
on	O
,	O
we	O
began	O
,	O
just	O
as	O
he	O
directed	O
,	O
to	O
search	O
about	O
the	O
rivers	O
for	O
more	O
gold	O
.	O

At	O
first	O
we	O
had	O
but	O
little	O
encouragement	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
doubtful	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
plain	O
that	O
the	O
reason	O
was	O
,	O
the	O
water	O
was	O
not	O
fully	O
fallen	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
rivers	O
reduced	O
to	O
their	O
usual	O
channel	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
we	O
were	O
fully	O
requited	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
much	O
more	O
gold	O
than	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
bigger	O
lumps	O
;	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
washed	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
sand	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
gold	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
a	O
small	O
nut	O
,	O
which	O
weighed	O
,	O
by	O
our	O
estimation	O
--	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
small	O
weights	O
--	O
almost	O
an	O
ounce	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
.	O

This	O
success	O
made	O
us	O
extremely	O
diligent	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
little	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
month	O
we	O
had	O
altogether	O
gotten	O
near	O
sixty	O
pound	O
weight	O
of	O
gold	O
;	O
but	O
after	O
this	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
told	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
abundance	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
,	O
men	O
,	O
women	O
,	O
and	O
children	O
,	O
hunting	O
every	O
river	O
and	O
brook	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
the	O
dry	O
land	O
of	O
the	O
hills	O
for	O
gold	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
do	O
nothing	O
like	O
then	O
,	O
compared	O
to	O
what	O
we	O
had	O
done	O
before	O

But	O
our	O
artificer	O
found	O
a	O
way	O
to	O
make	O
other	O
people	O
find	O
us	O
in	O
gold	O
without	O
our	O
own	O
labour	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
when	O
these	O
people	O
began	O
to	O
appear	O

he	O
had	O
a	O
considerable	O
quantity	O

&	O
c.	O

such	O

for	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
English	O
gentleman	O
being	O
the	O
interpreter	O
,	O
he	O
brought	O
the	O
savages	O
to	O
admire	O
them	O
;	O
so	O
our	O
cutler	O
had	O
trade	O
enough	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
sold	O
his	O
goods	O
at	O
a	O
monstrous	O
rate	O
;	O
for	O
he	O
would	O
get	O
an	O
ounce	O
of	O
gold	O
,	O
sometimes	O
two	O
,	O
for	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O

perhaps	O
of	O
the	O

if	O
it	O
were	O
iron	O

if	O
it	O

,	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
give	O
the	O
more	O
for	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
incredible	O
almost	O
to	O
think	O
what	O
a	O

bring	O
this	O

in	O
eleven	O

came	O
down	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Dutch	O
settlements	O
on	O
the	O
Gold	PNM

where	O
we	O
arrived	O
in	O
perfect	O
health	O

and	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
satisfaction	O

As	O
for	O
our	O
cargo	O
of	O

we	O
sold	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
Dutch	O
factory	O

received	O
clothes	O

other	O
necessaries	O

it	O
is	O
to	O

we	O
had	O
four	O

The	O

perfectly	O

clothed	O
him	O
out	O
of	O
our	O

here	O
we	O
all	O

Our	O

remained	O
in	O

factory	O
some	O
time	O

and	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
heard	O
afterwards	O

died	O
there	O
of	O
grief	O
;	O
for	O
he	O

sent	O
a	O

over	O

was	O
taken	O

The	O
rest	O
of	O
my	O

went	O
away	O

in	O
a	O

I	O

with	O

I	O
kept	O
with	O

went	O
away	O
to	O

where	O
I	O
got	O
passage	O
for	O
England	PNM

arrived	O
there	O
in	O
September	O

and	O
thus	O
ended	O
my	O
first	O
harvest	O
of	O
wild	O
oats	O
;	O
the	O
rest	O
were	O
not	O

I	O

neither	O

though	O
it	O

I	O

which	O
I	O

with	O
so	O

was	O
gone	O
in	O

more	O

two	O

time	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
even	O
rage	O
in	O
my	O
own	O
thoughts	O
to	O
reflect	O
upon	O
the	O
manner	O
how	O
it	O
was	O
wasted	O

so	O
I	O
need	O

no	O

;	O
the	O

to	O
be	O
concealed	O
with	O

for	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
spent	O
in	O
all	O
kinds	O
of	O
folly	O
and	O

So	O
this	O
scene	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
may	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
have	O
begun	O
in	O
theft	O
,	O
and	O
ended	O
in	O
luxury	O
;	O
a	O
sad	O
setting-out	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
worse	O
coming	O
home	O
.	O

About	O
the	O
year	O
--	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
my	O
stock	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
time	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
further	O
adventures	O
;	O
for	O
my	O
spoilers	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
call	O
them	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
let	O
me	O
know	O
,	O
that	O
as	O
my	O
money	O
declined	O
,	O
their	O
respect	O
would	O
ebb	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
expect	O
of	O
them	O
further	O
than	O
as	O
I	O
might	O
command	O
it	O
by	O
the	O
force	O
of	O
my	O
money	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
would	O
not	O
go	O
an	O
inch	O
the	O
further	O
for	O
all	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
spent	O
in	O
their	O
favour	O
before	O
.	O

This	O
shocked	O
me	O
very	O
much	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
conceived	O
a	O
just	O
abhorrence	O
of	O
their	O
ingratitude	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
wore	O
off	O
;	O
nor	O
had	O
I	O
met	O
with	O
any	O
regret	O
at	O
the	O
wasting	O
so	O
glorious	O
a	O
sum	O
of	O
money	O
as	O
I	O
brought	O
to	O
England	PNM
with	O
me	O
.	O

I	O
next	O
shipped	O
myself	O
,	O
in	O
an	O
evil	O
hour	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
on	O
a	O
voyage	O
to	O
Cadiz	PNM
,	O
in	O
a	O
ship	O
called	O
the	O
--	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
our	O
voyage	O
,	O
being	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Spain	PNM
,	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
put	O
into	O
the	O
Groyn	O
,	O
by	O
a	O
strong	O
southwest	O
wind	O
.	O

Here	O
I	O
fell	O
into	O
company	O
with	O
some	O
masters	O
of	O
mischief	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
one	O
,	O
forwarder	O
than	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
began	O
an	O
intimate	O
confidence	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
called	O
one	O
another	O
brothers	O
,	O
and	O
communicated	O
all	O
our	O
circumstances	O
to	O
one	O
another	O
.	O

His	O
name	O
was	O
Harris	O
.	O

This	O
fellow	O
came	O
to	O
me	O
one	O
morning	O
,	O
asking	O
me	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
agreed	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
got	O
the	O
captain	O
's	O
leave	O
for	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
together	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
were	O
together	O
,	O
he	O
asked	O
me	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
mind	O
for	O
an	O
adventure	O
that	O
might	O
make	O
amends	O
for	O
all	O
past	O
misfortunes	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
yes	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
my	O
heart	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
care	O
where	O
I	O
went	O
,	O
having	O
nothing	O
to	O
lose	O
,	O
and	O
no	O
one	O
to	O
leave	O
behind	O
me	O
.	O

He	O
then	O
asked	O
me	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
swear	O
to	O
be	O
secret	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
agree	O
to	O
what	O
he	O
proposed	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
nevertheless	O
never	O
betray	O
him	O
.	O

I	O
readily	O
bound	O
myself	O
to	O
that	O
,	O
upon	O
the	O
most	O
solemn	O
imprecations	O
and	O
curses	O
that	O
the	O
devil	O
and	O
both	O
of	O
us	O
could	O
invent	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
then	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
brave	O
fellow	O
in	O
the	O
other	O
ship	O
,	O
pointing	O
to	O
another	O
English	O
ship	O
which	O
rode	O
in	O
the	O
harbour	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
in	O
concert	O
with	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
had	O
resolved	O
to	O
mutiny	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
run	O
away	O
with	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
get	O
strength	O
enough	O
among	O
our	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
do	O
the	O
same	O
.	O

I	O
liked	O
the	O
proposal	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
got	O
eight	O
of	O
us	O
to	O
join	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
told	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
his	O
friend	O
had	O
begun	O
the	O
work	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
master	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
ready	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
like	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
his	O
plot	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
,	O
without	O
the	O
least	O
hesitation	O
,	O
either	O
at	O
the	O
villainy	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
or	O
the	O
difficulty	O
of	O
performing	O
it	O
,	O
came	O
immediately	O
into	O
the	O
wicked	O
conspiracy	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
it	O
went	O
on	O
among	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
bring	O
our	O
part	O
to	O
perfection	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
day	O
appointed	O
,	O
his	O
correspondent	O
in	O
the	O
other	O
ship	O
,	O
whose	O
name	O
was	O
Wilmot	O
,	O
began	O
the	O
work	O

and	O
,	O
having	O
seized	O
the	O
captain	O
's	O
mate	O
and	O
other	O
officers	O
,	O
secured	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
the	O
signal	O
to	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
but	O
eleven	O
in	O
our	O
ship	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
conspiracy	O
,	O
nor	O
could	O
we	O
get	O
any	O
more	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
trust	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
leaving	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
we	O
all	O
took	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
off	O
to	O
join	O
the	O
other	O
.	O

Having	O
thus	O
left	O
the	O
ship	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
entertained	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
joy	O
by	O
Captain	O
Wilmot	O

his	O

this	O

at	O

this	O
I	O
may	O
venture	O
to	O

upon	O
the	O

of	O
a	O

that	O

Captain	O

-LRB-	O
for	O
so	O
we	O
are	O
now	O
to	O
call	O
him	O
-RRB-	O
being	O
thus	O
possessed	O
of	O
a	O
ship	O

and	O
in	O
the	O
manner	O
as	O
you	O
have	O
heard	O
,	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
easily	O
concluded	O
he	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O

that	O
might	O
happen	O
among	O

On	O
the	O

we	O
weighed	O

stood	O
out	O

steering	O

Our	O

was	O

to	O
carry	O
thirty	O

as	O
she	O
was	O
fitted	O
out	O

So	O
we	O
put	O
into	O
Cadiz	O

that	O
is	O
to	O

we	O
came	O
to	O

comrade	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
a	O
complete	O
fellow	O
at	O
his	O
business	O
,	O
proposed	O
a	O
better	O
way	O
for	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
been	O
in	O
the	O
town	O
before	O
,	O
told	O
us	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
buy	O
what	O
powder	O
and	O
bullet	O
,	O
small-arms	O
,	O
or	O
anything	O
else	O
we	O
wanted	O
,	O
on	O
his	O
own	O
word	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
paid	O
for	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
in	O
such	O
English	O
goods	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
there	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
much	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
accordingly	O
he	O
and	O
the	O
captain	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
by	O
themselves	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
made	O
such	O
a	O
bargain	O
as	O
they	O
found	O
for	O
their	O
turn	O
,	O
came	O
away	O
again	O
in	O
two	O
hours	O
'	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
bringing	O
only	O
a	O
butt	O
of	O
wine	O
and	O
five	O
casks	O
of	O
brandy	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
we	O
all	O
went	O
on	O
board	O
again	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
two	O
_	O

came	O
off	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
deeply	O
laden	O

with	O
five	O
Spaniards	O
on	O
board	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
traffic	O

Our	O
captain	O
sold	O
them	O
good	O
pennyworths	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
delivered	O
us	O
sixteen	O
barrels	O
of	O
powder	O

twelve	O
small	O
rundlets	O
of	O
fine	O

for	O

with	O
some	O

and	O
twenty	O
good	O

of	O
pistols	O

Besides	O
this	O
,	O
they	O
brought	O
thirteen	O
butts	O
of	O
wine	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
we	O
,	O
that	O
were	O
now	O
all	O
become	O
gentlemen	O
,	O
scorned	O
to	O
drink	O
the	O
ship	O

-RRB-	O
,	O
also	O
sixteen	O
puncheons	O
of	O

with	O
twelve	O
barrels	O
of	O
raisins	O
and	O
twenty	O
chests	O
of	O
lemons	O
;	O
all	O
which	O
we	O
paid	O
for	O
in	O
English	O
goods	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
over	O
and	O
above	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
received	O
six	O
hundred	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
in	O
money	O
.	O

They	O
would	O
have	O
come	O
again	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
would	O
stay	O
no	O
longer	O
.	O

From	O
hence	O
we	O
sailed	O
to	O
the	O
Canaries	PNM
,	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
onward	O
to	O
the	O
West	O
Indies	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
committed	O
some	O
depredation	O
upon	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
for	O
provisions	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
some	O
prizes	O
,	O
but	O
none	O
of	O
any	O
great	O
value	O
,	O
while	O
I	O
remained	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
not	O
long	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
having	O
taken	O
a	O
Spanish	O
sloop	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Carthagena	PNM
,	O
my	O
friend	O
made	O
a	O
motion	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
desire	O
Captain	O
Wilmot	O
to	O
put	O
us	O
into	O
the	O
sloop	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
proportion	O
of	O
arms	O
and	O
ammunition	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
us	O
try	O
what	O
we	O
could	O
do	O
;	O
she	O
being	O
much	O
fitter	O
for	O
our	O
business	O
than	O
the	O
great	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
better	O
sailer	O
.	O

This	O
he	O
consented	O
to	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
appointed	O
our	O
rendezvous	O
at	O
Tobago	PNM
,	O
making	O
an	O
agreement	O
,	O
that	O
whatever	O
was	O
taken	O
by	O
either	O
of	O
our	O
ships	O
should	O
be	O
shared	O
among	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O
of	O
both	O
;	O
all	O
which	O
we	O
very	O
punctually	O
observed	O
,	O
and	O
joined	O
our	O
ships	O
again	O
,	O
about	O
fifteen	O
months	O
after	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Tobago	PNM
,	O
as	O
above	O
.	O

We	O
cruised	O
near	O
two	O
years	O
in	O
those	O
seas	O
,	O
chiefly	O
upon	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
;	O
not	O
that	O
we	O
made	O
any	O
difficulty	O
of	O
taking	O
English	O
ships	O
,	O
or	O
Dutch	O
,	O
or	O
French	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
came	O
in	O
our	O
way	O
;	O
and	O
particularly	O
,	O
Captain	O
Wilmot	O
attacked	O
a	O
New	PNM
England	PNM
ship	O
bound	O
from	O
the	O
Madeiras	O
to	O
Jamaica	PNM
,	O
and	O
another	O
bound	O
from	O
New	PNM
York	PNM
to	O
Barbados	PNM
,	O
with	O
provisions	O
;	O
which	O
last	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
happy	O
supply	O
to	O
us	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
reason	O
why	O
we	O
meddled	O
as	O
little	O
with	O
English	O
vessels	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
was	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
because	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
ships	O
of	O
any	O
force	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
sure	O
of	O
more	O
resistance	O
from	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
secondly	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
English	O
ships	O
had	O
less	O
booty	O
when	O
taken	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
generally	O
had	O
money	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
what	O
we	O
best	O
knew	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
.	O

Captain	O
Wilmot	O
was	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
more	O
particularly	O
cruel	O
when	O
he	O
took	O
any	O
English	O
vessel	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
not	O
too	O
soon	O
have	O
advice	O
of	O
him	O
in	O
England	PNM
;	O
and	O
so	O
the	O
men-of-war	O
have	O
orders	O
to	O
look	O
out	O
for	O
him	O
.	O

But	O
this	O
part	O
I	O
bury	O
in	O
silence	O
for	O
the	O
present	O
.	O

We	O
increased	O
our	O
stock	O
in	O
these	O
two	O
years	O
considerably	O
,	O
having	O
taken	O
60,000	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
in	O
one	O
vessel	O
,	O
and	O
100,000	O
in	O
another	O
;	O
and	O
being	O
thus	O
first	O
grown	O
rich	O
,	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
be	O
strong	O
too	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
taken	O
a	O
brigantine	O
built	O
at	O
Virginia	PNM
,	O
an	O
excellent	O
sea-boat	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
good	O
sailer	O
,	O
and	O
able	O
to	O
carry	O
twelve	O
guns	O
;	O
and	O
a	O
large	O
Spanish	O
frigate-built	O
ship	O
,	O
that	O
sailed	O
incomparably	O
well	O
also	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
afterwards	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
good	O
carpenters	O
,	O
we	O
fitted	O
up	O
to	O
carry	O
twenty-eight	O
guns	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
we	O
wanted	O
more	O
hands	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
put	O
away	O
for	O
the	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM
Campeachy	PNM
,	O
not	O
doubting	O
we	O
should	O
ship	O
as	O
many	O
men	O
there	O
as	O
we	O
pleased	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
we	O
did	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
sold	O
the	O
sloop	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
;	O
and	O
Captain	O
Wilmot	O
keeping	O
his	O
own	O
ship	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
the	O
command	O
of	O
the	O
Spanish	O
frigate	O
as	O
captain	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
comrade	O
Harris	O
as	O
eldest	O
lieutenant	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
bold	O
enterprising	O
fellow	O
he	O
was	O
,	O
as	O
any	O
the	O
world	O
afforded	O
.	O

One	O
culverdine	O
was	O
put	O
into	O
the	O
brigantine	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
three	O
stout	O
ships	O
,	O
well	O
manned	O
,	O
and	O
victualled	O
for	O
twelve	O
months	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
taken	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
sloops	O
from	O
New	PNM
England	PNM
and	O
New	PNM
York	PNM
,	O
laden	O
with	O
flour	O
,	O
peas	O
,	O
and	O
barrelled	O
beef	O
and	O
pork	O
,	O
going	O
for	O
Jamaica	PNM
and	O
Barbados	PNM
;	O
and	O
for	O
more	O
beef	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Cuba	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
killed	O
as	O
many	O
black	O
cattle	O
as	O
we	O
pleased	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
very	O
little	O
salt	O
to	O
cure	O
them	O
.	O

Out	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
prizes	O
we	O
took	O
here	O
we	O
took	O
their	O
powder	O
and	O
bullet	O
,	O
their	O
small-arms	O
and	O
cutlasses	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
for	O
their	O
men	O
,	O
we	O
always	O
took	O
the	O
surgeon	O
and	O
the	O
carpenter	O
,	O
as	O
persons	O
who	O
were	O
of	O
particular	O
use	O
to	O
us	O
upon	O
many	O
occasions	O
;	O
nor	O
were	O
they	O
always	O
unwilling	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
though	O
for	O
their	O
own	O
security	O
,	O
in	O
case	O
of	O
accidents	O
,	O
they	O
might	O
easily	O
pretend	O
they	O
were	O
carried	O
away	O
by	O
force	O
;	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
shall	O
give	O
a	O
pleasant	O
account	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
my	O
other	O
expeditions	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
one	O
very	O
merry	O
fellow	O
here	O
,	O
a	O
Quaker	O
,	O
whose	O
name	O
was	O
William	O
Walters	O
,	O
whom	O
we	O
took	O
out	O
of	O
a	O
sloop	O
bound	O
from	O
Pennsylvania	PNM
to	O
Barbados	PNM
.	O

He	O
was	O
a	O
surgeon	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
called	O
him	O
doctor	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
employed	O
in	O
the	O
sloop	O
as	O
a	O
surgeon	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
Barbados	PNM
to	O
get	O
a	O
berth	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
sailors	O
call	O
it	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
all	O
his	O
surgeon	O
's	O
chests	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
made	O
him	O
go	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
take	O
all	O
his	O
implements	O
with	O
him	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
a	O
comic	O
fellow	O
indeed	O
,	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
very	O
good	O
solid	O
sense	O
,	O
and	O
an	O
excellent	O
surgeon	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
what	O
was	O
worth	O
all	O
,	O
very	O
good-humoured	O
and	O
pleasant	O
in	O
his	O
conversation	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
bold	O
,	O
stout	O
,	O
brave	O
fellow	O
too	O
,	O
as	O
any	O
we	O
had	O
among	O
us	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
William	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
not	O
very	O
averse	O
to	O
go	O
along	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
resolved	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
apparent	O
he	O
was	O
taken	O
away	O
by	O
force	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
this	O
purpose	O
he	O
comes	O
to	O
me	O
.	O

``	O
Friend	O
,	O
''	O
says	O
he	O
,	O
``	O
thou	O
sayest	O
I	O
must	O
go	O
with	O
thee	O

and	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
in	O
my	O
power	O
to	O
resist	O
thee	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
desire	O
thou	O
wilt	O
oblige	O
the	O
master	O
of	O
the	O
sloop	O
which	O
I	O
am	O
on	O
board	O
to	O
certify	O
under	O
his	O
hand	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
taken	O
away	O
by	O
force	O
and	O
against	O
my	O
will	O

''	O

And	O
this	O
he	O
said	O
with	O
so	O
much	O
satisfaction	O
in	O
his	O
face	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
but	O
understand	O
him	O

``	O

I	O

``	O
whether	O

I	O

him	O

us	O

keep	O
them	O

''	O

So	O
I	O
drew	O
up	O
a	O
certificate	O
myself	O
,	O
wherein	O
I	O
wrote	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
taken	O
away	O
by	O
main	O
force	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
prisoner	O

by	O
a	O
pirate	O
ship	O

that	O
they	O
carried	O
away	O
his	O
chest	O
and	O
instruments	O
first	O

and	O
then	O
bound	O
his	O
hands	O
behind	O
him	O

forced	O
him	O
into	O
their	O
boat	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
signed	O
by	O
the	O
master	O
and	O
all	O
his	O
men	O

Accordingly	O
I	O
fell	O
a-swearing	O
at	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
called	O
to	O
my	O
men	O
to	O
tie	O
his	O
hands	O
behind	O
him	O

and	O
so	O
we	O
put	O
him	O
into	O
our	O
boat	O

carried	O
him	O
away	O

When	O
I	O
had	O
him	O
on	O
board	O

I	O
called	O
him	O
to	O
me	O

``	O

I	O
unbound	O

Our	O
cruising	O
so	O
long	O
in	O
these	O

began	O
now	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
well	O

that	O
not	O
in	O

The	O
consequence	O
of	O
this	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
several	O
English	O
men-of-war	O
were	O
sent	O
to	O
the	O
West	O
Indies	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
particularly	O
instructed	O
to	O
cruise	O
in	O
the	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM
Mexico	PNM
,	O
and	O
the	O
Gulf	PNM
of	PNM
Florida	PNM
,	O
and	O
among	O
the	O
Bahama	PNM
islands	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
to	O
attack	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
not	O
so	O
ignorant	O
of	O
things	O
as	O
not	O
to	O
expect	O
this	O
,	O
after	O
so	O
long	O
a	O
stay	O
in	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
first	O
certain	O
account	O
we	O
had	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
at	O
Honduras	O
,	O
when	O
a	O
vessel	O
coming	O
in	O
from	O
Jamaica	PNM
told	O
us	O
that	O
two	O
English	O
men-of-war	O
were	O
coming	O
directly	O
from	O
Jamaica	PNM
thither	O
in	O
quest	O
of	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
indeed	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
embayed	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
made	O
the	O
least	O
shift	O
to	O
have	O
got	O
off	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
come	O
directly	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
happened	O
,	O
somebody	O
had	O
informed	O
them	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM
Campeachy	PNM
,	O
and	O
they	O
went	O
directly	O
thither	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
only	O
free	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
so	O
much	O
to	O
the	O
windward	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
make	O
any	O
attempt	O
upon	O
us	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
had	O
known	O
we	O
were	O
there	O
.	O

We	O
took	O
this	O
advantage	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
away	O
for	O
Carthagena	PNM
,	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
with	O
great	O
difficulty	O
beat	O
it	O
up	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
from	O
under	O
the	O
shore	O
for	O
St.	PNM
Martha	PNM
,	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
Dutch	O
island	O
of	O
Curacoa	PNM
,	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Tobago	PNM
,	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
was	O
our	O
rendezvous	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
being	O
a	O
deserted	O
,	O
uninhabited	O
island	O
,	O
we	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
made	O
use	O
of	O
for	O
a	O
retreat	O
.	O

Here	O
the	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
brigantine	O
died	O
,	O
and	O
Captain	O
Harris	O
,	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
my	O
lieutenant	O
,	O
took	O
the	O
command	O
of	O
the	O
brigantine	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
resolution	O
to	O
go	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Brazil	PNM
,	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
to	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
of	PNM
Good	PNM
Hope	PNM
,	O
and	O
so	O
for	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
;	O
but	O
Captain	O
Harris	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
being	O
now	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
brigantine	O
,	O
alleged	O
that	O
his	O
ship	O
was	O
too	O
small	O
for	O
so	O
long	O
a	O
voyage	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
Captain	O
Wilmot	O
would	O
consent	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
take	O
the	O
hazard	O
of	O
another	O
cruise	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
would	O
follow	O
us	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
ship	O
he	O
could	O
take	O
.	O

So	O
we	O
appointed	O
our	O
rendezvous	O
to	O
be	O
at	O
Madagascar	PNM
,	O
which	O
was	O
done	O
by	O
my	O
recommendation	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
plenty	O
of	O
provisions	O
to	O
be	O
had	O
there	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
he	O
went	O
away	O
from	O
us	O
in	O
an	O
evil	O
hour	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
taking	O
a	O
ship	O
to	O
follow	O
us	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
taken	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
heard	O
afterwards	O
,	O
by	O
an	O
English	O
man-of-war	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
laid	O
in	O
irons	O
,	O
died	O
of	O
mere	O
grief	O
and	O
anger	O
before	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
England	PNM
.	O

His	O
lieutenant	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
heard	O
,	O
was	O
afterwards	O
executed	O
in	O
England	PNM
for	O
a	O
pirate	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
man	O
who	O
first	O
brought	O
me	O
into	O
this	O
unhappy	O
trade	O
.	O

We	O
parted	O
from	O
Tobago	O
three	O
days	O
after	O
,	O
bending	O
our	O
course	O
for	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Brazil	PNM
,	O
but	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
at	O
sea	O
above	O
twenty-four	O
hours	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
separated	O
by	O
a	O
terrible	O
storm	O
,	O
which	O
held	O
three	O
days	O
,	O
with	O
very	O
little	O
abatement	O
or	O
intermission	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
juncture	O
Captain	O
Wilmot	O
happened	O
,	O
unluckily	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
on	O
board	O
my	O
ship	O
,	O
to	O
his	O
great	O
mortification	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
not	O
only	O
lost	O
sight	O
of	O
his	O
ship	O
,	O
but	O
never	O
saw	O
her	O
more	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
Madagascar	PNM
,	O
where	O
she	O
was	O
cast	O
away	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
after	O
having	O
in	O
this	O
tempest	O
lost	O
our	O
fore-topmast	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
put	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
isle	O
of	O
Tobago	PNM
for	O
shelter	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
repair	O
our	O
damage	O
,	O
which	O
brought	O
us	O
all	O
very	O
near	O
our	O
destruction	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
no	O
sooner	O
on	O
shore	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
very	O
busy	O
looking	O
out	O
for	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
timber	O
for	O
a	O
topmast	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
perceived	O
standing	O
in	O
for	O
the	O
shore	O
an	O
English	O
man-of-war	O
of	O
thirty-six	O
guns	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
surprise	O
to	O
us	O
indeed	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
were	O
disabled	O
so	O
much	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
good	O
fortune	O
,	O
we	O
lay	O
pretty	O
snug	O
and	O
close	O
among	O
the	O
high	O
rocks	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
man-of-war	O
did	O
not	O
see	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
stood	O
off	O
again	O
upon	O
his	O
cruise	O
.	O

So	O
we	O
only	O
observed	O
which	O
way	O
she	O
went	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
night	O
,	O
leaving	O
our	O
work	O
,	O
resolved	O
to	O
stand	O
off	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
steering	O
the	O
contrary	O
way	O
from	O
that	O
which	O
we	O
observed	O
she	O
went	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
,	O
had	O
the	O
desired	O
success	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
saw	O
him	O
no	O
more	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
gotten	O
an	O
old	O
mizzen-topmast	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
us	O
a	O
jury	O
fore-topmast	O
for	O
the	O
present	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
we	O
stood	O
away	O
for	O
the	O
isle	O
of	O
Trinidad	PNM
,	O
where	O
,	O
though	O
there	O
were	O
Spaniards	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
landed	O
some	O
men	O
with	O
our	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
cut	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
piece	O
of	O
fir	O
to	O
make	O
us	O
a	O
new	O
topmast	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
got	O
fitted	O
up	O
effectually	O
;	O
and	O
also	O
we	O
got	O
some	O
cattle	O
here	O
to	O
eke	O
out	O
our	O
provisions	O
;	O
and	O
calling	O
a	O
council	O
of	O
war	O
among	O
ourselves	O
,	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
quit	O
those	O
seas	O
for	O
the	O
present	O
,	O
and	O
steer	O
away	O
for	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Brazil	PNM
.	O

The	O
first	O
thing	O
we	O
attempted	O
here	O
was	O
only	O
getting	O
fresh	O
water	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
learnt	O
that	O
there	O
lay	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
fleet	O
at	O
the	O
bay	O
of	O
All	O
Saints	O
,	O
bound	O
for	O
Lisbon	PNM
,	O
ready	O
to	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
only	O
waited	O
for	O
a	O
fair	O
wind	O
.	O

This	O
made	O
us	O
lie	O
by	O
,	O
wishing	O
to	O
see	O
them	O
put	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
accordingly	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
with	O
or	O
without	O
convoy	O
,	O
to	O
attack	O
or	O
avoid	O
them	O
.	O

It	O
sprung	O
up	O
a	O
fresh	O
gale	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
at	O
S.W.	O
by	O
W.	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
being	O

for	O
the	O
Portugal	PNM
fleet	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
weather	O
pleasant	O
and	O
agreeable	O
,	O
we	O
heard	O
the	O
signal	O
given	O
to	O
unmoor	O
,	O
and	O
running	O
in	O
under	O
the	O
island	O
of	O

,	O
we	O
hauled	O
our	O
mainsail	O

up	O
in	O
the	O
brails	O

lowered	O
the	O
topsails	O
upon	O
the	O
cap	O

and	O
clewed	O
them	O
up	O

that	O
we	O
might	O
lie	O
as	O
snug	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
expecting	O
their	O
coming	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
saw	O
the	O
whole	O
fleet	O
come	O
out	O
accordingly	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
to	O
our	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
consisted	O
of	O
twenty-six	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
ships	O
of	O
force	O

as	O
well	O
as	O
burthen	O
,	O
both	O

and	O
men-of-war	O
;	O
so	O
,	O
seeing	O
there	O
was	O
no	O

we	O
lay	O
still	O

we	O
were	O
also	O
,	O
till	O
the	O
fleet	O
was	O
out	O
of	O
sight	O

then	O
stood	O
off	O

on	O

in	O
hopes	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
long	O
before	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
sail	O

and	O
immediately	O
gave	O
her	O
chase	O
;	O
but	O
she	O
proved	O
an	O
excellent	O
sailer	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
standing	O
out	O
to	O

was	O
ten	O

but	O
we	O
should	O
snap	O
her	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O

Accordingly	O
we	O
went	O
about-ship	O
,	O
got	O
our	O
larboard	O
tacks	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
set	O
the	O

crowded	O

of	PNM
All	PNM

where	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
an	O

in	O
the	O
morning	O

just	O
out	O

As	O
William	O
said	O
,	O
so	O
it	O
was	O

We	O
could	O
see	O
by	O
our	O
glasses	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
in	O
a	O
hurry	O
,	O
manning	O
and	O
fitting	O

had	O
there	O

a	O

and	O
it	O
was	O

would	O

But	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
at	O
a	O
loss	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
;	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
ship	O
we	O
had	O
taken	O
was	O
laden	O
with	O
nothing	O
considerable	O
for	O
our	O
purpose	O

some	O

the	O

was	O

so	O
we	O
took	O
out	O
all	O

among	O

all	O
her	O

shot	O

and	O
small-arms	O

and	O
turned	O
her	O
off	O

We	O
also	O
took	O
a	O
cable	O
and	O
three	O
anchors	O
she	O
had	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
for	O
our	O
purpose	O

and	O
some	O
of	O
her	O

She	O
had	O
enough	O
left	O
just	O
to	O
carry	O
her	O
into	O
port	O

and	O
that	O
was	O
all	O

Having	O
done	O
this	O
,	O
we	O
stood	O
on	O
upon	O
the	O
Brazil	PNM
coast	O
,	O
southward	O
,	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
river	O

But	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
two	O
days	O
the	O
wind	O
blowing	O
hard	O
at	O
S.E.	O
and	O
S.S.E.	O

we	O
were	O

to	O

an	O
anchor	O
under	O
a	O
little	O
island	O

and	O
wait	O
for	O
a	O

In	O
this	O
time	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
had	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
given	O
notice	O
over	O
land	O
to	O
the	O
governor	O
there	O
,	O
that	O
a	O
pirate	O
was	O
upon	O
the	O
coast	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
in	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
port	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
two	O
men-of-war	O
riding	O
just	O
without	O
the	O
bar	O
,	O
whereof	O
one	O
,	O
we	O
found	O

was	O
getting	O
under	O

with	O
all	O

stood	O
both	O
fair	O
after	O

with	O
all	O

could	O

not	O
the	O
night	O
come	O
on	O

William	O
's	O
words	O
had	O
been	O
made	O
good	O
;	O
they	O
would	O
certainly	O
have	O
asked	O
us	O
the	O
question	O
what	O
we	O
did	O
there	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
foremost	O
ship	O
gained	O
upon	O
us	O

especially	O
upon	O
one	O
tack	O

for	O

plied	O
away	O
from	O

to	O
windward	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
dark	O
losing	O
sight	O
of	O
them	O

we	O
resolved	O
to	O
change	O
our	O
course	O
and	O
stand	O
away	O
directly	O
for	O
sea	O
,	O
not	O
doubting	O

should	O
lose	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
night	O

Whether	O
the	O
Portuguese	O

guessed	O
we	O
would	O
do	O
so	O
or	O
no	O

I	O

in	O
the	O

appeared	O

lost	O

about	O
a	O
league	O

only	O

to	O
our	O
great	O
good	O
fortune	O

we	O
could	O
see	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
two	O

this	O
one	O
was	O

six-and-forty	O

was	O
no	O

their	O

we	O
lay	O

The	O

In	O
the	O

of	O

of	O
this	O

I	O
was	O
very	O

upon	O

``	O

``	O

I	O
stepped	O
forward	O

there	O
was	O
friend	O

with	O
two	O

three	O

lashing	O
the	O

get	O
away	O
from	O
us	O

and	O
every	O
now	O

then	O
he	O
pulled	O
a	O
bottle	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
pocket	O

gave	O
the	O
men	O
a	O
dram	O
to	O
encourage	O
them	O

The	O
shot	O
flew	O
about	O
his	O
ears	O
as	O
thick	O
as	O
may	O
be	O
supposed	O
in	O
such	O
an	O
action	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
,	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
their	O
due	O
,	O
fought	O
very	O
briskly	O
,	O
believing	O
at	O
first	O
they	O
were	O
sure	O
of	O
their	O
game	O
,	O
and	O
trusting	O
to	O
their	O
superiority	O
;	O
but	O
there	O
was	O
William	O
,	O
as	O
composed	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
as	O
perfect	O
tranquillity	O
as	O
to	O
danger	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
over	O
a	O
bowl	O
of	O
punch	O
,	O
only	O
very	O
busy	O
securing	O
the	O
matter	O
,	O
that	O
a	O
ship	O
of	O
forty-six	O
guns	O
should	O
not	O
run	O
away	O
from	O
a	O
ship	O
of	O
eight-and-twenty	O

This	O
work	O
was	O
too	O
hot	O
to	O
hold	O
long	O
;	O
our	O
men	O
behaved	O
bravely	O
:	O
our	O
gunner	O
,	O
a	O
gallant	O
man	O
,	O
shouted	O
below	O
,	O
pouring	O
in	O
his	O
shot	O
at	O
such	O
a	O
rate	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
began	O
to	O
slacken	O
their	O
fire	O
;	O
we	O
had	O
dismounted	O
several	O
of	O
their	O
guns	O
by	O
firing	O
in	O
at	O
their	O
forecastle	O
,	O
and	O
raking	O
them	O

as	O
I	O
said	O

fore	O

Presently	O
comes	O
William	O
up	O
to	O
me	O

``	O

he	O

I	O
understood	O
him	O
immediately	O
,	O
for	O
our	O
guns	O
had	O
so	O
torn	O
their	O
hull	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
beat	O
two	O
port-holes	O
into	O
one	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
bulk-head	O
of	O
their	O
steerage	O
was	O
split	O
to	O
pieces	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
retire	O
to	O
their	O
close	O
quarters	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
gave	O
the	O
word	O
immediately	O
to	O
board	O
them	O

Our	O
second	O
lieutenant	O
,	O
with	O
about	O
thirty	O
men	O
,	O
entered	O
in	O
an	O
instant	O
over	O
the	O
forecastle	O
,	O
followed	O
by	O
some	O
more	O
with	O
the	O
boatswain	O

and	O
cutting	O
in	O
pieces	O
about	O
twenty-five	O
men	O
that	O
they	O
found	O
upon	O
the	O
deck	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
throwing	O
some	O
grenadoes	O
into	O
the	O
steerage	O
,	O
they	O
entered	O
there	O
also	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
cried	O
quarter	O
presently	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
mastered	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
contrary	O
indeed	O
to	O
our	O
own	O
expectation	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
would	O
have	O
compounded	O
with	O
them	O
if	O
they	O
would	O

sheered	O
off	O

laying	O
them	O
athwart	O
the	O
hawse	O
at	O
first	O

following	O
our	O
fire	O
furiously	O

without	O
giving	O
them	O
any	O
time	O
to	O
get	O
clear	O
of	O
us	O

work	O
their	O
ship	O

by	O
this	O
means	O

though	O
they	O
had	O
six-and-forty	O
guns	O

were	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
fight	O
above	O
five	O

six	O

I	O
said	O
above	O

for	O
we	O
beat	O
them	O
immediately	O
from	O
their	O
guns	O
in	O
the	O
forecastle	O

and	O
killed	O
them	O
abundance	O
of	O
men	O
between	O
decks	O

so	O
that	O
when	O
we	O
entered	O
they	O
had	O
hardly	O

men	O
enough	O

The	O
surprise	O
of	O
joy	O
to	O
hear	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
cry	O
quarter	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
their	O
ancient	O
struck	O

was	O
so	O
great	O
to	O
our	O
captain	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
was	O
reduced	O
very	O
weak	O
with	O
a	O
high	O
fever	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
gave	O
him	O
new	O
life	O

Nature	O
conquered	O
the	O
distemper	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
fever	O
abated	O
that	O
very	O
night	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
in	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
he	O
was	O
sensibly	O
better	O
,	O
his	O
strength	O
began	O
to	O
come	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
give	O
his	O
orders	O
effectually	O
in	O
everything	O
that	O
was	O
material	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
about	O
ten	O
days	O
was	O
entirely	O
well	O
and	O
about	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
meantime	O
I	O
took	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
man-of-war	O
;	O
and	O
Captain	O
Wilmot	O
made	O
me	O

made	O
myself	O

captain	O

her	O
for	O
the	O
present	O

About	O
thirty	O
of	O
their	O
seamen	O
took	O
service	O

us	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
which	O
were	O
French	O

some	O
Genoese	O

we	O
set	O

next	O

on	O
a	O
little	O
island	O

removed	O

whom	O
we	O
were	O
bound	O
to	O
keep	O
on	O
board	O

we	O
had	O
an	O
occasion	O
afterwards	O
to	O
dispose	O

them	O
at	O
the	O
Cape	PNM

soon	O

the	O

the	O

In	O
this	O

down	O

In	O
a	O
word	O

the	O
figure	O
the	O
whole	O

was	O
the	O
most	O
confounding	O
to	O

that	O

the	O

that	O

She	O

When	O
we	O

we	O
fired	O
a	O
gun	O
to	O
bring	O
her	O

She	O
took	O
no	O

nobody	O
answered	O

appeared	O

so	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
ship	O
gone	O
ashore	O
somewhere	O
in	O

and	O
the	O

had	O
floated	O
her	O
off	O

Coming	O
nearer	O
to	O
her	O

we	O
ran	O
up	O
alongside	O
of	O
her	O
so	O
close	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
hear	O
a	O
noise	O

the	O

of	O
several	O

But	O
William	O
,	O
with	O
many	O
persuasions	O
,	O
prevailed	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
by	O
telling	O
them	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
nothing	O

what	O

if	O

they	O
would	O

that	O

had	O
really	O
the	O

them	O

to	O

that	O
the	O

it	O

that	O
they	O
ought	O

then	O
to	O
our	O

to	O
ask	O
if	O
they	O

no	O
white	O
men	O
on	O

and	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
gone	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
understand	O
what	O
we	O
meant	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
they	O
pointed	O
to	O
our	O
boat	O
and	O
to	O
their	O
ship	O
,	O
asking	O
questions	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
a	O
thousand	O
things	O
,	O
and	O
expressed	O
themselves	O
with	O
great	O
earnestness	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
understand	O
a	O
word	O
of	O
it	O
all	O
,	O
or	O
know	O
what	O
they	O
meant	O
by	O
any	O
of	O
their	O
signs	O

We	O
knew	O
very	O
well	O
they	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
taken	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
as	O
slaves	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
by	O
some	O
European	O
people	O
too	O
.	O

We	O
could	O
easily	O
see	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
a	O
Dutch-built	O
ship	O
,	O
but	O
very	O
much	O
altered	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
built	O
upon	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
supposed	O
,	O
in	O
France	PNM
;	O
for	O
we	O
found	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
French	O
books	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
afterwards	O
we	O
found	O
clothes	O
,	O
linen	O
,	O
lace	O
,	O
some	O
old	O
shoes	O
,	O
and	O
several	O
other	O
things	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
among	O
the	O
provisions	O
some	O
barrels	O
of	O
Irish	O
beef	O
,	O
some	O
Newfoundland	PNM
fish	O
,	O
and	O
several	O
other	O
evidences	O
that	O
there	O
had	O
been	O
Christians	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
but	O
saw	O
no	O
remains	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
not	O
a	O
sword	O
,	O
gun	O
,	O
pistol	O
,	O
or	O
weapon	O
of	O
any	O
kind	O
,	O
except	O
some	O
cutlasses	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
negroes	O
had	O
hid	O
them	O
below	O
where	O
they	O
lay	O
.	O

We	O
asked	O
them	O
what	O
was	O
become	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
small-arms	O
,	O
pointing	O
to	O
our	O
own	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
places	O
where	O
those	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
had	O
hung	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
negroes	O
understood	O
me	O
presently	O
,	O
and	O
beckoned	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
come	O
upon	O
the	O
deck	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
taking	O
my	O
fuzee	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
never	O
let	O
go	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
hand	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
mastered	O
the	O
ship	O
--	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
offering	O
to	O
take	O
hold	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
he	O
made	O
the	O
proper	O
motion	O
of	O
throwing	O
it	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
by	O
which	O
I	O
understood	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
did	O
afterwards	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
thrown	O
all	O
the	O
small-arms	O
,	O
powder	O
,	O
shot	O
,	O
swords	O
,	O
&	O
c.	O
,	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
believing	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
supposed	O
,	O
those	O
things	O
would	O
kill	O
them	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
men	O
were	O
gone	O
.	O

After	O
we	O
understood	O
this	O
we	O
made	O
no	O
question	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
crew	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
surprised	O
by	O
these	O
desperate	O
rogues	O
,	O
had	O
gone	O
the	O
same	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
been	O
thrown	O
overboard	O
also	O
.	O

We	O
looked	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
ship	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
find	O
any	O
blood	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
thought	O
we	O
did	O
perceive	O
some	O
in	O
several	O
places	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
heat	O
of	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
melting	O
the	O
pitch	O
and	O
tar	O
upon	O
the	O
decks	O
,	O
made	O
it	O
impossible	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
discern	O
it	O
exactly	O
,	O
except	O
in	O
the	O
round-house	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
plainly	O
saw	O
that	O
there	O
had	O
been	O
much	O
blood	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
the	O
scuttle	O
open	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
we	O
supposed	O
that	O
the	O
captain	O
and	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
with	O
him	O
had	O
made	O
their	O
retreat	O
into	O
the	O
great	O
cabin	O
,	O
or	O
those	O
in	O
the	O
cabin	O
had	O
made	O
their	O
escape	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
round-house	O
.	O

But	O
that	O
which	O
confirmed	O
us	O
most	O
of	O
all	O
in	O
what	O
had	O
happened	O
was	O
that	O
,	O
upon	O
further	O
inquiry	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
of	O
the	O
negroes	O
very	O
much	O
wounded	O
,	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
of	O
them	O
with	O
shot	O
,	O
whereof	O
one	O
had	O
his	O
leg	O
broken	O
and	O
lay	O
in	O
a	O
miserable	O
condition	O
,	O
the	O
flesh	O
being	O
mortified	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
our	O
friend	O
William	O
said	O
,	O
in	O
two	O
days	O
more	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
died	O
.	O

William	O
was	O
a	O
most	O
dexterous	O
surgeon	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
showed	O
it	O
in	O
this	O
cure	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
all	O
the	O
surgeons	O
we	O
had	O
on	O
board	O
both	O
our	O
ships	O
-LRB-	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
five	O
that	O
called	O
themselves	O
bred	O
surgeons	O
,	O
besides	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
who	O
were	O
pretenders	O
or	O
assistants	O
-RRB-	O
--	O
though	O
all	O
these	O
gave	O
their	O
opinions	O
that	O
the	O
negro	O
's	O
leg	O
must	O
be	O
cut	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
his	O
life	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
saved	O
without	O
it	O
;	O
that	O
the	O
mortification	O
had	O
touched	O
the	O
marrow	O
in	O
the	O
bone	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
tendons	O
were	O
mortified	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
never	O
have	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
his	O
leg	O
if	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
cured	O
,	O
William	O
said	O
nothing	O
in	O
general	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
his	O
opinion	O
was	O
otherwise	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
desired	O
the	O
wound	O
might	O
be	O
searched	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
then	O
tell	O
them	O
further	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
he	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
the	O
leg	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
desired	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
surgeons	O
to	O
assist	O
him	O
,	O
we	O
appointed	O
him	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
ablest	O
of	O
them	O
to	O
help	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
to	O
look	O
on	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
thought	O
fit	O
.	O

William	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
his	O
own	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
pretended	O
to	O
find	O
fault	O
at	O
first	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
he	O
proceeded	O
and	O
searched	O
every	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
leg	O
where	O
he	O
suspected	O
the	O
mortification	O
had	O
touched	O
it	O
;	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
he	O
cut	O
off	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
mortified	O
flesh	O
,	O
in	O
all	O
which	O
the	O
poor	O
fellow	O
felt	O
no	O
pain	O
.	O

William	O
proceeded	O
till	O
he	O
brought	O
the	O
vessels	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
cut	O
to	O
bleed	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
man	O
to	O
cry	O
out	O
;	O
then	O
he	O
reduced	O
the	O
splinters	O
of	O
the	O
bone	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
calling	O
for	O
help	O
,	O
set	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
bound	O
it	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
laid	O
the	O
man	O
to	O
rest	O
,	O
who	O
found	O
himself	O
much	O
easier	O
than	O
before	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
first	O
opening	O
the	O
surgeons	O
began	O
to	O
triumph	O
;	O
the	O
mortification	O
seemed	O
to	O
spread	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
long	O
red	O
streak	O
of	O
blood	O
appeared	O
from	O
the	O
wound	O
upwards	O
to	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
man	O
's	O
thigh	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
surgeons	O
told	O
me	O
the	O
man	O
would	O
die	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
hours	O
.	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
William	O
himself	O
under	O
some	O
surprise	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
I	O
asked	O
him	O
how	O
long	O
he	O
thought	O
the	O
poor	O
fellow	O
could	O
live	O
,	O
he	O
looked	O
gravely	O
at	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
,	O
``	O
As	O
long	O
as	O
thou	O

I	O

was	O
not	O
just	O
then	O
upon	O
the	O
operation	O
as	O
to	O
his	O

was	O

up	O
something	O

give	O
the	O

to	O
repel	O

I	O
thought	O

to	O
abate	O

prevent	O
any	O
feverish	O
temper	O
that	O
might	O
happen	O
in	O
the	O
blood	O

after	O
which	O
he	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
opened	O
the	O
leg	O
in	O
two	O
places	O
above	O
the	O
wound	O

cutting	O
out	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
mortified	O
flesh	O
,	O
which	O
it	O
seemed	O
was	O
occasioned	O
by	O
the	O
bandage	O

which	O
had	O
pressed	O
the	O
parts	O
too	O
much	O
;	O
and	O
withal	O

the	O
blood	O

at	O
the	O
time	O
in	O
a	O
more	O

Well	O
,	O
our	O

William	O
conquered	O
all	O
this	O

cleared	O
the	O
spreading	O
mortification	O

and	O
the	O
red	O
streak	O
went	O
off	O
again	O
,	O
the	O

began	O
to	O

to	O
run	O

in	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
the	O

his	O

no	O

gathered	O

daily	O

,	O
in	O
a	O

he	O
was	O
a	O

in	O
about	O
ten	O

we	O
kept	O
him	O

us	O

him	O
an	O

But	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
:	O
we	O
never	O
could	O
come	O
at	O
a	O

some	O

on	O

I	O
was	O
convinced	O
by	O
these	O

we	O
had	O
all	O
much	O

to	O
keep	O
our	O

from	O

some	O

to	O
make	O

What	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
told	O
?	O

He	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
one	O
word	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
persuaded	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
negroes	O
must	O
needs	O
understand	O
him	O
when	O
he	O
asked	O

whether	O
the	O

no	O

like	O
ours	O

and	O
what	O
was	O

of	O
it	O

But	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
remedy	O
but	O
to	O
wait	O
till	O
we	O

these	O

to	O
adjourn	O
the	O

The	O
case	O
was	O
thus	O
:	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
taken	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
never	O
understand	O

because	O
they	O
never	O
knew	O
the	O
English	O

which	O
we	O
give	O
to	O
those	O

,	O
or	O
what	O
nation	O
they	O
were	O
who	O
belonged	O
to	O
the	O

they	O

thus	O

the	O
negro	O
I	O
examined	O

who	O
was	O
the	O

whose	O
leg	O
William	O

that	O

the	O

himself	O
in	O

one	O

out	O

When	O

That	O
they	O
boarded	O
the	O

in	O
a	O

and	O
killed	O
at	O

all	O

of	O
the	O

were	O
at	O

it	O

three	O

after	O

that	O
they	O
had	O
killed	O
about	O
thirty	O
of	O
the	O

on	O

such	O
things	O

one	O

killed	O
three	O

with	O
an	O

after	O

the	O

himself	O
at	O
the	O
door	O

the	O

which	O
he	O
had	O
split	O
open	O
with	O
the	O

and	O
this	O
we	O
supposed	O
was	O
the	O
occasion	O
of	O
the	O
great	O
quantity	O

blood	O
which	O
we	O
saw	O
at	O
the	O

The	O

negro	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
they	O

all	O
the	O
powder	O

shot	O
they	O
could	O
find	O
into	O
the	O

and	O
they	O

Being	O
asked	O
how	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
have	O
their	O

in	O
such	O
a	O

his	O

was	O

``	O
They	O

him	O

he	O
said	O
they	O

up	O

He	O
said	O
they	O
were	O
terribly	O

believing	O
we	O
were	O
the	O

was	O
the	O
account	O
we	O

that	O

our	O

what	O
to	O

with	O
the	O
negroes	O

The	O
Portuguese	O
in	O
the	O
Brazils	O
would	O
have	O

them	O
all	O
of	O
us	O

been	O
glad	O
of	O
the	O

if	O
we	O

not	O
showed	O
ourselves	O
enemies	O

We	O
all	O
agreed	O
to	O
this	O

appointed	O
to	O
go	O
away	O
ourselves	O
towards	O
the	O
Rio	PNM

where	O
we	O
had	O
thought	O

going	O
before	O

to	O
wait	O
for	O
him	O
,	O
not	O
there	O

at	O
Port	PNM
St	PNM

,	O
as	O
the	O

call	O
it	O
,	O
lying	O
at	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
which	O
they	O
call	O
Rio	PNM

where	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
had	O
a	O
small	O
fort	O

a	O
few	O
people	O

but	O
we	O
believe	O
there	O
was	O
nobody	O
in	O

Here	O
we	O
took	O
up	O
our	O
station	O

cruising	O
off	O
and	O
on	O

to	O
see	O
if	O
we	O

we	O
met	O

nothing	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
employed	O
ourselves	O
in	O
things	O

for	O

off	O
to	O

William	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
meantime	O
,	O
went	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
the	O
land	O
about	O
the	O
Cape	PNM

St	PNM
Thomas	PNM
;	O
and	O
betwixt	O
that	O
and	O
the	O
isles	O
De	O
Tuberon	O
he	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
trade	O
with	O
the	O
planters	O
for	O
all	O
his	O
negroes	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
the	O
women	O
as	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
price	O
too	O
;	O
for	O
William	O
,	O
who	O
spoke	O
Portuguese	O
pretty	O
well	O
,	O
told	O
them	O
a	O
fair	O
story	O
enough	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
in	O
scarcity	O
of	O
provisions	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
driven	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
say	O
,	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
knowledge	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
must	O
go	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
Jamaica	PNM
,	O
or	O
sell	O
there	O
upon	O
the	O
coast	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
plausible	O
tale	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
easily	O
believed	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
you	O
observe	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
the	O
negroes	O
'	O
sailing	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
happened	O
in	O
their	O
voyage	O
,	O
was	O
every	O
word	O
of	O
it	O
true	O
.	O

By	O
this	O
method	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
true	O
to	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
William	O
passed	O
for	O
what	O
he	O
was	O
--	O
I	O
mean	O
,	O
for	O
a	O
very	O
honest	O
fellow	O
;	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
assistance	O
of	O
one	O
planter	O
,	O
who	O
sent	O
to	O
some	O
of	O
his	O
neighbour	O
planters	O
,	O
and	O
managed	O
the	O
trade	O
among	O
themselves	O
,	O
he	O
got	O
a	O
quick	O
market	O
;	O
for	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
five	O
weeks	O
William	O
sold	O
all	O
his	O
negroes	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
sold	O
the	O
ship	O
itself	O
,	O
and	O
shipped	O
himself	O
and	O
his	O
twenty	O
men	O
,	O
with	O
two	O
negro	O
boys	O
whom	O
he	O
had	O
left	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
sloop	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
which	O
the	O
planters	O
used	O
to	O
send	O
on	O
board	O
for	O
the	O
negroes	O
.	O

With	O
this	O
sloop	O
Captain	O
William	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
then	O
called	O
him	O
,	O
came	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
us	O
at	O
Port	PNM
St	PNM
Pedro	PNM
,	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
32	O
degrees	O
30	O
minutes	O
south	O
.	O

Nothing	O
was	O
more	O
surprising	O
to	O
us	O
than	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
sloop	O
come	O
along	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
carrying	O
Portuguese	O
colours	O
,	O
and	O
come	O
in	O
directly	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
after	O
we	O
were	O
assured	O
he	O
had	O
discovered	O
both	O
our	O
ships	O
.	O

We	O
fired	O
a	O
gun	O
,	O
upon	O
her	O
nearer	O
approach	O
,	O
to	O
bring	O
her	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
,	O
but	O
immediately	O
she	O
fired	O
five	O
guns	O
by	O
way	O
of	O
salute	O
,	O
and	O
spread	O
her	O
English	O
ancient	O
.	O

Then	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
guess	O
it	O
was	O
friend	O
William	O
,	O
but	O
wondered	O
what	O
was	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
his	O
being	O
in	O
a	O
sloop	O
,	O
whereas	O
we	O
sent	O
him	O
away	O
in	O
a	O
ship	O
of	O
near	O
300	O
tons	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
soon	O
let	O
us	O
into	O
the	O
whole	O
history	O
of	O
his	O
management	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
reason	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
well	O
satisfied	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
brought	O
the	O
sloop	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
,	O
he	O
came	O
aboard	O
of	O
my	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
he	O
gave	O
us	O
an	O
account	O
how	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
trade	O
by	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
a	O
Portuguese	O
planter	O
,	O
who	O
lived	O
near	O
the	O
seaside	O
;	O
how	O
he	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
and	O
went	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
first	O
house	O
he	O
could	O
see	O
,	O
and	O
asked	O
the	O
man	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
to	O
sell	O
him	O
some	O
hogs	O
,	O
pretending	O
at	O
first	O
he	O
only	O
stood	O
in	O
upon	O
the	O
coast	O
to	O
take	O
in	O
fresh	O
water	O
and	O
buy	O
some	O
provisions	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
man	O
not	O
only	O
sold	O
him	O
seven	O
fat	O
hogs	O
,	O
but	O
invited	O
him	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
five	O
men	O
he	O
had	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
dinner	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
invited	O
the	O
planter	O
on	O
board	O
his	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
return	O
for	O
his	O
kindness	O
,	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
negro	O
girl	O
for	O
his	O
wife	O
.	O

This	O
so	O
obliged	O
the	O
planter	O
that	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
he	O
sent	O
him	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
luggage-boat	O
,	O
a	O
cow	O
and	O
two	O
sheep	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
chest	O
of	O
sweetmeats	O
and	O
some	O
sugar	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
bag	O
of	O
tobacco	O
,	O
and	O
invited	O
Captain	O
William	O
on	O
shore	O
again	O
;	O
that	O
,	O
after	O
this	O
,	O
they	O
grew	O
from	O
one	O
kindness	O
to	O
another	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
began	O
to	O
talk	O
about	O
trading	O
for	O
some	O
negroes	O
;	O
and	O
William	O
,	O
pretending	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
do	O
him	O
service	O
,	O
consented	O
to	O
sell	O
him	O
thirty	O
negroes	O
for	O
his	O
private	O
use	O
in	O
his	O
plantation	O
,	O
for	O
which	O
he	O
gave	O
William	O
ready	O
money	O
in	O
gold	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
rate	O
of	O
five-and-thirty	O
moidores	O
per	O
head	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
planter	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
use	O
great	O
caution	O
in	O
the	O
bringing	O
them	O
on	O
shore	O
;	O
for	O
which	O
purpose	O
he	O
made	O
William	O
weigh	O
and	O
stand	O
out	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
in	O
again	O
,	O
about	O
fifty	O
miles	O
farther	O
north	O
,	O
where	O
at	O
a	O
little	O
creek	O
he	O
took	O
the	O
negroes	O
on	O
shore	O
at	O
another	O
plantation	O
,	O
being	O
a	O
friend	O
's	O
of	O
his	O
,	O
whom	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
trust	O
.	O

This	O
remove	O
brought	O
William	O
into	O
a	O
further	O
intimacy	O
,	O
not	O
only	O
with	O
the	O
first	O
planter	O
,	O
but	O
also	O
with	O
his	O
friends	O
,	O
who	O
desired	O
to	O
have	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
negroes	O
also	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
from	O
one	O
to	O
another	O
,	O
they	O
bought	O
so	O
many	O
,	O
till	O
one	O
overgrown	O
planter	O
took	O
100	O
negroes	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
all	O
William	O
had	O
left	O
,	O
and	O
sharing	O
them	O
with	O
another	O
planter	O
,	O
that	O
other	O
planter	O
chaffered	O
with	O
William	O
for	O
ship	O
and	O
all	O
,	O
giving	O
him	O
in	O
exchange	O
a	O
very	O
clean	O
,	O
large	O
,	O
well-built	O
sloop	O
of	O
near	O
sixty	O
tons	O
,	O
very	O
well	O
furnished	O
,	O
carrying	O
six	O
guns	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
made	O
her	O
afterwards	O
carry	O
twelve	O
guns	O
.	O

William	O
had	O
300	O
moidores	O
of	O
gold	O
,	O
besides	O
the	O
sloop	O
,	O
in	O
payment	O
for	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
and	O
with	O
this	O
money	O
he	O
stored	O
the	O
sloop	O
as	O
full	O
as	O
she	O
could	O
hold	O
with	O
provisions	O
,	O
especially	O
bread	O
,	O
some	O
pork	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
sixty	O
hogs	O
alive	O
;	O
among	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
William	O
got	O
eighty	O
barrels	O
of	O
good	O
gunpowder	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
very	O
much	O
for	O
our	O
purpose	O
;	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
provisions	O
which	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
French	O
ship	O
he	O
took	O
out	O
also	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
agreeable	O
account	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
especially	O
when	O
we	O
saw	O
that	O
William	O
had	O
received	O
in	O
gold	O
coined	O
,	O
or	O
by	O
weight	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
Spanish	O
silver	O
,	O
60,000	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
,	O
besides	O
a	O
new	O
sloop	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
vast	O
quantity	O
of	O
provisions	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
very	O
glad	O
of	O
the	O
sloop	O
in	O
particular	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
consult	O
what	O
we	O
should	O
do	O
,	O
whether	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
best	O
turn	O
off	O
our	O
great	O
Portuguese	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
stick	O
to	O
our	O
first	O
ship	O
and	O
the	O
sloop	O
,	O
seeing	O
we	O
had	O
scarce	O
men	O
enough	O
for	O
all	O
three	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
biggest	O
ship	O
was	O
thought	O
too	O
big	O
for	O
our	O
business	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
another	O
dispute	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
now	O
decided	O
,	O
brought	O
the	O
first	O
to	O
a	O
conclusion	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
dispute	O
was	O
,	O
whither	O
we	O
should	O
go	O
.	O

My	O
comrade	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
called	O
him	O
now	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
he	O
that	O
was	O
my	O
captain	O
before	O
we	O
took	O
this	O
Portuguese	O
man-of-war	O
,	O
was	O
for	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
,	O
and	O
coasting	O
up	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
of	O
America	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
fail	O
of	O
making	O
several	O
good	O
prizes	O
upon	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
then	O
,	O
if	O
occasion	O
required	O
it	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
come	O
home	O
by	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
to	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
,	O
and	O
so	O
go	O
round	O
the	O
globe	O
,	O
as	O
others	O
had	O
done	O
before	O
us	O
.	O

But	O
my	O
head	O
lay	O
another	O
way	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
,	O
and	O
had	O
entertained	O
a	O
notion	O
ever	O
since	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
went	O
thither	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
fail	O
of	O
making	O
good	O
work	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
a	O
safe	O
retreat	O
,	O
and	O
good	O
beef	O
to	O
victual	O
our	O
ship	O
,	O
among	O
my	O
old	O
friends	O
the	O
natives	O
of	O
Zanzibar	PNM
,	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Mozambique	PNM
,	O
or	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
St	PNM
Lawrence	PNM
.	O

I	O
say	O
,	O
my	O
thoughts	O
lay	O
this	O
way	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
read	O
so	O
many	O
lectures	O
to	O
them	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
advantages	O
they	O
would	O
certainly	O
make	O
of	O
their	O
strength	O
by	O
the	O
prizes	O
they	O
would	O
take	O
in	O
the	O
Gulf	PNM
of	PNM
Mocha	PNM
,	O
or	O
the	O
Red	O
Sea	O
,	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Malabar	PNM
,	O
or	O
the	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM
Bengal	PNM
,	O
that	O
I	O
amazed	O
them	O
.	O

With	O
these	O
arguments	O
I	O
prevailed	O
on	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
all	O
resolved	O
to	O
steer	O
away	O
S.E.	O
for	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
of	PNM
Good	PNM
Hope	PNM
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
consequence	O
of	O
this	O
resolution	O
,	O
we	O
concluded	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
sloop	O
,	O
and	O
sail	O
with	O
all	O
three	O
,	O
not	O
doubting	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
assured	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
should	O
find	O
men	O
there	O
to	O
make	O
up	O
the	O
number	O
wanting	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
not	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
cast	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
off	O
when	O
we	O
pleased	O
.	O

We	O
could	O
do	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
make	O
our	O
friend	O
William	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
sloop	O
which	O
,	O
with	O
such	O
good	O
management	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
brought	O
us	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
us	O
,	O
though	O
with	O
much	O
good	O
manners	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
command	O
her	O
as	O
a	O
frigate	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
would	O
give	O
her	O
to	O
him	O
for	O
his	O
share	O
of	O
the	O
Guinea	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
came	O
very	O
honestly	O
by	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
keep	O
us	O
company	O
as	O
a	O
victualler	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
commanded	O
him	O
,	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
under	O
the	O
same	O
force	O
that	O
took	O
him	O
away	O
.	O

We	O
understood	O
him	O
,	O
so	O
gave	O
him	O
the	O
sloop	O
,	O
but	O
upon	O
condition	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
not	O
go	O
from	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
should	O
be	O
entirely	O
under	O
our	O
command	O

However	O
,	O
William	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
easy	O
as	O
before	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
afterwards	O
wanted	O
the	O
sloop	O
to	O
cruise	O
for	O
purchase	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
right	O
thorough-paced	O
pirate	O
in	O
her	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
such	O
pain	O
for	O
William	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
without	O
him	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
was	O
my	O
privy	O
counsellor	O
and	O
companion	O
upon	O
all	O
occasions	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
put	O
a	O
Scotsman	O
,	O
a	O
bold	O
,	O
enterprising	O
,	O
gallant	O
fellow	O
,	O
into	O
her	O
,	O
named	O
Gordon	PNM
,	O
and	O
made	O
her	O
carry	O
twelve	O
guns	O
and	O
four	O
petereroes	O
,	O
though	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
we	O
wanted	O
men	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
none	O
of	O
us	O
manned	O
in	O
proportion	O
to	O
our	O
force	O
.	O

We	O
sailed	O
away	O
for	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
of	PNM
Good	PNM
Hope	PNM
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
October	O
1706	O
,	O
and	O
passed	O
by	O
,	O
in	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
,	O
the	O
12th	O
of	O
November	O
following	O
,	O
having	O
met	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
bad	O
weather	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
several	O
merchant-ships	O
in	O
the	O
roads	O
there	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
English	O
as	O
Dutch	O
,	O
whether	O
outward	O
bound	O
or	O
homeward	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
;	O
be	O
it	O
what	O
it	O
would	O
,	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
fit	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
,	O
not	O
knowing	O
what	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
,	O
or	O
what	O
they	O
might	O
attempt	O
against	O
us	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
knew	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
wanted	O
fresh	O
water	O
,	O
we	O
sent	O
the	O
two	O
boats	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
man-of-war	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
Portuguese	O
seamen	O
or	O
negroes	O
in	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
watering-place	O
,	O
to	O
take	O
in	O
water	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
meantime	O
we	O
hung	O
out	O
a	O
Portuguese	O
ancient	O
at	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
lay	O
by	O
all	O
that	O
night	O
.	O

They	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
seems	O
we	O
passed	O
for	O
anything	O
but	O
really	O
what	O
we	O
was	O
.	O

Our	O
boats	O
returning	O
the	O
third	O
time	O
loaden	O
,	O
about	O
five	O
o'clock	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
we	O
thought	O
ourselves	O
sufficiently	O
watered	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
before	O
our	O
men	O
returned	O
the	O
last	O
time	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
blowing	O
an	O
easy	O
gale	O
at	O
west	O
,	O
we	O
perceived	O
a	O
boat	O
in	O
the	O
grey	O
of	O
the	O
morning	O
under	O
sail	O
,	O
crowding	O
to	O
come	O
up	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
afraid	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
gone	O
.	O

We	O
soon	O
found	O
it	O
was	O
an	O
English	O
long-boat	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
pretty	O
full	O
of	O
men	O
.	O

We	O
could	O
not	O
imagine	O
what	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
but	O
a	O
boat	O
,	O
we	O
thought	O
there	O
could	O
be	O
no	O
great	O
harm	O
in	O
it	O
to	O
let	O
them	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
it	O
appeared	O
they	O
came	O
only	O
to	O
inquire	O
who	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
give	O
them	O
a	O
full	O
account	O
of	O
our	O
business	O
,	O
by	O
taking	O
them	O
along	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
seeing	O
we	O
wanted	O
men	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
anything	O
.	O

But	O
they	O
saved	O
us	O
the	O
labour	O
of	O
being	O
in	O
doubt	O
how	O
to	O
dispose	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
seems	O
our	O
Portuguese	O
seamen	O
,	O
who	O
went	O
for	O
water	O
,	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
so	O
silent	O
at	O
the	O
watering-places	O
as	O
we	O
thought	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
case	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
was	O
this	O
:	O
Captain	O
--	O
-LRB-	O
I	O
forbear	O
his	O

at	O

for	O
a	O

-RRB-	O

captain	O
of	O
an	O
East	O
India	O
merchant-ship	O
,	O
bound	O
afterwards	O
for	O
China	PNM
,	O
had	O
found	O
some	O
reason	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
severe	O
with	O
his	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
handled	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
very	O
roughly	O
at	O
St	PNM
Helena	PNM
;	O
insomuch	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
threatened	O
among	O
themselves	O
to	O
leave	O
the	O
ship	O
the	O
first	O
opportunity	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
long	O
wished	O
for	O
that	O
opportunity	O

Some	O
of	O
these	O
men	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
our	O
boat	O
at	O
the	O

and	O
inquiring	O
of	O
one	O
another	O
who	O
we	O
were	O

and	O
upon	O
what	O

,	O
whether	O
the	O

by	O
faltering	O
in	O
their	O

made	O
them	O
suspect	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
out	O
upon	O
the	O

or	O
whether	O
they	O
told	O
it	O
in	O

for	O
they	O
all	O

but	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
ever	O
the	O
men	O
carried	O
the	O
news	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
ships	O
which	O
lay	O
by	O
to	O
the	O

were	O

and	O
that	O

upon	O
the	O

account	O
_	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
by	O
they	O
way	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
sea	O
term	O
for	O
a	O
pirate	O
;	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
ever	O
they	O
heard	O
it	O
,	O
they	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
,	O
and	O
getting	O
all	O
things	O
ready	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
their	O
chests	O
and	O
clothes	O
,	O
and	O
whatever	O
else	O
they	O
could	O
,	O
they	O
came	O
away	O
before	O
it	O
was	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
up	O
with	O
us	O
about	O
seven	O
o'clock	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
came	O
by	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
side	O
which	O
I	O
commanded	O
we	O
hailed	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
usual	O
manner	O
,	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
and	O
who	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
their	O
business	O
.	O

They	O
answered	O
they	O
were	O
Englishmen	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

We	O
told	O
them	O
they	O
might	O
lay	O
the	O
ship	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
but	O
ordered	O
they	O
should	O
let	O
only	O
one	O
man	O
enter	O
the	O
ship	O
till	O
the	O
captain	O
knew	O
their	O
business	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
come	O
without	O
any	O
arms	O
.	O

They	O
said	O
,	O
Ay	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
their	O
hearts	O
.	O

We	O
presently	O
found	O
their	O
business	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
desired	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
for	O
their	O
arms	O
,	O
they	O
desired	O
we	O
would	O
send	O
men	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
deliver	O
them	O
all	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
done	O
.	O

The	O
fellow	O
that	O
came	O
up	O
to	O
me	O
told	O
me	O
how	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
used	O
by	O
their	O
captain	O
,	O
how	O
he	O
had	O
starved	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
used	O
them	O
like	O
dogs	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
knew	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
admitted	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
satisfied	O
two-thirds	O
of	O
them	O
would	O
leave	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
the	O
fellows	O
were	O
very	O
hearty	O
in	O
their	O
resolution	O
,	O
and	O
jolly	O
brisk	O
sailors	O
they	O
were	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
I	O
would	O
do	O
nothing	O
without	O
our	O
admiral	O
,	O
that	O
was	O
the	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
ship	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
sent	O
my	O
pinnace	O
on	O
board	O
Captain	O
Wilmot	O
,	O
to	O
desire	O
him	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
board	O

But	O
he	O
was	O
indisposed	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
to	O
leeward	O
,	O
excused	O
his	O
coming	O
,	O
but	O
left	O
it	O
all	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
but	O
before	O
my	O
boat	O
was	O
returned	O
,	O
Captain	O
Wilmot	O
called	O
to	O
me	O
by	O
his	O
speaking-trumpet	O
,	O
which	O
all	O
the	O
men	O
might	O
hear	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O

thus	O

calling	O
me	O

my	O

``	O

there	O
was	O
no	O

the	O

and	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O

they	O
set	O
up	O
a	O

we	O
bound	O
them	O
to	O
us	O
by	O
a	O
stronger	O
obligation	O
still	O
after	O
this	O

for	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
Madagascar	PNM
,	O
Captain	O
Wilmot	O
,	O
with	O
consent	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
ship	O

company	O

ordered	O
that	O
these	O
men	O
should	O
have	O
as	O
much	O
money	O
given	O
them	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
stock	O
as	O
was	O
due	O
to	O
them	O
for	O
their	O
pay	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
they	O
had	O
left	O
;	O
and	O
after	O
that	O
we	O
allowed	O
them	O
twenty	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
a	O
man	O
bounty	O
money	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
we	O
entered	O
them	O
upon	O
shares	O

as	O
we	O
were	O
all	O

brave	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
28th	O
of	O
November	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
having	O
had	O
some	O
bad	O
weather	O

we	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
in	O
the	O
road	O
off	O
St	PNM
Augustine	PNM

at	O
the	O
south-west	O

We	O
lay	O
here	O
awhile	O
and	O
trafficked	O
with	O
the	O
natives	O
for	O
some	O
good	O
beef	O
;	O
though	O
the	O
weather	O
was	O
so	O
hot	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
promise	O
ourselves	O
to	O
salt	O
any	O
of	O
it	O
up	O
to	O
keep	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
showed	O
them	O
the	O
way	O
which	O
we	O
practised	O
before	O
,	O
to	O
salt	O
it	O
first	O
with	O
saltpetre	O
,	O
then	O
cure	O
it	O
by	O
drying	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O

which	O
made	O
it	O
eat	O
very	O
agreeably	O

not	O
so	O
wholesome	O
for	O
our	O
men	O

that	O
not	O

boiling	O

this	O
way	O

would	O

too	O
salt	O

the	O
fat	O
of	O

This	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O

made	O
ourselves	O

had	O
not	O
tasted	O
any	O
in	O
England	PNM
for	O
so	O
long	O
a	O
time	O
.	O

Having	O
now	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
remained	O
here	O
,	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
consider	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
place	O
for	O
our	O
business	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
,	O
that	O
had	O
some	O
views	O
a	O
particular	O
way	O
of	O
my	O
own	O
,	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
station	O
for	O
those	O
who	O
looked	O
for	O
purchase	O
;	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
two	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
which	O
were	O
particularly	O
proper	O
for	O
our	O
purposes	O
;	O
first	O
,	O
the	O
bay	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
Mauritius	PNM
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
usual	O
way	O
which	O
ships	O
that	O
came	O
from	O
the	O
Malabar	PNM
coast	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Coromandel	PNM
,	PNM
Fort	PNM
St	PNM

,	O
&	O
c.	O
,	O
used	O
to	O
take	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
waited	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
we	O
ought	O
to	O
take	O
our	O
station	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
resolve	O
to	O
fall	O
upon	O
the	O
European	O
traders	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
generally	O
ships	O
of	O
force	O
and	O
well	O
manned	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
blows	O
must	O
be	O
looked	O
for	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
had	O
another	O
prospect	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
promised	O
myself	O
would	O
yield	O
equal	O
profit	O
,	O
or	O
perhaps	O
greater	O
,	O
without	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
hazard	O
and	O
difficulty	O
of	O
the	O
former	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
Gulf	O
of	O
Mocha	PNM
,	O
or	O
the	O
Red	O
Sea	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
the	O
trade	O
here	O
was	O
great	O
,	O
the	O
ships	O
rich	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Strait	PNM
of	PNM
Babelmandel	PNM
narrow	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
doubt	O
but	O
we	O
might	O
cruise	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
let	O
nothing	O
slip	O
our	O
hands	O
,	O
having	O
the	O
seas	O
open	O
from	O
the	O
Red	O
Sea	O
,	O
along	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Arabia	PNM

the	O
Persian	O
Gulf	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Malabar	PNM
side	O
of	O
the	O
Indies	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
them	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
observed	O
when	O
I	O
sailed	O
round	O
the	O
island	O
in	O
my	O
former	O
progress	O
;	O
how	O
that	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
northernmost	O
point	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
several	O
very	O
good	O
harbours	O
and	O
roads	O
for	O
our	O
ships	O
;	O
that	O
the	O
natives	O
were	O
even	O
more	O
civil	O
and	O
tractable	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
than	O
those	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
not	O
having	O
been	O
so	O
often	O
ill-treated	O
by	O
European	O
sailors	O
as	O
those	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
south	O
and	O
east	O
sides	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
always	O
be	O
sure	O
of	O
a	O
retreat	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
driven	O
to	O
put	O
in	O
by	O
any	O
necessity	O
,	O
either	O
of	O
enemies	O
or	O
weather	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
easily	O
convinced	O
of	O
the	O
reasonableness	O
of	O
my	O
scheme	O
;	O
and	O
Captain	O
Wilmot	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
now	O
called	O
our	O
admiral	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
was	O
at	O
first	O
of	O
the	O
mind	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
lie	O
at	O
the	O
island	O
Mauritius	PNM
,	O
and	O
wait	O
for	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
European	O
merchant-ships	O

the	O
road	O
of	O
Coromandel	PNM

or	O
the	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM
Bengal	PNM
,	O
was	O
now	O
of	O
my	O
mind	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
true	O
we	O
were	O
strong	O
enough	O
to	O
have	O
attacked	O
an	O
English	O
East	O
India	PNM
ship	O
of	O
the	O
greatest	O
force	O
,	O
though	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
said	O
to	O
carry	O
fifty	O
guns	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
represented	O
to	O
him	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
sure	O
to	O
have	O
blows	O
and	O
blood	O
if	O
we	O
took	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
their	O
loading	O
was	O
not	O
of	O
equal	O
value	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
room	O
to	O
dispose	O
of	O
their	O
merchandise	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
our	O
circumstances	O
stood	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
rather	O
have	O
taken	O
one	O
outward-bound	O
East	O
India	PNM
ship	O
,	O
with	O
her	O
ready	O
cash	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
perhaps	O
to	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
forty	O
or	O
fifty	O
thousand	O
pounds	O
,	O
than	O
three	O
homeward-bound	O
,	O
though	O
their	O
loading	O
would	O
at	O
London	PNM
be	O
worth	O
three	O
times	O
the	O
money	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
whither	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
dispose	O
of	O
the	O
cargo	O
;	O
whereas	O
the	O
ships	O
from	O
London	PNM
had	O
abundance	O
of	O
things	O
we	O
knew	O
how	O
to	O
make	O
use	O
of	O
besides	O
their	O
money	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
their	O
stores	O
of	O
provisions	O
and	O
liquors	O
,	O
and	O
great	O
quantities	O
of	O
the	O
like	O
sent	O
to	O
the	O
governors	O
and	O
factories	O
at	O
the	O
English	O
settlements	O
for	O
their	O
use	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
our	O
own	O
country	O
ships	O
,	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
outward-bound	O
,	O
not	O
the	O
London	PNM
ships	O
homeward	O
.	O

All	O
these	O
things	O
considered	O
,	O
brought	O
the	O
admiral	O
to	O
be	O
of	O
my	O
mind	O
entirely	O
;	O
so	O
,	O
after	O
taking	O
in	O
water	O
and	O
some	O
fresh	O
provisions	O
where	O
we	O
lay	O

which	O
was	O

,	O
on	O
the	O
south-west	O

of	O
the	O

away	O
south	O

and	O
afterwards	O
S.S.E.	O
,	O
to	O
round	O
the	O
island	O

and	O
in	O
about	O
six	O
days	O
'	O
sail	O
got	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
wake	O
of	O
the	O
island	O

and	O
steered	O
away	O
north	O
,	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
off	O
Port	PNM

,	O
and	O
then	O
north	O
by	O
east	O

to	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
13	O
degrees	O
40	O
minutes	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
just	O
at	O
the	O
farthest	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
admiral	O
,	O
keeping	O
ahead	O

made	O
the	O

to	O
the	O
west	O

clear	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
island	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
he	O
brought	O
to	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
sent	O
a	O
sloop	O
to	O
stand	O
in	O
round	O
the	O
farthest	O
point	O
north	O
,	O
and	O
coast	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
for	O
a	O
harbour	O
to	O
put	O
into	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
did	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
brought	O
us	O
an	O
account	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
deep	O
bay	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
road	O
,	O
and	O
several	O
little	O
islands	O
,	O
under	O
which	O
they	O
found	O
good	O
riding	O
,	O
in	O
ten	O
to	O
seventeen	O
fathom	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
accordingly	O
there	O
we	O
put	O
in	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
afterwards	O
found	O
occasion	O
to	O
remove	O
our	O
station	O
,	O
as	O
you	O
shall	O
hear	O
presently	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
now	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
but	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
acquaint	O
ourselves	O
a	O
little	O
with	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
take	O
in	O
fresh	O
water	O
and	O
some	O
fresh	O
provisions	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
to	O
sea	O
again	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
the	O
people	O
very	O
easy	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
cattle	O
they	O
had	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
being	O
at	O
the	O
extremity	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
not	O
such	O
quantities	O
of	O
cattle	O
here	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
present	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
appoint	O
this	O
for	O
our	O
place	O
of	O
rendezvous	O
,	O
and	O
go	O
and	O
look	O
out	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
about	O
the	O
latter	O
end	O
of	O
April	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
we	O
put	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
cruised	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
Arabian	O
coast	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
long	O
run	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
the	O
winds	O
generally	O
blow	O
trade	O
from	O
the	O
S.	O
and	O
S.S.E.	O
from	O
May	O
to	O
September	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
good	O
weather	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
about	O
twenty	O
days	O
we	O
made	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Socotra	PNM
,	O
lying	O
south	O
from	O
the	O
Arabian	O
coast	O
,	O
and	O
E.S.E.	O
from	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
Gulf	PNM
of	PNM
Mocha	PNM
,	O
or	O
the	O
Red	O
Sea	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
took	O
in	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
off	O
and	O
on	O
upon	O
the	O
Arabian	O
shore	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
not	O
cruised	O
here	O
above	O
three	O
days	O
,	O
or	O
thereabouts	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
spied	O
a	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
her	O
chase	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
up	O
with	O
her	O
,	O
never	O
was	O
such	O
a	O
poor	O
prize	O
chased	O
by	O
pirates	O
that	O
looked	O
for	O
booty	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
found	O
nothing	O
in	O
her	O
but	O
poor	O
,	O
half-naked	O
Turks	O
,	O
going	O
a	O
pilgrimage	O
to	O
Mecca	PNM
,	O
to	O
the	O
tomb	O
of	O
their	O
prophet	O
Mahomet	O
.	O

The	O
junk	O
that	O
carried	O
them	O
had	O
no	O
one	O
thing	O
worth	O
taking	O
away	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
rice	O
and	O
some	O
coffee	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
all	O
the	O
poor	O
wretches	O
had	O
for	O
their	O
subsistence	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
let	O
them	O
go	O
,	O
for	O
indeed	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
same	O
evening	O
we	O
chased	O
another	O
junk	O
with	O
two	O
masts	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
something	O
better	O
plight	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
than	O
the	O
former	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
we	O
found	O
them	O
upon	O
the	O
same	O
errand	O
,	O
but	O
only	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
people	O
of	O
some	O
better	O
fashion	O
than	O
the	O
other	O
;	O
and	O
here	O
we	O
got	O
some	O
plunder	O
,	O
some	O
Turkish	O
stores	O
,	O
a	O
few	O
diamonds	O
in	O
the	O
ear-drops	O
of	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
persons	O
,	O
some	O
fine	O
Persian	O
carpets	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
made	O
their	O
saffras	O
to	O
lie	O
upon	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
money	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
let	O
them	O
go	O
also	O
.	O

We	O
continued	O
here	O
eleven	O
days	O
longer	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
nothing	O
but	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
a	O
fishing-boat	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
twelfth	O
day	O
of	O
our	O
cruise	O
we	O
spied	O
a	O
ship	O
:	O
indeed	O
I	O
thought	O
at	O
first	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
an	O
English	O
ship	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
European	O
freighted	O
for	O
a	O
voyage	O
from	O
Goa	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Malabar	PNM
,	O
to	O
the	O
Red	O
Sea	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
very	O
rich	O
.	O

We	O
chased	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
her	O
without	O
any	O
fight	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
had	O
some	O
guns	O
on	O
board	O
too	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
many	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
her	O
manned	O
with	O
Portuguese	O
seamen	O
,	O
but	O
under	O
the	O
direction	O
of	O
five	O
merchant	O
Turks	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
hired	O
her	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Malabar	PNM
of	PNM
some	PNM
Portugal	PNM
merchants	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
laden	O
her	O
with	O
pepper	O
,	O
saltpetre	O
,	O
some	O
spices	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
loading	O
was	O
chiefly	O
calicoes	O
and	O
wrought	O
silks	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
very	O
rich	O
.	O

We	O
took	O
her	O
and	O
carried	O
her	O
to	O
Socotra	PNM
;	O
but	O
we	O
really	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
her	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
same	O
reasons	O
as	O
before	O
;	O
for	O
all	O
their	O
goods	O
were	O
of	O
little	O
or	O
no	O
value	O
to	O
us	O
.	O

After	O
some	O
days	O
we	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
let	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Turkish	O
merchants	O
know	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
ransom	O
the	O
ship	O
we	O
would	O
take	O
a	O
sum	O
of	O
money	O
and	O
let	O
them	O
go	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
let	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
for	O
the	O
money	O
they	O
would	O
do	O
it	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
adjusted	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
the	O
cargo	O
at	O
30,000	O
ducats	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
agreement	O
,	O
we	O
allowed	O
the	O
sloop	O
to	O
carry	O
him	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
at	O
Dofar	PNM
,	O
in	O
Arabia	PNM
,	O
where	O
a	O
rich	O
merchant	O
laid	O
down	O
the	O
money	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
off	O
with	O
our	O
sloop	O
;	O
and	O
on	O
payment	O
of	O
the	O
money	O
we	O
very	O
fairly	O
and	O
honestly	O
let	O
them	O
go	O
.	O

Some	O
days	O
after	O
this	O
we	O
took	O
an	O
Arabian	O
junk	O
,	O
going	O
from	O
the	O
Gulf	PNM
of	PNM
Persia	PNM
to	O
Mocha	PNM
,	O
with	O
a	O
good	O
quantity	O
of	O
pearl	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

We	O
gutted	O
him	O
of	O
the	O
pearl	O
,	O
which	O
it	O
seems	O
was	O
belonging	O
to	O
some	O
merchants	O
at	O
Mocha	PNM
,	O
and	O
let	O
him	O
go	O
,	O
for	O
there	O
was	O
nothing	O
else	O
worth	O
our	O
taking	O
.	O

We	O
continued	O
cruising	O
up	O
and	O
down	O
here	O
till	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
find	O
our	O
provisions	O
grow	O
low	O
,	O
when	O
Captain	O
Wilmot	O
,	O
our	O
admiral	O
,	O
told	O
us	O
it	O
was	O
time	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
going	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
rendezvous	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
said	O
the	O
same	O
,	O
being	O
a	O
little	O
weary	O
of	O
beating	O
about	O
for	O
above	O
three	O
months	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
meeting	O
with	O
little	O
or	O
nothing	O
compared	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
expectations	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
loth	O
to	O
part	O
with	O
the	O
Red	O
Sea	O
at	O
so	O
cheap	O
a	O
rate	O
,	O
and	O
pressed	O
them	O
to	O
tarry	O
a	O
little	O
longer	O
,	O
which	O
at	O
my	O
instance	O
they	O
did	O
;	O
but	O
three	O
days	O
afterwards	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
misfortune	O
,	O
understood	O
that	O
,	O
by	O
landing	O
the	O
Turkish	O
merchants	O
at	O
Dofar	PNM
,	O
we	O
had	O
alarmed	O
the	O
coast	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
Gulf	PNM
of	PNM
Persia	PNM
,	O
so	O
that	O
no	O
vessel	O
would	O
stir	O
that	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
nothing	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
expected	O
on	O
that	O
side	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
greatly	O
mortified	O
at	O
this	O
news	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
no	O
longer	O
withstand	O
the	O
importunities	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
Madagascar	PNM
.	O

However	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
wind	O
continued	O
still	O
to	O
blow	O
at	O
S.S.E.	O
by	O
S.	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
stand	O
away	O
towards	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Africa	PNM
and	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
Guardafui	PNM
,	O
the	O
winds	O
being	O
more	O
variable	O
under	O
the	O
shore	O
than	O
in	O
the	O
open	O
sea	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
chopped	O
upon	O
a	O
booty	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
look	O
for	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
made	O
amends	O
for	O
all	O
our	O
waiting	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
very	O
same	O
hour	O
that	O
we	O
made	O
land	O
we	O
spied	O
a	O
large	O
vessel	O
sailing	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
.	O

The	O
ship	O
was	O
of	O
Bengal	PNM
,	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
Great	O
Mogul	O
's	O
country	O
,	O
but	O
had	O
on	O
board	O
a	O
Dutch	O
pilot	O
,	O
whose	O
name	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
remember	O
right	O
,	O
was	O
Vandergest	O
,	O
and	O
several	O
European	O
seamen	O
,	O
whereof	O
three	O
were	O
English	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
in	O
no	O
condition	O
to	O
resist	O
us	O
.	O

The	O
rest	O
of	O
her	O
seamen	O
were	O
Indians	O
of	O
the	O
Mogul	O
's	O
subjects	O
,	O
some	O
Malabars	O
and	O
some	O
others	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
five	O
Indian	O
merchants	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
Armenians	O
.	O

It	O
seems	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
at	O
Mocha	PNM
with	O
spices	O
,	O
silks	O
,	O
diamonds	O
,	O

&	O
c.	O

such	O
goods	O
as	O
the	O
country	O
afforded	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
little	O
on	O
board	O
now	O
but	O
money	O
in	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
was	O
just	O
what	O
we	O
wanted	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
three	O
English	O
seamen	O
came	O
along	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Dutch	O
pilot	O
would	O
have	O
done	O
so	O
too	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
two	O
Armenian	O
merchants	O
entreated	O
us	O
not	O
to	O
take	O
him	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
he	O
being	O
their	O
pilot	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
none	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
knew	O
how	O
to	O
guide	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
so	O
,	O
at	O
their	O
request	O
,	O
we	O
refused	O
him	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
made	O
them	O
promise	O
he	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
used	O
ill	O
for	O
being	O
willing	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
got	O
near	O
200,000	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
in	O
this	O
vessel	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
said	O
true	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
Jew	O
of	O
Goa	O
,	O
who	O
intended	O
to	O
have	O
embarked	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
200,000	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
all	O
his	O
own	O
;	O
but	O
his	O
good	O
fortune	O
,	O
springing	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
ill	O
fortune	O
,	O
hindered	O
him	O
,	O
or	O
he	O
fell	O
sick	O
at	O
Mocha	PNM
,	O
and	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
ready	O
to	O
travel	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
saving	O
of	O

money	O

There	O
was	O
none	O
with	O
me	O
at	O
the	O
taking	O
this	O
prize	O
but	O
the	O
sloop	O
,	O
for	O
Captain	O
Wilmot	O
's	O
ship	O
proving	O
leaky	O
,	O
he	O
went	O
away	O
for	O
the	O
rendezvous	O
before	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
arrived	O
there	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
December	O
;	O
but	O
not	O
liking	O
the	O
port	O
,	O
he	O
left	O
a	O
great	O
cross	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
with	O
directions	O
written	O
on	O
a	O
plate	O
of	O
lead	O
fixed	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
come	O
after	O
him	O
to	O
the	O
great	O
bays	O
at	O
Mangahelly	PNM
,	O
where	O
he	O
found	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
harbour	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
learned	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
news	O
here	O
that	O
kept	O
us	O
from	O
him	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
admiral	O
took	O
offence	O
at	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
stopped	O
his	O
mouth	O
with	O
his	O
share	O
of	O
200,000	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
to	O
him	O
and	O
his	O
ship	O
's	O
crew	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
story	O
which	O
interrupted	O
our	O
coming	O
to	O
him	O
was	O
this	O
.	O

Between	O
Mangahelly	O
and	O
another	O
point	O
,	O
called	O
Cape	PNM
St	PNM
Sebastian	PNM
,	O
there	O
came	O
on	O
shore	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
an	O
European	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
whether	O
by	O
stress	O
of	O
weather	O
or	O
want	O
of	O
a	O
pilot	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
ship	O
stranded	O
and	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
got	O
off	O
.	O

We	O
lay	O
in	O
the	O
cove	O
or	O
harbour	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
our	O
rendezvous	O
was	O
appointed	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
not	O
yet	O
been	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
seen	O
the	O
directions	O
our	O
admiral	O
had	O
left	O
for	O
us	O
.	O

Our	O
friend	O
William	O
,	O
of	O
whom	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
nothing	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
,	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
mind	O
one	O
day	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
importuned	O
me	O
to	O
let	O
him	O
have	O
a	O
little	O
troop	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
for	O
safety	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
see	O
the	O
country	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
mightily	O
against	O
it	O
for	O
many	O
reasons	O
;	O
but	O
particularly	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
he	O
knew	O
the	O
natives	O
were	O
but	O
savages	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
treacherous	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
desired	O
him	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
go	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
had	O
he	O
gone	O
on	O
much	O
farther	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
downright	O
refused	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
commanded	O
him	O
not	O
to	O
go	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
persuade	O
me	O
to	O
let	O
him	O
go	O
,	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
would	O
give	O
me	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
reason	O
why	O
he	O
was	O
so	O
importunate	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
the	O
last	O
night	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
dream	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
so	O
forcible	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
such	O
an	O
impression	O
upon	O
his	O
mind	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
quiet	O
till	O
he	O
had	O
made	O
the	O
proposal	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
go	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
I	O
refused	O
him	O
,	O
then	O
he	O
thought	O
his	O
dream	O
was	O
significant	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
not	O
,	O
then	O
his	O
dream	O
was	O
at	O
an	O
end	O
.	O

His	O
dream	O
was	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
with	O
thirty	O
men	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
the	O
cockswain	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
was	O
one	O
,	O
upon	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
found	O
a	O
mine	O
of	O
gold	O
,	O
and	O
enriched	O
them	O
all	O
.	O

But	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
main	O
thing	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
same	O
morning	O
he	O
had	O
dreamed	O
so	O
,	O
the	O
cockswain	O
came	O
to	O
him	O
just	O
then	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
he	O
dreamed	O
he	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Madagascar	PNM
,	O
and	O
that	O
some	O
men	O
came	O
to	O
him	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
they	O
would	O
show	O
him	O
where	O
he	O
should	O
get	O
a	O
prize	O
which	O
would	O
make	O
them	O
all	O
rich	O
.	O

These	O
two	O
things	O
put	O
together	O
began	O
to	O
weigh	O
with	O
me	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
was	O
never	O
inclined	O
to	O
give	O
any	O
heed	O
to	O
dreams	O
;	O
but	O
William	O
's	O
importunity	O
turned	O
me	O
effectually	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
always	O
put	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
stress	O
upon	O
his	O
judgment	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
them	O
leave	O
to	O
go	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
charged	O
them	O
not	O
to	O
go	O
far	O
off	O
from	O
the	O
sea-coast	O
;	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
forced	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
seaside	O
upon	O
any	O
occasion	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
perhaps	O
see	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
fetch	O
them	O
off	O
with	O
our	O
boats	O
.	O

They	O
went	O
away	O
early	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
one-and-thirty	O
men	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
number	O
,	O
very	O
well	O
armed	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
stout	O
fellows	O
;	O
they	O
travelled	O
all	O
the	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
night	O
made	O
us	O
a	O
signal	O
that	O
all	O
was	O
well	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
a	O
hill	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
agreed	O
on	O
,	O
by	O
making	O
a	O
great	O
fire	O
.	O

Next	O
day	O
they	O
marched	O
down	O
the	O
hill	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
,	O
inclining	O
towards	O
the	O
seaside	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
promised	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
a	O
very	O
pleasant	O
valley	O
before	O
them	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
river	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
a	O
little	O
farther	O
below	O
them	O
,	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
big	O
enough	O
to	O
bear	O
small	O
ships	O
;	O
they	O
marched	O
apace	O
towards	O
this	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
surprised	O
with	O
the	O
noise	O
of	O
a	O
piece	O
going	O
off	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
sound	O
,	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
far	O
off	O
.	O

They	O
listened	O
long	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
hear	O
no	O
more	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
went	O
on	O
to	O
the	O
river-side	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
fine	O
fresh	O
stream	O
,	O
but	O
widened	O
apace	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
kept	O
on	O
by	O
the	O
banks	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
till	O
,	O
almost	O
at	O
once	O
,	O
it	O
opened	O
or	O
widened	O
into	O
a	O
good	O
large	O
creek	O
or	O
harbour	O
,	O
about	O
five	O
miles	O
from	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
which	O
was	O
still	O
more	O
surprising	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
marched	O
forward	O
,	O
they	O
plainly	O
saw	O
in	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
harbour	O
,	O
or	O
creek	O
,	O
the	O
wreck	O
of	O
a	O
ship	O
.	O

The	O
tide	O
was	O
up	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
appear	O
very	O
much	O
above	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
but	O

as	O
they	O
made	O
downwards	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
it	O
grow	O
bigger	O
and	O
bigger	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
tide	O
soon	O
after	O
ebbing	O
out	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
it	O
lay	O
dry	O
upon	O
the	O
sands	O
,	O
and	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
wreck	O
of	O
a	O
considerable	O
vessel	O
,	O
larger	O
than	O
could	O
be	O
expected	O
in	O
that	O
country	O

After	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
William	O
,	O
taking	O
out	O
his	O
glass	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
it	O
more	O
nearly	O
,	O
was	O
surprised	O
with	O
hearing	O
a	O
musket-shot	O
whistle	O
by	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
after	O
that	O
he	O
heard	O
the	O
gun	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
the	O
smoke	O
from	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
our	O
men	O
immediately	O
fired	O
three	O
muskets	O
,	O
to	O
discover	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
what	O
or	O
who	O
they	O
were	O
.	O

Upon	O
the	O
noise	O
of	O
these	O
guns	O
,	O
abundance	O
of	O
men	O
came	O
running	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
from	O
among	O
the	O
trees	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
could	O
easily	O
perceive	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
Europeans	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
knew	O
not	O
of	O
what	O
nation	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
hallooed	O
to	O
them	O
as	O
loud	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
,	O
and	O
by-and-by	O
they	O
got	O
a	O
long	O
pole	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
it	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
hung	O
a	O
white	O
shirt	O
upon	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
flag	O
of	O
truce	O
.	O

They	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
saw	O
it	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
their	O
glasses	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
and	O
quickly	O
after	O
our	O
men	O
see	O
a	O
boat	O
launch	O
off	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
thought	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
from	O
another	O
creek	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
;	O
and	O
immediately	O
they	O
came	O
rowing	O
over	O
the	O
creek	O
to	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
carrying	O
also	O
a	O
white	O
flag	O
as	O
a	O
token	O
of	O
truce	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
not	O
easy	O
to	O
describe	O
the	O
surprise	O
,	O
or	O
joy	O
and	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
that	O
appeared	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
not	O
only	O
white	O
men	O
,	O
but	O
Englishmen	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
place	O
so	O
remote	O
;	O
but	O
what	O
then	O
must	O
it	O
be	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
know	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
find	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
only	O
countrymen	O
but	O
comrades	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
very	O
ship	O
that	O
Captain	O
Wilmot	O
,	O
our	O
admiral	O
,	O
commanded	O
,	O
and	O
whose	O
company	O
we	O
had	O
lost	O
in	O
the	O
storm	O
at	O
Tobago	PNM
,	O
after	O
making	O
an	O
agreement	O
to	O

at	O
Madagascar	PNM

They	O
had	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
got	O
intelligence	O
of	O
us	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
been	O
a-roving	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
Gulf	PNM
of	PNM
Bengal	PNM
,	O
when	O
they	O
met	O
Captain	O
Avery	O
,	O
with	O
whom	O
they	O
joined	O
,	O
took	O
several	O

prizes	O

amongst	O
the	O

one	O

with	O
the	O

an	O
immense	O
treasure	O
in	O
money	O

jewels	O
;	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
they	O
came	O
about	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Coromandel	PNM
,	O
and	O
afterwards	O
that	O
of	O
Malabar	PNM
,	O
into	O
the	O
Gulf	PNM
of	PNM
Persia	PNM
,	O
where	O
they	O
also	O
took	O
some	O
prize	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
designed	O
for	O
the	O
south	O
part	O
of	O
Madagascar	PNM
;	O
but	O
the	O
winds	O
blowing	O
hard	O
at	O
S.E.	O
and	O
S.E.	O
by	O
E.	O
,	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
of	O
the	O
isle	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
after	O
that	O
separated	O
by	O
a	O
furious	O
tempest	O
from	O
the	O
N.W.	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
forced	O
into	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
that	O
creek	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
lost	O
their	O
ship	O

And	O
they	O
told	O
us	O
,	O
also	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
heard	O
that	O
Captain	O
Avery	O
himself	O
had	O
lost	O
his	O
ship	O
also	O
not	O

When	O
they	O
had	O
thus	O
acquainted	O
one	O
another	O
with	O
their	O
fortunes	O
,	O
the	O
poor	O
overjoyed	O
men	O
were	O
in	O
haste	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
communicate	O
their	O
joy	O
to	O
their	O
comrades	O

and	O
,	O
leaving	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
men	O
with	O
ours	O
,	O
the	O
rest	O
went	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
William	O
was	O
so	O
earnest	O
to	O
see	O
them	O
that	O
he	O
and	O
two	O
more	O
went	O
back	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
their	O
little	O
camp	O
where	O
they	O
lived	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
about	O
a	O
hundred	O
and	O
sixty	O
men	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
all	O
;	O
they	O
had	O
got	O
their	O
guns	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
ammunition	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
good	O
deal	O
of	O
their	O
powder	O
was	O
spoiled	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
raised	O
a	O
fair	O
platform	O
,	O
and	O
mounted	O
twelve	O
pieces	O
of	O
cannon	O
upon	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
sufficient	O
defence	O
to	O
them	O
on	O
that	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
and	O
just	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
platform	O
they	O
had	O
made	O
a	O
launch	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
yard	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
all	O
hard	O
at	O
work	O
,	O
building	O
another	O
little	O
ship	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
may	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
sea	O
in	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
put	O
a	O
stop	O
to	O
this	O
work	O
upon	O
the	O
news	O
they	O
had	O
of	O
our	O
being	O
come	O
in	O
.	O

When	O
our	O
men	O
went	O
into	O
their	O
huts	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
surprising	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
vast	O
stock	O
of	O
wealth	O
they	O
had	O
got	O
,	O
in	O
gold	O
and	O
silver	O
and	O
jewels	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
they	O
told	O
us	O
was	O
a	O
trifle	O
to	O
what	O
Captain	O
Avery	O
had	O
,	O
wherever	O
he	O
was	O
gone	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
five	O
days	O
we	O
had	O
waited	O
for	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
no	O
news	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
indeed	O
I	O
gave	O
them	O
over	O
for	O
lost	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
surprised	O
,	O
after	O
five	O
days	O
'	O
waiting	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
ship	O
's	O
boat	O
come	O
rowing	O
towards	O
us	O
along	O
shore	O
.	O

What	O
to	O
make	O
of	O
it	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
at	O
least	O
better	O
satisfied	O
when	O
our	O
men	O
told	O
me	O
they	O
heard	O
them	O
halloo	O
and	O
saw	O
them	O
wave	O
their	O
caps	O
to	O
us	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
little	O
time	O
they	O
came	O
quite	O
up	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
saw	O
friend	O
William	O
stand	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
and	O
make	O
signs	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
I	O
saw	O
there	O
were	O
but	O
fifteen	O
of	O
our	O
one-and-thirty	O
men	O
,	O
I	O
asked	O
him	O
what	O
had	O
become	O
of	O
their	O
fellows	O
.	O

``	O
Oh	O
,	O
''	O
says	O
William	O
,	O
``	O
they	O
are	O
all	O
very	O
well	O
;	O
and	O
my	O
dream	O
is	O
fully	O
made	O
good	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
cockswain	O
's	O
too	O
.	O
''	O

This	O
made	O
me	O
very	O
impatient	O
to	O
know	O
how	O
the	O
case	O
stood	O
;	O
so	O
he	O
told	O
us	O
the	O
whole	O
story	O
,	O
which	O
indeed	O
surprised	O
us	O
all	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
we	O
weighed	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
away	O
southerly	O
to	O
join	O
Captain	O
Wilmot	O
and	O
ship	O
at	O
Mangahelly	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
found	O
him	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
a	O
little	O
chagrined	O
at	O
our	O
stay	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
pacified	O
him	O
afterwards	O
with	O
telling	O
him	O
the	O
history	O
of	O
William	O
's	O
dream	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
consequence	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
meantime	O
the	O
camp	O
of	O
our	O
comrades	O
was	O
so	O
near	O
Mangahelly	O
,	O
that	O
our	O
admiral	O
and	O
I	O
,	O
friend	O
William	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
resolved	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
sloop	O
and	O
go	O
and	O
see	O
them	O

and	O
fetch	O
them	O
all	O

their	O
goods	O
,	O
bag	O
and	O
baggage	O
,	O
on	O
board	O
our	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
accordingly	O
we	O
did	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
their	O
camp	O
,	O
their	O
fortifications	O
,	O
the	O
battery	O
of	O
guns	O
they	O
had	O
erected	O

their	O

and	O
all	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
just	O
as	O
William	O
had	O
related	O
it	O
;	O
so	O
,	O
after	O
some	O
stay	O
,	O
we	O
took	O
all	O
the	O
men	O
into	O
the	O
sloop	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
them	O
away	O
with	O
us	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
some	O
time	O
before	O
we	O
knew	O
what	O
was	O
become	O
of	O
Captain	O
Avery	O
;	O
but	O
after	O
about	O
a	O
month	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
direction	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
who	O
had	O
lost	O
their	O
ship	O
,	O
we	O
sent	O
the	O
sloop	O
to	O
cruise	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
about	O
a	O
week	O
's	O
cruise	O
our	O

found	O
them	O

that	O
they	O
had	O

their	O
ship	O
,	O
as	O
well	O

our	O

that	O
they	O
were	O
every	O
way	O
in	O
as	O
bad	O
a	O

It	O
was	O
about	O
ten	O

before	O
the	O
sloop	O
returned	O

Captain	O
Avery	O
with	O

this	O
was	O
the	O
whole	O

as	O
I	O
remember	O
,	O
Captain	O
Avery	O
ever	O
had	O
with	O
him	O
;	O
for	O
now	O
we	O
joined	O
all	O
our	O
companies	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
stood	O
thus	O
:	O
--	O
We	O
had	O
two	O
ships	O
and	O
a	O
sloop	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
320	O
men	O

but	O
much	O
too	O
few	O

400	O

her	O
complement	O
of	O
men	O
was	O
180	O

or	O
thereabouts	O
;	O
and	O
Captain	O
Avery	O
had	O
about	O
300	O
men	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
whereof	O
he	O
had	O
ten	O
carpenters	O
with	O
him	O

most	O
of	O
which	O
were	O
taken	O
aboard	O
the	O

;	O
so	O
that	O

in	O
a	O
word	O

all	O
the	O
force	O
Avery	O
had	O
at	O
Madagascar	PNM

in	O
the	O
year	O
1699	O

as	O
you	O
have	O

and	O
never	O
had	O
any	O
more	O
than	O
about	O
1200	O
men	O
in	O
all	O

It	O
was	O
about	O
a	O
month	O
after	O
this	O
that	O
all	O
our	O
crews	O
got	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
Avery	O
was	O
unshipped	O
,	O
we	O
all	O
agreed	O
to	O

our	O
own	O

into	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
man-of-war	O
and	O
the	O

40,000	O

Captain	O

to	O

I	O
soon	O
convinced	O
him	O
that	O
this	O
place	O
would	O
be	O
no	O
security	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
pretended	O
to	O
carry	O
on	O
our	O
cruising	O
trade	O
;	O
for	O
that	O
then	O
all	O
the	O
nations	O
of	O
Europe	PNM
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
of	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
would	O
be	O
engaged	O
to	O
root	O
us	O
out	O
;	O
but	O
if	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
live	O
there	O
as	O
in	O
retirement	O
,	O
and	O
plant	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
as	O
private	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
give	O
over	O
our	O
trade	O
of	O
pirating	O
,	O
then	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
plant	O
and	O
settle	O
ourselves	O
where	O
we	O
pleased	O
.	O

But	O
then	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
would	O
be	O
to	O
treat	O
with	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
and	O
buy	O
a	O
tract	O
of	O
land	O
of	O
them	O
farther	O
up	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
seated	O
upon	O
some	O
navigable	O
river	O
,	O
where	O
boats	O
might	O
go	O
up	O
and	O
down	O
for	O
pleasure	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
ships	O
to	O
endanger	O
us	O
;	O
that	O
thus	O
planting	O
the	O
high	O
ground	O
with	O
cattle	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
cows	O
and	O
goats	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
the	O
country	O
also	O
was	O
full	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
we	O
might	O
live	O
here	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
any	O
men	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
owned	O
to	O
him	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
retreat	O
for	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
willing	O
to	O
leave	O
off	O
and	O
lay	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
did	O
not	O
care	O
to	O
venture	O
home	O
and	O
be	O
hanged	O
;	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
to	O
run	O
the	O
risk	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

Captain	O
Avery	O
,	O
however	O
he	O
made	O
no	O
positive	O
discovery	O
of	O
his	O
intentions	O
,	O
seemed	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
decline	O
my	O
notion	O
of	O
going	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
to	O
plant	O
;	O
on	O
the	O
contrary	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
apparent	O
he	O
was	O
of	O
Captain	O
Wilmot	O
's	O
opinion	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
maintain	O
themselves	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
carry	O
on	O
their	O
cruising	O
trade	O
too	O
;	O
and	O
upon	O
this	O
they	O
resolved	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
afterwards	O
understood	O
,	O
about	O
fifty	O
of	O
their	O
men	O
went	O
up	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
settled	O
themselves	O
in	O
an	O
inland	O
place	O
as	O
a	O
colony	O
.	O

Whether	O
they	O
are	O
there	O
still	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
tell	O
,	O
or	O
how	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
are	O
left	O
alive	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
my	O
opinion	O
they	O
are	O
there	O
still	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
considerably	O
increased	O
,	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
hear	O
,	O
they	O
have	O
got	O
some	O
women	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
many	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
seems	O
five	O
Dutch	O
women	O
and	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
little	O
girls	O
were	O
taken	O
by	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
Dutch	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
afterwards	O
took	O
going	O
to	O
Mocha	PNM
;	O
and	O
three	O
of	O
those	O
women	O
,	O
marrying	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
men	O
,	O
went	O
with	O
them	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
their	O
new	O
plantation	O
.	O

But	O
of	O
this	O
I	O
speak	O
only	O
by	O
hearsay	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
lay	O
here	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
our	O
people	O
mightily	O
divided	O
in	O
their	O
notions	O
;	O
some	O
were	O
for	O
going	O
this	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
that	O
,	O
till	O
at	O
last	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
foresee	O
they	O
would	O
part	O
company	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
we	O
should	O
not	O
have	O
men	O
enough	O
to	O
keep	O
together	O
to	O
man	O
the	O
great	O
ship	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
took	O
Captain	O
Wilmot	O
aside	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
talk	O
to	O
him	O
about	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
soon	O
perceived	O
that	O
he	O
inclined	O
himself	O
to	O
stay	O
at	O
Madagascar	PNM
,	O
and	O
having	O
got	O
a	O
vast	O
wealth	O
for	O
his	O
own	O
share	O
,	O
had	O
secret	O
designs	O
of	O
getting	O
home	O
some	O
way	O
or	O
other	O
.	O

I	O
argued	O
the	O
impossibility	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
hazard	O
he	O
would	O
run	O
,	O
either	O
of	O
falling	O
into	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
thieves	O
and	O
murderers	O
in	O
the	O
Red	O
Sea	O
,	O
who	O
would	O
never	O
let	O
such	O
a	O
treasure	O
as	O
his	O
pass	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
or	O
of	O
his	O
falling	O
into	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
the	O
English	O
,	O
Dutch	O
,	O
or	O
French	O
,	O
who	O
would	O
certainly	O
hang	O
him	O
for	O
a	O
pirate	O
.	O

I	O
gave	O
him	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
voyage	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
from	O
this	O
very	O
place	O
to	O
the	O
continent	O
of	O
Africa	PNM
,	O
and	O
what	O
a	O
journey	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
travel	O
on	O
foot	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
nothing	O
could	O
persuade	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
would	O
go	O
into	O
the	O
Red	O
Sea	O
with	O
the	O
sloop	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
the	O
children	O
of	O
Israel	O
passed	O
through	O
the	O
sea	O
dry-shod	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
landing	O
there	O
,	O
would	O
travel	O
to	O
Grand	PNM
Cairo	PNM
by	O
land	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
not	O
above	O
eighty	O
miles	O
,	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
he	O
said	O
he	O
could	O
ship	O
himself	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
Alexandria	PNM
,	O
to	O
any	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

I	O
represented	O
the	O
hazard	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
the	O
impossibility	O
,	O
of	O
his	O
passing	O
by	O
Mocha	O
and	O
Jiddah	O
without	O
being	O
attacked	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
offered	O
it	O
by	O
force	O
,	O
or	O
plundered	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
went	O
to	O
get	O
leave	O
;	O
and	O
explained	O
the	O
reasons	O
of	O
it	O
so	O
much	O
and	O
so	O
effectually	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
though	O
at	O
last	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
hearken	O
to	O
it	O
himself	O
,	O
none	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
would	O
go	O
with	O
him	O
.	O

They	O
told	O
him	O
they	O
would	O
go	O
anywhere	O
with	O
him	O
to	O
serve	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
running	O
himself	O
and	O
them	O
into	O
certain	O
destruction	O
,	O
without	O
any	O
possibility	O
of	O
avoiding	O
it	O
,	O
or	O
probability	O
of	O
answering	O
his	O
end	O
.	O

The	O
captain	O
took	O
what	O
I	O
said	O
to	O
him	O
quite	O
wrong	O
,	O
and	O
pretended	O
to	O
resent	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
me	O
some	O
buccaneer	O
words	O
upon	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
gave	O
him	O
no	O
return	O
to	O
it	O
but	O
this	O
:	O
that	O
I	O
advised	O
him	O
for	O
his	O
advantage	O
;	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
it	O
so	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
his	O
fault	O
,	O
not	O
mine	O
;	O
that	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
forbid	O
him	O
to	O
go	O
,	O
nor	O
had	O
I	O
offered	O
to	O
persuade	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
not	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
their	O
apparent	O
destruction	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
warm	O
heads	O
are	O
not	O
easily	O
cooled	O
.	O

The	O
captain	O
was	O
so	O
eager	O
that	O
he	O
quitted	O
our	O
company	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
with	O
most	O
part	O
of	O
his	O
crew	O
,	O
went	O
over	O
to	O
Captain	O
Avery	O
,	O
and	O
sorted	O
with	O
his	O
people	O
,	O
taking	O
all	O
the	O
treasure	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
was	O
not	O
very	O
fair	O
in	O
him	O
,	O
we	O
having	O
agreed	O
to	O
share	O
all	O
our	O
gains	O
,	O
whether	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
,	O
whether	O
absent	O
or	O
present	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
muttered	O
a	O
little	O
at	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
pacified	O
them	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
them	O
it	O
was	O
easy	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
get	O
as	O
much	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
minded	O
our	O
hits	O
;	O
and	O
Captain	O
Wilmot	O
had	O
set	O
us	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
example	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
by	O
the	O

rule	O
,	O
the	O
agreement	O
of	O
any	O
further	O
sharing	O
of	O
profits	O
with	O
them	O
was	O
at	O
an	O
end	O

I	O
took	O
this	O
occasion	O
to	O
put	O
into	O
their	O
heads	O
some	O
part	O
of	O
my	O
further	O
designs	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
,	O
to	O
range	O
over	O
the	O
eastern	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
make	O
ourselves	O
as	O
rich	O
as	O
Mr	O
Avery	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
true	O
,	O
had	O
gotten	O
a	O
prodigious	O
deal	O
of	O
money	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
one-half	O
of	O
what	O
was	O
said	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
Europe	PNM
.	O

Our	O
men	O
were	O
so	O
pleased	O
with	O
my	O
forward	O
,	O
enterprising	O
temper	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
assured	O
me	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
go	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
one	O
and	O
all	O
,	O
over	O
the	O
whole	O

wherever	O
I	O
would	O
carry	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
for	O
Captain	O
Wilmot	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
nothing	O
more	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
him	O
.	O

This	O
came	O
to	O
his	O
ears	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
him	O
into	O
a	O
great	O
rage	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
he	O
threatened	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
came	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
cut	O
my	O
throat	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
information	O
of	O
it	O
privately	O
,	O
but	O
took	O
no	O
notice	O
of	O
it	O
at	O
all	O
;	O
only	O
I	O
took	O
care	O
not	O
to	O
go	O
unprovided	O
for	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
seldom	O
walked	O
about	O
but	O
in	O
very	O
good	O
company	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
at	O
last	O
Captain	O
Wilmot	O
and	O
I	O
met	O
,	O
and	O
talked	O
over	O
the	O
matter	O
very	O
seriously	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
offered	O
him	O
the	O
sloop	O
to	O
go	O
where	O
he	O
pleased	O
,	O
or	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
satisfied	O
with	O
that	O
,	O
I	O
offered	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
sloop	O
and	O
leave	O
him	O
the	O
great	O
ship	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
declined	O
both	O
,	O
and	O
only	O
desired	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
leave	O
him	O
six	O
carpenters	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
in	O
our	O
ship	O
more	O
than	O
I	O
had	O
need	O
of	O
,	O
to	O
help	O
his	O
men	O
to	O
finish	O
the	O
sloop	O
that	O
was	O
begun	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
thither	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
men	O
that	O
lost	O
their	O
ship	O
.	O

This	O
I	O
consented	O
readily	O
to	O
,	O
and	O
lent	O
him	O
several	O
other	O
hands	O
that	O
were	O
useful	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
time	O
they	O
built	O
a	O
stout	O
brigantine	O
,	O
able	O
to	O
carry	O
fourteen	O
guns	O
and	O
200	O
men	O

What	O
measures	O
they	O
took	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
Captain	O

managed	O

five	O
months	O

and	O
pendant	O
,	O
lay	O
by	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
we	O
intended	O
to	O
attack	O
them	O
.	O

They	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
what	O
to	O
make	O
of	O
us	O
a	O
good	O
while	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
saw	O
our	O
colours	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
believe	O
at	O
first	O
they	O
thought	O
us	O
to	O
be	O
French	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
they	O
came	O
nearer	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
let	O
them	O
soon	O
see	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
hoisted	O
a	O
black	O
flag	O
,	O
with	O
two	O
cross	O
daggers	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
on	O
our	O
main-top-mast	O
head	O
,	O
which	O
let	O
them	O
see	O
what	O
they	O
were	O
to	O
expect	O
.	O

We	O
soon	O
found	O
the	O
effects	O
of	O
this	O
;	O
for	O
at	O
first	O
they	O
spread	O
their	O
ancients	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
up	O
to	O
us	O
in	O
a	O
line	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
fight	O
us	O
,	O
having	O
the	O
wind	O
off	O
shore	O
,	O
fair	O
enough	O
to	O
have	O
brought	O
them	O
on	O
board	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
they	O
saw	O
what	O
force	O
we	O
were	O
of	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
we	O
were	O
cruisers	O
of	O
another	O
kind	O
,	O
they	O
stood	O
away	O
from	O
us	O
again	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
sail	O
they	O
could	O
make	O
.	O

If	O
they	O
had	O
come	O
up	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
given	O
them	O
an	O
unexpected	O
welcome	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
mind	O
to	O
follow	O
them	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
let	O
them	O
go	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
same	O
reasons	O
which	O
I	O
mentioned	O
before	O

But	O
though	O
we	O
let	O
them	O
pass	O
,	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
design	O
to	O
let	O
others	O
go	O
at	O
so	O
easy	O
a	O
price	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
but	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
that	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
sail	O
standing	O
round	O
Cape	PNM
Comorin	PNM
,	O
and	O
steering	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
thought	O
,	O
the	O
same	O
course	O
with	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
knew	O
not	O
at	O
first	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
her	O
,	O
because	O
she	O
had	O
the	O
shore	O
on	O
her	O
larboard	O
quarter	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
we	O
offered	O
to	O
chase	O
her	O
,	O
she	O
might	O
put	O
into	O
any	O
port	O
or	O
creek	O
,	O
and	O
escape	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
to	O
prevent	O
this	O
,	O
we	O
sent	O
the	O
sloop	O
to	O
get	O
in	O
between	O
her	O
and	O
the	O
land	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
she	O
saw	O
that	O
,	O
she	O
hauled	O
in	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
land	O
aboard	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
the	O
sloop	O
stood	O
towards	O
her	O
she	O
made	O
right	O
ashore	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
canvas	O
she	O
could	O
spread	O
.	O

The	O
sloop	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
came	O
up	O
with	O
her	O
and	O
engaged	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
she	O
was	O
a	O
vessel	O
of	O
ten	O
guns	O
,	O
Portuguese	O
built	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
Dutch	O
traders	O

hands	O

and	O
manned	O

who	O
were	O
bound	O
from	O
the	O

to	O
Batavia	PNM
,	O
to	O
fetch	O
spices	O

other	O
goods	O
from	O
thence	O

The	O
sloop	O
's	O
men	O
took	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
the	O
rummaging	O
of	O
her	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
up	O
.	O

She	O
had	O
in	O
her	O
some	O
European	O
goods	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
good	O
round	O
sum	O
of	O
money	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
pearl	O
;	O
so	O
that	O

though	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
gulf	O
for	O
the	O
pearl	O
,	O
the	O
pearl	O
came	O
to	O
us	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
gulf	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
our	O
share	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
rich	O
ship	O

and	O
the	O

were	O
of	O
very	O
considerable	O
value	O
,	O
besides	O
the	O
money	O
and	O
the	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
long	O
consultation	O
here	O
what	O
we	O
should	O
do	O
with	O
the	O
men	O

for	O
to	O

them	O
pursue	O
their	O

would	O
be	O
to	O

who	O

by	O

the	O
strongest	O
in	O

and	O
to	O
make	O
our	O
passage	O
that	O
way	O
impracticable	O

we	O
resolved	O
to	O
visit	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
in	O
our	O
way	O

but	O
were	O
not	O
willing	O
to	O
pass	O
the	O
great	O
Bay	PNM

Bengal	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
hoped	O
for	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
purchase	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
it	O
behoved	O
us	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
waylaid	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
there	O

because	O

those	O
of	O

and	O
either	O

it	O
was	O
very	O
easy	O
to	O

While	O
we	O
were	O
consulting	O
this	O
in	O
the	O
great	O
cabin	O

the	O

had	O

her	O
on	O

and	O
we	O
chose	O
the	O

So	O
we	O
set	O
her	O
foresail	O
with	O
the	O

at	O
the	O
cat-head	O

and	O
lashed	O

and	O
so	O
set	O
her	O
agoing	O
,	O
with	O
neither	O

in	O
her	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
above	O
two	O
hours	O
before	O
we	O
saw	O
her	O
run	O
right	O
ashore	O
upon	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
a	O
little	O
beyond	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
Comorin	PNM
;	O
and	O
away	O
we	O
went	O
round	O
about	O
Ceylon	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Coromandel	PNM

We	O
sailed	O
along	O
there	O
,	O
not	O
in	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
shore	O
only	O
,	O
but	O
so	O

at	O

at	O

that	O
shore	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
along	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Golconda	PNM

carrying	O
our	O
English	O
ancient	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
near	O
the	O

and	O
Dutch	O
colours	O
when	O
we	O
passed	O
by	O
the	O
English	O

We	O
met	O
with	O
little	O
purchase	O
upon	O
this	O
coast	O
,	O
except	O
two	O
small	O
vessels	O
of	O
Golconda	PNM
,	O
bound	O
across	O
the	O
bay	O
with	O
bales	O
of	O
calicoes	O
and	O
muslins	O
and	O
wrought	O
silks	O
,	O
and	O
fifteen	O
bales	O
of	O

,	O
from	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
the	O

,	O
which	O
were	O
going	O
,	O
on	O
whose	O
account	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
,	O
to	O
Acheen	PNM
,	O
and	O
to	O
other	O
ports	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Malacca	PNM

We	O
did	O
not	O
inquire	O
to	O
what	O
place	O
in	O
particular	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
let	O
the	O
vessels	O
go	O
,	O
having	O
none	O
but	O
Indians	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
junk	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
Mogul	O
's	O
court	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
people	O
,	O
passengers	O
as	O
we	O
supposed	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
:	O
it	O
seems	O
they	O
were	O
bound	O
for	O
the	O
river	O
Hooghly	PNM
or	O
Ganges	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
from	O
Sumatra	PNM
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
prize	O
worth	O
taking	O
indeed	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
got	O
so	O
much	O
gold	O
in	O
her	O
,	O
besides	O
other	O
goods	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
meddle	O
with	O
--	O
pepper	O
in	O
particular	O
--	O
that	O
it	O
had	O
like	O
to	O
have	O
put	O
an	O
end	O
to	O
our	O
cruise	O
;	O
for	O
almost	O
all	O
my	O
men	O
said	O
we	O
were	O
rich	O
enough	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
again	O
to	O
Madagascar	PNM
.	O

But	O
I	O
had	O
other	O
things	O
in	O
my	O
head	O
still	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
talk	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
friend	O
William	O
to	O
talk	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
we	O
put	O
such	O
further	O
golden	O
hopes	O
into	O
their	O
heads	O
that	O
we	O
soon	O
prevailed	O
with	O
them	O
to	O
let	O
us	O
go	O
on	O
.	O

My	O
next	O
design	O
was	O
to	O
leave	O
all	O
the	O
dangerous	O
straits	O
of	O
Malacca	PNM
,	O
Singapore	O
,	O
and	O
Sunda	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
could	O
expect	O
no	O
great	O
booty	O
,	O
but	O
what	O
we	O
might	O
light	O
on	O
in	O
European	O
ships	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
must	O
fight	O
for	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
we	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
fight	O
,	O
and	O
wanted	O
no	O
courage	O
,	O
even	O
to	O
desperation	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
were	O
rich	O
too	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
to	O
be	O
richer	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
this	O
for	O
our	O
maxim	O
,	O
that	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
sure	O
the	O
wealth	O
we	O
sought	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
had	O
without	O
fighting	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
occasion	O
to	O
put	O
ourselves	O
to	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
fighting	O
for	O
that	O
which	O
would	O
come	O
upon	O
easy	O
terms	O
.	O

We	O
left	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
the	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM
Bengal	PNM
,	O
and	O
coming	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Sumatra	PNM
,	O
we	O
put	O
in	O
at	O
a	O
small	O
port	O
,	O
where	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
town	O
,	O
inhabited	O
only	O
by	O
Malays	O
;	O
and	O
here	O
we	O
took	O
in	O
fresh	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
large	O
quantity	O
of	O
good	O
pork	O
,	O
pickled	O
up	O
and	O
well	O
salted	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
the	O
heat	O
of	O
the	O
climate	O
,	O
being	O
in	O
the	O
very	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
torrid	O
zone	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
in	O
three	O
degrees	O
fifteen	O
minutes	O
north	O
latitude	O
.	O

We	O
also	O
took	O
on	O
board	O
both	O
our	O
vessels	O
forty	O
hogs	O
alive	O
,	O
which	O
served	O
us	O
for	O
fresh	O
provisions	O
,	O
having	O
abundance	O
of	O
food	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
country	O
produced	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
guams	O
,	O
potatoes	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
coarse	O
rice	O
,	O
good	O
for	O
nothing	O
else	O
but	O
to	O
feed	O
the	O
swine	O
.	O

We	O
killed	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
hogs	O
every	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
excellent	O
meat	O
.	O

We	O
took	O
in	O
also	O
a	O
monstrous	O
quantity	O
of	O
ducks	O
,	O
and	O
cocks	O
and	O
hens	O
,	O
the	O
same	O
kind	O
as	O
we	O
have	O
in	O
England	PNM
,	O
which	O
we	O
kept	O
for	O
change	O
of	O
provisions	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
I	O
remember	O
right	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
two	O
thousand	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
at	O
first	O
we	O
were	O
pestered	O
with	O
them	O
very	O
much	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
soon	O
lessened	O
them	O
by	O
boiling	O
,	O
roasting	O
,	O
stewing	O
,	O
&	O
c.	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
never	O
wanted	O
while	O
we	O
had	O
them	O
.	O

My	O
long-projected	O
design	O
now	O
lay	O
open	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
to	O
fall	O
in	O
amongst	O
the	O
Dutch	O
Spice	O
Islands	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
what	O
mischief	O
I	O
could	O
do	O
there	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
we	O
put	O
out	O
to	O
sea	O
the	O
12th	O
of	O
August	O
,	O
and	O
passing	O
the	O
line	O
on	O
the	O
17th	O
,	O
we	O
stood	O
away	O
due	O
south	O
,	O
leaving	O
the	O
Straits	PNM
of	PNM
Sunda	PNM
and	O
the	O
isle	O
of	O
Java	PNM
on	O
the	O
east	O
,	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
eleven	O
degrees	O
twenty	O
minutes	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
steered	O
east	O
and	O
E.N.E.	O
,	O
having	O
easy	O
gales	O
from	O
the	O
W.S.W.	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
among	O
the	O
Moluccas	O
,	O
or	O
Spice	PNM
Islands	PNM
.	O

We	O
passed	O
those	O
seas	O
with	O
less	O
difficulty	O
than	O
in	O
other	O
places	O
,	O
the	O
winds	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
of	O
Java	PNM
being	O
more	O
variable	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
weather	O
good	O
,	O
though	O
sometimes	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
squally	O
weather	O
and	O
short	O
storms	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
in	O
among	O
the	O
Spice	O
Islands	O
themselves	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
share	O
of	O
the	O
monsoons	O
,	O
or	O
trade-winds	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
use	O
of	O
them	O
accordingly	O
.	O

The	O
infinite	O
number	O
of	O
islands	O
which	O
lie	O
in	O
these	O
seas	O
embarrassed	O
us	O
strangely	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
with	O
great	O
difficulty	O
that	O
we	O
worked	O
our	O
way	O
through	O
them	O
;	O
then	O
we	O
steered	O
for	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
Philippines	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
double	O
chance	O
for	O
purchase	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
either	O
to	O
meet	O
with	O
the	O
Spanish	O
ships	O
from	O
Acapulco	PNM
,	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
New	PNM
Spain	PNM
,	O
or	O
we	O
were	O
certain	O
not	O
to	O
fail	O
of	O
finding	O
some	O
ships	O
or	O
junks	O
of	O
China	PNM
,	O
who	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
came	O
from	O
China	PNM
,	O
would	O
have	O
a	O
great	O
quantity	O
of	O
goods	O
of	O
value	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
money	O
;	O
or	O
if	O
we	O
took	O
them	O
going	O
back	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
find	O
them	O
laden	O
with	O
nutmegs	O
and	O
cloves	O
from	O
Banda	PNM
and	O
Ternate	PNM
,	O
or	O
from	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
islands	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
right	O
in	O
our	O
guesses	O
here	O
to	O
a	O
tittle	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
steered	O
directly	O
through	O
a	O
large	O
outlet	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
call	O
a	O
strait	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
be	O
fifteen	O
miles	O
broad	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
an	O
island	O
they	O
call	O
Dammer	O
,	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
N.N.E.	O
to	O
Banda	PNM
.	O

Between	O
these	O
islands	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
a	O
Dutch	O
junk	O
,	O
or	O
vessel	O
,	O
going	O
to	O
Amboyna	PNM
:	O
we	O
took	O
her	O
without	O
much	O
trouble	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
much	O
ado	O
to	O
prevent	O
our	O
men	O
murdering	O
all	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
heard	O
them	O
say	O
they	O
belonged	O
to	O
Amboyna	PNM
:	O
the	O
reasons	O
I	O
suppose	O
any	O
one	O
will	O
guess	O
.	O

We	O
took	O
out	O
of	O
her	O
about	O
sixteen	O
ton	O
of	O
nutmegs	O
,	O
some	O
provisions	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
small-arms	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
great	O
guns	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
the	O
ship	O
go	O
:	O
from	O
thence	O
we	O
sailed	O
directly	O
to	O
the	O
Banda	PNM
Island	PNM
,	PNM
or	O
Islands	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
sure	O
to	O
get	O
more	O
nutmegs	O
if	O
we	O
thought	O
fit	O
.	O

For	O
my	O
part	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
willingly	O
have	O
got	O
more	O
nutmegs	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
had	O
paid	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
our	O
people	O
abhorred	O
paying	O
for	O
anything	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
got	O
about	O
twelve	O
ton	O
more	O
at	O
several	O
times	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
from	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
only	O
a	O
few	O
in	O
a	O
small	O
boat	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
Gilolo	PNM
.	O

We	O
would	O
have	O
traded	O
openly	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
Dutch	O
,	O
who	O
have	O
made	O
themselves	O
masters	O
of	O
all	O
those	O
islands	O
,	O
forbade	O
the	O
people	O
dealing	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
or	O
any	O
strangers	O
whatever	O
,	O
and	O
kept	O
them	O
so	O
in	O
awe	O
that	O
they	O
durst	O
not	O
do	O
it	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
could	O
indeed	O
have	O
made	O
nothing	O
of	O
it	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
stayed	O
longer	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
resolved	O
to	O
be	O
gone	O
for	O
Ternate	PNM
,	O
and	O
see	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
make	O
up	O
our	O
loading	O
with	O
cloves	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
we	O
stood	O
away	O
north	O
,	O
but	O
found	O
ourselves	O
so	O
entangled	O
among	O
innumerable	O
islands	O
,	O
and	O
without	O
any	O
pilot	O
that	O
understood	O
the	O
channel	O
and	O
races	O
between	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
give	O
it	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
again	O
to	O
Banda	PNM
,	O
and	O
see	O
what	O
we	O
could	O
get	O
among	O
the	O
other	O
islands	O
thereabouts	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
adventure	O
we	O
made	O
here	O
had	O
like	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
fatal	O
to	O
us	O
all	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
sloop	O
,	O
being	O
ahead	O
,	O
made	O
the	O
signal	O
to	O
us	O
for	O
seeing	O
a	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
afterwards	O
another	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
third	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
we	O
understood	O
she	O
saw	O
three	O
sail	O
;	O
whereupon	O
we	O
made	O
more	O
sail	O
to	O
come	O
up	O
with	O
her	O
,	O
but	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
were	O
gotten	O
among	O
some	O
rocks	O
,	O
falling	O
foul	O
upon	O
them	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
manner	O
as	O
frighted	O
us	O
all	O
very	O
heartily	O
;	O
for	O
having	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
but	O
just	O
water	O
enough	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
to	O
an	O
inch	O
,	O
our	O
rudder	O
struck	O
upon	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
a	O
rock	O

which	O
gave	O
us	O
a	O
terrible	O
shock	O
,	O
and	O
split	O
a	O
great	O
piece	O
off	O
the	O
rudder	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
disabled	O
it	O
so	O
that	O
our	O
ship	O
would	O
not	O
steer	O
at	O
all	O

at	O

not	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
be	O
depended	O
upon	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
glad	O
to	O
hand	O
all	O
our	O
sails	O
,	O
except	O
our	O
fore-sail	O
and	O
main-topsail	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
them	O
we	O
stood	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
east	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
find	O
any	O
creek	O
or	O
harbour	O
where	O
we	O
might	O
lay	O
the	O
ship	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
repair	O
our	O
rudder	O
;	O
besides	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
ship	O
herself	O
had	O
received	O
some	O
damage	O
,	O
for	O
she	O
had	O
some	O
little	O
leak	O
near	O
her	O
stern-post	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
under	O
water	O
.	O

By	O
this	O
mischance	O
we	O
lost	O
the	O
advantages	O
,	O
whatever	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
sail	O
of	O
ships	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
afterwards	O
came	O
to	O
hear	O
were	O
small	O
Dutch	O
ships	O
from	O
Batavia	PNM
,	O
going	O
to	O
Banda	PNM
and	O
Amboyna	PNM
,	O
to	O
load	O
spice	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
no	O

had	O
a	O
good	O
quantity	O
of	O

Upon	O
the	O
disaster	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
speaking	O
of	O
you	O
may	O
very	O
well	O
suppose	O
that	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
upon	O
a	O
small	O
island	O
not	O
far	O
from	O
Banda	PNM
,	O
where	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
Dutch	O
keep	O
no	O
factory	O
,	O
yet	O
they	O
come	O
at	O
the	O
season	O
to	O
buy	O
nutmegs	O
and	O
mace	O
.	O

We	O
stayed	O
there	O
thirteen	O
days	O
;	O
but	O
there	O
being	O
no	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
could	O
lay	O
the	O
ship	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
we	O
sent	O
the	O
sloop	O
to	O
cruise	O
among	O
the	O
islands	O
,	O
to	O
look	O
out	O
for	O
a	O
place	O
fit	O
for	O
us	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
meantime	O
we	O
got	O
very	O
good	O
water	O
here	O
,	O
some	O
provisions	O
,	O
roots	O
,	O
and	O
fruits	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
good	O
quantity	O
of	O
nutmegs	O
and	O
mace	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
ways	O
to	O
trade	O
with	O
the	O
natives	O
for	O
,	O
without	O
the	O
knowledge	O
of	O
their	O
masters	O
,	O
the	O
Dutch	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
our	O
sloop	O
returned	O
;	O
having	O
found	O
another	O
island	O
where	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
harbour	O
,	O
we	O
ran	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
.	O

We	O
immediately	O
unbent	O
all	O
our	O
sails	O
,	O
sent	O
them	O
ashore	O
upon	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
up	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
tents	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
then	O
we	O
unrigged	O
our	O
top-masts	O
,	O
and	O
cut	O
them	O
down	O
,	O
hoisted	O
all	O
our	O
guns	O
out	O
,	O
our	O
provisions	O
and	O
loading	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
them	O
ashore	O
in	O
the	O
tents	O
.	O

With	O
the	O
guns	O
we	O
made	O
two	O
small	O
batteries	O
,	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
a	O
surprise	O
,	O
and	O
kept	O
a	O
look-out	O
upon	O
the	O
hill	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
ready	O
,	O
we	O
laid	O
the	O
ship	O
aground	O
upon	O
a	O
hard	O
sand	O
,	O
the	O
upper	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
harbour	O
,	O
and	O
shored	O
her	O
up	O
on	O
each	O
side	O
.	O

At	O
low	O
water	O
she	O
lay	O
almost	O
dry	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
mended	O
her	O
bottom	O
,	O
and	O
stopped	O
the	O
leak	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
occasioned	O
by	O
straining	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
rudder	O
irons	O
with	O
the	O
shock	O
which	O
the	O
ship	O
had	O
against	O
the	O
rock	O
.	O

Having	O
done	O
this	O
,	O
we	O
also	O
took	O
occasion	O
to	O
clean	O
her	O
bottom	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
at	O
sea	O
so	O
long	O
,	O
was	O
very	O
foul	O
.	O

The	O
sloop	O
washed	O
and	O
tallowed	O
also	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
ready	O
before	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
cruised	O
eight	O
or	O
ten	O
days	O
among	O
the	O
islands	O
,	O
but	O
met	O
with	O
no	O
purchase	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
tired	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
having	O
little	O
to	O
divert	O
us	O
but	O
the	O
most	O
furious	O
claps	O
of	O
thunder	O
that	O
ever	O
were	O
heard	O
or	O
read	O
of	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
in	O
hopes	O
to	O
have	O
met	O
with	O
some	O
purchase	O
here	O
among	O
the	O
Chinese	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
told	O
,	O
came	O
to	O
Ternate	PNM
to	O
trade	O
for	O
cloves	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
Banda	PNM
Isles	PNM
for	O
nutmegs	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
glad	O
to	O
have	O
loaded	O
our	O
galleon	O
,	O
or	O
great	O
ship	O
,	O
with	O
these	O
two	O
sorts	O
of	O
spice	O
,	O
and	O
have	O
thought	O
it	O
a	O
glorious	O
voyage	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
found	O
nothing	O
stirring	O
more	O
than	O
what	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
except	O
Dutchmen	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
by	O
what	O
means	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
imagine	O
,	O
had	O
either	O
a	O
jealousy	O
of	O
us	O
or	O
intelligence	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
kept	O
themselves	O
close	O
in	O
their	O
ports	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
once	O
resolved	O
to	O
have	O
made	O
a	O
descent	O
at	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Dumas	PNM
,	O
the	O
place	O
most	O
famous	O
for	O
the	O
best	O
nutmegs	O
;	O
but	O
friend	O
William	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
always	O
for	O
doing	O
our	O
business	O
without	O
fighting	O
,	O
dissuaded	O
me	O
from	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
such	O
reasons	O
for	O
it	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
resist	O
;	O
particularly	O
the	O
great	O
heats	O
of	O
the	O
season	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
just	O
half	O
a	O
degree	O
south	O
.	O

But	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
disputing	O
this	O
point	O
we	O
were	O
soon	O
determined	O
by	O
the	O
following	O
accident	O
:	O
--	O
We	O
had	O
a	O
strong	O
gale	O
of	O
wind	O
at	O
S.W.	O
by	O
W.	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
ship	O
had	O
fresh	O
way	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
great	O
sea	O
rolling	O
in	O
upon	O
us	O
from	O
the	O
N.E.	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
afterwards	O
found	O
was	O
the	O
pouring	O
in	O
of	O
the	O
great	O
ocean	O
east	O
of	O
New	PNM
Guinea	PNM
.	O

However	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
we	O
stood	O
away	O
large	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
fresh	O
way	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
sudden	O
,	O
from	O
a	O
dark	O
cloud	O
which	O
hovered	O
over	O
our	O
heads	O
,	O
came	O
a	O
flash	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
blast	O
,	O
of	O
lightning	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
so	O
terrible	O
,	O
and	O
quivered	O
so	O
long	O
among	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
not	O
I	O
only	O
,	O
but	O
all	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
thought	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
on	O
fire	O
.	O

The	O
heat	O
of	O
the	O
flash	O
,	O
or	O
fire	O
,	O
was	O
so	O
sensibly	O
felt	O
in	O
our	O
faces	O
,	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
had	O
blisters	O
raised	O
by	O
it	O
on	O
their	O
skins	O
,	O
not	O
immediately	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
heat	O
,	O
but	O
by	O
the	O
poisonous	O
or	O
noxious	O
particles	O
which	O
mixed	O
themselves	O
with	O
the	O
matter	O
inflamed	O
.	O

But	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
all	O
;	O
the	O
shock	O
of	O
the	O
air	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
fracture	O
in	O
the	O
clouds	O
made	O
,	O
was	O
such	O
that	O
our	O
ship	O
shook	O
as	O
when	O
a	O
broadside	O
is	O
fired	O
;	O
and	O
her	O
motion	O
being	O
checked	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
at	O
once	O
,	O
by	O
a	O
repulse	O
superior	O
to	O
the	O
force	O
that	O
gave	O
her	O
way	O
before	O
,	O
the	O
sails	O
all	O
flew	O
back	O
in	O
a	O
moment	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
ship	O
lay	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
might	O
truly	O
say	O
,	O
thunder-struck	O
.	O

As	O
the	O
blast	O
from	O
the	O
cloud	O
was	O
so	O
very	O
near	O
us	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
but	O
a	O
few	O
moments	O
after	O
the	O
flash	O
that	O
the	O
terriblest	O
clap	O
of	O
thunder	O
followed	O
that	O
was	O
ever	O
heard	O
by	O
mortals	O

I	O
firmly	O
believe	O
a	O
blast	O
of	O
a	O
hundred	O
thousand	O
barrels	O
of	O
gunpowder	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
greater	O
to	O
our	O
hearing	O
;	O
nay	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
to	O
some	O
of	O
our	O

it	O
took	O
away	O

It	O
is	O
not	O
possible	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
describe	O

or	O
any	O
one	O
to	O
conceive	O

the	O
terror	O
of	O
that	O
minute	O

Our	O

were	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
consternation	O
,	O
that	O
not	O
a	O
man	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
had	O
presence	O
of	O

to	O
apply	O
to	O
the	O
proper	O
duty	O
of	O
a	O
sailor	O

except	O

and	O
had	O
he	O
not	O
run	O
very	O
nimbly	O

with	O
a	O
composure	O
that	O
I	O

I	O
was	O

by	O
the	O

perhaps	O
have	O
been	O
overwhelmed	O
in	O

As	O
for	O

I	O
must	O
confess	O
my	O
eyes	O
were	O
open	O
to	O
my	O

though	O
not	O
the	O

to	O

I	O
was	O
all	O
amazement	O

and	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
feel	O
the	O
effects	O
of	O
that	O

which	O
I	O
know	O

of	O

upon	O
the	O

I	O
thought	O
myself	O

with	O
this	O
peculiar	O
mark	O
of	O
terror	O

viz.	O

that	O
the	O
vengeance	O
was	O
not	O
executed	O
in	O
the	O

that	O
God	O

had	O

Let	O
them	O
alone	O

My	O
soul	O
was	O
all	O
amazement	O
and	O
surprise	O

I	O
thought	O
myself	O
just	O
sinking	O
into	O
eternity	O

owning	O
the	O
divine	O
justice	O
of	O

not	O
at	O

perhaps	O
many	O
that	O

this	O
will	O
be	O
sensible	O
of	O
the	O
thunder	O

that	O
may	O
think	O
nothing	O
of	O
the	O
rest	O

or	O
rather	O
may	O
make	O
a	O
jest	O
of	O
it	O

;	O
so	O
I	O
say	O
no	O
more	O
of	O
it	O
at	O
this	O
time	O

but	O
proceed	O
to	O
the	O
story	O
of	O
the	O
voyage	O

When	O
the	O
amazement	O
was	O
over	O

and	O
the	O
men	O
began	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
themselves	O

they	O
fell	O
a-calling	O
for	O
one	O
another	O

every	O
one	O
for	O
his	O

or	O
for	O
those	O
he	O
had	O
most	O
respect	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
singular	O
satisfaction	O
to	O
find	O
that	O
nobody	O
was	O
hurt	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
thing	O
was	O
to	O
inquire	O
if	O
the	O
ship	O
had	O
received	O
no	O
damage	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
boatswain	O

stepping	O
forward	O

found	O
that	O
part	O

the	O

gone	O

but	O
not	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
endanger	O
the	O
bowsprit	O

so	O
we	O
hoisted	O
our	O
top-sails	O
again	O

hauled	O
aft	O
the	O
fore-sheet	O
,	O
braced	O
the	O
yards	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
our	O
course	O
as	O
before	O
.	O

Nor	O
can	O
I	O
deny	O
but	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
somewhat	O
like	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
our	O
first	O
astonishment	O
being	O
a	O
little	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
ship	O
swim	O
again	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
soon	O
the	O
same	O
irreligious	O
,	O
hardened	O
crew	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
among	O
the	O
rest	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
now	O
steered	O
,	O
our	O
course	O
lay	O
N.N.E.	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
passed	O
thus	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
fair	O
wind	O
,	O
through	O
the	O
strait	O
or	O
channel	O
between	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Gilolo	PNM
and	O
the	O
land	O
of	O
Nova	PNM
Guinea	PNM
,	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
soon	O
in	O
the	O
open	O
sea	O
or	O
ocean	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
south-east	O
of	O
the	O
Philippines	O
,	O
being	O
the	O
great	O
Pacific	O
,	O
or	O
South	PNM
Sea	PNM
,	O
where	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
join	O
itself	O
with	O
the	O
vast	O
Indian	PNM
Ocean	PNM
.	O

As	O
we	O
passed	O
into	O
these	O
seas	O
,	O
steering	O
due	O
north	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
soon	O
crossed	O
the	O
line	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
sailed	O
on	O
towards	O
Mindanao	O
and	O
Manilla	PNM
,	O
the	O
chief	O
of	O
the	O
Philippine	PNM
Islands	PNM
,	O
without	O
meeting	O
with	O
any	O
purchase	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
of	O
Manilla	PNM
,	O
and	O
then	O
our	O
trade	O
began	O
;	O
for	O
here	O
we	O
took	O
three	O
Japanese	O
vessels	O
,	O
though	O
at	O
some	O
distance	O
from	O
Manilla	PNM
.	O

Two	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
made	O
their	O
market	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
going	O
home	O
with	O
nutmegs	O
,	O
cinnamon	O
,	O
cloves	O
,	O
&	O
c.	O
,	O
besides	O
all	O
sorts	O
of	O
European	O
goods	O
,	O
brought	O
with	O
the	O
Spanish	O
ships	O
from	O
Acapulco	PNM
.	O

They	O
had	O
together	O
eight-and-thirty	O
ton	O
of	O
cloves	O
,	O
and	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
ton	O
of	O
nutmegs	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
much	O
cinnamon	O
.	O

We	O
took	O
the	O
spice	O
,	O
but	O
meddled	O
with	O
very	O
little	O
of	O
the	O
European	O
goods	O
,	O
they	O
being	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
thought	O
,	O
not	O
worth	O
our	O
while	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
sorry	O
for	O
it	O
soon	O
after	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
grew	O
wiser	O
upon	O
the	O
next	O
occasion	O
.	O

The	O
third	O
Japanese	O
was	O
the	O
best	O
prize	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
for	O
he	O
came	O
with	O
money	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
gold	O
uncoined	O
,	O
to	O
buy	O
such	O
goods	O
as	O
we	O
mentioned	O
above	O
.	O

We	O
eased	O
him	O
of	O
his	O
gold	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
him	O
no	O
other	O
harm	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
no	O
intention	O
to	O
stay	O
long	O
here	O
,	O
we	O
stood	O
away	O
for	O
China	PNM
.	O

We	O
were	O
at	O
sea	O
above	O
two	O
months	O
upon	O
this	O
voyage	O
,	O
beating	O
it	O
up	O
against	O
the	O
wind	O
,	O
which	O
blew	O
steadily	O
from	O
the	O
N.E.	O
,	O
and	O
within	O
a	O
point	O
or	O
two	O
one	O
way	O
or	O
other	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
indeed	O
was	O
the	O
reason	O
why	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
the	O
more	O
prizes	O
in	O
our	O
voyage	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
just	O
gotten	O
clear	O
of	O
the	O
Philippines	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
purposed	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
isle	O
of	O
Formosa	PNM
,	O
but	O
the	O
wind	O
blew	O
so	O
fresh	O
at	O
N.N.E.	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
making	O
anything	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
put	O
back	O
to	O
Laconia	PNM
,	O
the	O
most	O
northerly	O
of	O
those	O
islands	O
.	O

We	O
rode	O
here	O
very	O
secure	O
,	O
and	O
shifted	O
our	O
situation	O
,	O
not	O
in	O
view	O
of	O
any	O
danger	O
,	O
for	O
there	O
was	O
none	O
,	O
but	O
for	O
a	O
better	O
supply	O
of	O
provisions	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
people	O
very	O
willing	O
to	O
supply	O
us	O
with	O
.	O

There	O
lay	O
,	O
while	O
we	O
remained	O
here	O
,	O
three	O
very	O
great	O
galleons	O
,	O
or	O
Spanish	O
ships	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
south	O
seas	O
;	O
whether	O
newly	O
come	O
in	O
or	O
ready	O
to	O
sail	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
understand	O
at	O
first	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
China	PNM
traders	O
began	O
to	O
load	O
and	O
set	O
forward	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
,	O
we	O
concluded	O
the	O
Spanish	O
ships	O
had	O
newly	O
unloaded	O
their	O
cargo	O
,	O
and	O
these	O
had	O
been	O
buying	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
doubted	O
not	O
but	O
we	O
should	O
meet	O
with	O
purchase	O
in	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
voyage	O
,	O
neither	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
could	O
we	O
well	O
miss	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

We	O
stayed	O
here	O
till	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
May	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
told	O
the	O
Chinese	O
traders	O
would	O
set	O
forward	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
northern	O
monsoons	O
end	O
about	O
the	O
latter	O
end	O
of	O
March	O
or	O
beginning	O
of	O
April	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
sure	O
of	O
fair	O
winds	O
home	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
we	O
hired	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
boats	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
very	O
swift	O
sailers	O
,	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
bring	O
us	O
word	O
how	O
affairs	O
stood	O
at	O
Manilla	PNM
,	O
and	O
when	O
the	O
China	PNM
junks	O
would	O
sail	O
;	O
and	O
by	O
this	O
intelligence	O
we	O
ordered	O
our	O
matters	O
so	O
well	O
,	O
that	O
three	O
days	O
after	O
we	O
set	O
sail	O
we	O
fell	O
in	O
with	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
eleven	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
out	O
of	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
having	O
by	O
misfortune	O
of	O
discovering	O
ourselves	O
,	O
taken	O
but	O
three	O
,	O
we	O
contented	O
ourselves	O
and	O
pursued	O
our	O
voyage	O
to	O
Formosa	PNM
.	O

In	O
these	O
three	O
vessels	O
we	O
took	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
such	O
a	O
quantity	O
of	O
cloves	O
,	O
nutmegs	O
,	O
cinnamon	O
,	O
and	O
mace	O
,	O
besides	O
silver	O
,	O
that	O
our	O
men	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
of	O
my	O
opinion	O
,	O
--	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
rich	O
enough	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
now	O
but	O
to	O
consider	O
by	O
what	O
methods	O
to	O
secure	O
the	O
immense	O
treasure	O
we	O
had	O
got	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
secretly	O
glad	O
to	O
hear	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
of	O
this	O
opinion	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
long	O
before	O
resolved	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
were	O
possible	O
,	O
to	O
persuade	O
them	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
returning	O
,	O
having	O
fully	O
perfected	O
my	O
first	O
projected	O
design	O
of	O
rummaging	O
among	O
the	O
Spice	PNM
Islands	PNM
;	O
and	O
all	O
those	O
prizes	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
exceeding	O
rich	O
at	O
Manilla	PNM
,	O
was	O
quite	O
beyond	O
my	O
design	O
.	O

But	O
now	O
I	O
had	O
heard	O
what	O
the	O
men	O
said	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
they	O
thought	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
I	O
let	O
them	O
know	O
by	O
friend	O
William	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
intended	O
only	O
to	O
sail	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Formosa	PNM
,	O
where	O
I	O
should	O
find	O
opportunity	O
to	O
turn	O
our	O
spices	O
and	O
Europe	PNM
goods	O
into	O
ready	O
money	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
then	O
I	O
would	O
tack	O
about	O
for	O
the	O
south	O
,	O
the	O
northern	O
monsoons	O
being	O
perhaps	O
by	O
that	O
time	O
also	O
ready	O
to	O
set	O
in	O
.	O

They	O
all	O
approved	O
of	O
my	O
design	O
,	O
and	O
willingly	O
went	O
forward	O
;	O
because	O
,	O
besides	O
the	O
winds	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
not	O
permit	O
until	O
October	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
,	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
besides	O
this	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
a	O
very	O
deep	O
ship	O
,	O
having	O
near	O
two	O
hundred	O
ton	O
of	O
goods	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
particularly	O
,	O
some	O
very	O
valuable	O
;	O
the	O
sloop	O
also	O
had	O
a	O
proportion	O
.	O

With	O
this	O
resolution	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
cheerfully	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
within	O
about	O
twelve	O
days	O
'	O
sail	O
more	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
the	O
island	O
Formosa	PNM
,	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
ourselves	O
shot	O
beyond	O
the	O
southernmost	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
being	O
to	O
leeward	O
,	O
and	O
almost	O
upon	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
China	PNM
.	O

Here	O
we	O
were	O
a	O
little	O
at	O
a	O
loss	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
English	O
factories	O
were	O
not	O
far	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
might	O
be	O
obliged	O
to	O
fight	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
ships	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
were	O
able	O
enough	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
desire	O
it	O
on	O
many	O
accounts	O
,	O
and	O
particularly	O
because	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
our	O
business	O
to	O
have	O
it	O
known	O
who	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
or	O
that	O
such	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
people	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
seen	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
keep	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
,	O
keeping	O
as	O
good	O
an	O
offing	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
with	O
respect	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
China	PNM
.	O

We	O
had	O
not	O
sailed	O
long	O
but	O
we	O
chased	O
a	O
small	O
Chinese	O
junk	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
taken	O
her	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
she	O
was	O
bound	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Formosa	PNM
,	O
having	O
no	O
goods	O
on	O
board	O
but	O
some	O
rice	O
and	O
a	O
small	O
quantity	O
of	O
tea	O
;	O
but	O
she	O
had	O
three	O
Chinese	O
merchants	O
in	O
her	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
meet	O
a	O
large	O
vessel	O
of	O
their	O
country	O
,	O
which	O
came	O
from	O
Tonquin	PNM
,	O
and	O
lay	O
in	O
a	O
river	O
in	O
Formosa	PNM
,	O
whose	O
name	O
I	O
forgot	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
Philippine	PNM
Islands	PNM
,	O
with	O
silks	O
,	O
muslins	O
,	O
calicoes	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
goods	O
as	O
are	O
the	O
product	O
of	O
China	PNM
,	O
and	O
some	O
gold	O
;	O
that	O
their	O
business	O
was	O
to	O
sell	O
their	O
cargo	O
,	O
and	O
buy	O
spices	O
and	O
European	O
goods	O
.	O

This	O
suited	O
very	O
well	O
with	O
our	O
purpose	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
resolved	O
now	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
leave	O
off	O
being	O
pirates	O
and	O
turn	O
merchants	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
told	O
them	O
what	O
goods	O
we	O
had	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
bring	O
their	O
supercargoes	O
or	O
merchants	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
trade	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
very	O
willing	O
to	O
trade	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
terribly	O
afraid	O
to	O
trust	O
us	O
;	O
nor	O
was	O
it	O
an	O
unjust	O
fear	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
plundered	O
them	O
already	O
of	O
what	O
they	O
had	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
as	O
diffident	O
as	O
they	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
uncertain	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
;	O
but	O
William	O
the	O
Quaker	O
put	O
this	O
matter	O
into	O
a	O
way	O
of	O
barter	O
.	O

He	O
came	O
to	O
me	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
really	O
thought	O
the	O
merchants	O
looked	O
like	O
fair	O
men	O
,	O
that	O
meant	O
honestly	O
.	O

``	O
And	O
besides	O

''	O
says	O
William	O
,	O
``	O
it	O
is	O
their	O

foundations	O
,	O
William	O
said	O
he	O
was	O
satisfied	O
we	O
might	O
trust	O
them	O
;	O
``	O
for	O

''	O
says	O
William	O
,	O
``	O
I	O
would	O
as	O

just	O
to	O
me	O

''	O

Upon	O
the	O
whole	O
,	O
William	O
proposed	O
that	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
merchants	O
should	O
be	O
left	O
on	O
board	O
our	O
ship	O
as	O
hostages	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
our	O
goods	O
should	O
be	O
loaded	O
in	O
their	O
vessel	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
the	O
third	O
go	O
with	O
it	O
into	O
the	O
port	O
where	O
their	O
ship	O
lay	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
he	O
had	O
delivered	O
the	O
spices	O
,	O
he	O
should	O
bring	O
back	O
such	O
things	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
agreed	O
should	O
be	O
exchanged	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
concluded	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
William	O
the	O
Quaker	O
ventured	O
to	O
go	O
along	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
upon	O
my	O
word	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
not	O
have	O
cared	O
to	O
have	O
done	O
,	O
nor	O
was	O
I	O
willing	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
went	O
still	O
upon	O
the	O
notion	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
their	O
interest	O
to	O
treat	O
him	O
friendly	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
meantime	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
under	O
a	O
little	O
island	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
23	O
degrees	O
28	O
minutes	O
,	O
being	O
just	O
under	O
the	O
northern	O
tropic	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
twenty	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
lay	O
thirteen	O
days	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
uneasy	O
for	O
my	O
friend	O
William	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
promised	O
to	O
be	O
back	O
again	O
in	O
four	O
days	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
might	O
very	O
easily	O
have	O
done	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
thirteen	O
days	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
three	O
sail	O
coming	O
directly	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
which	O
a	O
little	O
surprised	O
us	O
all	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
not	O
knowing	O
what	O
might	O
be	O
the	O
case	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
put	O
ourselves	O
in	O
a	O
posture	O
of	O
defence	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
they	O
came	O
nearer	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
soon	O
satisfied	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
vessel	O
was	O
that	O
which	O
William	O
went	O
in	O
,	O
who	O
carried	O
a	O
flag	O
of	O
truce	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
hours	O
they	O
all	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
,	O
and	O
William	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
us	O
with	O
a	O
little	O
boat	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
Chinese	O
merchant	O
in	O
his	O
company	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
other	O
merchants	O
,	O
who	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
brokers	O
for	O
the	O
rest	O
.	O

Here	O
he	O
gave	O
us	O
an	O
account	O
how	O
civilly	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
used	O
;	O
how	O
they	O
had	O
treated	O
him	O
with	O
all	O
imaginable	O
frankness	O
and	O
openness	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
not	O
only	O
given	O
him	O
the	O
full	O
value	O
of	O
his	O
spices	O
and	O
other	O
goods	O
which	O
he	O
carried	O
,	O
in	O
gold	O
,	O
by	O
good	O
weight	O
,	O
but	O
had	O
loaded	O
the	O
vessel	O
again	O
with	O
such	O
goods	O
as	O
he	O
knew	O
we	O
were	O
willing	O
to	O
trade	O
for	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
afterwards	O
they	O
had	O
resolved	O
to	O
bring	O
the	O
great	O
ship	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
harbour	O
,	O
to	O
lie	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
that	O
so	O
we	O
might	O
make	O
what	O
bargain	O
we	O
thought	O
fit	O
;	O
only	O
William	O
said	O
he	O
had	O
promised	O
,	O
in	O
our	O
name	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
use	O
no	O
violence	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
nor	O
detain	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
vessels	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
done	O
trading	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
we	O
would	O
strive	O
to	O
outdo	O
them	O
in	O
civility	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
make	O
good	O
every	O
part	O
of	O
his	O
agreement	O
;	O
in	O
token	O
whereof	O
,	O
I	O
caused	O
a	O
white	O
flag	O
likewise	O
to	O
be	O
spread	O
at	O
the	O
poop	O
of	O
our	O
great	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
signal	O
agreed	O
on	O
.	O

As	O
to	O
the	O
third	O
vessel	O
which	O
came	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
bark	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
having	O
intelligence	O
of	O
our	O
design	O
to	O
traffic	O
,	O
came	O
off	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
bringing	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
gold	O
and	O
some	O
provisions	O
,	O
which	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
glad	O
of	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
we	O
traded	O
upon	O
the	O
high	O
seas	O
with	O
these	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
we	O
made	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
market	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
sold	O
thieves	O
'	O
pennyworths	O
too	O
.	O

We	O
sold	O
here	O
about	O
sixty	O
ton	O
of	O
spice	O
,	O
chiefly	O
cloves	O
and	O
nutmegs	O
,	O
and	O
above	O
two	O
hundred	O
bales	O
of	O
European	O
goods	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
linen	O
and	O
woollen	O
manufactures	O
.	O

We	O
considered	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
occasion	O
for	O
some	O
such	O
things	O
ourselves	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
we	O
kept	O
a	O
good	O
quantity	O
of	O
English	O
stuffs	O
,	O
cloth	O
,	O
baize	O
,	O
&	O
c.	O
,	O
for	O
ourselves	O
.	O

I	O
shall	O
not	O
take	O
up	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
little	O
room	O
I	O
have	O
left	O
here	O
with	O
the	O
further	O
particulars	O
of	O
our	O
trade	O
;	O
it	O
is	O
enough	O
to	O
mention	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
except	O
a	O
parcel	O
of	O
tea	O
,	O
and	O
twelve	O
bales	O
of	O
fine	O
China	PNM
wrought	O
silks	O
,	O
we	O
took	O
nothing	O
in	O
exchange	O
for	O
our	O
goods	O
but	O
gold	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
sum	O
we	O
took	O
here	O
in	O
that	O
glittering	O
commodity	O
amounted	O
to	O
above	O
fifty	O
thousand	O
ounces	O
good	O
weight	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
finished	O
our	O
barter	O
,	O
we	O
restored	O
the	O
hostages	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
the	O
three	O
merchants	O
about	O
the	O
quantity	O
of	O
twelve	O
hundredweight	O
of	O
nutmegs	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
many	O
of	O
cloves	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
handsome	O
present	O
of	O
European	O
linen	O
and	O
stuff	O
for	O
themselves	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
recompense	O
for	O
what	O
we	O
had	O
taken	O
from	O
them	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
sent	O
them	O
away	O
exceedingly	O
well	O
satisfied	O
.	O

Here	O
it	O
was	O
that	O
William	O
gave	O
me	O
an	O
account	O
,	O
that	O
while	O
he	O
was	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
Japanese	O
vessel	O
,	O
he	O
met	O
with	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
religious	O
,	O
or	O
Japan	PNM
priest	O
,	O
who	O
spoke	O
some	O
words	O
of	O
English	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
being	O
very	O
inquisitive	O
to	O
know	O
how	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
learn	O
any	O
of	O
those	O
words	O
,	O
he	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
in	O
his	O
country	O
thirteen	O
Englishmen	O
;	O
he	O
called	O
them	O
Englishmen	O
very	O
articulately	O
and	O
distinctly	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
had	O
conversed	O
with	O
them	O
very	O
frequently	O
and	O
freely	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
that	O
were	O
left	O
of	O
two-and-thirty	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
came	O
on	O
shore	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
of	O
Japan	PNM
,	O
being	O
driven	O
upon	O
a	O
great	O
rock	O
in	O
a	O
stormy	O
night	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
lost	O
their	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
their	O
men	O
were	O
drowned	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
persuaded	O
the	O
king	O
of	O
his	O
country	O
to	O
send	O
boats	O
off	O
to	O
the	O
rock	O
or	O
island	O
where	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
lost	O
,	O
to	O
save	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
bring	O
them	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
done	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
used	O
very	O
kindly	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
houses	O
built	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
land	O
given	O
them	O
to	O
plant	O
for	O
provision	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
lived	O
by	O
themselves	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
he	O
went	O
frequently	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
persuade	O
them	O
to	O
worship	O
their	O
god	O
-LRB-	O
an	O
idol	O
,	O
I	O
suppose	O
,	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
making	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
they	O
ungratefully	O
refused	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
therefore	O
the	O
king	O
had	O
once	O
or	O
twice	O
ordered	O
them	O
all	O
to	O
be	O
put	O
to	O
death	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
prevailed	O
upon	O
the	O
king	O
to	O
spare	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
them	O
live	O
their	O
own	O
way	O
,	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
quiet	O
and	O
peaceable	O

and	O
did	O
not	O
go	O
about	O
to	O
withdraw	O
others	O
from	O
the	O
worship	O
of	O
the	O
country	O

I	O
asked	O

so	O
he	O
found	O
that	O

of	O

would	O
weigh	O
very	O
little	O
with	O
us	O

Then	O
he	O
pressed	O
us	O
very	O
earnestly	O
to	O
let	O
him	O
have	O
the	O
sloop	O
to	O
go	O
by	O
himself	O

and	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
I	O
would	O
not	O

but	O
when	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
sloop	O
none	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
would	O
go	O
with	O
him	O

for	O
the	O

was	O

had	O
all	O
a	O

as	O

in	O
that	O
of	O
the	O

and	O
the	O
richness	O
of	O
the	O

was	O
such	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
not	O

it	O

so	O
poor	O
William	O

much	O
to	O
his	O
mortification	O
,	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
give	O
it	O

What	O
became	O
of	O
those	O
thirteen	O
men	O

or	O
whether	O
they	O

not	O
there	O
still	O

I	O
can	O

We	O
are	O
now	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
our	O
cruise	O
;	O
what	O
we	O
had	O
taken	O
was	O
indeed	O
so	O
considerable	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
only	O
enough	O
to	O
satisfy	O
the	O
most	O
covetous	O
and	O
the	O
most	O
ambitious	O
minds	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
did	O
indeed	O
satisfy	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
declared	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
desire	O
any	O
more	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
motion	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
was	O
about	O
going	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
way	O
by	O
which	O
we	O
should	O
perform	O
the	O

so	O
as	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
attacked	O
by	O
the	O
Dutch	O
in	O
the	O
Straits	PNM
of	PNM
Sunda	PNM

We	O
had	O
pretty	O
well	O
stored	O
ourselves	O
here	O
with	O
provisions	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
being	O
now	O
near	O
the	O
return	O
of	O
the	O
monsoons	O
,	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
stand	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
;	O
and	O
not	O
only	O
to	O
keep	O
without	O
the	O
Philippine	PNM
Islands	PNM
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
keep	O
on	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
leave	O
not	O
only	O
the	O
Moluccas	O
,	O
or	O
Spice	PNM
Islands	PNM
,	O
behind	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
even	O
Nova	PNM
Guinea	PNM
and	O
Nova	PNM
Hollandia	PNM
also	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
getting	O
into	O
the	O
variable	O
winds	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
of	O
the	O
tropic	O
of	O

This	O
was	O
indeed	O
at	O
first	O
a	O
monstrous	O
voyage	O
in	O
its	O
appearance	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
provisions	O
threatened	O
us	O
.	O

William	O
told	O
us	O
in	O
so	O
many	O
words	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
we	O
could	O
carry	O
provisions	O
enough	O
to	O
subsist	O
us	O
for	O
such	O
a	O
voyage	O
,	O
and	O
especially	O
fresh	O
water	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
no	O
land	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
touch	O
at	O
where	O
we	O
could	O
get	O
any	O
supply	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
madness	O
to	O
undertake	O
it	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
undertook	O
to	O
remedy	O
this	O
evil	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
desired	O
them	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
uneasy	O
at	O
that	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
knew	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
supply	O
ourselves	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM
,	O
the	O
most	O
southerly	O
island	O
of	O
the	O
Philippines	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
we	O
set	O
sail	O
,	O
having	O
taken	O
all	O
the	O
provisions	O
here	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
get	O
,	O
the	O
28th	O
of	O
September	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
veering	O
a	O
little	O
at	O
first	O
from	O
the	O
N.N.W.	O
to	O
the	O
N.E.	O
by	O

,	O
but	O
afterwards	O
settled	O
about	O
the	O
N.E.	O
and	O
the	O
E.N.E.	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
nine	O
weeks	O
in	O
this	O
voyage	O
,	O
having	O
met	O
with	O
several	O
interruptions	O
by	O
the	O
weather	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
in	O
under	O
the	O
lee	O
of	O
a	O
small	O
island	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
16	O
degrees	O
12	O
minutes	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
never	O
knew	O
the	O
name	O
,	O
none	O
of	O
our	O
charts	O
having	O
given	O
any	O
account	O
of	O
it	O
:	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
we	O
put	O
in	O
here	O
by	O
reason	O
of	O
a	O
strange	O
tornado	O
or	O
hurricane	O
,	O
which	O
brought	O
us	O
into	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
danger	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
rode	O
about	O
sixteen	O
days	O
,	O
the	O
winds	O
being	O
very	O
tempestuous	O
and	O
the	O
weather	O
uncertain	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
got	O
some	O
provisions	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
plants	O
and	O
roots	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
few	O
hogs	O
.	O

We	O
believed	O
there	O
were	O
inhabitants	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
saw	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

From	O
hence	O
,	O
the	O
weather	O
settling	O
again	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
southernmost	O
part	O
of	O
Mindanao	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
took	O
in	O
fresh	O
water	O
and	O
some	O
cows	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
climate	O
was	O
so	O
hot	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
attempt	O
to	O
salt	O
up	O
any	O
more	O
than	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
keep	O
a	O
fortnight	O
or	O
three	O
weeks	O
;	O
and	O
away	O
we	O
stood	O
southward	O
,	O
crossing	O
the	O
line	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
leaving	O
Gillolo	O
on	O
the	O
starboard	O
side	O
,	O
we	O
coasted	O
the	O
country	O
they	O
call	O
New	PNM
Guinea	PNM
,	O
where	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
eight	O
degrees	O
south	O
,	O
we	O
put	O
in	O
again	O
for	O
provisions	O
and	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
we	O
found	O
inhabitants	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
fled	O
from	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
altogether	O
inconversable	O
.	O

From	O
thence	O
,	O
sailing	O
still	O
southward	O
,	O
we	O
left	O
all	O
behind	O
us	O
that	O
any	O
of	O
our	O
charts	O
and	O
maps	O
took	O
any	O
notice	O
of	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
on	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
seventeen	O
degrees	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
continuing	O
still	O
north-east	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
made	O
land	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
had	O
kept	O
in	O
sight	O
for	O
three	O
days	O
,	O
coasting	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
for	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
about	O
four	O
leagues	O
,	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
fear	O
we	O
should	O
find	O
no	O
outlet	O
west	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
should	O
be	O
obliged	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
in	O
among	O
the	O
Moluccas	O
at	O
last	O
;	O
but	O
at	O
length	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
land	O
break	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
go	O
trending	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
sea	O
,	O
seeming	O
to	O
be	O
all	O
open	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
and	O
south-west	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
sea	O
came	O
rolling	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
south	O
,	O
which	O
gave	O
us	O
to	O
understand	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
land	O
for	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
we	O
kept	O
on	O
our	O
course	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
,	O
a	O
little	O
westerly	O
,	O
till	O
we	O
passed	O
the	O
south	O
tropic	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
winds	O
variable	O
;	O
and	O
now	O
we	O
stood	O
away	O
fair	O
west	O
,	O
and	O
held	O
it	O
out	O
for	O
about	O
twenty	O
days	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
discovered	O
land	O
right	O
ahead	O
,	O
and	O
on	O
our	O
larboard	O
bow	O
;	O
we	O
made	O
directly	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
being	O
willing	O
to	O
take	O
all	O
advantages	O
now	O
for	O
supplying	O
ourselves	O
with	O
fresh	O
provisions	O
and	O
water	O
,	O
knowing	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
entering	O
on	O
that	O
vast	O
unknown	O
Indian	O
Ocean	O
,	O
perhaps	O
the	O
greatest	O
sea	O
on	O
the	O

having	O

with	O
very	O
little	O
interruption	O
of	O
islands	O

a	O

sea	O
quite	O
round	O
the	O

We	O
found	O
a	O
good	O
road	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
people	O
on	O
shore	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
we	O
landed	O

they	O
fled	O
up	O

with	O

come	O

shot	O
at	O
us	O
several	O
times	O
with	O
arrows	O
as	O
long	O

We	O
set	O
up	O
white	O

for	O
a	O

they	O
either	O

on	O
the	O

so	O
that	O

in	O
a	O

we	O
never	O

We	O

though	O
it	O
was	O
something	O
difficult	O
to	O
get	O
at	O
it	O

for	O

we	O

for	O
the	O

if	O
they	O
had	O
any	O
cattle	O

drove	O
them	O
all	O
away	O

showed	O
us	O
nothing	O

themselves	O

that	O
sometimes	O
in	O
a	O

posture	O

in	O

the	O

we	O

It	O

at	O

they	O
came	O

them	O

,	O
by	O
the	O

of	O
our	O

to	O

that	O

their	O

were	O
only	O
about	O

of	O
them	O
were	O
wounded	O
;	O
nor	O
had	O
they	O
escaped	O
so	O
,	O
if	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
so	O
much	O
wiser	O
or	O
thoughtfuller	O
than	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
consider	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
see	O
the	O
enemy	O
,	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
shoot	O
at	O
them	O
,	O
yet	O
perhaps	O
the	O
noise	O
of	O
their	O
shot	O
might	O
terrify	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
rather	O
fire	O
at	O
a	O
venture	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
ten	O
of	O
them	O
faced	O
about	O
,	O
and	O
fired	O
at	O
random	O
anywhere	O
among	O
the	O
canes	O
.	O

The	O
noise	O
and	O
the	O
fire	O
not	O
only	O
terrified	O
the	O
enemy	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
believed	O
,	O
their	O
shot	O
had	O
luckily	O
hit	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
found	O
not	O
only	O
that	O
the	O
arrows	O
,	O
which	O
came	O
thick	O
among	O
them	O
before	O
,	O
ceased	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
heard	O
the	O
Indians	O
halloo	O
,	O
after	O
their	O
way	O
,	O
to	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
a	O
strange	O
noise	O
,	O
more	O
uncouth	O
and	O
inimitably	O
strange	O
than	O
any	O
they	O
had	O
ever	O
heard	O
,	O
more	O
like	O
the	O
howling	O
and	O
barking	O
of	O
wild	O
creatures	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
than	O
like	O
the	O
voice	O
of	O
men	O
,	O
only	O
that	O
sometimes	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
speak	O
words	O
.	O

They	O
observed	O
also	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
noise	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
went	O
farther	O
and	O
farther	O
off	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
satisfied	O
the	O
Indians	O
fled	O
away	O
,	O
except	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
heard	O
a	O
doleful	O
groaning	O
and	O
howling	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
it	O
continued	O
a	O
good	O
while	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
supposed	O
was	O
from	O
some	O
or	O
other	O
of	O
them	O
being	O
wounded	O
,	O
and	O
howling	O
by	O
reason	O
of	O
their	O
wounds	O
;	O
or	O
killed	O
,	O
and	O
others	O
howling	O
over	O
them	O
:	O
but	O
our	O
men	O
had	O
enough	O
of	O
making	O
discoveries	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
trouble	O
themselves	O
to	O
look	O
farther	O
,	O
but	O
resolved	O
to	O
take	O
this	O
opportunity	O
to	O
retreat	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
worst	O
of	O
their	O
adventure	O
was	O
to	O
come	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
they	O
came	O
back	O
,	O
they	O
passed	O
by	O
a	O
prodigious	O
great	O
trunk	O
of	O
an	O
old	O
tree	O
;	O
what	O
tree	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
they	O
said	O
,	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
stood	O
like	O
an	O
old	O
decayed	O
oak	O
in	O
a	O
park	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
keepers	O
in	O
England	PNM
take	O
a	O
stand	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
to	O
shoot	O
a	O
deer	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
stood	O
just	O
under	O
the	O
steep	O
side	O
of	O
a	O
great	O
rock	O
,	O
or	O
hill	O
,	O
that	O
our	O
people	O
could	O
not	O
see	O
what	O
was	O
beyond	O
it	O
.	O

As	O
they	O
came	O
by	O
this	O
tree	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
of	O
a	O
sudden	O
shot	O
at	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
with	O
seven	O
arrows	O
and	O
three	O
lances	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
grief	O
,	O
killed	O
two	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
wounded	O
three	O
more	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
more	O
surprising	O
,	O
because	O
,	O
being	O
without	O
any	O
defence	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
near	O
the	O
trees	O
,	O
they	O
expected	O
more	O
lances	O
and	O
arrows	O
every	O
moment	O
;	O
nor	O
would	O
flying	O
do	O
them	O
any	O
service	O
,	O
the	O
Indians	O
being	O
,	O
as	O
appeared	O
,	O
very	O
good	O
marksmen	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
extremity	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
happily	O
this	O
presence	O
of	O
mind	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
to	O
run	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
and	O
stand	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
under	O
it	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
those	O
above	O
could	O
not	O
come	O
at	O
,	O
or	O
see	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
throw	O
their	O
lances	O
at	O
them	O
.	O

This	O
succeeded	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
them	O
time	O
to	O
consider	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
;	O
they	O
knew	O
their	O
enemies	O
and	O
murderers	O
were	O
above	O
;	O
they	O
heard	O
them	O
talk	O
,	O
and	O
those	O
above	O
knew	O
those	O
were	O
below	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
below	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
keep	O
close	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
their	O
lances	O
from	O
above	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
looking	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
strictly	O
than	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
thought	O
he	O
saw	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
just	O
over	O
a	O
dead	O
limb	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
the	O
creature	O
sat	O
upon	O
.	O

One	O
man	O
immediately	O
fired	O
,	O
and	O
levelled	O
his	O
piece	O
so	O
true	O
that	O
the	O
shot	O
went	O
through	O
the	O
fellow	O
's	O
head	O
;	O
and	O
down	O
he	O
fell	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
immediately	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
with	O
such	O
force	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
height	O
of	O
his	O
fall	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
killed	O
with	O
the	O
shot	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
certainly	O
have	O
been	O
killed	O
with	O
dashing	O
his	O
body	O
against	O
the	O
ground	O
.	O

This	O
so	O
frightened	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
besides	O
the	O
howling	O
noise	O
they	O
made	O
in	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
heard	O
a	O
strange	O
clutter	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
body	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
from	O
whence	O
they	O
concluded	O
they	O
had	O
made	O
the	O
tree	O
hollow	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
got	O
to	O
hide	O
themselves	O
there	O
.	O

Now	O
,	O
had	O
this	O
been	O
the	O
case	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
secure	O
enough	O
from	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
any	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
could	O
get	O
up	O
the	O
tree	O
on	O
the	O
outside	O
,	O
there	O
being	O
no	O
branches	O
to	O
climb	O
by	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
to	O
shoot	O
at	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
tried	O
several	O
times	O
to	O
no	O
purpose	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
tree	O
was	O
so	O
thick	O
that	O
no	O
shot	O
would	O
enter	O
it	O
.	O

They	O
made	O
no	O
doubt	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
their	O
enemies	O
in	O
a	O
trap	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
a	O
small	O
siege	O
would	O
either	O
bring	O
them	O
down	O
,	O
tree	O
and	O
all	O
,	O
or	O
starve	O
them	O
out	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
keep	O
their	O
post	O
,	O
and	O
send	O
to	O
us	O
for	O
help	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
came	O
away	O
to	O
us	O
for	O
more	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
particularly	O
desired	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
carpenters	O
might	O
come	O
with	O
tools	O
,	O
to	O
help	O
to	O
cut	O
down	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
or	O
at	O
least	O
to	O
cut	O
down	O
other	O
wood	O
and	O
set	O
fire	O
to	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
they	O
concluded	O
,	O
would	O
not	O
fail	O
to	O
bring	O
them	O
out	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
went	O
like	O
a	O
little	O
army	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
mighty	O
preparations	O
for	O
an	O
enterprise	O
,	O
the	O
like	O
of	O
which	O
has	O
scarce	O
been	O
ever	O
heard	O
,	O
to	O
form	O
the	O
siege	O
of	O
a	O
great	O
tree	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
there	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
the	O
task	O
difficult	O
enough	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
old	O
trunk	O
was	O
indeed	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
one	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
tall	O
,	O
being	O
at	O
least	O
two-and-twenty	O
feet	O
high	O
,	O
with	O
seven	O
old	O
limbs	O
standing	O
out	O
every	O
way	O
from	O
the	O

very	O

William	O
the	O
Quaker	O
,	O
whose	O
curiosity	O
led	O
him	O
to	O
go	O
among	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
proposed	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
make	O
a	O
ladder	O
,	O
and	O
get	O
upon	O
the	O
top	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
throw	O
wild-fire	O
into	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
and	O
smoke	O
them	O
out	O
.	O

Others	O
proposed	O
going	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
getting	O
a	O
great	O
gun	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
split	O
the	O
tree	O
in	O
pieces	O
with	O
the	O
iron	O
bullets	O
;	O
others	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
cut	O
down	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
wood	O
,	O
and	O
pile	O
it	O
up	O
round	O
the	O
tree	O

and	O
set	O
it	O
on	O
fire	O

and	O
burn	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Indians	O
in	O
it	O
.	O

These	O
consultations	O
took	O
up	O
our	O
people	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
,	O
in	O
all	O
which	O
time	O
they	O

William	O
's	O
project	O
was	O
first	O
gone	O
about	O

and	O
a	O
large	O
strong	O
ladder	O
was	O
made	O

to	O

this	O

in	O
two	O

been	O
ready	O
to	O
mount	O

on	O
a	O

they	O
heard	O
the	O
noise	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
in	O
the	O
body	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
after	O
,	O
several	O
of	O
them	O
appeared	O
at	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
and	O
threw	O
some	O
lances	O
down	O
at	O
our	O
men	O
;	O
one	O
of	O
which	O
struck	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
seamen	O
a-top	O
of	O
the	O
shoulder	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
him	O
such	O
a	O
desperate	O
wound	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
surgeons	O
not	O
only	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
difficulty	O
to	O
cure	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
poor	O
man	O
endured	O
such	O
horrible	O
torture	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
all	O
said	O
they	O
had	O
better	O
have	O
killed	O
him	O
outright	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
cured	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
never	O
recovered	O
the	O
perfect	O
use	O
of	O
his	O
arm	O

the	O
lance	O
having	O
cut	O
some	O
of	O

tendons	O
on	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
arm	O
,	O
near	O
the	O
shoulder	O

which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
supposed	O
,	O
performed	O
the	O
office	O
of	O
motion	O
to	O
the	O
limb	O
before	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
poor	O
man	O
was	O
a	O
cripple	O
all	O
the	O
days	O
of	O
his	O
life	O

But	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
the	O
desperate	O
rogues	O
in	O
the	O
tree	O
;	O
our	O
men	O
shot	O
at	O

did	O
not	O

them	O

any	O

but	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
ever	O
they	O

at	O
them	O

they	O
could	O
hear	O
them	O

down	O

again	O

there	O

to	O

Well	O

however	O

it	O
was	O
this	O
which	O
put	O
by	O
the	O
project	O
of	O
William	O

ladder	O
;	O
for	O
when	O
it	O
was	O

one	O
man	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
could	O
go	O
up	O

began	O
to	O

it	O

indeed	O

I	O
was	O
of	O
the	O

-LRB-	O
for	O
about	O
this	O

was	O

that	O
going	O
up	O

that	O

run	O

composition	O
which	O
only	O

does	O
not	O
flame	O
or	O
burn	O
;	O
but	O
withal	O
the	O
smoke	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
so	O
thick	O

and	O
the	O

so	O
intolerably	O

that	O
it	O

This	O
he	O
threw	O
into	O
the	O
tree	O
himself	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
waited	O
for	O
the	O
effect	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
heard	O
or	O
saw	O
nothing	O
all	O
that	O
night	O
or	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
concluded	O
the	O
men	O
within	O
were	O
all	O
smothered	O
;	O
when	O
,	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
,	O
the	O
next	O
night	O
we	O
heard	O
them	O
upon	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
again	O
shouting	O
and	O
hallooing	O
like	O
madmen	O
.	O

We	O
concluded	O
,	O
as	O
anybody	O
would	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
to	O
call	O
for	O
help	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
continue	O
our	O
siege	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
enraged	O
to	O
see	O
ourselves	O
so	O
baulked	O
by	O
a	O
few	O
wild	O
people	O
,	O
whom	O
we	O
thought	O
we	O
had	O
safe	O
in	O
our	O
clutches	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
never	O
were	O
there	O
so	O
many	O
concurring	O
circumstances	O
to	O
delude	O
men	O
in	O
any	O
case	O
we	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
.	O

We	O
resolved	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
to	O
try	O
another	O
stink-pot	O
the	O
next	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
engineer	O
and	O
gunner	O
had	O
got	O
it	O
ready	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
hearing	O
a	O
noise	O
of	O
the	O
enemy	O
on	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
body	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
willing	O
to	O
let	O
the	O
gunner	O
go	O
up	O
the	O
ladder	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
would	O
be	O
but	O
to	O
be	O
certain	O
of	O
being	O
murdered	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
he	O
found	O
a	O
medium	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
to	O
go	O
up	O
a	O
few	O
steps	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
long	O
pole	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
,	O
to	O
throw	O
it	O
in	O
upon	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
the	O
ladder	O
being	O
standing	O
all	O
this	O
while	O
against	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
the	O
gunner	O
,	O
with	O
his	O
machine	O
at	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
his	O
pole	O
,	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
with	O
three	O
other	O
men	O
to	O
help	O
him	O
,	O
behold	O
the	O
ladder	O
was	O
gone	O
.	O

This	O
perfectly	O
confounded	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
now	O
concluded	O
the	O
Indians	O
in	O
the	O
tree	O
had	O
,	O
by	O
this	O
piece	O
of	O
negligence	O
,	O
taken	O
the	O
opportunity	O
,	O
and	O
come	O
all	O
down	O
the	O
ladder	O
,	O
made	O
their	O
escape	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
carried	O
away	O
the	O
ladder	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
laughed	O
most	O
heartily	O
at	O
my	O
friend	O
William	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
had	O
the	O
direction	O
of	O
the	O
siege	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
set	O
up	O
a	O
ladder	O
for	O
the	O
garrison	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
called	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
get	O
down	O
upon	O
,	O
and	O
run	O
away	O
.	O

But	O
when	O
daylight	O
came	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
set	O
to	O
rights	O
again	O
;	O
for	O
there	O
stood	O
our	O
ladder	O
,	O
hauled	O
up	O
on	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
with	O
about	O
half	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
hollow	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
half	O
upright	O
in	O
the	O
air	O
.	O

Then	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
laugh	O
at	O
the	O
Indians	O
for	O
fools	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
as	O
well	O
have	O
found	O
their	O
way	O
down	O
by	O
the	O
ladder	O
,	O
and	O
have	O
made	O
their	O
escape	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
have	O
pulled	O
it	O
up	O
by	O
main	O
strength	O
into	O
the	O
tree	O
.	O

We	O
then	O
resolved	O
upon	O
fire	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
to	O
put	O
an	O
end	O
to	O
the	O
work	O
at	O
once	O
,	O
and	O
burn	O
the	O
tree	O
and	O
its	O
inhabitants	O
together	O
;	O
and	O
accordingly	O
we	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
to	O
cut	O
wood	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
hours	O
'	O
time	O
we	O
got	O
enough	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
thought	O
,	O
together	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
piling	O
it	O
up	O
round	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
we	O
set	O
it	O
on	O
fire	O
,	O
waiting	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
to	O
see	O
when	O
,	O
the	O
gentlemen	O
's	O
quarters	O
being	O
too	O
hot	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
come	O
flying	O
out	O
at	O
the	O
top	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
were	O
quite	O
confounded	O
when	O
,	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
fire	O
all	O
put	O
out	O
by	O
a	O
great	O
quantity	O
of	O
water	O
thrown	O
upon	O
it	O
.	O

We	O
then	O
thought	O
the	O
devil	O
must	O
be	O
in	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
.	O

Says	O
William	O
,	O
``	O
This	O
is	O
certainly	O
the	O
cunningest	O

of	O

there	O

he	O

``	O

that	O

''	O

He	O
then	O
called	O
the	O
carpenters	O
,	O
to	O
know	O
of	O
them	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
any	O
large	O
saws	O
that	O
would	O
cut	O
through	O
the	O
body	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
told	O
him	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
saws	O
that	O
were	O
long	O
enough	O

nor	O
could	O
men	O
work	O
into	O
such	O
a	O
monstrous	O
old	O
stump	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
go	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
it	O
with	O
their	O
axes	O
,	O
and	O
undertake	O
to	O
cut	O
it	O
down	O
in	O
two	O
days	O
,	O
and	O
stock	O
up	O
the	O
root	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
two	O

.	O

But	O
William	O
was	O
for	O
another	O
way	O
,	O
which	O
proved	O
much	O
better	O
than	O
all	O
this	O
;	O
for	O
he	O
was	O
for	O
silent	O
work	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
he	O
might	O
catch	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
fellows	O
in	O
it	O
.	O

So	O
he	O
sets	O
twelve	O
men	O
to	O
it	O
with	O
large	O
augers	O
,	O
to	O
bore	O
great	O
holes	O
into	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
to	O
go	O
almost	O
through	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
quite	O
through	O
;	O
which	O
holes	O
were	O
bored	O
without	O
noise	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
done	O
he	O
filled	O
them	O
all	O
with	O
gunpowder	O
,	O
stopping	O
strong	O
plugs	O
,	O
bolted	O
crossways	O
,	O
into	O
the	O
holes	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
boring	O
a	O
slanting	O
hole	O
,	O
of	O
a	O
less	O
size	O
,	O
down	O
into	O
the	O
greater	O
hole	O
,	O
all	O
of	O
which	O
were	O
filled	O
with	O
powder	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
once	O
blown	O
up	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
took	O
fire	O
,	O
they	O
made	O
such	O
a	O
noise	O
,	O
and	O
tore	O
and	O
split	O
up	O
the	O
tree	O
in	O
so	O
many	O
places	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
manner	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
plainly	O
such	O
another	O
blast	O
would	O
demolish	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
it	O
did	O
.	O

Thus	O
at	O
the	O
second	O
time	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
at	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
places	O
,	O
put	O
our	O
hands	O
in	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
discovered	O
a	O
cheat	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
cave	O
or	O
hole	O
dug	O
into	O
the	O
earth	O
,	O
from	O
or	O
through	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
the	O
hollow	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
had	O
communication	O
with	O
another	O
cave	O
farther	O
in	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
heard	O
the	O
voices	O
of	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
wild	O
folks	O
,	O
calling	O
and	O
talking	O
to	O
one	O
another	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
thus	O
far	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
mind	O
to	O
get	O
at	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
William	O
desired	O
that	O
three	O
men	O
might	O
be	O
given	O
him	O
with	O
hand-grenadoes	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
promised	O
to	O
go	O
down	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
boldly	O
he	O
did	O
so	O
;	O
for	O
William	O
,	O
to	O
give	O
him	O
his	O
due	O
,	O
had	O
the	O
heart	O
of	O
a	O
lion	O

They	O
had	O
pistols	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
swords	O
by	O
their	O
sides	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
taught	O
the	O
Indians	O
before	O
by	O
their	O
stink-pots	O
,	O
the	O
Indians	O
returned	O
them	O
in	O
their	O
own	O
kind	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
made	O
such	O
a	O
smoke	O
come	O
up	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
entrance	O
into	O
the	O
cave	O
or	O
hollow	O
,	O
that	O
William	O
and	O
his	O
three	O
men	O
were	O
glad	O
to	O
come	O
running	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
cave	O
,	O
and	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
too	O
,	O
for	O
mere	O
want	O
of	O
breath	O
;	O
and	O
indeed	O
they	O
were	O
almost	O
stifled	O
.	O

Never	O
was	O
a	O
fortification	O
so	O
well	O
defended	O
,	O
or	O
assailants	O
so	O
many	O
ways	O
defeated	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
now	O
for	O
giving	O
it	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
particularly	O
I	O
called	O
William	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
but	O
laugh	O
to	O
see	O
us	O
spinning	O
out	O
our	O
time	O
here	O
for	O
nothing	O
;	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
imagine	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
doing	O
;	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
certain	O
that	O
the	O
rogues	O
that	O
were	O
in	O
it	O
were	O
cunning	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
degree	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
would	O
vex	O
anybody	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
baulked	O
by	O
a	O
few	O
naked	O
ignorant	O
fellows	O
;	O
but	O
still	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
worth	O
our	O
while	O
to	O
push	O
it	O
any	O
further	O
,	O
nor	O
was	O
there	O
anything	O
that	O
I	O
knew	O
of	O
to	O
be	O
got	O
by	O
the	O
conquest	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
made	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
high	O
time	O
to	O
give	O
it	O
over	O
.	O

William	O
acknowledged	O
what	O
I	O
said	O
was	O
just	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
nothing	O
but	O
our	O
curiosity	O
to	O
be	O
gratified	O
in	O
this	O
attempt	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
very	O
desirous	O
to	O
have	O
searched	O
into	O
the	O
thing	O
,	O
yet	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
insist	O
upon	O
it	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
quit	O
it	O
and	O
come	O
away	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
William	O
said	O
before	O
we	O
went	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
this	O
satisfaction	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
to	O
burn	O
down	O
the	O
tree	O
and	O
stop	O
up	O
the	O
entrance	O
into	O
the	O
cave	O
.	O

And	O
while	O
doing	O
this	O
the	O
gunner	O
told	O
him	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
one	O
satisfaction	O
of	O
the	O
rogues	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
make	O
a	O
mine	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
which	O
way	O
it	O
had	O
vent	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
he	O
fetched	O
two	O
barrels	O
of	O
powder	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
placed	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
inside	O
of	O
the	O
hollow	O
of	O
the	O
cave	O
,	O
as	O
far	O
in	O
as	O
he	O
durst	O
go	O
to	O
carry	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
filling	O
up	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
cave	O
where	O
the	O
tree	O
stood	O
,	O
and	O

a	O

he	O
gave	O

on	O

the	O

of	O

burst	O
its	O
way	O
out	O
among	O
some	O
bushes	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
the	O
little	O
hill	O
I	O
mentioned	O

and	O
that	O
it	O
came	O
roaring	O
out	O
there	O
as	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
a	O
cannon	O
.	O

Immediately	O
running	O
thither	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
effects	O
of	O
the	O
powder	O

First	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
the	O
other	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
cave	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
powder	O
had	O
so	O
torn	O

opened	O

that	O
the	O
loose	O
earth	O
was	O
so	O
fallen	O
in	O
again	O
that	O
nothing	O
of	O
shape	O
could	O
be	O
discerned	O
;	O
but	O
there	O
we	O
saw	O
what	O
was	O
become	O
of	O
the	O
garrison	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
too	O

who	O
had	O
given	O
us	O
all	O
this	O

for	O
some	O

them	O
had	O
no	O

some	O
no	O

some	O
no	O

some	O

half	O

that	O
is	O
to	O

in	O
the	O

that	O
fell	O
in	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
miserable	O
havoc	O
made	O
in	O
them	O
all	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
good	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
not	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
that	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
inside	O
could	O
escape	O

but	O
rather	O
were	O
shot	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
cave	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
bullet	O
out	O
of	O

We	O
had	O
now	O
our	O
full	O
satisfaction	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
losing	O
voyage	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
two	O
men	O
killed	O
,	O
one	O
quite	O
crippled	O
,	O
and	O
five	O
more	O
wounded	O
;	O
we	O
spent	O
two	O

and	O
eleven	O
days	O
'	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
to	O

the	O

how	O

mine	O

or	O
how	O
to	O
keep	O

and	O
with	O
this	O

bought	O
at	O
this	O

we	O
came	O
away	O

having	O
taken	O
in	O
some	O

got	O
no	O

We	O

considered	O
what	O
we	O
should	O
do	O
to	O

back	O

Madagascar	PNM

We	O

a	O
great	O
deal	O
;	O
for	O

about	O
fifteen	O

we	O

about	O
three	O

that	O

chose	O
rather	O
to	O
take	O
what	O
we	O
could	O
find	O

which	O

N.W.	O

made	O
land	O
again	O

standing	O
in	O
with	O
the	O
shore	O

we	O
were	O
surprised	O
to	O
find	O
ourselves	O
on	O
the	O
south	O
shore	O
of	O
Java	PNM
;	O
and	O
just	O
as	O
we	O
were	O

we	O
saw	O
a	O
boat	O

carrying	O

along-shore	O

our	O

indeed	O

by	O
this	O
time	O
were	O
very	O

the	O
most	O

bring	O
the	O

not	O
to	O
stay	O
any	O
considerable	O
time	O
,	O
at	O

not	O
long	O
enough	O
to	O
have	O

across	O

for	O
ships	O
to	O
come	O
round	O
from	O

attack	O
us	O

We	O
found	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
our	O
desire	O
,	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
harbour	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
rode	O
in	O
seven	O
fathom	O
water	O
,	O
well	O
defended	O
from	O
the	O
weather	O
,	O
whatever	O
might	O
happen	O
;	O
and	O
here	O
we	O
got	O
fresh	O
provisions	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
good	O
hogs	O
and	O
some	O
cows	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
lay	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
store	O
,	O
we	O
killed	O
sixteen	O
cows	O
,	O
and	O
pickled	O
and	O
barrelled	O
up	O
the	O
flesh	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
be	O
supposed	O
to	O
do	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
eight	O
degrees	O
from	O
the	O
line	O
.	O

We	O
did	O
all	O
this	O
in	O
about	O
five	O
days	O
,	O
and	O
filled	O
our	O
casks	O
with	O
water	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
last	O
boat	O
was	O
coming	O
off	O
with	O
herbs	O
and	O
roots	O
,	O
we	O
being	O
unmoored	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
fore-topsail	O
loose	O
for	O
sailing	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
spied	O
a	O
large	O
ship	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
,	O
bearing	O
down	O
directly	O
upon	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
she	O
might	O
be	O
,	O
but	O
concluded	O
the	O
worst	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
all	O
possible	O
haste	O
to	O
get	O
our	O
anchor	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
get	O
under	O
sail	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
readiness	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
she	O
had	O
to	O
say	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
under	O
no	O
great	O
concern	O
for	O
one	O
ship	O
,	O
but	O
our	O
notion	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
attacked	O
by	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
together	O
.	O

By	O
the	O
time	O
we	O
had	O
got	O
up	O
our	O
anchor	O
and	O
the	O
boat	O
was	O
stowed	O
,	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
within	O
a	O
league	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
thought	O
,	O
bore	O
down	O
to	O
engage	O
us	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
spread	O
our	O
black	O
flag	O
,	O
or	O
ancient	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
poop	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
bloody	O
flag	O
at	O
the	O
top-mast-head	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
made	O
a	O
clear	O
ship	O
,	O
we	O
stretched	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
,	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
wind	O
of	O
him	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
quite	O
mistaken	O
us	O
before	O
,	O
expecting	O
nothing	O
of	O
an	O
enemy	O
or	O
a	O
pirate	O
in	O
those	O
seas	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
not	O
doubting	O
but	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
ships	O
,	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
some	O
confusion	O
when	O
they	O
found	O
their	O
mistake	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
immediately	O
hauled	O
upon	O
a	O
wind	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
tack	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
edging	O
in	O
for	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
towards	O
the	O
easternmost	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O

Upon	O
this	O
we	O
tacked	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
after	O
him	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
sail	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
two	O
hours	O
came	O
almost	O
within	O
gunshot	O
.	O

Though	O
they	O
crowded	O
all	O
the	O
sail	O
they	O
could	O
lay	O
on	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
remedy	O
but	O
to	O
engage	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
soon	O
saw	O
their	O
inequality	O
of	O
force	O
.	O

We	O
fired	O
a	O
gun	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
bring	O
to	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
manned	O
out	O
their	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
sent	O
to	O
us	O
with	O
a	O
flag	O
of	O
truce	O
.	O

We	O
sent	O
back	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
but	O
with	O
this	O
answer	O
to	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
but	O
to	O
strike	O
and	O
bring	O
his	O
ship	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
under	O
our	O
stern	O
,	O
and	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
us	O
himself	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
should	O
know	O
our	O
demands	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
since	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
yet	O
put	O
us	O
to	O
the	O
trouble	O
of	O
forcing	O
him	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
saw	O
we	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
we	O
assured	O
them	O
that	O
the	O
captain	O
should	O
return	O
again	O
in	O
safety	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
his	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
supplying	O
us	O
with	O
such	O
things	O
as	O
we	O
should	O
demand	O
,	O
his	O
ship	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
plundered	O
.	O

They	O
went	O
back	O
with	O
this	O
message	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
some	O
time	O
after	O
they	O
were	O
on	O
board	O
before	O
they	O
struck	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
us	O
begin	O
to	O
think	O

refused	O
it	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
fired	O
a	O
shot	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
more	O
we	O
perceived	O
their	O
boat	O
put	O
off	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
boat	O
put	O
off	O
the	O
ship	O
struck	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
,	O
as	O
was	O
directed	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
captain	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
we	O
demanded	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
their	O
cargo	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
chiefly	O
bales	O
of	O
goods	O
from	O
Bengal	PNM
for	O
Bantam	PNM
.	O

We	O
told	O
them	O
our	O
present	O
want	O
was	O
provisions	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
need	O
of	O
,	O
being	O
just	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
their	O
voyage	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
send	O
their	O
boat	O
on	O
shore	O
with	O
ours	O
,	O
and	O
procure	O
us	O
six-and-twenty	O
head	O
of	O
black	O
cattle	O
,	O
threescore	O
hogs	O
,	O
a	O
quantity	O
of	O
brandy	O
and	O
arrack	O
,	O
and	O
three	O
hundred	O
bushels	O
of	O
rice	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
let	O
them	O
go	O
free	O
.	O

As	O
to	O
the	O
rice	O
,	O
they	O
gave	O
us	O
six	O
hundred	O
bushels	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
actually	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
together	O
with	O
a	O
parcel	O
shipped	O
upon	O
freight	O
.	O

Also	O
,	O
they	O
gave	O
us	O
thirty	O
middling	O
casks	O
of	O
very	O
good	O
arrack	O
,	O
but	O
beef	O
and	O
pork	O
they	O
had	O
none	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
they	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
with	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
bought	O
eleven	O
bullocks	O
and	O
fifty	O
hogs	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
pickled	O
up	O
for	O
our	O
occasion	O
;	O
and	O
upon	O
the	O
supplies	O
of	O
provision	O
from	O
shore	O
,	O
we	O
dismissed	O
them	O
and	O
their	O
ship	O
.	O

We	O
lay	O
here	O
several	O
days	O
before	O
we	O
could	O
furnish	O
ourselves	O
with	O
the	O
provisions	O
agreed	O
for	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
fancied	O
the	O
Dutchmen	O
were	O
contriving	O
our	O
destruction	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
honest	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
what	O
they	O
could	O
to	O
furnish	O
the	O
black	O
cattle	O
,	O
but	O
found	O
it	O
impossible	O
to	O
supply	O
so	O
many	O
.	O

So	O
they	O
came	O
and	O
told	O
us	O
ingenuously	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
unless	O
we	O
could	O
stay	O
a	O
while	O
longer	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
get	O
no	O
more	O
oxen	O
or	O
cows	O
than	O
those	O
eleven	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
be	O
satisfied	O
,	O
taking	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
other	O
things	O
,	O
rather	O
than	O
stay	O
longer	O
there	O
.	O

On	O
our	O
side	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
punctual	O
with	O
them	O
in	O
observing	O
the	O
conditions	O
we	O
had	O
agreed	O
on	O
;	O
nor	O
would	O
we	O
let	O
any	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
go	O
on	O
board	O
them	O
,	O
or	O
suffer	O
any	O
of	O
their	O
men	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
us	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
had	O
any	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
gone	O
on	O

,	O
nobody	O
could	O
have	O
answered	O
for	O
their	O
behaviour	O
,	O
any	O
more	O
than	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
on	O
shore	O
in	O
an	O
enemy	O

country	O

We	O
were	O
now	O
victualled	O
for	O
our	O
voyage	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
mattered	O
not	O
purchase	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
merrily	O
on	O
for	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Ceylon	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
intended	O
to	O
touch	O
,	O
to	O
get	O
fresh	O
water	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
more	O
provisions	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
nothing	O
material	O
offered	O
in	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
voyage	O
,	O
only	O
that	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
contrary	O
winds	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
above	O
a	O
month	O
in	O
the	O
passage	O
.	O

We	O
put	O
in	O
upon	O
the	O
south	O
coast	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
desiring	O
to	O
have	O
as	O
little	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
the	O
Dutch	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
the	O
Dutch	O
were	O
lords	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
as	O
to	O
commerce	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
are	O
more	O
so	O
of	O
the	O
sea-coast	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
have	O
several	O
forts	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
in	O

have	O
all	O
the	O
cinnamon	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
trade	O
of	O
that	O
island	O
.	O

We	O
took	O
in	O
fresh	O
water	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
provisions	O
,	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
much	O
trouble	O
ourselves	O
about	O
laying	O
in	O
any	O
stores	O
,	O
our	O
beef	O
and	O
hogs	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
got	O
at	O
Java	PNM
,	O
being	O
not	O
yet	O
all	O
gone	O
by	O
a	O
good	O
deal	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
little	O
skirmish	O
on	O
shore	O
here	O
with	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
having	O
been	O
a	O
little	O
too	O
familiar	O
with	O
the	O
homely	O
ladies	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
;	O
for	O
homely	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
to	O
such	O
a	O
degree	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
our	O
men	O
had	O
not	O
had	O
good	O
stomachs	O
that	O
way	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
scarce	O
have	O
touched	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
could	O
never	O
fully	O
get	O
it	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
what	O
they	O
did	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
true	O
to	O
one	O
another	O
in	O
their	O
wickedness	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
understood	O
in	O
the	O
main	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
some	O
barbarous	O
thing	O
they	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
like	O
to	O
have	O
paid	O
dear	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
men	O
resented	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
degree	O
,	O
and	O
gathered	O
in	O
such	O
numbers	O
about	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
had	O
not	O
sixteen	O
more	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
in	O
another	O
boat	O
,	O
come	O
all	O
in	O
the	O
nick	O
of	O
time	O
,	O
just	O
to	O
rescue	O
our	O
first	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
but	O
eleven	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
fetch	O
them	O
off	O
by	O
main	O
force	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
all	O
cut	O
off	O
,	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
being	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
hundred	O
,	O
armed	O
with	O
darts	O
and	O
lances	O
,	O
the	O
usual	O
weapons	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
they	O
are	O
very	O
dexterous	O
at	O
the	O
throwing	O
,	O
even	O
so	O
dexterous	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
scarce	O
credible	O
;	O
and	O
had	O
our	O
men	O
stood	O
to	O
fight	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
bold	O
enough	O
to	O
talk	O
of	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
all	O
overwhelmed	O
and	O
killed	O
.	O

As	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
seventeen	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
were	O
wounded	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
very	O
dangerously	O
.	O

But	O
they	O
were	O
more	O
frighted	O
than	O
hurt	O
too	O
,	O
for	O
every	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
gave	O
themselves	O
over	O
for	O
dead	O
men	O
,	O
believing	O
the	O

were	O

But	O
William	O
was	O
our	O
comfort	O
here	O
too	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
when	O
two	O
of	O
our	O
surgeons	O
were	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
opinion	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
the	O
men	O
foolishly	O
enough	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
die	O
,	O
William	O
cheerfully	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
cured	O
them	O
all	O
but	O
one	O
,	O
who	O
rather	O
died	O
by	O
drinking	O
some	O
arrack	O
punch	O
than	O
of	O
his	O
wound	O
;	O
the	O
excess	O
of	O
drinking	O
throwing	O
him	O
into	O
a	O
fever	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
enough	O
of	O
Ceylon	O
,	O
though	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
were	O
for	O
going	O
ashore	O
again	O
,	O
sixty	O
or	O
seventy	O
men	O
together	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
revenged	O
;	O
but	O
William	O
persuaded	O
them	O
against	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
his	O
reputation	O
was	O
so	O
great	O
among	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
with	O
us	O
that	O
were	O
commanders	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
influence	O
them	O
more	O
than	O
any	O
of	O
us	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
mighty	O
warm	O
upon	O
their	O
revenge	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
would	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
destroy	O
five	O
hundred	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

``	O
Well	O

''	O
says	O
William	O
,	O
``	O
and	O
suppose	O
you	O
do	O

``	O
Why	O

one	O

says	O
William	O

They	O
could	O
then	O
say	O
nothing	O

``	O

William	O

``	O

says	O
William	O

``	O

''	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
William	O
argued	O
so	O
effectually	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
convinced	O
them	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
mere	O
murder	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
men	O
had	O
a	O
right	O
to	O
their	O
own	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
right	O
to	O
take	O
them	O
away	O
;	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
destroying	O
innocent	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
acted	O
no	O
otherwise	O
than	O
as	O
the	O
laws	O
of	O
nature	O
dictated	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
as	O
much	O
murder	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
meet	O
a	O
man	O
on	O
the	O
highway	O
,	O
and	O
kill	O
him	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
mere	O
sake	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
in	O
cold	O
blood	O
,	O
not	O
regarding	O
whether	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
any	O
wrong	O
to	O
us	O
or	O
no	O
.	O

These	O
reasons	O
prevailed	O
with	O
them	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
content	O
to	O
go	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
leave	O
them	O
as	O
they	O
found	O
them	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
first	O
skirmish	O
they	O
killed	O
between	O
sixty	O
and	O
seventy	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
wounded	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
more	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
had	O
nothing	O

and	O
our	O
people	O
got	O
nothing	O
by	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
one	O

and	O
the	O
wounding	O
sixteen	O
more	O

as	O
above	O

But	O
another	O
accident	O
brought	O
us	O
to	O
a	O
necessity	O
of	O
further	O
business	O
with	O
these	O
people	O

and	O
indeed	O
we	O

in	O
a	O
thousand	O
pieces	O
upon	O
a	O
great	O
ledge	O
of	O
rocks	O
which	O
lay	O
off	O
about	O
half-a-league	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
shifting	O
very	O
often	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
coming	O
to	O
the	O
E.S.E.	O
,	O
we	O
stretched	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
above	O
a	O
league	O
more	O
sea-room	O
in	O
half-an-hour	O
.	O

After	O
that	O
,	O
it	O
blew	O
with	O
some	O
fury	O
S.W.	O
by	O
S.	O
,	O
then	O
S.W.	O
by	O
W.	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
us	O
back	O
again	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
of	O
the	O
ledge	O
of	O
rocks	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
great	O
opening	O
between	O
the	O
rocks	O
and	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
and	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
there	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
found	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
ground	O
fit	O
to	O
anchor	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
lose	O
our	O
anchors	O
,	O
there	O
being	O
nothing	O
but	O
rocks	O
.	O

We	O
stood	O
through	O
the	O
opening	O
,	O
which	O
held	O
about	O
four	O
leagues	O
.	O

The	O
storm	O
continued	O
,	O
and	O
now	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
dreadful	O
foul	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
course	O
to	O
take	O
.	O

We	O
looked	O
out	O
very	O
narrowly	O
for	O
some	O
river	O
or	O
creek	O
or	O
bay	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
might	O
run	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
come	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
,	O
but	O
found	O
none	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
great	O
headland	O
lie	O
out	O
far	O
south	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
to	O
such	O
a	O
length	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
plainly	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
wind	O
held	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
weather	O
it	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
ran	O
in	O
as	O
much	O
under	O
the	O
lee	O
of	O
the	O
point	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
in	O
about	O
twelve	O
fathom	O
water	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
wind	O
veering	O
again	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
blowing	O
exceedingly	O
hard	O
,	O
our	O
anchors	O
came	O
home	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
ship	O
drove	O
till	O
the	O
rudder	O
struck	O
against	O
the	O
ground	O
;	O
and	O
had	O
the	O
ship	O
gone	O
half	O
her	O
length	O
farther	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
lost	O
,	O
and	O
every	O
one	O
of	O
us	O
with	O
her	O
.	O

But	O
our	O
sheet-anchor	O
held	O
its	O
own	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
heaved	O
in	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
cable	O
,	O
to	O
get	O
clear	O
of	O
the	O
ground	O
we	O
had	O
struck	O
upon	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
by	O
this	O
only	O
cable	O
that	O
we	O
rode	O
it	O
out	O
all	O
night	O
;	O
and	O
towards	O
morning	O
we	O
thought	O
the	O
wind	O
abated	O
a	O
little	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
well	O
for	O
us	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
,	O
for	O
,	O
in	O
spite	O
of	O
what	O
our	O
sheet-anchor	O
did	O
for	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
ship	O
fast	O
aground	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
very	O
great	O
surprise	O
and	O
amazement	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
tide	O
was	O
out	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
water	O
here	O
ebbed	O
away	O
,	O
the	O
ship	O
lay	O
almost	O
dry	O
upon	O
a	O
bank	O
of	O
hard	O
sand	O
,	O
which	O
never	O
,	O
I	O
suppose	O
,	O
had	O
any	O
ship	O
upon	O
it	O
before	O
.	O

The	O
people	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
came	O
down	O
in	O
great	O
numbers	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
us	O
and	O
gaze	O
,	O
not	O
knowing	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
but	O
gaping	O
at	O
us	O
as	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
sight	O
or	O
wonder	O
at	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
surprised	O
,	O
and	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
upon	O
the	O
sight	O
they	O
immediately	O
sent	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
a	O
ship	O
being	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
condition	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
there	O
appeared	O
a	O
great	O
man	O
;	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
their	O
king	O
or	O
no	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
had	O
abundance	O
of	O
men	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
with	O
long	O
javelins	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
half-pikes	O
;	O
and	O
these	O
came	O
all	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
water	O
's	O
edge	O
,	O
and	O
drew	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
order	O
,	O
just	O
in	O
our	O
view	O
.	O

They	O
stood	O
near	O
an	O
hour	O
without	O
making	O
any	O
motion	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
there	O
came	O
near	O
twenty	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
man	O
before	O
them	O
carrying	O
a	O
white	O
flag	O
.	O

They	O
came	O
forward	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
as	O
high	O
as	O
their	O
waists	O
,	O
the	O
sea	O
not	O
going	O
so	O
high	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
wind	O
was	O
abated	O
,	O
and	O
blew	O
off	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

The	O
man	O
made	O
a	O
long	O
oration	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
by	O
his	O
gestures	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
sometimes	O
heard	O
his	O
voice	O
,	O
but	O
knew	O
not	O
one	O
word	O

said	O

William	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
always	O
useful	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
was	O
here	O
again	O
the	O
saving	O
of	O
all	O

what	O
I	O
might	O
call	O
him	O
,	O
when	O
his	O
speech	O
was	O
done	O

gave	O
three	O
great	O
screams	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
what	O
else	O
to	O

they	O
were	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
then	O
lowered	O
his	O
white	O
flag	O
three	O
times	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
made	O
three	O
motions	O
to	O
us	O
with	O
his	O

to	O

him	O

I	O

that	O
I	O
was	O
for	O
manning	O
out	O
the	O

going	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
William	O
would	O
by	O
no	O

allow	O
me	O

to	O
trust	O

that	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
were	O

and	O
under	O
their	O

,	O
we	O
might	O
be	O
sure	O
to	O
be	O
all	O
murdered	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
Christians	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
not	O
fare	O
much	O
better	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
knew	O
who	O
we	O
were	O
;	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
custom	O
of	O
the	O
Malabars	O
to	O
betray	O
all	O
people	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
get	O
into	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
these	O
were	O
some	O
of	O
the	O

that	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
any	O
regard	O
to	O
our	O
own	O
safety	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
not	O
go	O
to	O
them	O

any	O

I	O
opposed	O
him	O
a	O
great	O

and	O
told	O
him	O
I	O
thought	O
he	O
used	O
to	O
be	O

right	O

that	O
now	O
I	O
thought	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
;	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
no	O
more	O
for	O
running	O
needless	O
risks	O
than	O
he	O
or	O
any	O
one	O
else	O

I	O
thought	O
all	O

the	O

even	O
the	O
most	O
savage	O
people	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
held	O
out	O
a	O

of	O
peace	O

kept	O
the	O
offer	O
of	O
peace	O
made	O
by	O
that	O
signal	O
very	O
sacredly	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
gave	O
him	O
several	O
examples	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
history	O
of	O
my	O
African	PNM
travels	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
have	O
here	O
gone	O
through	O
in	O
the	O

that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
think	O
these	O
people	O
worse	O
than	O
some	O
of	O
them	O

And	O
,	O
besides	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
our	O
case	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
such	O
that	O
we	O
must	O
fall	O
into	O
somebody	O

that	O

by	O

had	O

a	O

they	O
advanced	O
all	O
in	O

of	O

every	O

carrying	O

or	O
some	O
such	O

which	O
,	O
flying	O
through	O
the	O

had	O
nothing	O
to	O
hinder	O
it	O
taking	O
fire	O
as	O
it	O
flew	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
generally	O
did	O
so	O

I	O
can	O
not	O
say	O
but	O
this	O
method	O
of	O
attacking	O
us	O
,	O
by	O
a	O
way	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
notion	O
of	O
,	O
might	O
give	O
us	O
at	O
first	O
some	O
little	O
surprise	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
number	O
was	O
so	O
great	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
altogether	O
without	O
apprehensions	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
unluckily	O
set	O
our	O
ship	O
on	O

so	O
that	O
William	O
resolved	O
immediately	O
to	O
row	O
on	O

and	O
persuade	O
us	O
all	O
to	O
weigh	O
and	O
stand	O
out	O
to	O
sea	O
;	O
but	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
time	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
immediately	O
let	O
fly	O
a	O
volley	O
at	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
from	O
all	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
vast	O
crowd	O
of	O
people	O
which	O
stood	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O

Nor	O
did	O
they	O
fire	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
may	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
all	O
at	O
once	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
leave	O
off	O
;	O
but	O
their	O
arrows	O
being	O
soon	O
notched	O
upon	O
their	O
bows	O
,	O
they	O
kept	O
continually	O
shooting	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
air	O
was	O
full	O
of	O
flame	O
.	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
say	O
whether	O
they	O
set	O
their	O
cotton	O
rag	O
on	O
fire	O
before	O
they	O
shot	O
the	O
arrow	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
perceive	O
they	O
had	O
fire	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
they	O
had	O
.	O

The	O
arrow	O
,	O
besides	O
the	O
fire	O
it	O
carried	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
had	O
a	O
head	O
,	O
or	O
a	O
peg	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
of	O
bone	O
;	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
sharp	O
flint	O
stone	O
;	O
and	O
some	O
few	O
of	O
a	O
metal	O
,	O
too	O
soft	O
in	O
itself	O
for	O
metal	O
,	O
but	O
hard	O
enough	O
to	O
cause	O
it	O
to	O
enter	O

it	O
were	O
a	O

so	O

to	O

William	O
and	O
his	O
men	O
had	O
notice	O
sufficient	O
to	O
lie	O
close	O
behind	O
their	O
waste-boards	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
for	O
this	O
very	O
purpose	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
made	O
so	O
high	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
easily	O
sink	O
themselves	O
behind	O
them	O
,	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
defend	O
themselves	O
from	O
anything	O
that	O
came	O
point-blank	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
we	O
call	O
it	O
-RRB-	O
or	O
upon	O
a	O
line	O
;	O
but	O
for	O
what	O
might	O
fall	O
perpendicularly	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
air	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
guard	O
,	O
but	O
took	O
the	O
hazard	O
of	O
that	O
.	O

At	O
first	O
they	O
made	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
row	O
away	O
,	O
but	O
before	O
they	O
went	O
they	O
gave	O
a	O
volley	O
of	O
their	O
fire-arms	O
,	O
firing	O
at	O
those	O
which	O
stood	O
with	O
the	O
Dutchman	O
;	O
but	O
William	O
ordered	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
to	O
take	O
their	O
aim	O
at	O
others	O
,	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
miss	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
did	O
so	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
no	O
calling	O
to	O
them	O
now	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
noise	O
was	O
so	O
great	O
among	O
them	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
hear	O
nobody	O
,	O
but	O
our	O
men	O
boldly	O
rowed	O
in	O
nearer	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
at	O
first	O
driven	O
a	O
little	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
nearer	O
,	O
they	O
fired	O
a	O
second	O
volley	O
,	O
which	O
put	O
the	O
fellows	O
into	O
great	O
confusion	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
from	O
the	O
ship	O
that	O
several	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
killed	O
or	O
wounded	O
.	O

We	O
thought	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
unequal	O
fight	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
we	O
made	O
a	O
signal	O
to	O
our	O
men	O
to	O
row	O
away	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
a	O
little	O
of	O
the	O
sport	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
they	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
arrows	O
flew	O
so	O
thick	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
being	O
so	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
sit	O
to	O
their	O
oars	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
spread	O
a	O
little	O
of	O
their	O
sail	O
,	O
thinking	O
they	O
might	O
sail	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
lie	O
behind	O
their	O
waste-board	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
sail	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
spread	O
six	O
minutes	O
till	O
it	O
had	O
five	O
hundred	O
fire-arrows	O
shot	O
into	O
it	O
and	O
through	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
length	O
set	O
it	O
fairly	O
on	O
fire	O
;	O
nor	O
were	O
our	O
men	O
quite	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
danger	O
of	O
its	O
setting	O
the	O
boat	O
on	O
fire	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
made	O
them	O
paddle	O
and	O
shove	O
the	O
boat	O
away	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
lay	O
,	O
to	O
get	O
farther	O
off	O
.	O

By	O
this	O
time	O
they	O
had	O
left	O
us	O
a	O
fair	O
mark	O
at	O
the	O
whole	O
savage	O
army	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
sheered	O
the	O
ship	O
as	O
near	O
to	O
them	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
we	O
fired	O
among	O
the	O
thickest	O
of	O
them	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
times	O
,	O
five	O
guns	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
,	O
with	O
shot	O
,	O
old	O
iron	O
,	O
musket-bullets	O
,	O
&	O
c	O
.	O

We	O
could	O
easily	O
see	O
that	O
we	O
made	O
havoc	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
killed	O
and	O
wounded	O
abundance	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
surprise	O
at	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
yet	O
they	O
never	O
offered	O
to	O
stir	O

and	O
all	O
this	O
while	O
their	O
fire-arrows	O
flew	O
as	O
thick	O
as	O
before	O

At	O
last	O
,	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
their	O
arrows	O
stopped	O

the	O
old	O

general	O

with	O

The	O

When	O
they	O
were	O

before	O
him	O

he	O
demanded	O
who	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
long	O
they	O

They	O
told	O

not	O

His	O
answer	O
was	O

that	O
the	O

was	O
glad	O
to	O
hear	O
the	O
English	O
were	O
come	O

him	O

them	O
as	O
they	O
should	O
desire	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
sent	O
a	O
letter	O
to	O
be	O

none	O

the	O
captain	O
himself	O

They	O
were	O
then	O
twelve	O
miles	O
from	O
the	O

therefore	O
replied	O

that	O
the	O
captain	O
could	O
not	O
leave	O
his	O
ship	O
to	O
come	O
so	O
far	O
;	O
but	O
if	O
he	O
pleased	O
to	O
go	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
seaside	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
would	O
wait	O
on	O
him	O
to	O
receive	O
the	O
letter	O
;	O
whereupon	O
the	O
dissauva	O
desired	O
them	O
to	O
stay	O
that	O
day	O

and	O
on	O
the	O

he	O
would	O
go	O

which	O
,	O
rather	O
than	O
displease	O
him	O
in	O
so	O
small	O
a	O
matter	O
,	O
they	O
consented	O
to	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
the	O
dissauva	O
sent	O

him	O
in	O
the	O

who	O
told	O
him	O
withal	O
that	O
his	O
men	O
were	O
coming	O
down	O
with	O
the	O
dissauva	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
his	O
company	O
on	O
shore	O
against	O
his	O
coming	O
,	O
having	O
a	O
letter	O
from	O
the	O
king	O
to	O
deliver	O
into	O
his	O

The	O
captain	O
,	O
mistrusting	O
nothing	O
,	O
came	O
on	O
shore	O
with	O
his	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
sitting	O
under	O
a	O
tamarind	O
tree	O

waited	O
for	O
the	O
dissauva	O

In	O
the	O

the	O
native	O
soldiers	O
privately	O
surrounded	O
him	O
and	O
the	O
seven	O
men	O
he	O
had	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
seizing	O
them	O

carried	O
them	O
to	O

the	O
dissauva	O
,	O
bearing	O
the	O

on	O
a	O

The	O

the	O
long-boat	O

not	O
knowing	O
what	O
had	O
happened	O

came	O
on	O

to	O
cut	O
down	O
a	O
tree	O
to	O
make	O
cheeks	O
for	O
the	O
mainmast	O

and	O
were	O
made	O
prisoners	O
after	O
the	O

manner	O
,	O
though	O
with	O
more	O
violence	O
,	O
because	O
they	O
were	O
more	O
rough	O
with	O
them	O

and	O
made	O
resistance	O
;	O
yet	O
they	O
were	O
not	O

the	O

The	O

two	O

eighteen	O

his	O

care	O
was	O
to	O
gain	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
and	O
to	O
that	O
end	O
,	O
telling	O
the	O
captain	O
that	O
he	O
and	O
his	O
men	O
were	O
only	O
detained	O
because	O
the	O
king	O
intended	O
to	O
send	O
letters	O
and	O
a	O
present	O
to	O
the	O
English	O
nation	O
by	O
him	O

desired	O
he	O
would	O
send	O
some	O
men	O
on	O
board	O
his	O
ship	O
to	O
order	O
her	O
to	O
stay	O
;	O
and	O
because	O
the	O

was	O
in	O
danger	O
of	O

fired	O
by	O
the	O
Dutch	O
if	O

The	O

did	O
not	O
approve	O
of	O
the	O
advice	O

but	O
did	O
not	O
dare	O
to	O
own	O
his	O

so	O
he	O
sent	O
his	O

with	O
a	O

doubted	O
but	O
what	O
they	O
did	O
was	O
upon	O
the	O
account	O
of	O
trade	O

because	O
Mr	O

be	O
supposed	O
to	O

towards	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

knowing	O
very	O
little	O
of	O
the	O
ways	O

which	O
were	O
generally	O
intricate	O
and	O
perplexed	O
,	O
because	O
they	O
have	O
no	O

a	O
multitude	O
of	O
little	O
paths	O
from	O

those	O
often	O
changing	O
;	O

for	O
white	O
men	O
to	O
inquire	O
about	O
the	O

was	O
very	O
dangerous	O

because	O
the	O
people	O
would	O
presently	O
suspect	O
their	O

At	O
this	O
time	O
they	O
travelled	O
from	O

about	O
three	O

They	O
were	O
very	O
thankful	O
to	O
Providence	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
passed	O
all	O

yet	O
they	O
durst	O
not	O

they	O
had	O
no	O

it	O

the	O

had	O
been	O
absent	O

would	O
come	O

them	O
to	O

for	O
them	O

they	O
returned	O

went	O
eight	O

ten	O
times	O
into	O
those	O
parts	O
with	O
their	O

till	O
they	O
became	O

with	O

In	O
these	O

Mr	O

met	O
his	O

turned	O
away	O

now	O
got	O
a	O

was	O
very	O
poor	O

being	O
acquainted	O
with	O
these	O

he	O
not	O

for	O

gladly	O

Mr	O

by	O
a	O
grievous	O

which	O
seized	O
him	O
on	O

held	O
him	O
five	O

that	O

up	O
eight	O

sat	O
down	O

they	O

This	O
greatly	O
distressed	O
them	O

because	O
he	O

easily	O
suspect	O
they	O
were	O
out	O

their	O

being	O
captives	O

however	O
,	O
they	O
went	O
resolutely	O
to	O
his	O

meeting	O
him	O

with	O

The	O
governor	O
did	O
not	O

them	O

told	O
them	O
he	O
was	O
sorry	O
they	O
came	O
in	O
so	O
dry	O
a	O
time	O

when	O
no	O

if	O
some	O

he	O
would	O

This	O
answer	O
pleased	O
them	O

they	O
seemed	O

accordingly	O

with	O
him	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O

and	O
no	O

they	O
presented	O
the	O

with	O
five	O

six	O
charges	O
of	O

which	O
is	O

they	O

Here	O
also	O
they	O
were	O
put	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
fright	O
by	O
the	O
coming	O
of	O
certain	O
soldiers	O
from	O
the	O

to	O
the	O

to	O
give	O
him	O

God	O
so	O
ordered	O
it	O
that	O
they	O

them	O

We	O

we	O
stood	O
away	O

we	O
were	O
very	O

we	O

we	O

it	O

that	O

it	O
was	O

we	O

on	O
the	O

it	O

in	O

The	O

way	O

out	O

when	O
William	O

I	O
called	O
a	O

as	O
we	O

upon	O

that	O

with	O

this	O
with	O
the	O
more	O
caution	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
as	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
suspected	O
,	O
we	O
agreed	O
to	O
take	O
out	O
all	O

William	O

a	O
ready-witted	O

that	O

a	O
pilot	O
upon	O
the	O

New	PNM
England	PNM
,	O
and	O
was	O
an	O
excellent	O

;	O
these	O

William	O
dressed	O
up	O

two	O

The	O

the	O

I	O
should	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
have	O
observed	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
went	O
,	O
some	O
days	O
before	O
we	O
parted	O
,	O
to	O
a	O
small	O
sandy	O
island	O
close	O
under	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
where	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
cove	O
of	O
deep	O
water	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
road	O
,	O
and	O
out	O
of	O

of	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
factories	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
here	O
very	O
thick	O
upon	O
the	O
coast	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
shifted	O
the	O
loading	O
of	O
the	O
sloop	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
into	O
her	O
such	O
things	O
only	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
mind	O
to	O
dispose	O
of	O
there	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
indeed	O
little	O
but	O
nutmegs	O
and	O
cloves	O
,	O
but	O
chiefly	O
the	O
former	O
;	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
William	O
and	O
his	O
two	O
Quakers	O
,	O
with	O
about	O
eighteen	O
men	O
in	O
the	O
sloop	O
,	O
went	O
away	O
to	O
Surat	PNM
,	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
factory	O
.	O

William	O
used	O
such	O
caution	O
that	O
he	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
himself	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
doctor	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
called	O
him	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
boat	O
which	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
them	O
to	O
sell	O
fish	O
,	O
rowed	O
with	O
only	O
Indians	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
which	O
boat	O
he	O
afterwards	O
hired	O
to	O
carry	O
him	O
on	O
board	O
again	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
long	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
get	O
acquaintance	O
with	O
some	O
Englishmen	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
lived	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
were	O
the	O
company	O
's	O
servants	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
yet	O
appeared	O
then	O
to	O
be	O
traders	O
for	O
themselves	O
,	O
in	O
whatever	O
coast	O
business	O
especially	O
came	O
in	O
their	O
way	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
doctor	O
was	O
made	O
the	O
first	O
to	O
pick	O
acquaintance	O
;	O
so	O
he	O
recommended	O
his	O
friend	O
,	O
the	O
supercargo	O
,	O
till	O
,	O
by	O
degrees	O
,	O
the	O
merchants	O
were	O
as	O
fond	O
of	O
the	O
bargain	O
as	O
our	O
men	O
were	O
of	O
the	O
merchants	O
,	O
only	O
that	O
the	O
cargo	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
too	O
much	O
for	O
them	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
this	O
did	O
not	O
prove	O
a	O
difficulty	O
long	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
they	O
brought	O
two	O
more	O
merchants	O
,	O
English	O
also	O
,	O
into	O
their	O
bargain	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
William	O
could	O
perceive	O
by	O
their	O
discourse	O
,	O
they	O
resolved	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
bought	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
carry	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
Gulf	PNM
of	PNM
Persia	PNM
upon	O
their	O
own	O
accounts	O
.	O

William	O
took	O
the	O
hint	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
afterwards	O
,	O
concluded	O
we	O
might	O
carry	O
them	O
there	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
they	O
.	O

But	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
William	O
's	O
present	O
business	O
;	O
he	O
had	O
here	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
three-and-thirty	O
ton	O
of	O
nuts	O
and	O
eighteen	O
ton	O
of	O
cloves	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
quantity	O
of	O
mace	O
among	O
the	O
nutmegs	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
stand	O
to	O
make	O
much	O
allowance	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
they	O
bargained	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
merchants	O
,	O
who	O
would	O
gladly	O
have	O
bought	O
sloop	O
and	O
all	O
,	O
gave	O
William	O
directions	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
men	O
for	O
pilots	O
,	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
a	O
creek	O
about	O
six	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
factory	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
brought	O
boats	O
,	O
and	O
unloaded	O
the	O
whole	O
cargo	O
,	O
and	O
paid	O
William	O
very	O
honestly	O
for	O
it	O
;	O
the	O
whole	O
parcel	O
amounting	O
,	O
in	O
money	O
,	O
to	O
about	O
thirty-five	O
thousand	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
,	O
besides	O
some	O
goods	O
of	O
value	O
,	O
which	O
William	O
was	O
content	O
to	O
take	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
large	O
diamonds	O
,	O
worth	O
about	O
three	O
hundred	O
pounds	O
sterling	O

When	O
they	O
paid	O
the	O
money	O
,	O
William	O
invited	O
them	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
sloop	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
came	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
merry	O
old	O
Quaker	O
diverted	O
them	O
exceedingly	O
with	O
his	O

and	O
``	O

them	O

``	O

them	O
till	O
he	O

them	O
so	O
drunk	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
for	O
that	O
night	O

They	O
would	O
fain	O
have	O
known	O
who	O
our	O
people	O
were	O

and	O
whence	O
they	O
came	O
;	O
but	O
not	O
a	O

in	O
the	O

would	O
answer	O
them	O
to	O
any	O

they	O

a	O

twice	O

He	O
ordered	O

William	O
was	O
always	O
the	O
lucky	O

to	O
us	O

never	O
more	O

now	O
;	O
for	O
where	O
we	O
had	O
thrust	O
in	O

we	O
could	O
get	O
nothing	O

a	O

our	O

and	O
indeed	O
our	O

's	O
patience	O
was	O
almost	O

for	O
it	O
was	O
seventeen	O
days	O
that	O
William	O
spent	O
upon	O
this	O
enterprise	O

and	O
well	O

too	O

When	O
he	O
came	O
back	O
we	O
had	O
another	O
conference	O
upon	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
trade	O

namely	O
,	O
whether	O
we	O
should	O
send	O
the	O

and	O
other	O
goods	O
we	O
had	O
in	O
the	O

to	O
Surat	PNM

or	O
whether	O
we	O
should	O
go	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
Gulf	PNM
of	PNM
Persia	PNM
ourselves	O
,	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
probable	O
we	O
might	O
sell	O
them	O
as	O

the	O

of	O
Surat	PNM

William	O
was	O
for	O
going	O
ourselves	O

which	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
was	O
from	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
man	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
for	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
everything	O
;	O
but	O
here	O
I	O
overruled	O
William	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
very	O
seldom	O
took	O
upon	O
me	O
to	O
do	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
considering	O
our	O
circumstances	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
much	O
better	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
sell	O
all	O
our	O
cargoes	O
here	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
made	O
but	O
half-price	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
than	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
Gulf	PNM
of	PNM
Persia	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
should	O
run	O
a	O
greater	O
risk	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
people	O
would	O
be	O
much	O
more	O
curious	O
and	O
inquisitive	O
into	O
things	O
than	O
they	O
were	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
so	O
easy	O
to	O
manage	O
them	O
,	O
seeing	O
they	O
traded	O
freely	O
and	O
openly	O
there	O
,	O
not	O
by	O
stealth	O
,	O
as	O
those	O
men	O
seemed	O
to	O
do	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
besides	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
suspected	O
anything	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
much	O
more	O
difficult	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
retreat	O
,	O
except	O
by	O
mere	O
force	O
,	O
than	O
here	O

where	O
we	O
were	O
upon	O
the	O
high	O

as	O
it	O

could	O
be	O
gone	O

none	O

My	O
apprehensions	O
prevailed	O
with	O
William	O
,	O
whether	O
my	O
reasons	O
did	O
or	O
no	O

he	O
submitted	O

another	O

The	O
main	O

was	O
to	O

to	O

off	O
that	O

an	O

to	O

up	O

in	O

before	O
with	O
a	O

sailed	O
now	O

so	O
that	O

in	O

this	O

and	O
in	O
about	O
twenty	O

for	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
other	O
goods	O

he	O
brought	O
us	O
back	O
about	O
three-and-thirty	O

not	O

it	O
seems	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
a	O
novelty	O
there	O
as	O
we	O
believed	O

for	O

which	O
I	O
had	O
on	O

in	O

we	O
had	O
indeed	O
an	O

two	O

indeed	O
I	O
began	O

very	O

sometimes	O
thinking	O
he	O

that	O

the	O

to	O

with	O
him	O

they	O
were	O
gone	O
away	O
together	O

it	O
was	O
but	O
three	O
days	O
before	O
his	O
return	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
just	O
upon	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
resolving	O
to	O
go	O
away	O
to	O
Madagascar	PNM

and	O
give	O
him	O
over	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
old	O
surgeon	O

who	O
mimicked	O
the	O
Quaker	O
and	O
passed	O
for	O
the	O
master	O
of	O
the	O
sloop	O
at	O
Surat	PNM
,	O
persuaded	O
me	O
against	O
that	O
,	O
for	O
which	O
good	O
advice	O
and	O
apparent	O
faithfulness	O
in	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
trusted	O
with	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
him	O
a	O
party	O
to	O
my	O
design	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
proved	O
very	O
honest	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
William	O
came	O
back	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
inexpressible	O
joy	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
necessary	O
things	O
with	O
him	O
;	O
as	O
,	O
particularly	O
,	O
he	O
brought	O
sixty	O
barrels	O
of	O
powder	O
,	O
some	O
iron	O
shot	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
thirty	O
ton	O
of	O
lead	O
;	O
also	O
he	O
brought	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
provisions	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
William	O
gave	O
me	O
a	O
public	O
account	O
of	O
his	O
voyage	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
hearing	O
of	O
whoever	O
happened	O
to	O
be	O
upon	O
the	O
quarter-deck	O
,	O
that	O
no	O
suspicions	O
might	O
be	O
found	O
about	O
us	O
.	O

After	O
all	O
was	O
done	O
,	O
William	O
moved	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
go	O
up	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
with	O
him	O
;	O
named	O
several	O
things	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
on	O
board	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
sell	O
there	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
particularly	O
,	O
told	O
us	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
obliged	O
to	O
leave	O
several	O
things	O
there	O
,	O
the	O
caravans	O
being	O
not	O
come	O
in	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
engaged	O
to	O
come	O
back	O
again	O
with	O
goods	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
what	O
I	O
wanted	O
.	O

The	O
men	O
were	O
eager	O
for	O
his	O
going	O
,	O
and	O
particularly	O
because	O
he	O
told	O
them	O
they	O
might	O
load	O
the	O
sloop	O
back	O
with	O
rice	O
and	O
provisions	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
seemed	O
backward	O
to	O
going	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
old	O
surgeon	O
stood	O
up	O
and	O
persuaded	O
me	O
to	O
go	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
many	O
arguments	O
pressed	O
me	O
to	O
it	O
;	O
as	O
,	O
particularly	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
go	O
,	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
no	O
order	O
,	O
and	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
might	O
drop	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
betray	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
not	O
think	O
it	O
safe	O
for	O
the	O
sloop	O
to	O
go	O
again	O
if	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
go	O
;	O
and	O
to	O
urge	O
me	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
he	O
offered	O
himself	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
me	O
.	O

Upon	O
these	O
considerations	O
I	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
over-persuaded	O
to	O
go	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
company	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
better	O
satisfied	O
when	O
I	O
had	O
consented	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
accordingly	O
,	O
we	O
took	O
all	O
the	O
powder	O
,	O
lead	O
,	O
and	O
iron	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
sloop	O
into	O
the	O
great	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
other	O
things	O
that	O
were	O
for	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
use	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
in	O
some	O
bales	O
of	O
spices	O
and	O
casks	O
or	O
frails	O
of	O
cloves	O
,	O
in	O
all	O
about	O
seven	O
ton	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
other	O
goods	O
,	O
among	O
the	O
bales	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
conveyed	O
all	O
my	O
private	O
treasure	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
I	O
assure	O
you	O
,	O
was	O
of	O
no	O
small	O
value	O
,	O
and	O
away	O
I	O
went	O
.	O

At	O
going	O
off	O
I	O
called	O
a	O
council	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
officers	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
to	O
consider	O
in	O
what	O
place	O
they	O
should	O
wait	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
long	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
appointed	O
the	O
ship	O
to	O
stay	O
eight-and-twenty	O
days	O
at	O
a	O
little	O
island	O
on	O
the	O
Arabian	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
Gulf	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
sloop	O
did	O
not	O
come	O
in	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
they	O
should	O
sail	O
to	O
another	O
island	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
of	O
that	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
wait	O
there	O
fifteen	O
days	O
more	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
then	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
sloop	O
did	O
not	O
come	O

they	O
should	O
conclude	O
some	O

have	O
happened	O

and	O
the	O
rendezvous	O
should	O
be	O
at	O

Being	O
thus	O
resolved	O

we	O
left	O

both	O
William	O

I	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
surgeon	O

never	O
intended	O
to	O
see	O
any	O

We	O
steered	O
directly	O
for	O
the	O
Gulf	O

through	O
to	O
Bassorah	PNM

Balsara	PNM

ill	O
acquainted	O
with	O
it	O

having	O
but	O
an	O
ordinary	O

we	O
went	O
on	O

at	O
a	O
village	O
where	O
some	O
merchants	O
live	O

and	O
which	O
is	O

for	O
the	O

the	O
dusk	O

for	O

very	O
good	O

It	O
is	O
not	O
material	O
to	O
record	O
here	O
what	O
a	O
mass	O
of	O

together	O

it	O
will	O
be	O
more	O
to	O
the	O
purpose	O
to	O
tell	O
you	O
that	O
I	O
began	O

very	O
little	O
satisfaction	O
in	O

,	O
as	O
I	O
told	O

I	O

no	O
expectation	O

,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
to	O
him	O
one	O
day	O
walking	O
out	O
into	O
the	O
fields	O
near	O
the	O
town	O
of	O
Bassorah	PNM
,	O
so	O
I	O
depended	O

that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
the	O
case	O
,	O
which	O
you	O
will	O

We	O
were	O
perfectly	O
secured	O
at	O
Bassorah	PNM
,	O
by	O
having	O
frighted	O
away	O
the	O
rogues	O
,	O
our	O
comrades	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O

to	O
consider	O
how	O
to	O
convert	O
our	O
treasure	O
into	O
things	O
proper	O
to	O
make	O
us	O
look	O
like	O

as	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
to	O

,	O
and	O
not	O
like	O
freebooters	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
really	O
had	O
been	O

We	O
happened	O
very	O
opportunely	O
here	O
upon	O
a	O
Dutchman	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
travelled	O
from	O
Bengal	PNM
to	O
Agra	PNM
,	O
the	O
capital	O
city	O
of	O
the	O
Great	PNM
Mogul	PNM
,	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
was	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Malabar	PNM
by	O
land	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
shipping	O
,	O
somehow	O
or	O
other	O
,	O
up	O
the	O
Gulf	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
his	O
design	O
was	O
to	O
go	O
up	O
the	O
great	O
river	O
to	O
Bagdad	PNM
or	O
Babylon	PNM
,	O
and	O
so	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
caravan	O
,	O
to	O
Aleppo	PNM
and	O
Scanderoon	O

As	O
William	O
spoke	O
Dutch	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
of	O
an	O
agreeable	O
,	O
insinuating	O
behaviour	O
,	O
he	O
soon	O
got	O
acquainted	O
with	O
this	O
Dutchman	O
,	O
and	O
discovering	O
our	O
circumstances	O
to	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
he	O
had	O
considerable	O
effects	O
with	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
traded	O
long	O
in	O
that	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
making	O
homeward	O
to	O
his	O
own	O
country	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
servants	O
with	O
him	O
;	O
one	O
an	O
Armenian	O
,	O
whom	O
he	O
had	O
taught	O
to	O
speak	O
Dutch	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
had	O
something	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
,	O
but	O
had	O
a	O
mind	O
to	O
travel	O
into	O
Europe	PNM
;	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
a	O
Dutch	O
sailor	O
,	O
whom	O
he	O
had	O
picked	O
up	O
by	O
his	O

and	O
reposed	O
a	O
great	O
trust	O
in	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
very	O
honest	O
fellow	O
he	O
was	O
.	O

This	O
Dutchman	O
was	O
very	O
glad	O
of	O
an	O
acquaintance	O
,	O
because	O
he	O
soon	O
found	O
that	O
we	O
directed	O
our	O
thoughts	O
to	O
Europe	PNM
also	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
he	O
found	O
we	O
were	O
encumbered	O
with	O
goods	O
only	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
we	O
let	O
him	O
know	O
nothing	O
of	O
our	O
money	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
he	O
readily	O
offered	O
us	O
his	O
assistance	O
to	O
dispose	O
of	O
as	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
as	O
the	O
place	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
would	O
put	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
advice	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
the	O
rest	O
.	O

While	O
this	O
was	O
doing	O
,	O
William	O
and	O
I	O
consulted	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
ourselves	O
and	O
what	O
we	O
had	O
;	O
and	O
first	O
,	O
we	O
resolved	O
we	O
would	O
never	O
talk	O
seriously	O
of	O
our	O
measures	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
open	O
fields	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
sure	O
nobody	O
could	O
hear	O
;	O
so	O
every	O
evening	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
sun	O
began	O
to	O
decline	O
and	O
the	O
air	O
to	O
be	O
moderate	O
we	O
walked	O
out	O
,	O
sometimes	O
this	O
way	O
,	O
sometimes	O
that	O
,	O
to	O
consult	O
of	O
our	O
affairs	O
.	O

I	O
should	O
have	O
observed	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
new	O
clothed	O
ourselves	O
here	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
Persian	O
manner	O
,	O
with	O
long	O
vests	O
of	O
silk	O
,	O
a	O
gown	O
or	O
robe	O
of	O
English	PNM
crimson	O
cloth	O
,	O
very	O
fine	O
and	O
handsome	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
let	O
our	O
beards	O
grow	O
so	O
after	O
the	O
Persian	O
manner	O
that	O
we	O
passed	O
for	O
Persian	PNM
merchants	O
,	O
in	O
view	O
only	O
,	O
though	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
understand	O
or	O
speak	O
one	O
word	O
of	O
the	O
language	O
of	O
Persia	PNM
,	O
or	O
indeed	O
of	O
any	O
other	O
but	O
English	O
and	O
Dutch	O
;	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
latter	O
I	O
understood	O
very	O
little	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
Dutchman	O
supplied	O
all	O
this	O
for	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
resolved	O
to	O
keep	O
ourselves	O
as	O
retired	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
though	O
there	O
were	O
several	O
English	O
merchants	O
upon	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
never	O
acquainted	O
ourselves	O
with	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
or	O
exchanged	O
a	O
word	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
by	O
which	O
means	O
we	O
prevented	O
their	O
inquiry	O
of	O
us	O
now	O
,	O
or	O
their	O
giving	O
any	O
intelligence	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
if	O
any	O
news	O
of	O
our	O
landing	O
here	O
should	O
happen	O
to	O
come	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
easy	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
know	O
,	O
was	O
possible	O
enough	O
,	O
if	O
any	O
of	O
our	O
comrades	O
fell	O
into	O
bad	O
hands	O
,	O
or	O
by	O
many	O
accidents	O
which	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
foresee	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
during	O
my	O
being	O
here	O
,	O
for	O
here	O
we	O
stayed	O
near	O
two	O
months	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
grew	O
very	O
thoughtful	O
about	O
my	O
circumstances	O
;	O
not	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
danger	O
,	O
neither	O
indeed	O
were	O
we	O
in	O
any	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
entirely	O
concealed	O
and	O
unsuspected	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
really	O
began	O
to	O
have	O
other	O
thoughts	O
of	O
myself	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
than	O
ever	O
I	O
had	O
before	O

William	O
had	O
struck	O
so	O
deep	O
into	O
my	O
unthinking	O
temper	O
with	O
hinting	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
something	O
beyond	O
all	O
this	O
;	O
that	O
the	O
present	O
time	O
was	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
enjoyment	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
account	O
approached	O
;	O
that	O
the	O
work	O
that	O
remained	O
was	O
gentler	O
than	O
the	O
labour	O
past	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
repentance	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
high	O
time	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
--	O
I	O
say	O
these	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
thoughts	O
as	O
these	O
,	O
engrossed	O
my	O
hours	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
I	O
grew	O
very	O
sad	O

As	O
to	O
the	O
wealth	O
I	O
had	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
immensely	O
great	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
all	O
like	O
dirt	O
under	O

I	O
had	O
no	O
value	O
for	O

no	O
peace	O
in	O
the	O
possession	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
no	O
great	O
concern	O
about	O
me	O
for	O
the	O
leaving	O
of	O
it	O

William	O
had	O
perceived	O
my	O
thoughts	O
to	O
be	O
troubled	O
and	O
my	O
mind	O
heavy	O
and	O
oppressed	O
for	O
some	O
time	O

and	O
one	O
evening	O
,	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
cool	O

I	O
began	O
with	O
him	O
about	O
the	O
leaving	O
our	O

William	O
was	O
a	O
wise	O
and	O
wary	O
man	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
all	O
the	O
prudentials	O
of	O
my	O
conduct	O
had	O
for	O
a	O
long	O

been	O
owing	O
to	O
his	O

all	O
the	O

our	O

even	O
ourselves	O

lay	O
upon	O
him	O

and	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
telling	O
me	O
of	O
some	O
of	O
the	O

he	O
had	O
been	O
taking	O
for	O
our	O

for	O
the	O

This	O
resolution	O
of	O
William	O
was	O
very	O
satisfying	O
to	O
me	O
indeed	O

as	O

the	O

,	O
all	O
he	O

at	O

were	O
,	O
quieted	O
my	O
mind	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
verily	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
so	O
alarmed	O
at	O
the	O
just	O
reason	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
expect	O
vengeance	O
from	O
Heaven	O
upon	O
me	O
for	O
my	O
ill-gotten	O
wealth	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
should	O

run	O
away	O
from	O
it	O

nothing	O

was	O
in	O
certain	O
danger	O

However	O
,	O
William	O
settled	O
my	O
mind	O
to	O
more	O
prudent	O
steps	O
than	O
these	O
,	O

I	O
concluded	O
that	O

to	O
proceed	O

But	O
this	O
I	O
must	O
leave	O
upon	O
record	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
from	O
this	O
time	O
no	O
joy	O
of	O
the	O
wealth	O
I	O
had	O
got	O
.	O

I	O
looked	O
upon	O
it	O
all	O
as	O
stolen	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
indeed	O
the	O
greatest	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
was	O
.	O

I	O
looked	O
upon	O
it	O
as	O
a	O
hoard	O
of	O
other	O
men	O
's	O
goods	O

which	O
I	O
had	O
robbed	O

which	O
I	O
ought	O

to	O

damned	O
for	O

And	O
now	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
sincerely	O
to	O
hate	O
myself	O
for	O
a	O
dog	O

a	O

was	O

for	O

though	O
I	O
had	O
the	O

yet	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
I	O
should	O
ever	O
make	O
any	O

upon	O
this	O

sincere	O
without	O

William	O

with	O

entered	O
upon	O
a	O

me	O
about	O
the	O
nature	O

about	O
repentance	O

that	O
it	O

indeed	O

with	O
a	O
deep	O
abhorrence	O
of	O

that	O
I	O
had	O
to	O

myself	O
with	O

that	O
to	O
despair	O
of	O
God	O
's	O
mercy	O
was	O
no	O
part	O
of	O
repentance	O
,	O
but	O
putting	O
myself	O
into	O
the	O
condition	O
of	O
the	O
devil	O
;	O
indeed	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
must	O
apply	O
myself	O
with	O
a	O
sincere	O
,	O
humble	O
confession	O
of	O
my	O
crime	O
,	O
to	O
ask	O
pardon	O
of	O
God	O

whom	O
I	O
had	O
offended	O
,	O
and	O
cast	O
myself	O
upon	O
His	O
mercy	O

resolving	O
to	O

restitution	O

if	O

it	O
in	O

even	O
to	O
the	O
utmost	O
of	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
world	O

And	O
this	O
,	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
was	O
the	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
satisfaction	O
in	O
William	O
's	O
discourse	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
quieted	O
me	O
very	O
much	O
;	O

William	O
was	O
very	O
anxious	O
ever	O
after	O
about	O
my	O
talking	O
in	O
my	O
sleep	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
care	O
to	O
lie	O
with	O
me	O
always	O
himself	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
keep	O
me	O
from	O

in	O
any	O

where	O
so	O

as	O
a	O

However	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
like	O

afterward	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
much	O
more	O
composed	O
in	O
my	O
mind	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
for	O
the	O
future	O
to	O
live	O
a	O
quite	O
different	O
life	O
from	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
.	O

As	O
to	O
the	O
wealth	O
I	O
had	O
,	O
I	O
looked	O
upon	O
it	O
as	O
nothing	O
;	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
set	O
it	O
apart	O
to	O
any	O
such	O
opportunity	O
of	O
doing	O
justice	O
as	O
God	O
should	O
put	O
into	O
my	O
hand	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
miraculous	O
opportunity	O
I	O
had	O
afterwards	O
of	O
applying	O
some	O
parts	O
of	O
it	O
to	O
preserve	O
a	O
ruined	O
family	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O

With	O
these	O

I	O
began	O
to	O

to	O
some	O
degree	O
of	O
quiet	O
in	O

almost	O
three	O

we	O
hired	O

went	O
up	O

on	O
the	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
very	O
considerable	O

with	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
made	O
a	O
great	O
figure	O
there	O

were	O
received	O

We	O

sundry	O

we	O

seventy	O

We	O
were	O

the	O
Dutchman	O
advised	O
us	O
not	O

told	O

get	O
a	O

at	O
Aleppo	PNM

or	O
in	O

we	O

we	O

sold	O

,	O
indeed	O

I	O

But	O
,	O
as	O
I	O

I	O

and	O
in	O
about	O
nine-and-fifty	O

the	O

what	O

here	O

William	O

which	O

It	O
is	O

wisely	O
in	O
it	O
not	O

we	O

but	O
we	O
took	O
our	O

how	O
to	O

to	O
him	O
in	O
Holland	PNM

that	O
we	O
might	O

we	O

in	O

as	O
we	O

by	O

of	O
the	O
Persian	O

Armenian	O
jargon	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
talked	O
at	O
Bassorah	PNM

and	O
everywhere	O
that	O
we	O
came	O
in	O
the	O

of	O
our	O

it	O
will	O
appear	O
incredible	O

and	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
greatest	O
difficulty	O
in	O
the	O

how	O
to	O
conceal	O
it	O

being	O

in	O

for	O

At	O
length	O
William	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
think	O
now	O
that	O
he	O
must	O
never	O
see	O
England	PNM
any	O
more	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
indeed	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
much	O
concern	O
himself	O
about	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
seeing	O
we	O
had	O
gained	O
so	O
great	O
wealth	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
had	O
some	O
poor	O
relations	O
in	O
England	PNM
,	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
willing	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
write	O
to	O
know	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
living	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
condition	O
they	O
were	O
in	O

and	O
if	O
he	O
found	O
such	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
alive	O

I	O
consented	O

accordingly	O
William	O
wrote	O
to	O
a	O
sister	O

an	O
uncle	O

and	O
in	O
about	O
five	O

received	O
