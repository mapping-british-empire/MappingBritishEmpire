My	O

that	O

the	O

therefore	O

I	O

appointed	O

I	O
come	O

by	O

we	O

which	O
I	O
suppose	O
the	O

143	O
their	O
setting	O
upon	O

They	O
said	O
it	O

to	O
no	O

for	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
their	O

that	O

,	O
which	O
being	O
a	O

they	O
had	O

We	O
had	O
not	O
gone	O
above	O
half	O
a	O
League	O
onward	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
heard	O
dreadful	O
Shouting	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
looking	O
behind	O
us	O
,	O
it	O
being	O
a	O
strait	O
Road	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
perceive	O
a	O
Cloud	O
of	O
Dull	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Indians	O
running	O
full	O
Speed	O
toward	O
us	O

Upon	O
which	O
we	O
put	O
down	O
our	O
two	O
wounded	O
men	O
that	O
were	O
on	O
Horseback	O
,	O
and	O
mounted	O
upon	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
spare	O
Horses	O
.	O

Now	O
we	O
being	O
nineteen	O
Horsemen	O
,	O
resolved	O
to	O
island	O
it	O
:	O
We	O
divided	O
into	O
Ranks	O
,	O
four	O
in	O
a	O
Rank	O

which	O
made	O
five	O
Ranks	O
;	O
only	O
there	O
were	O
but	O
three	O
in	O
the	O

Rank	O

So	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
keep	O
directly	O
one	O
behind	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
the	O
first	O

had	O
fired	O
,	O
to	O
fall	O
in	O
the	O
Rear	O
,	O
and	O
charge	O
again	O
The	O
Spaniards	O
would	O
make	O
up	O
the	O
three	O
fir	O
ft	O
Ranks	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
said	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
in	O
Honour	O
expose	O
us	O
to	O
the	O
first	O
Onset	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
ventured	O
our	O
Lives	O
in	O
coming	O
to	O
their	O
Assistance	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
no	O
Time	O
to	O
dispute	O
,	O
for	O
now	O
they	O
were	O
just	O
upon	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
our	O
Surprize	O
had	O
several	O
Fire-Aj	O

among	O
them	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
got	O
within	O
a	O
hundred	O
Paces	O
of	O
us	O
they	O
fired	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
above	O
two	O
of	O
their	O

went	O
off	O
,	O
the	O

were	O
clogged	O
with	O

in	O

,	O
that	O
very	O
happily	O
for	O
us	O
hindered	O
their	O
Discharging	O

The	O
Shot	O
missed	O
us	O
providentially	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
would	O
not	O
give	O
them	O
Time	O
to	O
charge	O
again	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
moved	O
forward	O
and	O
fired	O
in	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
great	O
Execution	O
;	O
when	O
it	O
came	O
to	O
our	O
Turn	O
to	O
fire	O
,	O
we	O
in	O
the	O
Heat	O
forgot	O
our	O
:	O
144	O
The	O
Adventures	O
of	O
our	O
Orders	O
,	O
but	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
discharged	O
our	O
Guns	O
and	O
Pistols	O
,	O
we	O
fell	O
in	O
with	O
them	O
with	O
our	O
Cutlasses	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
raised	O
above	O
them	O
by	O
being	O
on	O
Horseback	O
,	O
did	O
great	O
Execution	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
with	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
charging	O
and	O
firing	O
again	O
,	O
put	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
Rout	O
;	O
but	O
now	O
we	O
followed	O
them	O
being	O
on	O
Horseback	O
,	O
and	O
dispersed	O
them	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
rally	O
any	O
more	O
that	O
Night	O
.	O

However	O
we	O
took	O
four	O
of	O
them	O
Prisoners	O
,	O
and	O
tying	O
their	O
Hands	O
behind	O
them	O
,	O
fattened	O
them	O
to	O
two	O
of	O
our	O
foremost	O
Horses	O
,	O
the	O
rest	O
following	O
after	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
not	O

We	O
were	O
met	O
in	O
the	O

by	O
twenty	O

with	O
each	O
a	O

who	O
were	O
upon	O
the	O
full	O

to	O
our	O
Assistance	O
,	O
being	O
alarmed	O
by	O
the	O
Mulatto	O
that	O
rode	O
by	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
believe	O
some	O
were	O
glad	O
they	O
came	O
too	O
late	O

The	O
Officer	O
and	O
the	O

saluted	O
us	O
very	O
courteously	O

when	O
they	O
heard	O
how	O
luckily	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
their	O

but	O
fell	O
a	O
whipping	O
the	O
poor	O
naked	O
Indians	O
so	O
barbarously	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
they	O
deserved	O
it	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
bear	O
to	O

it	O

the	O

followed	O

This	O
is	O
the	O

use	O
them	O
civilly	O

and	O
discharge	O
them	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
they	O
might	O
live	O
in	O
perfect	O
Friendship	O
with	O
them	O

For	O
the	O

are	O
good	O

The	O

with	O

could	O

nothing	O

we	O

I	O
advised	O
our	O

to	O
put	O
out	O
our	O
Boat	O
,	O
and	O
tow	O
our	O
Flip	O
from	O
them	O
:	O
For	O
,	O
said	O
I	O
,	O
if	O
a	O

the	O

that	O

This	O
Advice	O
was	O
approved	O
of	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Boat	O
was	O
got	O
out	O
immediately	O
with	O
six	O
Men	O
to	O
row	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
obliged	O
myself	O
to	O
go	O
along	O
with	O
her	O
to	O
steer	O
her	O
right	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
row	O
with	O
all	O
their	O
Strength	O

We	O
rowed	O
Co	O
tightly	O
for	O
an	O
Hour	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
made	O
pretty	O
good	O
Way	O
with	O
our	O
Flip	O
;	O
but	O
for	O
all	O
our	O
Endeavours	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
in	O
about	O
another	O
Hour	O
they	O
would	O
get	O
up	O
with	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
designed	O
to	O
row	O

till	O
they	O
were	O
within	O

In	O
the	O

our	O

were	O
in	O

them	O

We	O
had	O
sixteen	O

We	O
were	O

we	O
found	O
they	O

almost	O
up	O
with	O
us	O

but	O
our	O
Captain	O
advised	O
me	O
not	O

ordered	O
us	O
to	O

as	O

by	O
that	O

them	O

that	O
they	O
would	O
not	O

Immediately	O
it	O
was	O
agreed	O

and	O
two	O
more	O

together	O
with	O
our	O

The	O

it	O

they	O

that	O
it	O
was	O

Now	O
my	O
Reason	O
of	O
sending	O
for	O
you	O
,	O
said	O
the	O
Captain	O
,	O
'	O
is	O
,	O
we	O

When	O
Mr.	O
Matthews	O
had	O
told	O
us	O
in	O
English	O
what	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
my	O
Indignation	O
rose	O
that	O
1	O
could	O
hardly	O
forbear	O
rushing	O
upon	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
tearing	O
his	O
Throat	O
out	O
;	O
but	O
at	O

my	O
Reason	O
conquered	O
my	O
Passion	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
became	O
calm	O
.	O

I	O
bid	O
Mr.	O
Matthews	O
let	O
him	O
know	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
expect	O
us	O
to	O
fight	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
English	O
,	O
our	O
Countrymen	O
;	O
But	O
he	O
fworewe	O
should	O
fight	O

or	O
be	O
killed	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
our	O

Fathers	O

I	O
bid	O
Mr.	O
Matthews	O
tell	O
him	O
,	O
as	O
for	O
my	O
own	O
Part	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
fight	O
a	O

let	O
it	O
be	O

it	O
would	O
;	O
and	O
for	O
his	O
threatening	O
to	O
kill	O
us	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
but	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
better	O
to	O
die	O
,	O
than	O
to	O
associate	O
with	O
such	O
an	O
ungrateful	O
Crew	O
as	O
they	O
were	O

The	O
Flip	O
now	O
instead	O
of	O
keeping	O
her	O
Course	O
,	O
as	O
fine	O
did	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
made	O
all	O

could	O

bore	O
down	O
upon	O
us	O

which	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
mind	O
in	O
our	O
disputing	O

The	O
Captain	O
then	O
began	O
to	O
change	O
his	O
Tone	O

and	O
thought	O
it	O
the	O
wise	O
ft	O
Way	O
to	O
fleer	O
away	O
before	O
the	O

Whereupon	O
he	O
crowded	O
away	O

and	O
belaboured	O
the	O
poor	O
Turks	O
with	O
his	O
Bastinado	O
to	O

with	O
all	O
their	O
Strength	O

that	O
I	O
pitied	O
them	O

Looking	O
towards	O
the	O

that	O
pursued	O
us	O

we	O
could	O
perceive	O
English	O
Colours	O

which	O
rejoiced	O
us	O

mightily	O

We	O
now	O
consulted	O
how	O
we	O
mould	O
top	O
the	O

for	O
with	O
sailing	O
and	O
rowing	O
we	O
went	O
salter	O

they	O

At	O

I	O
resolved	O
