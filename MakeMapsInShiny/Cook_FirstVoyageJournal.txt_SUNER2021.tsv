that	O
there	O
remaind	O
nothing	O
more	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
to	O
regain	O
their	O

to	O
deliver	O
up	O
the	O

the	O
people	O
had	O
taken	O
from	O
the	O
petty	O
Officer	O

Corporal	O
and	O
these	O
were	O
brought	O
on	O
board	O
in	O
less	O

half	O
an	O

then	O
I	O
sent	O
them	O
all	O
a	O

they	O
made	O

a	O
short	O
stay	O
with	O
our	O

there	O
before	O
they	O
went	O
away	O

most	O
of	O
the	O

with	O

they	O

wanted	O
to	O

us	O

we	O

to	O
leave	O
these	O

in	O
disgust	O
with	O
our	O
behaviour	O
towards	O

owing	O
wholy	O
