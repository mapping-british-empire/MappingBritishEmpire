a	O
very	O

I	O
was	O

and	O
so	O
my	O
companions	O
always	O
called	O
me	O

I	O
had	O
two	O
elder	O
brothers	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
whom	O
was	O
lieutenant-colonel	O
to	O
an	O
English	O
regiment	O
of	O
foot	O
in	O
Flanders	O
,	O
formerly	O
commanded	O
by	O
the	O
famous	O
Colonel	O
Lockhart	O

and	O
was	O
killed	O
at	O
the	O
battle	O
near	O
Dunkirk	PNM
against	O
the	O
Spaniards	O

What	O
became	O
of	O
my	O
second	O
brother	O
I	O
never	O
knew	O
,	O
any	O
more	O
than	O
my	O
father	O
or	O
mother	O
knew	O
what	O
became	O
of	O
me	O
.	O

Being	O
the	O
third	O
son	O
of	O
the	O
family	O
and	O
not	O
bred	O
to	O
any	O
trade	O
,	O
my	O
head	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
filled	O
very	O
early	O
with	O
rambling	O
thoughts	O
.	O

My	O
father	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
very	O
ancient	O
,	O
had	O
given	O
me	O
a	O
competent	O
share	O
of	O
learning	O
,	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
house-education	O
and	O
a	O
country	O
free	O
school	O
generally	O
go	O
,	O
and	O
designed	O
me	O
for	O
the	O
law	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
satisfied	O
with	O
nothing	O
but	O
going	O
to	O
sea	O
;	O
and	O
my	O
inclination	O
to	O
this	O
led	O
me	O
so	O
strongly	O
against	O
the	O
will	O
,	O
nay	O
,	O
the	O
commands	O
of	O
my	O
father	O
,	O
and	O
against	O
all	O
the	O
entreaties	O
and	O
persuasions	O
of	O
my	O
mother	O
and	O
other	O
friends	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
something	O
fatal	O
in	O
that	O
propensity	O
of	O
nature	O
,	O
tending	O
directly	O
to	O
the	O
life	O
of	O
misery	O
which	O
was	O
to	O
befall	O
me	O
.	O

My	O
father	O
,	O
a	O
wise	O
and	O
grave	O
man	O
,	O
gave	O
me	O
serious	O
and	O
excellent	O
counsel	O
against	O
what	O
he	O
foresaw	O
was	O
my	O
design	O
.	O

He	O
called	O
me	O
one	O
morning	O
into	O
his	O
chamber	O
,	O
where	O
he	O
was	O
confined	O
by	O
the	O
gout	O
,	O
and	O
expostulated	O
very	O
warmly	O
with	O
me	O
upon	O
this	O
subject	O
.	O

He	O
asked	O
me	O
what	O
reasons	O
,	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
mere	O
wandering	O
inclination	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
for	O
leaving	O
father	O
's	O
house	O
and	O
my	O
native	O
country	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
well	O
introduced	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
prospect	O
of	O
raising	O
my	O
fortune	O
by	O
application	O
and	O
industry	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
life	O
of	O
ease	O
and	O
pleasure	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
it	O
was	O
men	O
of	O
desperate	O
fortunes	O
on	O
one	O
hand	O
,	O
or	O
of	O
aspiring	O
,	O
superior	O
fortunes	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
who	O
went	O
abroad	O
upon	O
adventures	O
,	O
to	O
rise	O
by	O
enterprise	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
themselves	O
famous	O
in	O
undertakings	O
of	O
a	O

out	O
of	O
the	O
common	O
road	O
;	O
that	O
these	O
things	O
were	O
all	O
either	O
too	O
far	O
above	O
me	O
or	O
too	O
far	O
below	O
me	O
;	O
that	O
mine	O
was	O
the	O
middle	O
state	O
,	O
or	O
what	O
might	O
be	O
called	O
the	O
upper	O
station	O
of	O
low	O
life	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
found	O
,	O
by	O
long	O
experience	O
,	O
was	O
the	O
best	O
state	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
the	O
most	O
suited	O
to	O
human	O
happiness	O
,	O
not	O
exposed	O
to	O
the	O
miseries	O
and	O
hardships	O
,	O
the	O
labour	O
and	O
sufferings	O
of	O
the	O

part	O
of	O
mankind	O

not	O
embarrassed	O
with	O
the	O
pride	O

luxury	O
,	O
ambition	O
,	O
and	O
envy	O
of	O
the	O
upper	O
part	O
of	O
mankind	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
I	O
might	O
judge	O
of	O
the	O
happiness	O
of	O
this	O
state	O
by	O
this	O
one	O
thing	O
--	O
viz.	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
state	O
of	O
life	O
which	O
all	O
other	O
people	O
envied	O
;	O
that	O
kings	O
have	O
frequently	O
lamented	O
the	O
miserable	O
consequence	O
of	O
being	O
born	O
to	O
great	O
things	O
,	O
and	O
wished	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
placed	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
extremes	O
,	O
between	O
the	O
mean	O
and	O
the	O
great	O
;	O
that	O
the	O
wise	O
man	O
gave	O
his	O
testimony	O
to	O
this	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
standard	O
of	O
felicity	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
prayed	O
to	O
have	O
neither	O
poverty	O
nor	O
riches	O

He	O
bade	O
me	O
observe	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
should	O
always	O
find	O
that	O
the	O
calamities	O
of	O
life	O
were	O
shared	O
among	O
the	O
upper	O

part	O

that	O
the	O

the	O

was	O
not	O

that	O

keep	O
him	O
from	O
going	O
into	O
the	O
Low	O
Country	O
wars	O

could	O
not	O
prevail	O

his	O
young	O

him	O
to	O
run	O
into	O
the	O
army	O

where	O
he	O
was	O
killed	O
;	O

though	O

he	O
would	O
not	O
cease	O

for	O
me	O

would	O

to	O
me	O

that	O
if	O
I	O
did	O
take	O
this	O
foolish	O
step	O
,	O
God	O
would	O

I	O
should	O

when	O
there	O
might	O
be	O
none	O
to	O

I	O
observed	O
in	O
this	O
last	O
part	O
of	O
his	O
discourse	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
truly	O
prophetic	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
suppose	O
my	O
father	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
himself	O
--	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
I	O
observed	O
the	O
tears	O
run	O
down	O
his	O
face	O
very	O
plentifully	O
,	O
especially	O
when	O
he	O
spoke	O
of	O
my	O
brother	O
who	O
was	O
killed	O
:	O
and	O
that	O
when	O
he	O
spoke	O
of	O
my	O
having	O
leisure	O
to	O
repent	O
,	O
and	O
none	O
to	O
assist	O
me	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
so	O
moved	O
that	O
he	O
broke	O
off	O
the	O
discourse	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
his	O
heart	O
was	O
so	O
full	O
he	O
could	O
say	O
no	O
more	O
to	O
me	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
sincerely	O
affected	O
with	O
this	O
discourse	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
who	O
could	O
be	O
otherwise	O
?	O

and	O
I	O
resolved	O
not	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
going	O
abroad	O
any	O
more	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
settle	O
at	O
home	O
according	O
to	O
my	O
father	O
's	O
desire	O
.	O

But	O
alas	O
!	O

a	O
few	O
days	O
wore	O
it	O
all	O
off	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
to	O
prevent	O
any	O
of	O
my	O
father	O
's	O
further	O
importunities	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
weeks	O
after	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
run	O
quite	O
away	O
from	O
him	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
act	O
quite	O
so	O
hastily	O
as	O
the	O
first	O
heat	O
of	O
my	O
resolution	O
prompted	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
took	O
my	O
mother	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
when	O
I	O
thought	O
her	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
pleasant	O
than	O
ordinary	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
her	O
that	O
my	O
thoughts	O
were	O
so	O
entirely	O
bent	O
upon	O
seeing	O
the	O
world	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
never	O
settle	O
to	O
anything	O
with	O
resolution	O
enough	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
father	O
had	O
better	O
give	O
me	O
his	O
consent	O
than	O
force	O
me	O
to	O
go	O
without	O
it	O
;	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
now	O
eighteen	O
years	O
old	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
too	O
late	O
to	O
go	O
apprentice	O
to	O
a	O
trade	O
or	O
clerk	O
to	O
an	O
attorney	O
;	O
that	O
I	O
was	O

should	O
never	O

in	O
this	O
agony	O
of	O

I	O
made	O

my	O

run	O
myself	O
into	O
such	O
miseries	O

these	O

Now	O
I	O
saw	O
plainly	O
the	O
goodness	O
of	O
his	O

about	O
the	O

of	O

how	O

exposed	O
to	O
tempests	O
at	O

to	O
be	O
a	O
little	O

it	O

I	O
was	O

lay	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
continuing	O
contrary	O
--	O
viz.	O
at	O
south-west	O
--	O
for	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
days	O
,	O
during	O
which	O
time	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
ships	O
from	O
Newcastle	PNM
came	O
into	O
the	O
same	O
Roads	O

as	O
the	O
common	O
harbour	O
where	O
the	O
ships	O
might	O
wait	O
for	O
a	O

for	O
the	O
river	O

We	O
had	O
not	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
rid	O
here	O
so	O
long	O
but	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
tided	O
it	O
up	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
wind	O
blew	O
too	O
fresh	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
lain	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
days	O
,	O
blew	O
very	O
hard	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
Roads	O
being	O
reckoned	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
a	O
harbour	O
,	O
the	O
anchorage	O
good	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
ground-tackle	O
very	O
strong	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
were	O
unconcerned	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
in	O
the	O
least	O
apprehensive	O
of	O
danger	O
,	O
but	O
spent	O
the	O
time	O
in	O
rest	O
and	O
mirth	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
eighth	O
day	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
increased	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
all	O
hands	O
at	O
work	O
to	O
strike	O
our	O
topmasts	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
everything	O
snug	O
and	O
close	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
might	O
ride	O
as	O
easy	O
as	O
possible	O
.	O

By	O
noon	O
the	O
sea	O
went	O
very	O
high	O
indeed	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
ship	O
rode	O
forecastle	O
in	O
,	O
shipped	O
several	O
seas	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
thought	O
once	O
or	O
twice	O
our	O
anchor	O
had	O
come	O
home	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
our	O
master	O
ordered	O
out	O
the	O
sheet-anchor	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
rode	O
with	O
two	O
anchors	O
ahead	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
cables	O
veered	O
out	O
to	O
the	O
bitter	O
end	O

By	O
this	O
time	O
it	O
blew	O
a	O
terrible	O
storm	O
indeed	O
;	O
and	O
now	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
see	O
terror	O
and	O
amazement	O
in	O
the	O
faces	O
even	O
of	O
the	O
seamen	O
themselves	O
.	O

The	O
master	O
,	O
though	O
vigilant	O
in	O
the	O
business	O
of	O
preserving	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
yet	O
as	O
he	O
went	O
in	O
and	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
cabin	O
by	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
hear	O
him	O
softly	O
to	O
himself	O
say	O
,	O
several	O
times	O
,	O
``	O
Lord	O

and	O
the	O

During	O
these	O
first	O
hurries	O
I	O
was	O
stupid	O
,	O
lying	O
still	O
in	O
my	O
cabin	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
steerage	O
,	O
and	O
can	O
not	O
describe	O
my	O
temper	O
:	O
I	O
could	O
ill	O
resume	O
the	O
first	O
penitence	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
so	O
apparently	O
trampled	O
upon	O
and	O
hardened	O
myself	O
against	O
:	O
I	O
thought	O
the	O
bitterness	O
of	O
death	O
had	O
been	O
past	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
this	O
would	O
be	O
nothing	O
like	O
the	O
first	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
the	O
master	O
himself	O
came	O
by	O
me	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
just	O
now	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
all	O
lost	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
dreadfully	O
frighted	O
.	O

I	O
got	O
up	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
cabin	O
and	O
looked	O
out	O
;	O
but	O
such	O
a	O
dismal	O
sight	O
I	O
never	O
saw	O
:	O
the	O
sea	O
ran	O
mountains	O
high	O
,	O
and	O
broke	O
upon	O
us	O
every	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
minutes	O
;	O
when	O
I	O
could	O
look	O
about	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
see	O
nothing	O
but	O
distress	O
round	O
us	O
;	O
two	O
ships	O
that	O
rode	O
near	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
,	O
had	O
cut	O
their	O
masts	O
by	O
the	O
board	O
,	O
being	O
deep	O
laden	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
cried	O
out	O
that	O
a	O
ship	O
which	O
rode	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
ahead	O
of	O
us	O
was	O
foundered	O
.	O

Two	O
more	O
ships	O
,	O
being	O
driven	O
from	O
their	O
anchors	O

were	O
run	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
Roads	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
at	O
all	O
adventures	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
with	O
not	O
a	O
mast	O
standing	O
.	O

The	O
light	O
ships	O
fared	O
the	O
best	O
,	O
as	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
labouring	O
in	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
but	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
of	O
them	O
drove	O

and	O
came	O
close	O

,	O
running	O
away	O
with	O
only	O
their	O
spritsail	O
out	O
before	O
the	O
wind	O

Towards	O
evening	O
the	O
mate	O
and	O
boatswain	O
begged	O
the	O
master	O
of	O
our	O
ship	O
to	O
let	O
them	O
cut	O
away	O
the	O
fore-mast	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
very	O
unwilling	O
to	O
do	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
boatswain	O
protesting	O
to	O
him	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
the	O
ship	O
would	O
founder	O
,	O
he	O
consented	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
had	O
cut	O
away	O
the	O
fore-mast	O
,	O
the	O
main-mast	O
stood	O
so	O
loose	O
,	O
and	O
shook	O
the	O
ship	O
so	O
much	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
cut	O
that	O
away	O
also	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
a	O
clear	O
deck	O
.	O

Any	O
one	O
may	O
judge	O
what	O
a	O
condition	O
I	O
must	O
be	O
in	O
at	O
all	O
this	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
but	O
a	O
young	O
sailor	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
fright	O
before	O
at	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
.	O

But	O
if	O
I	O
can	O
express	O
at	O
this	O
distance	O
the	O
thoughts	O
I	O
had	O
about	O
me	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
tenfold	O
more	O
horror	O
of	O
mind	O
upon	O
account	O
of	O
my	O
former	O
convictions	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
having	O
returned	O
from	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
resolutions	O
I	O
had	O
wickedly	O
taken	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
than	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
death	O
itself	O
;	O
and	O
these	O
,	O
added	O
to	O
the	O
terror	O
of	O
the	O
storm	O
,	O
put	O
me	O
into	O
such	O
a	O
condition	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
by	O
no	O
words	O
describe	O
it	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
worst	O
was	O
not	O
come	O
yet	O
;	O
the	O
storm	O
continued	O
with	O
such	O
fury	O
that	O
the	O
seamen	O
themselves	O
acknowledged	O
they	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
a	O
worse	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
good	O
ship	O
,	O
but	O
she	O
was	O
deep	O
laden	O
,	O
and	O
wallowed	O
in	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
seamen	O
every	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
cried	O
out	O
she	O
would	O
founder	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
my	O
advantage	O
in	O
one	O
respect	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
what	O
they	O
meant	O
by	O
_	O
founder	O
_	O
till	O
I	O
inquired	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
storm	O
was	O
so	O
violent	O
that	O
I	O
saw	O
,	O
what	O
is	O
not	O
often	O
seen	O
,	O
the	O
master	O
,	O
the	O
boatswain	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
others	O
more	O
sensible	O
than	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
at	O
their	O
prayers	O
,	O
and	O
expecting	O
every	O
moment	O
when	O
the	O
ship	O
would	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
bottom	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
under	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
our	O
distresses	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
down	O
to	O
see	O
cried	O
out	O
we	O
had	O
sprung	O
a	O
leak	O
;	O
another	O
said	O
there	O
was	O
four	O
feet	O
water	O
in	O
the	O
hold	O
.	O

Then	O
all	O
hands	O
were	O
called	O
to	O
the	O
pump	O
.	O

At	O
that	O
word	O
,	O
my	O
heart	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
died	O
within	O
me	O
:	O
and	O
I	O
fell	O
backwards	O
upon	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
my	O
bed	O
where	O
I	O
sat	O
,	O
into	O
the	O
cabin	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
men	O
roused	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
I	O
,	O
that	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
nothing	O
before	O
,	O
was	O
as	O
well	O
able	O
to	O
pump	O
as	O
another	O
;	O
at	O
which	O
I	O
stirred	O
up	O
and	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
pump	O
,	O
and	O
worked	O
very	O
heartily	O
.	O

While	O
this	O
was	O
doing	O
the	O
master	O

seeing	O
some	O
light	O
colliers	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
ride	O
out	O
the	O
storm	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
slip	O
and	O
run	O
away	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
come	O
near	O
us	O
,	O
ordered	O
to	O
fire	O
a	O
gun	O
as	O
a	O
signal	O
of	O
distress	O
.	O

I	O
,	O
who	O
knew	O
nothing	O
what	O
they	O
meant	O
,	O
thought	O
the	O
ship	O
had	O
broken	O
,	O
or	O
some	O
dreadful	O
thing	O
happened	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
so	O
surprised	O
that	O
I	O
fell	O
down	O
in	O
a	O
swoon	O
.	O

As	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
time	O
when	O
everybody	O
had	O
his	O
own	O
life	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
,	O
nobody	O
minded	O
me	O
,	O
or	O
what	O
was	O
become	O
of	O
me	O
;	O
but	O
another	O
man	O
stepped	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
pump	O
,	O
and	O
thrusting	O
me	O
aside	O
with	O
his	O
foot	O
,	O
let	O
me	O
lie	O
,	O
thinking	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
dead	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
before	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
myself	O
.	O

We	O
worked	O
on	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
water	O
increasing	O
in	O
the	O
hold	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
apparent	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
would	O
founder	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
the	O
storm	O
began	O
to	O
abate	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
possible	O
she	O
could	O
swim	O
till	O
we	O
might	O
run	O
into	O
any	O
port	O
;	O
so	O
the	O
master	O
continued	O
firing	O
guns	O
for	O
help	O
;	O
and	O
a	O
light	O
ship	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
rid	O
it	O
out	O
just	O
ahead	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
ventured	O
a	O
boat	O
out	O
to	O
help	O
us	O

It	O
was	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
hazard	O
the	O
boat	O
came	O
near	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
get	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
or	O
for	O
the	O
boat	O
to	O
lie	O
near	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
side	O
,	O
till	O
at	O
last	O
the	O
men	O
rowing	O
very	O
heartily	O
,	O
and	O
venturing	O
their	O
lives	O
to	O
save	O
ours	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
cast	O
them	O
a	O
rope	O
over	O
the	O
stern	O
with	O
a	O
buoy	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
veered	O
it	O
out	O
a	O
great	O
length	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
,	O
after	O
much	O
labour	O
and	O
hazard	O
,	O
took	O
hold	O
of	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
hauled	O
them	O
close	O
under	O
our	O
stern	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
all	O
into	O
their	O
boat	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
to	O
no	O
purpose	O
for	O
them	O
or	O
us	O
,	O
after	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
reaching	O
their	O
own	O
ship	O
;	O
so	O
all	O
agreed	O
to	O
let	O
her	O
drive	O
,	O
and	O
only	O
to	O
pull	O
her	O
in	O
towards	O
shore	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
master	O
promised	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
boat	O
was	O
staved	O
upon	O
shore	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
make	O
it	O
good	O
to	O
their	O
master	O
:	O
so	O
partly	O
rowing	O
and	O
partly	O
driving	O
,	O
our	O
boat	O
went	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
,	O
sloping	O
towards	O
the	O
shore	O
almost	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
Winterton	O
Ness	O

We	O
were	O
not	O
much	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
ship	O
till	O
we	O
saw	O
her	O
sink	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
understood	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
what	O
was	O
meant	O
by	O
a	O
ship	O
foundering	O
in	O
the	O
sea	O

I	O
must	O
acknowledge	O
I	O
had	O
hardly	O
eyes	O
to	O
look	O
up	O
when	O
the	O
seamen	O
told	O
me	O
she	O
was	O
sinking	O
;	O
for	O
from	O
the	O
moment	O
that	O
they	O
rather	O
put	O
me	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
than	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
go	O
in	O

my	O
heart	O
was	O

as	O
it	O

partly	O
with	O

I	O
increased	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
voyage	O
which	O
I	O
may	O
say	O
was	O
successful	O
in	O
all	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
unhappiest	O
voyage	O
that	O
ever	O
man	O
made	O

for	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
carry	O
quite	O
£	O

very	O

I	O
fell	O
into	O
terrible	O
misfortunes	O

The	O
first	O
was	O
this	O

making	O

towards	O
the	O
Canary	PNM
Islands	PNM
,	O
or	O
rather	O
between	O
those	O
islands	O
and	O
the	O
African	O
shore	O
,	O
was	O
surprised	O
in	O
the	O
grey	O
of	O
the	O
morning	O
by	O
a	O
Turkish	O
rover	O
of	O
Sallee	O

who	O
gave	O
chase	O
to	O
us	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
sail	O

could	O
make	O

We	O
crowded	O
also	O
as	O
much	O
canvas	O
as	O

would	O
spread	O

or	O
our	O

but	O
finding	O
the	O
pirate	O
gained	O
upon	O
us	O

and	O
would	O
certainly	O
come	O
up	O
with	O
us	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
hours	O
,	O
we	O
prepared	O
to	O
fight	O
;	O
our	O
ship	O
having	O
twelve	O
guns	O

and	O
the	O
rogue	O
eighteen	O

About	O
three	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
he	O
came	O
up	O
with	O
us	O

and	O
bringing	O
to	O

by	O
mistake	O

just	O
athwart	O
our	O
quarter	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
athwart	O
our	O
stern	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
intended	O
,	O
we	O
brought	O
eight	O
of	O
our	O
guns	O
to	O
bear	O
on	O
that	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
poured	O
in	O
a	O
broadside	O
upon	O
him	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
him	O
sheer	O
off	O
again	O
,	O
after	O
returning	O
our	O
fire	O

and	O
pouring	O
in	O
also	O
his	O
small	O
shot	O
from	O
near	O
two	O

men	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
on	O

However	O

we	O
had	O
not	O
a	O
man	O
touched	O
,	O
all	O
our	O
men	O
keeping	O
close	O

He	O
prepared	O
to	O
attack	O
us	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
to	O
defend	O
ourselves	O

But	O
laying	O
us	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
next	O
time	O
upon	O
our	O
other	O
quarter	O
,	O
he	O
entered	O
sixty	O
men	O
upon	O
our	O
decks	O
,	O
who	O
immediately	O
fell	O
to	O
cutting	O
and	O
hacking	O
the	O
sails	O

We	O
plied	O

cleared	O
our	O

of	O
them	O
twice	O

However	O
,	O
to	O
cut	O
short	O
this	O
melancholy	O
part	O
of	O
our	O
story	O
,	O
our	O
ship	O
being	O
disabled	O
,	O
and	O
three	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
killed	O
,	O
and	O
eight	O
wounded	O

we	O
were	O

all	O
prisoners	O
into	O
Sallee	O

a	O
port	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
Moors	O

The	O
usage	O
I	O
had	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
dreadful	O
as	O
at	O
first	O
I	O
apprehended	O
;	O
nor	O
was	O
I	O
carried	O
up	O
the	O
country	O
to	O
the	O
emperor	O

as	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
were	O

but	O
was	O
kept	O
by	O
the	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
rover	O
as	O
his	O
proper	O
prize	O

and	O
made	O

being	O
young	O

At	O
this	O
surprising	O
change	O
of	O
my	O
circumstances	O
,	O
from	O
a	O
merchant	O
to	O
a	O
miserable	O
slave	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
perfectly	O
overwhelmed	O
;	O
and	O
now	O
I	O
looked	O
back	O
upon	O
my	O
father	O
's	O
prophetic	O
discourse	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
miserable	O
and	O
have	O
none	O
to	O
relieve	O
me	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
thought	O
was	O
now	O
so	O
effectually	O
brought	O
to	O
pass	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
worse	O
;	O
for	O
now	O
the	O
hand	O
of	O
Heaven	O
had	O
overtaken	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
undone	O
without	O
redemption	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
alas	O
!	O

this	O
was	O
but	O
a	O
taste	O
of	O
the	O
misery	O
I	O
was	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
,	O
as	O
will	O
appear	O
in	O
the	O
sequel	O
of	O
this	O
story	O

As	O
my	O
new	O
patron	O
,	O
or	O
master	O
,	O
had	O
taken	O
me	O
home	O
to	O
his	O
house	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
hopes	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
take	O
me	O
with	O
him	O
when	O
he	O
went	O
to	O
sea	O
again	O
,	O
believing	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
some	O
time	O
or	O
other	O
be	O
his	O
fate	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
by	O
a	O
Spanish	O
or	O
Portugal	PNM
man-of-war	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
then	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
set	O
at	O
liberty	O
.	O

But	O
this	O
hope	O
of	O
mine	O
was	O
soon	O
taken	O
away	O
;	O
for	O
when	O
he	O
went	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
he	O
left	O
me	O
on	O
shore	O
to	O
look	O
after	O
his	O
little	O
garden	O
,	O
and	O
do	O
the	O
common	O
drudgery	O
of	O
slaves	O
about	O
his	O
house	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
he	O
came	O
home	O
again	O
from	O
his	O
cruise	O
,	O
he	O
ordered	O
me	O
to	O
lie	O
in	O
the	O
cabin	O
to	O
look	O
after	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

Here	O
I	O
meditated	O
nothing	O
but	O
my	O
escape	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
method	O
I	O
might	O
take	O
to	O
effect	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
found	O
no	O
way	O
that	O
had	O
the	O

probability	O
in	O
it	O
;	O
nothing	O
presented	O
to	O

I	O
never	O

the	O

After	O
about	O
two	O

an	O

out	O

I	O
proved	O
very	O
dexterous	O
in	O

It	O
happened	O

that	O
going	O

in	O
a	O
calm	O
morning	O

a	O

though	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
half	O
a	O
league	O
from	O
the	O

we	O
lost	O

rowing	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
whither	O

all	O
the	O
next	O

and	O
when	O
the	O

came	O
we	O

at	O

However	O

We	O
went	O
frequently	O
out	O
with	O
this	O

to	O

out	O
in	O
this	O

either	O
for	O

for	O

with	O
two	O

of	O

for	O
whom	O
he	O
had	O
provided	O

and	O
had	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
sent	O
on	O

the	O
boat	O
overnight	O
a	O
larger	O
store	O
of	O
provisions	O
than	O
ordinary	O
;	O
and	O
had	O
ordered	O
me	O
to	O
get	O
ready	O
three	O
fusees	O
with	O
powder	O
and	O
shot	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
on	O

that	O
they	O
designed	O
some	O

of	O

I	O
got	O
all	O

he	O
had	O
directed	O

and	O
waited	O
the	O
next	O

with	O

out	O

and	O
everything	O
to	O
accommodate	O
his	O

;	O
when	O
by-and-by	O
my	O

came	O
on	O

told	O
me	O

had	O
put	O
off	O
going	O
from	O
some	O
business	O
that	O
fell	O
out	O

ordered	O
me	O

with	O
the	O
man	O

as	O
usual	O
,	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
with	O
the	O
boat	O
and	O
catch	O
them	O
some	O
fish	O

for	O
that	O
his	O

were	O
to	O
sup	O
at	O

house	O

and	O
commanded	O
that	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
got	O
some	O

I	O
should	O
bring	O
it	O
home	O
to	O
his	O

all	O
which	O
I	O
prepared	O
to	O

This	O
moment	O
my	O
former	O
notions	O
of	O

darted	O
into	O
my	O
thoughts	O

for	O
now	O
I	O
found	O
I	O
was	O
likely	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
little	O
ship	O
at	O
my	O

and	O
my	O

being	O
gone	O

I	O
prepared	O
to	O

myself	O

not	O
for	O

for	O
a	O
voyage	O

I	O

I	O
so	O

whither	O
I	O
should	O
steer	O

anywhere	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
that	O

was	O
my	O
desire	O

My	O
first	O
contrivance	O
was	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
pretence	O
to	O
speak	O
to	O
this	O
Moor	O
,	O
to	O
get	O
something	O
for	O
our	O
subsistence	O
on	O

;	O
for	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
we	O
must	O
not	O
presume	O
to	O
eat	O
of	O
our	O
patron	O
's	O
bread	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
that	O
was	O
true	O
;	O
so	O
he	O
brought	O
a	O
large	O
basket	O
of	O
rusk	O
or	O
biscuit	O
,	O
and	O
three	O
jars	O
of	O
fresh	O
water	O
,	O
into	O
the	O

I	O
knew	O
where	O
my	O

of	O

stood	O
,	O
which	O
it	O
was	O

by	O
the	O
make	O

were	O
taken	O
out	O
of	O
some	O
English	O
prize	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
conveyed	O
them	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
while	O
the	O
Moor	O
was	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
there	O
before	O
for	O
our	O
master	O

I	O
conveyed	O
also	O
a	O
great	O
lump	O
of	O
beeswax	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
which	O
weighed	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
hundred-weight	O

with	O
a	O

a	O

were	O
of	O

to	O
us	O
afterwards	O

the	O

Another	O
trick	O
I	O
tried	O
upon	O
him	O

he	O
innocently	O
came	O
into	O
also	O

his	O

in	O
that	O

five	O
days	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
wind	O
shifting	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
,	O
I	O
concluded	O
also	O
that	O
if	O
any	O
of	O
our	O
vessels	O
were	O
in	O
chase	O
of	O
me	O
,	O
they	O
also	O
would	O
now	O
give	O
over	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
ventured	O
to	O
make	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
in	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
a	O
little	O
river	O

I	O
knew	O
not	O

neither	O
what	O
latitude	O

I	O
neither	O
saw	O

nor	O
desired	O
to	O
see	O
any	O
people	O
;	O
the	O
principal	O
thing	O
I	O
wanted	O
was	O
fresh	O
water	O

We	O
came	O
into	O
this	O
creek	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O

resolving	O
to	O
swim	O
on	O
shore	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
dark	O

and	O
discover	O
the	O
country	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
quite	O
dark	O
,	O
we	O
heard	O
such	O
dreadful	O
noises	O
of	O
the	O
barking	O
,	O
roaring	O
,	O
and	O
howling	O
of	O
wild	O
creatures	O
,	O
of	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
kinds	O

that	O
the	O
poor	O
boy	O
was	O
ready	O
to	O
die	O
with	O
fear	O
,	O
and	O
begged	O
of	O
me	O
not	O

``	O

Such	O

Xury	O
spoke	O
by	O

among	O

I	O
was	O
glad	O

the	O

was	O

I	O
took	O
it	O

indeed	O

we	O

it	O
might	O
be	O
so	O
for	O
aught	O
I	O

poor	O
Xury	O
cried	O
to	O

I	O

when	O

where	O
to	O

Xury	O
said	O

if	O
I	O
would	O
let	O
him	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
with	O
one	O
of	O

why	O

The	O

so	O

him	O

``	O

So	O
I	O
gave	O

a	O

a	O

out	O

our	O
patron	O
's	O
case	O
of	O
bottles	O
which	O
I	O
mentioned	O
before	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
hauled	O
the	O
boat	O
in	O
as	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
as	O
we	O
thought	O
was	O
proper	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
waded	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
carrying	O
nothing	O
but	O
our	O
arms	O
and	O
two	O
jars	O
for	O
water	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
care	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
of	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
fearing	O
the	O
coming	O
of	O
canoes	O
with	O
savages	O
down	O
the	O
river	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
boy	O
seeing	O
a	O
low	O
place	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
up	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
rambled	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
by-and-by	O
I	O
saw	O
him	O
come	O
running	O
towards	O
me	O

I	O
thought	O
he	O
was	O
pursued	O
by	O
some	O
savage	O

or	O
frighted	O
with	O
some	O
wild	O
beast	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
ran	O
forward	O
towards	O
him	O
to	O
help	O
him	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
nearer	O
to	O
him	O
I	O
saw	O
something	O
hanging	O
over	O
his	O
shoulders	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
creature	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
shot	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
hare	O
,	O
but	O
different	O
in	O
colour	O
,	O
and	O
longer	O
legs	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
glad	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
meat	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
great	O
joy	O
that	O
poor	O
Xury	O
came	O
with	O
,	O
was	O
to	O
tell	O
me	O
he	O
had	O
found	O
good	O
water	O
and	O
seen	O
no	O
wild	O
mans	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
found	O
afterwards	O
that	O
we	O
need	O
not	O
take	O
such	O
pains	O
for	O
water	O
,	O
for	O
a	O
little	O
higher	O
up	O
the	O
creek	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
water	O
fresh	O
when	O
the	O
tide	O
was	O
out	O
,	O
which	O
flowed	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
up	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
filled	O
our	O
jars	O
,	O
and	O
feasted	O
on	O
the	O
hare	O
he	O
had	O
killed	O
,	O
and	O
prepared	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
our	O
way	O
,	O
having	O
seen	O
no	O
footsteps	O
of	O
any	O
human	O
creature	O
in	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
country	O

As	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
one	O
voyage	O
to	O
this	O
coast	O
before	O
,	O
I	O
knew	O
very	O
well	O
that	O
the	O
islands	O
of	O
the	O
Canaries	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
de	PNM
Verde	PNM
Islands	PNM
also	O
,	O
lay	O
not	O
far	O
off	O
from	O
the	O
coast	O

But	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
instruments	O
to	O
take	O
an	O
observation	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
latitude	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
exactly	O
knowing	O
,	O
or	O
at	O
least	O
remembering	O
,	O
what	O
latitude	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
,	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
where	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
or	O
when	O
to	O
stand	O
off	O
to	O
sea	O
towards	O
them	O
;	O
otherwise	O
I	O
might	O
now	O
easily	O
have	O
found	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
islands	O
.	O

But	O
my	O
hope	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
I	O
stood	O
along	O
this	O
coast	O
till	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
that	O
part	O
where	O
the	O
English	O
traded	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
find	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
vessels	O
upon	O
their	O
usual	O
design	O
of	O
trade	O
,	O
that	O
would	O
relieve	O
and	O
take	O
us	O
in	O
.	O

By	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
my	O
calculation	O
,	O
that	O
place	O
where	O
I	O
now	O
was	O
must	O
be	O
that	O
country	O
which	O
,	O
lying	O
between	O
the	O
Emperor	O
of	O
Morocco	O
's	O
dominions	O

the	O

waste	O
and	O
uninhabited	O
,	O
except	O
by	O
wild	O
beasts	O
;	O
the	O
negroes	O
having	O
abandoned	O
it	O
and	O
gone	O
farther	O
south	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
the	O
Moors	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Moors	O
not	O
thinking	O
it	O
worth	O
inhabiting	O
by	O
reason	O
of	O
its	O
barrenness	O
;	O
and	O
indeed	O
,	O
both	O
forsaking	O
it	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
prodigious	O
number	O
of	O
tigers	O
,	O
lions	O
,	O
leopards	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
furious	O
creatures	O
which	O
harbour	O
there	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
Moors	O
use	O
it	O
for	O
their	O
hunting	O
only	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
go	O
like	O
an	O
army	O
,	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
thousand	O
men	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
;	O
and	O
indeed	O
for	O
near	O
a	O
hundred	O
miles	O
together	O
upon	O
this	O
coast	O
we	O
saw	O
nothing	O
but	O
a	O
waste	O
,	O
uninhabited	O
country	O
by	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
heard	O
nothing	O
but	O
howlings	O
and	O
roaring	O
of	O
wild	O
beasts	O
by	O
night	O
.	O

Once	O
or	O
twice	O
in	O
the	O
daytime	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O
saw	O
the	O
Pico	O
of	O
Teneriffe	O

being	O
the	O
high	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
Mountain	O
Teneriffe	O
in	O
the	O
Canaries	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
mind	O
to	O
venture	O
out	O
,	O
in	O
hopes	O
of	O
reaching	O
thither	O
;	O
but	O
having	O
tried	O
twice	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
forced	O
in	O
again	O
by	O
contrary	O
winds	O
,	O
the	O
sea	O
also	O
going	O
too	O
high	O
for	O
my	O
little	O
vessel	O

so	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
pursue	O
my	O
first	O
design	O

and	O
keep	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O

Several	O
times	O
I	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
land	O
for	O
fresh	O
water	O

after	O
we	O

left	O

and	O
once	O
in	O

,	O
being	O
early	O
in	O

we	O
came	O
to	O
an	O

under	O
a	O
little	O
point	O
of	O
land	O

which	O
was	O
pretty	O
high	O

and	O
the	O

I	O

no	O

to	O
the	O
boy	O

but	O
bade	O
him	O
lie	O
still	O

and	O
I	O
took	O
our	O
biggest	O
gun	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
almost	O
musket-bore	O
,	O
and	O
loaded	O
it	O
with	O
a	O
good	O
charge	O
of	O
powder	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
two	O
slugs	O
,	O
and	O
laid	O
it	O
down	O
;	O
then	O
I	O
loaded	O
another	O
gun	O
with	O
two	O
bullets	O

the	O
third	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
three	O

I	O
loaded	O

five	O

I	O
took	O
the	O
best	O
aim	O
I	O
could	O
with	O
the	O
first	O
piece	O
to	O
have	O
shot	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
head	O

but	O
he	O
lay	O
so	O
with	O
his	O
leg	O
raised	O
a	O
little	O
above	O
his	O
nose	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
slugs	O
hit	O
his	O
leg	O
about	O
the	O
knee	O

broke	O
the	O
bone	O

He	O
started	O
up	O

growling	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
but	O
finding	O
his	O
leg	O
broken	O
,	O
fell	O
down	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
got	O
upon	O
three	O
legs	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
the	O
most	O
hideous	O
roar	O
that	O
ever	O
I	O
heard	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
surprised	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
hit	O
him	O
on	O
the	O
head	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
up	O
the	O
second	O
piece	O
immediately	O
,	O
and	O
though	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
move	O
off	O
,	O
fired	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
shot	O
him	O
in	O
the	O

had	O
the	O
pleasure	O
to	O
see	O
him	O
drop	O
and	O
make	O
but	O
little	O
noise	O
,	O
but	O
lie	O
struggling	O
for	O
life	O

Then	O
Xury	O
took	O
heart	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
have	O
me	O
let	O
him	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

``	O
Well	O
,	O
go	O
,	O
''	O
said	O
I	O
:	O
so	O
the	O
boy	O
jumped	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
and	O
taking	O
a	O
little	O
gun	O
in	O
one	O
hand	O
,	O
swam	O
to	O
shore	O
with	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
coming	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
creature	O
,	O
put	O
the	O
muzzle	O
of	O
the	O
piece	O
to	O
his	O
ear	O
,	O
and	O
shot	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
head	O
again	O
,	O
which	O
despatched	O
him	O
quite	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
game	O
indeed	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
this	O
was	O
no	O
food	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
sorry	O
to	O
lose	O
three	O
charges	O
of	O
powder	O
and	O
shot	O
upon	O
a	O
creature	O
that	O
was	O
good	O
for	O
nothing	O
to	O
us	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
Xury	O
said	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
some	O
of	O
him	O
;	O
so	O
he	O
comes	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
asked	O
me	O
to	O
give	O
him	O
the	O
hatchet	O
.	O

``	O
For	O
what	O
,	O
Xury	O
?	O
''	O

said	O
I.	O
``	O
Me	O
cut	O
off	O
his	O
head	O

''	O
said	O
he	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
Xury	O
could	O
not	O
cut	O
off	O
his	O
head	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
cut	O
off	O
a	O
foot	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
it	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
monstrous	O
great	O
one	O
.	O

I	O
bethought	O
myself	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
perhaps	O
the	O
skin	O
of	O
him	O
might	O
,	O
one	O
way	O
or	O
other	O
,	O
be	O
of	O
some	O
value	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
take	O
off	O
his	O
skin	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
.	O

So	O
Xury	O
and	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
him	O
;	O
but	O
Xury	O
was	O
much	O
the	O
better	O
workman	O
at	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
knew	O
very	O
ill	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
it	O
took	O
us	O
both	O
up	O
the	O
whole	O
day	O
,	O
but	O
at	O
last	O
we	O
got	O
off	O
the	O
hide	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
spreading	O
it	O
on	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
our	O
cabin	O

the	O
sun	O
effectually	O
dried	O
it	O
in	O
two	O

CHAPTER	O
III	O
--	O
WRECKED	O
ON	O
A	O
DESERT	O
ISLAND	O
After	O
this	O
stop	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
on	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
continually	O
for	O
ten	O
or	O
twelve	O
days	O
,	O
living	O
very	O
sparingly	O
on	O
our	O
provisions	O
,	O
which	O
began	O
to	O
abate	O
very	O
much	O
,	O
and	O
going	O
no	O
oftener	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
than	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
for	O
fresh	O
water	O
.	O

My	O
design	O
in	O
this	O
was	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
river	O
Gambia	PNM
or	O
Senegal	PNM
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
anywhere	O
about	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
de	PNM
Verde	PNM
,	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
hopes	O
to	O
meet	O
with	O
some	O
European	O
ship	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
,	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
course	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
take	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
seek	O
for	O
the	O
islands	O
,	O
or	O
perish	O
there	O
among	O
the	O
negroes	O
.	O

I	O
knew	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
ships	O
from	O
Europe	PNM
,	O
which	O
sailed	O
either	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Guinea	PNM
or	O
to	O
Brazil	PNM
,	O
or	O
to	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
,	O
made	O
this	O
cape	O
,	O
or	O
those	O
islands	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
I	O
put	O
the	O
whole	O
of	O
my	O
fortune	O
upon	O
this	O
single	O
point	O
,	O
either	O
that	O
I	O
must	O
meet	O
with	O
some	O
ship	O
or	O
must	O
perish	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
had	O
pursued	O
this	O
resolution	O
about	O
ten	O
days	O
longer	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
the	O
land	O
was	O
inhabited	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
places	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
sailed	O
by	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
people	O
stand	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
us	O
;	O
we	O
could	O
also	O
perceive	O
they	O
were	O
quite	O
black	O
and	O
naked	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
once	O
inclined	O
to	O
have	O
gone	O
on	O
shore	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
Xury	O
was	O
my	O
better	O
counsellor	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
``	O
No	O
go	O
,	O
no	O
go	O
.	O
''	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
hauled	O
in	O
nearer	O
the	O
shore	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
talk	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
found	O
they	O
ran	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
by	O
me	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
.	O

I	O
observed	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
weapons	O
in	O
their	O
hand	O
,	O
except	O
one	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
a	O
long	O
slender	O
stick	O
,	O
which	O
Xury	O
said	O
was	O
a	O
lance	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
throw	O
them	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
with	O
good	O
aim	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
kept	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
but	O
talked	O
with	O
them	O
by	O
signs	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
;	O
and	O
particularly	O
made	O
signs	O
for	O
something	O
to	O
eat	O
:	O
they	O
beckoned	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
stop	O
my	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
would	O
fetch	O
me	O
some	O
meat	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
I	O
lowered	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
my	O
sail	O
and	O
lay	O
by	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
ran	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
half-an-hour	O
came	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
with	O
them	O
two	O
pieces	O
of	O
dried	O
flesh	O
and	O
some	O
corn	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
is	O
the	O
produce	O
of	O
their	O
country	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
neither	O
knew	O
what	O
the	O
one	O
or	O
the	O
other	O
was	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
willing	O
to	O
accept	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
how	O
to	O
come	O
at	O
it	O
was	O
our	O
next	O
dispute	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
venture	O
on	O
shore	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
as	O
much	O
afraid	O
of	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
took	O
a	O
safe	O
way	O
for	O
us	O
all	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
brought	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
and	O
laid	O
it	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
and	O
stood	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
off	O
till	O
we	O
fetched	O
it	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
came	O
close	O
to	O
us	O
again	O
.	O

We	O
made	O
signs	O
of	O
thanks	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
amends	O
;	O
but	O
an	O
opportunity	O
offered	O
that	O
very	O
instant	O
to	O
oblige	O
them	O
wonderfully	O
;	O
for	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
lying	O
by	O
the	O
shore	O
came	O
two	O
mighty	O
creatures	O
,	O
one	O
pursuing	O
the	O
other	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
we	O
took	O
it	O
-RRB-	O
with	O
great	O
fury	O
from	O
the	O
mountains	O
towards	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
male	O
pursuing	O
the	O
female	O
,	O
or	O
whether	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
sport	O
or	O
in	O
rage	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
,	O
any	O
more	O
than	O
we	O
could	O
tell	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
usual	O
or	O
strange	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
believe	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
latter	O
;	O
because	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
,	O
those	O
ravenous	O
creatures	O
seldom	O
appear	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
second	O
place	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
people	O
terribly	O
frighted	O
,	O
especially	O
the	O
women	O
.	O

The	O
man	O
that	O
had	O
the	O
lance	O
or	O
dart	O
did	O
not	O
fly	O
from	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
rest	O
did	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
two	O
creatures	O
ran	O
directly	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
offer	O
to	O
fall	O
upon	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
negroes	O
,	O
but	O
plunged	O
themselves	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
swam	O
about	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
come	O
for	O
their	O
diversion	O
;	O
at	O
last	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
began	O
to	O
come	O
nearer	O
our	O
boat	O
than	O
at	O
first	O
I	O
expected	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
lay	O
ready	O
for	O
him	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
loaded	O
my	O
gun	O
with	O
all	O
possible	O
expedition	O
,	O
and	O
bade	O
Xury	O
load	O
both	O
the	O
others	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
came	O
fairly	O
within	O
my	O
reach	O
,	O
I	O
fired	O
,	O
and	O
shot	O
him	O
directly	O
in	O
the	O
head	O
;	O
immediately	O
he	O
sank	O
down	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
but	O
rose	O
instantly	O
,	O
and	O
plunged	O
up	O
and	O
down	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
were	O
struggling	O
for	O
life	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
indeed	O
he	O
was	O
;	O
he	O
immediately	O
made	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
but	O
between	O
the	O
wound	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
his	O
mortal	O
hurt	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
strangling	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
he	O
died	O
just	O
before	O
he	O
reached	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
impossible	O
to	O
express	O
the	O
astonishment	O
of	O
these	O
poor	O
creatures	O
at	O
the	O
noise	O
and	O
fire	O
of	O
my	O
gun	O
:	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
even	O
ready	O
to	O
die	O
for	O
fear	O
,	O
and	O
fell	O
down	O
as	O
dead	O
with	O
the	O
very	O
terror	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
they	O
saw	O
the	O
creature	O
dead	O
,	O
and	O
sunk	O
in	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
made	O

to	O
them	O
to	O

search	O
for	O
the	O
creature	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
him	O
by	O
his	O
blood	O
staining	O
the	O
water	O
;	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
a	O
rope	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
slung	O
round	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
the	O
negroes	O
to	O
haul	O
,	O
they	O
dragged	O
him	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
most	O
curious	O
leopard	O
,	O
spotted	O
,	O
and	O
fine	O
to	O
an	O
admirable	O
degree	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
negroes	O
held	O
up	O
their	O
hands	O
with	O
admiration	O
,	O
to	O
think	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
I	O
had	O
killed	O
him	O
with	O
.	O

The	O
other	O
creature	O
,	O
frighted	O
with	O
the	O
flash	O
of	O
fire	O
and	O
the	O
noise	O
of	O
the	O
gun	O
,	O
swam	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
ran	O
up	O
directly	O
to	O
the	O
mountains	O
from	O
whence	O
they	O
came	O
;	O
nor	O
could	O
I	O
,	O
at	O
that	O
distance	O
,	O
know	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
quickly	O
the	O
negroes	O
wished	O
to	O
eat	O
the	O
flesh	O
of	O
this	O
creature	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
was	O
willing	O
to	O
have	O
them	O
take	O
it	O
as	O
a	O
favour	O
from	O
me	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
them	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
take	O
him	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
thankful	O
for	O
.	O

Immediately	O
they	O
fell	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
knife	O
,	O
yet	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
sharpened	O
piece	O
of	O
wood	O
,	O
they	O
took	O
off	O
his	O
skin	O
as	O
readily	O
,	O
and	O
much	O
more	O
readily	O
,	O
than	O
we	O
could	O
have	O
done	O
with	O
a	O
knife	O
.	O

They	O
offered	O
me	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
flesh	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
declined	O
,	O
pointing	O
out	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
give	O
it	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
made	O
signs	O
for	O
the	O
skin	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
gave	O
me	O
very	O
freely	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
me	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
more	O
of	O
their	O
provisions	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
accepted	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
them	O
for	O
some	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
held	O
out	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
jars	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
turning	O
it	O
bottom	O
upward	O
,	O
to	O
show	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
empty	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
have	O
it	O
filled	O
.	O

They	O
called	O
immediately	O
to	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
friends	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
came	O
two	O
women	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
a	O
great	O
vessel	O
made	O
of	O
earth	O
,	O
and	O
burnt	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
supposed	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
this	O
they	O
set	O
down	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
sent	O
Xury	O
on	O
shore	O
with	O
my	O
jars	O
,	O
and	O
filled	O
them	O
all	O
three	O
.	O

The	O
women	O
were	O
as	O
naked	O
as	O
the	O
men	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
now	O
furnished	O
with	O
roots	O
and	O
corn	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
and	O
water	O
;	O
and	O
leaving	O
my	O
friendly	O
negroes	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
forward	O
for	O
about	O
eleven	O
days	O
more	O
,	O
without	O
offering	O
to	O
go	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
till	O
I	O
saw	O
the	O
land	O
run	O
out	O
a	O
great	O
length	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
at	O
about	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
leagues	O
before	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
sea	O
being	O
very	O
calm	O
,	O
I	O
kept	O
a	O
large	O
offing	O
to	O
make	O
this	O
point	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
,	O
doubling	O
the	O
point	O
,	O
at	O
about	O
two	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
I	O
saw	O
plainly	O
land	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
,	O
to	O
seaward	O
;	O
then	O
I	O
concluded	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
most	O
certain	O
indeed	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
de	PNM
Verde	PNM
,	O
and	O
those	O
the	O
islands	O
called	O
,	O
from	O
thence	O
,	O
Cape	PNM
de	PNM
Verde	PNM
Islands	PNM
.	O

However	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
well	O
tell	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
best	O
to	O
do	O
;	O
for	O
if	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
taken	O
with	O
a	O
fresh	O
of	O
wind	O
,	O
I	O
might	O
neither	O
reach	O
one	O
or	O
other	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
dilemma	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
pensive	O
,	O
I	O
stepped	O
into	O
the	O
cabin	O
and	O
sat	O
down	O
,	O
Xury	O
having	O
the	O
helm	O
;	O
when	O
,	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
,	O
the	O
boy	O
cried	O
out	O
,	O
``	O
Master	O
,	O
master	O
,	O
a	O
ship	O
with	O
a	O
sail	O
!	O
''	O

and	O
the	O
foolish	O
boy	O
was	O
frighted	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
wits	O
,	O
thinking	O
it	O
must	O
needs	O
be	O
some	O
of	O
his	O
master	O
's	O
ships	O
sent	O
to	O
pursue	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
knew	O
we	O
were	O
far	O
enough	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
reach	O
.	O

I	O
jumped	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
cabin	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
saw	O
,	O
not	O
only	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
Portuguese	O
ship	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
was	O
bound	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Guinea	PNM
,	O
for	O
negroes	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
observed	O
the	O
course	O
she	O
steered	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
soon	O
convinced	O
they	O
were	O
bound	O
some	O
other	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
design	O
to	O
come	O
any	O
nearer	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
I	O
stretched	O
out	O
to	O
sea	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
resolving	O
to	O
speak	O
with	O
them	O
if	O
possible	O
.	O

With	O
all	O
the	O
sail	O
I	O
could	O
make	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
I	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
come	O
in	O
their	O
way	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
gone	O
by	O
before	O
I	O
could	O
make	O
any	O
signal	O
to	O
them	O
:	O
but	O
after	O
I	O
had	O
crowded	O
to	O
the	O
utmost	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
despair	O
,	O
they	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
saw	O
by	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
their	O
glasses	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
some	O
European	O
boat	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
supposed	O
must	O
belong	O
to	O
some	O
ship	O
that	O
was	O
lost	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
shortened	O
sail	O
to	O
let	O
me	O
come	O
up	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
encouraged	O
with	O
this	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
my	O
patron	O
's	O
ancient	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
waft	O
of	O
it	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
a	O
signal	O
of	O
distress	O
,	O
and	O
fired	O
a	O
gun	O
,	O
both	O
which	O
they	O
saw	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
told	O
me	O
they	O
saw	O
the	O
smoke	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
hear	O
the	O
gun	O

Upon	O
these	O

they	O
very	O
kindly	O
brought	O
to	O

lay	O
by	O
for	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
about	O
three	O
hours	O
;	O
time	O
I	O
came	O
up	O
with	O
them	O

They	O
asked	O
me	O
what	O
I	O
was	O
,	O
in	O
Portuguese	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
Spanish	O
,	O
and	O
in	O

I	O
understood	O
none	O

but	O
at	O
last	O
a	O
Scotch	O
sailor	O

who	O
was	O
on	O

called	O
to	O
me	O

very	O
kindly	O

me	O
in	O

all	O

a	O

I	O

I	O
proposed	O
to	O
myself	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
neighbour	O

a	O
Portuguese	O

of	O

born	O
of	O

in	O

such	O
circumstances	O
as	O
I	O
was	O

I	O
call	O
him	O
my	O
neighbour	O
,	O
because	O
his	O
plantation	O
lay	O
next	O
to	O
mine	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
very	O
sociably	O
together	O

My	O
stock	O
was	O
but	O
low	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
his	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
rather	O
planted	O
for	O
food	O
than	O
anything	O
else	O
,	O
for	O
about	O
two	O
years	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
increase	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
land	O
began	O
to	O
come	O
into	O
order	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
third	O
year	O
we	O
planted	O
some	O
tobacco	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
each	O
of	O
us	O
a	O
large	O
piece	O
of	O

ready	O
for	O
planting	O
canes	O
in	O
the	O

to	O
come	O

But	O
we	O
both	O
wanted	O

and	O
now	O
I	O
found	O

more	O
than	O

done	O
wrong	O
in	O

my	O

alas	O

for	O
me	O
to	O
do	O

that	O
never	O

was	O
no	O
great	O

I	O
hail	O
no	O

to	O
go	O
on	O

I	O

directly	O

never	O

myself	O

I	O

upon	O
what	O

me	O

and	O
,	O
after	O
enjoining	O
me	O
to	O

they	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
mind	O
to	O
fit	O
out	O
a	O

to	O
go	O

that	O
they	O
had	O
all	O

were	O
straitened	O

nothing	O

that	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
trade	O
that	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
carried	O
on	O

because	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
publicly	O
sell	O
the	O
negroes	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
home	O

so	O
they	O
desired	O
to	O
make	O
but	O
one	O
voyage	O
,	O
to	O
bring	O
the	O
negroes	O
on	O
shore	O
privately	O

them	O

and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O

,	O
the	O
question	O
was	O
whether	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
their	O
supercargo	O

to	O
manage	O
the	O
trading	O
part	O
upon	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O

they	O

me	O
that	O

the	O

without	O

This	O
was	O

must	O

it	O

made	O
to	O
any	O
one	O
that	O
had	O

a	O

for	O
me	O

that	O

had	O
nothing	O

that	O

for	O
me	O
to	O

the	O

thing	O
that	O

In	O

for	O

during	O
these	O

I	O

In	O
this	O

the	O

found	O
that	O

twenty-two	O

from	O

so	O
that	O
he	O
found	O

was	O
upon	O

the	O

began	O

what	O

he	O
should	O
take	O

for	O
the	O
ship	O

I	O
was	O

looking	O
over	O
the	O

concluded	O
there	O

for	O
us	O
to	O
have	O
recourse	O

and	O
therefore	O
resolved	O

which	O
,	O
by	O
keeping	O
off	O
at	O

avoid	O
the	O

we	O
might	O

as	O
we	O
hoped	O

in	O
about	O
fifteen	O
days	O

whereas	O
we	O
could	O
not	O

without	O

both	O
to	O

With	O
this	O
design	O
we	O
changed	O
our	O
course	O

steered	O
away	O
N.W.	O
by	O

in	O

to	O
reach	O
some	O
of	O
our	O

hoped	O
for	O

But	O
our	O

was	O
otherwise	O
determined	O

for	O

being	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
twelve	O
degrees	O
eighteen	O
minutes	O
,	O
a	O
second	O
storm	O
came	O
upon	O
us	O

which	O
carried	O
us	O
away	O
with	O
the	O

impetuosity	O
westward	O

and	O
drove	O
us	O
so	O
out	O
of	O
the	O

of	O
all	O
human	O
commerce	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
had	O
all	O
our	O

we	O
were	O
rather	O

one	O
of	O

early	O
in	O
the	O

cried	O
out	O

``	O

and	O
we	O
had	O
no	O

run	O
out	O

look	O
out	O

in	O
hopes	O

in	O
the	O

we	O
were	O

the	O

in	O
a	O

that	O
we	O

It	O
is	O

for	O
any	O
one	O
who	O

not	O
been	O
in	O
the	O

the	O

in	O

We	O

nothing	O

whether	O
an	O

the	O
main	O

whether	O
inhabited	O
or	O

As	O
the	O
rage	O
of	O
the	O
wind	O
was	O
still	O
great	O
,	O
though	O
rather	O
less	O
than	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
hope	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
ship	O
hold	O
many	O
minutes	O
without	O
breaking	O

should	O

In	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
we	O
sat	O
looking	O
upon	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
and	O
expecting	O
death	O
every	O

,	O
and	O
every	O

accordingly	O

preparing	O
for	O
another	O

for	O
there	O
was	O
little	O
or	O
nothing	O
more	O
for	O
us	O
to	O

in	O
this	O

That	O
which	O
was	O
our	O
present	O
comfort	O

and	O
all	O
the	O
comfort	O
we	O
had	O
,	O
was	O
that	O

contrary	O
to	O
our	O
expectation	O
,	O
the	O
ship	O
did	O
not	O
break	O
yet	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
master	O
said	O
the	O
wind	O
began	O
to	O
abate	O

Now	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
thought	O
that	O
the	O

did	O
a	O
little	O
abate	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
ship	O
having	O
thus	O
struck	O
upon	O
the	O

and	O
sticking	O
too	O
fast	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
expect	O
her	O
getting	O
off	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
a	O
dreadful	O
condition	O
indeed	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
but	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
saving	O
our	O
lives	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
boat	O
at	O
our	O
stern	O
just	O
before	O
the	O
storm	O
,	O
but	O
she	O
was	O
first	O
staved	O
by	O
dashing	O
against	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
rudder	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
place	O
she	O
broke	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
either	O
sunk	O
or	O
was	O
driven	O
off	O
to	O
sea	O
;	O
so	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
hope	O
from	O
her	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
another	O
boat	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
but	O
how	O
to	O
get	O
her	O
off	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
was	O
a	O
doubtful	O
thing	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
time	O
to	O
debate	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
fancied	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
would	O
break	O
in	O
pieces	O
every	O
minute	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
told	O
us	O
she	O
was	O
actually	O
broken	O
already	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
distress	O
the	O
mate	O
of	O
our	O
vessel	O
laid	O
hold	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
got	O
her	O
slung	O
over	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
side	O
;	O
and	O
getting	O
all	O
into	O
her	O
,	O
let	O
go	O
,	O
and	O
committed	O
ourselves	O
,	O
being	O
eleven	O
in	O
number	O
,	O
to	O
God	O
's	O
mercy	O
and	O
the	O
wild	O
sea	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
the	O
storm	O
was	O
abated	O
considerably	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
sea	O
ran	O
dreadfully	O
high	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
be	O
well	O
called	O
_	O
den	O
wild	O
zee	O
_	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
Dutch	O
call	O
the	O
sea	O
in	O
a	O
storm	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
our	O
case	O
was	O
very	O
dismal	O
indeed	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
all	O
saw	O
plainly	O
that	O
the	O
sea	O
went	O
so	O
high	O
that	O
the	O
boat	O
could	O
not	O
live	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
inevitably	O
drowned	O
.	O

As	O
to	O
making	O
sail	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
none	O
,	O
nor	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
could	O
we	O
have	O
done	O
anything	O
with	O
it	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
worked	O
at	O
the	O
oar	O
towards	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
though	O
with	O
heavy	O
hearts	O
,	O
like	O
men	O
going	O
to	O
execution	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
all	O
knew	O
that	O
when	O
the	O
boat	O
came	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
she	O
would	O
be	O
dashed	O
in	O
a	O
thousand	O
pieces	O
by	O
the	O
breach	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
committed	O
our	O
souls	O
to	O
God	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
earnest	O
manner	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
wind	O
driving	O
us	O
towards	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
we	O
hastened	O
our	O
destruction	O
with	O
our	O
own	O
hands	O
,	O
pulling	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
towards	O
land	O

What	O
the	O
shore	O
was	O
,	O
whether	O
rock	O
or	O
sand	O
,	O
whether	O
steep	O
or	O
shoal	O

we	O
knew	O
not	O

The	O
only	O
hope	O
that	O
could	O
rationally	O
give	O
us	O
the	O
least	O
shadow	O
of	O
expectation	O
was	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
might	O
find	O
some	O
bay	O
or	O
gulf	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
some	O
river	O
,	O
where	O
by	O
great	O
chance	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
run	O
our	O
boat	O
in	O
,	O
or	O
got	O
under	O
the	O
lee	O
of	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
made	O
smooth	O
water	O
.	O

But	O
there	O
was	O
nothing	O
like	O
this	O
appeared	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
we	O
made	O
nearer	O
and	O
nearer	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
the	O
land	O
looked	O
more	O
frightful	O
than	O
the	O
sea	O
.	O

After	O
we	O
had	O
rowed	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
driven	O
about	O
a	O
league	O
and	O
a	O
half	O

as	O
we	O
reckoned	O
it	O
,	O
a	O
raging	O
wave	O

mountain-like	O

came	O
rolling	O
astern	O
of	O

and	O
plainly	O
bade	O
us	O
expect	O
the	O
_	O
coup	O
de	O

It	O
took	O
us	O
with	O
such	O
a	O
fury	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
overset	O
the	O
boat	O
at	O
once	O
;	O
and	O
separating	O
us	O
as	O
well	O
from	O
the	O
boat	O
as	O
from	O

gave	O

at	O
once	O
twenty	O
or	O
thirty	O
feet	O
deep	O
in	O
its	O
own	O
body	O

and	O
I	O
could	O
feel	O
myself	O
carried	O
with	O
a	O
mighty	O
force	O
and	O
swiftness	O
towards	O
the	O
shore	O
--	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
way	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
held	O
my	O
breath	O
,	O
and	O
assisted	O
myself	O
to	O
swim	O
still	O
forward	O
with	O
all	O
my	O
might	O

I	O
was	O
ready	O
to	O
burst	O
with	O
holding	O
my	O
breath	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
felt	O
myself	O
rising	O
up	O
,	O
so	O
,	O
to	O
my	O
immediate	O
relief	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
my	O
head	O
and	O
hands	O
shoot	O
out	O
above	O
the	O
surface	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
two	O
seconds	O
of	O

that	O
I	O
could	O
keep	O
myself	O
so	O

yet	O
it	O
relieved	O
me	O
greatly	O
,	O
gave	O
me	O
breath	O
,	O
and	O
new	O
courage	O

I	O
was	O
covered	O
again	O
with	O
water	O
a	O
good	O
while	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
so	O
long	O
but	O
I	O
held	O
it	O
out	O
;	O
and	O
finding	O
the	O
water	O
had	O
spent	O
itself	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
return	O
,	O
I	O
struck	O
forward	O
against	O
the	O
return	O
of	O
the	O
waves	O
,	O
and	O
felt	O
ground	O
again	O
with	O
my	O
feet	O

I	O
stood	O
still	O
a	O
few	O
moments	O
to	O
recover	O
breath	O
,	O
and	O
till	O
the	O
waters	O
went	O
from	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
took	O
to	O
my	O
heels	O
and	O
ran	O
with	O
what	O
strength	O
I	O
had	O
further	O
towards	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

But	O
neither	O
would	O
this	O
deliver	O
me	O
from	O
the	O
fury	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
which	O
came	O
pouring	O
in	O
after	O
me	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
twice	O
more	O
I	O
was	O
lifted	O
up	O
by	O
the	O
waves	O
and	O
carried	O
forward	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
the	O
shore	O
being	O
very	O
flat	O
.	O

The	O
last	O
time	O
of	O
these	O
two	O
had	O
well-nigh	O
been	O
fatal	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
sea	O
having	O
hurried	O
me	O
along	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
landed	O
me	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
dashed	O
me	O

against	O
a	O
piece	O

that	O
with	O
such	O
force	O

that	O
it	O
left	O
me	O
senseless	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
helpless	O

as	O
to	O
my	O
own	O
deliverance	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
blow	O
taking	O
my	O
side	O

beat	O
the	O

as	O

out	O
of	O
my	O

;	O
and	O
had	O
it	O
returned	O
again	O
immediately	O
,	O
I	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
strangled	O
in	O
the	O
water	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
recovered	O
a	O
little	O
before	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

,	O
and	O
seeing	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
covered	O
again	O
with	O
the	O

,	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
hold	O
fast	O
by	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O

and	O
so	O
to	O

I	O
held	O

till	O
the	O

abated	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
fetched	O
another	O

which	O
brought	O
me	O
so	O
near	O
the	O

that	O
the	O
next	O

though	O
it	O
went	O
over	O

did	O
not	O

me	O
up	O

me	O
away	O

I	O
took	O

to	O
the	O

where	O

to	O
my	O
great	O
comfort	O

I	O
clambered	O
up	O
the	O
cliffs	O

sat	O
me	O
down	O
upon	O

free	O
from	O

quite	O
out	O

with	O
the	O

part	O

that	O

in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
dreadful	O
deliverance	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
wet	O
,	O
had	O
no	O

to	O

me	O

nor	O
anything	O
either	O
to	O
eat	O
or	O
drink	O
to	O
comfort	O
me	O
;	O
neither	O
did	O
I	O
see	O
any	O

that	O
of	O
perishing	O
with	O
hunger	O
or	O
being	O
devoured	O
by	O
wild	O
beasts	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
which	O
was	O
particularly	O
afflicting	O
to	O
me	O
was	O

that	O
I	O
had	O
no	O

nothing	O

a	O

a	O

and	O
a	O

in	O
a	O
box	O

This	O
was	O
all	O
my	O

this	O
threw	O
me	O
into	O
such	O
terrible	O
agonies	O
of	O
mind	O

that	O
for	O
a	O
while	O
I	O
ran	O
about	O
like	O

coming	O
upon	O
me	O

began	O
with	O

the	O

at	O
that	O
time	O
was	O
to	O
get	O
up	O
into	O
a	O
thick	O
bushy	O

like	O
a	O
fir	O

thorny	O

which	O
grew	O
near	O

where	O
I	O

sit	O
all	O

the	O
next	O
day	O
what	O
death	O
I	O
should	O
die	O
,	O
for	O
as	O
yet	O
I	O
saw	O
no	O
prospect	O
of	O

I	O
walked	O
about	O
a	O
furlong	O
from	O
the	O

to	O
see	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
find	O
any	O
fresh	O
water	O
to	O
drink	O

which	O
I	O
did	O

to	O
my	O
great	O
joy	O

and	O
put	O
a	O
little	O
tobacco	O

my	O
mouth	O
to	O
prevent	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
the	O

CHAPTER	O
IV	O
--	O
FIRST	O
WEEKS	O
ON	O
THE	O
ISLAND	O
When	O
I	O
waked	O
it	O
was	O
broad	O
day	O
,	O
the	O
weather	O
clear	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
storm	O
abated	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
sea	O
did	O
not	O
rage	O
and	O
swell	O
as	O
before	O
.	O

But	O
that	O
which	O
surprised	O
me	O
most	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
lifted	O
off	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
from	O
the	O
sand	O
where	O
she	O
lay	O
by	O
the	O
swelling	O
of	O
the	O
tide	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
driven	O
up	O
almost	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
rock	O
which	O
I	O
at	O
first	O
mentioned	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
bruised	O
by	O
the	O
wave	O
dashing	O
me	O
against	O
it	O
.	O

This	O
being	O
within	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
ship	O
seeming	O
to	O
stand	O
upright	O
still	O
,	O
I	O
wished	O
myself	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
that	O
at	O
least	O
I	O
might	O
save	O
some	O
necessary	O
things	O
for	O
my	O
use	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
came	O
down	O
from	O
my	O
apartment	O
in	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
I	O
looked	O
about	O
me	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
I	O
found	O
was	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
which	O
lay	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
wind	O
and	O
the	O
sea	O
had	O
tossed	O
her	O
up	O
,	O
upon	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
about	O
two	O
miles	O
on	O
my	O
right	O
hand	O
.	O

I	O
walked	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
to	O
have	O
got	O
to	O
her	O
;	O
but	O
found	O
a	O
neck	O
or	O
inlet	O
of	O
water	O
between	O
me	O
and	O
the	O
boat	O
which	O
was	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
broad	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
came	O
back	O
for	O
the	O
present	O
,	O
being	O
more	O
intent	O
upon	O
getting	O
at	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
hoped	O
to	O
find	O
something	O
for	O
my	O
present	O
subsistence	O
.	O

A	O
little	O
after	O
noon	O
I	O
found	O
the	O
sea	O
very	O
calm	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
tide	O
ebbed	O
so	O
far	O
out	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
come	O
within	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

And	O
here	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
fresh	O
renewing	O
of	O
my	O
grief	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
saw	O
evidently	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
kept	O
on	O
board	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
all	O
safe	O
--	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
all	O
got	O
safe	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
so	O
miserable	O
as	O
to	O
be	O
left	O
entirely	O
destitute	O
of	O
all	O
comfort	O
and	O
company	O
as	O
I	O
now	O
was	O
.	O

This	O
forced	O
tears	O
to	O
my	O
eyes	O
again	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
there	O
was	O
little	O
relief	O
in	O
that	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
to	O
get	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
pulled	O
off	O
my	O
clothes	O
--	O
for	O
the	O
weather	O
was	O
hot	O
to	O
extremity	O
--	O
and	O
took	O
the	O
water	O
.	O

But	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
my	O
difficulty	O
was	O
still	O
greater	O
to	O
know	O
how	O
to	O
get	O
on	O
board	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
she	O
lay	O
aground	O
,	O
and	O
high	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
nothing	O
within	O
my	O
reach	O
to	O
lay	O
hold	O
of	O
.	O

I	O
swam	O
round	O
her	O
twice	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
second	O
time	O
I	O
spied	O
a	O
small	O
piece	O
of	O
rope	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
wondered	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
see	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
hung	O
down	O
by	O
the	O
fore-chains	O
so	O
low	O
,	O
as	O
that	O
with	O
great	O
difficulty	O
I	O
got	O
hold	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
that	O
rope	O
I	O
got	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
forecastle	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

Here	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
bulged	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
water	O
in	O
her	O
hold	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
she	O
lay	O
so	O
on	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
a	O
bank	O
of	O
hard	O
sand	O
,	O
or	O
,	O
rather	O
earth	O
,	O
that	O
her	O
stern	O
lay	O
lifted	O
up	O
upon	O
the	O
bank	O
,	O
and	O
her	O
head	O
low	O
,	O
almost	O
to	O
the	O
water	O
.	O

By	O
this	O
means	O
all	O
her	O
quarter	O
was	O
free	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
that	O
was	O
in	O
that	O
part	O
was	O
dry	O
;	O
for	O
you	O
may	O
be	O
sure	O
my	O
first	O
work	O
was	O
to	O
search	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
was	O
spoiled	O
and	O
what	O
was	O
free	O
.	O

And	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
provisions	O
were	O
dry	O
and	O
untouched	O
by	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
very	O
well	O
disposed	O
to	O
eat	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
bread	O
room	O
and	O
filled	O
my	O
pockets	O
with	O
biscuit	O
,	O
and	O
ate	O
it	O
as	O
I	O
went	O
about	O
other	O
things	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
time	O
to	O
lose	O
.	O

I	O
also	O
found	O
some	O
rum	O
in	O
the	O
great	O
cabin	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
took	O
a	O
large	O
dram	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
need	O
enough	O
of	O
to	O
spirit	O
me	O
for	O
what	O
was	O
before	O
me	O
.	O

Now	O
I	O
wanted	O
nothing	O
but	O
a	O
boat	O
to	O
furnish	O
myself	O
with	O
many	O
things	O
which	O
I	O
foresaw	O
would	O
be	O
very	O
necessary	O
to	O
me	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
in	O
vain	O
to	O
sit	O
still	O
and	O
wish	O
for	O
what	O
was	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
had	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
extremity	O
roused	O
my	O
application	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
several	O
spare	O
yards	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
large	O
spars	O
of	O
wood	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
spare	O
topmast	O
or	O
two	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
fall	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
these	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
flung	O
as	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
overboard	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
manage	O
for	O
their	O
weight	O
,	O
tying	O
every	O
one	O
with	O
a	O
rope	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
not	O
drive	O
away	O
.	O

When	O
this	O
was	O
done	O
I	O
went	O
down	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
pulling	O
them	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
tied	O
four	O
of	O
them	O
together	O
at	O
both	O
ends	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
a	O
raft	O
,	O
and	O
laying	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
short	O
pieces	O
of	O
plank	O
upon	O
them	O
crossways	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
I	O
could	O
walk	O
upon	O
it	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
bear	O
any	O
great	O
weight	O
,	O
the	O
pieces	O
being	O
too	O
light	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
a	O
carpenter	O
's	O
saw	O
I	O
cut	O
a	O
spare	O
topmast	O
into	O
three	O
lengths	O
,	O
and	O
added	O
them	O
to	O
my	O
raft	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
labour	O
and	O
pains	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
hope	O
of	O
furnishing	O
myself	O
with	O
necessaries	O
encouraged	O
me	O
to	O
go	O
beyond	O
what	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
have	O
done	O
upon	O
another	O
occasion	O
.	O

My	O
raft	O
was	O
now	O
strong	O
enough	O
to	O
bear	O
any	O
reasonable	O
weight	O
.	O

My	O
next	O
care	O
was	O
what	O
to	O
load	O
it	O
with	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
to	O
preserve	O
what	O
I	O
laid	O
upon	O
it	O
from	O
the	O
surf	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
long	O
considering	O
this	O
.	O

I	O
first	O
laid	O
all	O
the	O
planks	O
or	O
boards	O
upon	O
it	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
get	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
considered	O
well	O
what	O
I	O
most	O
wanted	O
,	O
I	O
got	O
three	O
of	O
the	O
seamen	O
's	O
chests	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
broken	O
open	O
,	O
and	O
emptied	O
,	O
and	O
lowered	O
them	O
down	O
upon	O
my	O
raft	O
;	O
the	O
first	O
of	O
these	O
I	O
filled	O
with	O
provisions	O
--	O
viz.	O
bread	O
,	O
rice	O
,	O
three	O
Dutch	O
cheeses	O
,	O
five	O
pieces	O
of	O
dried	O
goat	O
's	O
flesh	O
-LRB-	O
which	O
we	O
lived	O
much	O
upon	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
remainder	O
of	O
European	O
corn	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
laid	O
by	O
for	O
some	O
fowls	O
which	O
we	O
brought	O
to	O
sea	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
fowls	O
were	O
killed	O
.	O

There	O
had	O
been	O
some	O
barley	O
and	O
wheat	O
together	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
to	O
my	O
great	O
disappointment	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
afterwards	O
that	O
the	O
rats	O
had	O
eaten	O
or	O
spoiled	O
it	O
all	O
.	O

As	O
for	O
liquors	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
several	O
,	O
cases	O
of	O
bottles	O
belonging	O
to	O
our	O
skipper	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
were	O
some	O
cordial	O
waters	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
all	O
,	O
about	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
gallons	O
of	O
rack	O
.	O

These	O
I	O
stowed	O
by	O
themselves	O
,	O
there	O
being	O
no	O
need	O
to	O
put	O
them	O
into	O
the	O
chest	O
,	O
nor	O
any	O
room	O
for	O
them	O
.	O

While	O
I	O
was	O
doing	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
the	O
tide	O
begin	O
to	O
flow	O
,	O
though	O
very	O
calm	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
mortification	O
to	O
see	O
my	O
coat	O
,	O
shirt	O
,	O
and	O
waistcoat	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
left	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
upon	O
the	O
sand	O
,	O
swim	O
away	O
.	O

As	O
for	O
my	O
breeches	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
only	O
linen	O
,	O
and	O
open-kneed	O
,	O
I	O
swam	O
on	O
board	O
in	O
them	O
and	O
my	O
stockings	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
this	O
set	O
me	O
on	O
rummaging	O
for	O
clothes	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
found	O
enough	O
,	O
but	O
took	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
I	O
wanted	O
for	O
present	O
use	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
others	O
things	O
which	O
my	O
eye	O
was	O
more	O
upon	O
--	O
as	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
tools	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

And	O
it	O
was	O
after	O
long	O
searching	O
that	O
I	O
found	O
out	O
the	O
carpenter	O
's	O
chest	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
a	O
very	O
useful	O
prize	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
much	O
more	O
valuable	O
than	O
a	O
shipload	O
of	O
gold	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
.	O

I	O
got	O
it	O
down	O
to	O
my	O
raft	O
,	O
whole	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
without	O
losing	O
time	O
to	O
look	O
into	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
knew	O
in	O
general	O
what	O
it	O
contained	O
.	O

My	O
next	O
care	O
was	O
for	O
some	O
ammunition	O
and	O
arms	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
two	O
very	O
good	O
fowling-pieces	O
in	O
the	O
great	O
cabin	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
pistols	O
.	O

These	O
I	O
secured	O
first	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
powder-horns	O
and	O
a	O
small	O
bag	O
of	O
shot	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
old	O
rusty	O
swords	O
.	O

I	O
knew	O
there	O
were	O
three	O
barrels	O
of	O
powder	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
but	O
knew	O
not	O
where	O
our	O
gunner	O
had	O
stowed	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
with	O
much	O
search	O
I	O
found	O
them	O
,	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
dry	O
and	O
good	O
,	O
the	O
third	O
had	O
taken	O
water	O
.	O

Those	O
two	O
I	O
got	O
to	O
my	O
raft	O
with	O
the	O
arms	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
I	O
thought	O
myself	O
pretty	O
well	O
freighted	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
think	O
how	O
I	O
should	O
get	O
to	O
shore	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
having	O
neither	O
sail	O
,	O
oar	O
,	O
nor	O
rudder	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
least	O
capful	O
of	O
wind	O
would	O
have	O
overset	O
all	O
my	O
navigation	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
three	O
encouragements	O
--	O
1st	O
,	O
a	O
smooth	O
,	O
calm	O
sea	O
;	O
2ndly	O
,	O
the	O
tide	O
rising	O
,	O
and	O
setting	O
in	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
3rdly	O
,	O
what	O
little	O
wind	O
there	O
was	O
blew	O
me	O
towards	O
the	O
land	O
.	O

And	O
thus	O
,	O
having	O
found	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
broken	O
oars	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
--	O
and	O
,	O
besides	O
the	O
tools	O
which	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
chest	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
two	O
saws	O
,	O
an	O
axe	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
hammer	O
;	O
with	O
this	O
cargo	O
I	O
put	O
to	O
sea	O
.	O

For	O
a	O
mile	O
or	O
thereabouts	O
my	O
raft	O
went	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
only	O
that	O
I	O
found	O
it	O
drive	O
a	O
little	O
distant	O
from	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
I	O
had	O
landed	O
before	O
;	O
by	O
which	O
I	O
perceived	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
some	O
indraft	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
I	O
hoped	O
to	O
find	O
some	O
creek	O
or	O
river	O
there	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
might	O
make	O
use	O
of	O
as	O
a	O
port	O
to	O
get	O
to	O
land	O
with	O
my	O
cargo	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
imagined	O
,	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
.	O

There	O
appeared	O
before	O
me	O
a	O
little	O
opening	O
of	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
strong	O
current	O
of	O
the	O
tide	O
set	O
into	O
it	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
guided	O
my	O
raft	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
to	O
keep	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
stream	O
.	O

But	O
here	O
I	O
had	O
like	O
to	O
have	O
suffered	O
a	O
second	O
shipwreck	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
verily	O
would	O
have	O
broken	O
my	O
heart	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
knowing	O
nothing	O
of	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
my	O
raft	O
ran	O
aground	O
at	O
one	O
end	O
of	O
it	O
upon	O
a	O
shoal	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
being	O
aground	O
at	O
the	O
other	O
end	O
,	O
it	O
wanted	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
that	O
all	O
my	O
cargo	O
had	O
slipped	O
off	O
towards	O
the	O
end	O
that	O
was	O
afloat	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
fallen	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
.	O

I	O
did	O
my	O
utmost	O
,	O
by	O
setting	O
my	O
back	O
against	O
the	O
chests	O
,	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
in	O
their	O
places	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
not	O
thrust	O
off	O
the	O
raft	O
with	O
all	O
my	O
strength	O
;	O
neither	O
durst	O
I	O
stir	O
from	O
the	O
posture	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
;	O
but	O
holding	O
up	O
the	O
chests	O
with	O
all	O
my	O
might	O
,	O
I	O
stood	O
in	O
that	O
manner	O
near	O
half-an-hour	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
time	O
the	O
rising	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
brought	O
me	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
upon	O
a	O
level	O
;	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
after	O
,	O
the	O
water	O
still-rising	O
,	O
my	O
raft	O
floated	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
thrust	O
her	O
off	O
with	O
the	O
oar	O
I	O
had	O
into	O
the	O
channel	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
driving	O
up	O
higher	O
,	O
I	O
at	O
length	O
found	O
myself	O
in	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
a	O
little	O
river	O
,	O
with	O
land	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
strong	O
current	O
of	O
tide	O
running	O
up	O
.	O

I	O
looked	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
for	O
a	O
proper	O
place	O
to	O
get	O
to	O
shore	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
willing	O
to	O
be	O
driven	O
too	O
high	O
up	O
the	O
river	O
:	O
hoping	O
in	O
time	O
to	O
see	O
some	O
ships	O
at	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
resolved	O
to	O
place	O
myself	O
as	O
near	O
the	O
coast	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
I	O
spied	O
a	O
little	O
cove	O
on	O
the	O
right	O
shore	O
of	O
the	O
creek	O
,	O
to	O
which	O
with	O
great	O
pain	O
and	O
difficulty	O
I	O
guided	O
my	O
raft	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
got	O
so	O
near	O
that	O
,	O
reaching	O
ground	O
with	O
my	O
oar	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
thrust	O
her	O
directly	O
in	O
.	O

But	O
here	O
I	O
had	O
like	O
to	O
have	O
dipped	O
all	O
my	O
cargo	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
again	O
;	O
for	O
that	O
shore	O
lying	O
pretty	O
steep	O
--	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
sloping	O
--	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
place	O
to	O
land	O
,	O
but	O
where	O
one	O
end	O
of	O
my	O
float	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
ran	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
would	O
lie	O
so	O
high	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
sink	O
lower	O
,	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
endanger	O
my	O
cargo	O
again	O
.	O

All	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
do	O
was	O
to	O
wait	O
till	O
the	O
tide	O
was	O
at	O
the	O
highest	O
,	O
keeping	O
the	O
raft	O
with	O
my	O
oar	O
like	O
an	O
anchor	O
,	O
to	O
hold	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
it	O
fast	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
near	O
a	O
flat	O
piece	O
of	O
ground	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
expected	O
the	O
water	O
would	O
flow	O
over	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
it	O
did	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
found	O
water	O
enough	O
--	O
for	O
my	O
raft	O
drew	O
about	O
a	O
foot	O
of	O
water	O
--	O
I	O
thrust	O
her	O
upon	O
that	O
flat	O
piece	O
of	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
fastened	O
or	O
moored	O
her	O
,	O
by	O
sticking	O
my	O
two	O
broken	O
oars	O
into	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
one	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
near	O
one	O
end	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
near	O
the	O
other	O
end	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
I	O
lay	O
till	O
the	O
water	O
ebbed	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
my	O
raft	O
and	O
all	O
my	O
cargo	O
safe	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

My	O
next	O
work	O
was	O
to	O
view	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
seek	O
a	O
proper	O
place	O
for	O
my	O
habitation	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
to	O
stow	O
my	O
goods	O
to	O
secure	O
them	O
from	O
whatever	O
might	O
happen	O
.	O

Where	O
I	O
was	O
,	O
I	O
yet	O
knew	O
not	O
;	O
whether	O
on	O
the	O
continent	O
or	O
on	O
an	O
island	O
;	O
whether	O
inhabited	O
or	O
not	O
inhabited	O
;	O
whether	O
in	O
danger	O
of	O
wild	O
beasts	O
or	O
not	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
hill	O
not	O
above	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
me	O
,	O
which	O
rose	O
up	O
very	O
steep	O
and	O
high	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
seemed	O
to	O
overtop	O
some	O
other	O
hills	O
,	O
which	O
lay	O
as	O
in	O
a	O
ridge	O
from	O
it	O
northward	O
.	O

I	O
took	O
out	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
fowling-pieces	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
pistols	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
horn	O
of	O
powder	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
armed	O
,	O
I	O
travelled	O
for	O
discovery	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
that	O
hill	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
after	O
I	O
had	O
with	O
great	O
labour	O
and	O
difficulty	O
got	O
to	O
the	O
top	O
,	O
I	O
saw	O
my	O
fate	O
,	O
to	O
my	O
great	O
affliction	O
--	O
viz.	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
an	O
island	O
environed	O
every	O
way	O
with	O
the	O
sea	O
:	O
no	O
land	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
except	O
some	O
rocks	O
,	O
which	O
lay	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
off	O
;	O
and	O
two	O
small	O
islands	O
,	O
less	O
than	O
this	O
,	O
which	O
lay	O
about	O
three	O
leagues	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
also	O
that	O
the	O
island	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
was	O
barren	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
saw	O
good	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
,	O
uninhabited	O
except	O
by	O
wild	O
beasts	O
,	O
of	O
whom	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
saw	O
none	O
.	O

Yet	O
I	O
saw	O
abundance	O
of	O
fowls	O
,	O
but	O
knew	O
not	O
their	O
kinds	O
;	O
neither	O
when	O
I	O
killed	O
them	O
could	O
I	O
tell	O
what	O
was	O
fit	O
for	O
food	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
not	O
.	O

At	O
my	O
coming	O
back	O
,	O
I	O
shot	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
bird	O
which	O
I	O
saw	O
sitting	O
upon	O
a	O
tree	O
on	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
a	O
great	O
wood	O
.	O

I	O
believe	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
gun	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
fired	O
there	O
since	O
the	O
creation	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
no	O
sooner	O
fired	O
,	O
than	O
from	O
all	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
wood	O
there	O
arose	O
an	O
innumerable	O
number	O
of	O
fowls	O
,	O
of	O
many	O
sorts	O
,	O
making	O
a	O
confused	O
screaming	O
and	O
crying	O
,	O
and	O
every	O
one	O
according	O
to	O
his	O
usual	O
note	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
of	O
any	O
kind	O
that	O
I	O
knew	O
.	O

As	O
for	O
the	O
creature	O
I	O
killed	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
hawk	O
,	O
its	O
colour	O
and	O
beak	O
resembling	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
had	O
no	O
talons	O
or	O
claws	O
more	O
than	O
common	O
.	O

Its	O
flesh	O
was	O
carrion	O
,	O
and	O
fit	O
for	O
nothing	O
.	O

Contented	O
with	O
this	O
discovery	O
,	O
I	O
came	O
back	O
to	O
my	O
raft	O
,	O
and	O
fell	O
to	O
work	O
to	O
bring	O
my	O
cargo	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
which	O
took	O
me	O
up	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
that	O
day	O
.	O

What	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
myself	O
at	O
night	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
,	O
nor	O
indeed	O
where	O
to	O
rest	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
afraid	O
to	O
lie	O
down	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
not	O
knowing	O
but	O
some	O
wild	O
beast	O
might	O
devour	O
me	O
,	O
though	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
afterwards	O
found	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
really	O
no	O
need	O
for	O
those	O
fears	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
I	O
barricaded	O
myself	O
round	O
with	O
the	O
chest	O
and	O
boards	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
brought	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
hut	O
for	O
that	O
night	O
's	O
lodging	O
.	O

As	O
for	O
food	O
,	O
I	O
yet	O
saw	O
not	O
which	O
way	O
to	O
supply	O
myself	O
,	O
except	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
creatures	O
like	O
hares	O
run	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
wood	O
where	O
I	O
shot	O
the	O
fowl	O
.	O

I	O
now	O
began	O
to	O
consider	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
yet	O
get	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
things	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
which	O
would	O
be	O
useful	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
particularly	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
rigging	O
and	O
sails	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
other	O
things	O
as	O
might	O
come	O
to	O
land	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
make	O
another	O
voyage	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
vessel	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
.	O

And	O
as	O
I	O
knew	O
that	O
the	O
first	O
storm	O
that	O
blew	O
must	O
necessarily	O
break	O
her	O
all	O
in	O
pieces	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
set	O
all	O
other	O
things	O
apart	O
till	O
I	O
had	O
got	O
everything	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
get	O
.	O

Then	O
I	O
called	O
a	O
council	O
--	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
in	O
my	O
thoughts	O
--	O
whether	O
I	O
should	O
take	O
back	O
the	O
raft	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
appeared	O
impracticable	O
:	O
so	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
tide	O
was	O
down	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
did	O
so	O
,	O
only	O
that	O
I	O
stripped	O
before	O
I	O
went	O
from	O
my	O
hut	O
,	O
having	O
nothing	O
on	O
but	O
my	O
chequered	O
shirt	O
,	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
linen	O
drawers	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
pumps	O
on	O
my	O
feet	O
.	O

I	O
got	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
prepared	O
a	O
second	O
raft	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
had	O
experience	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
,	O
I	O
neither	O
made	O
this	O
so	O
unwieldy	O
,	O
nor	O
loaded	O
it	O
so	O
hard	O
,	O
but	O
yet	O
I	O
brought	O
away	O
several	O
things	O
very	O
useful	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
as	O
first	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
carpenters	O
stores	O
I	O
found	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
bags	O
full	O
of	O
nails	O
and	O
spikes	O
,	O
a	O
great	O
screw-jack	O
,	O
a	O
dozen	O
or	O
two	O
of	O
hatchets	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
above	O
all	O
,	O
that	O
most	O
useful	O
thing	O
called	O
a	O
grindstone	O
.	O

All	O
these	O
I	O
secured	O
,	O
together	O
with	O
several	O
things	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
gunner	O
,	O
particularly	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
iron	O
crows	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
barrels	O
of	O
musket	O
bullets	O
,	O
seven	O
muskets	O
,	O
another	O
fowling-piece	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
small	O
quantity	O
of	O
powder	O
more	O
;	O
a	O
large	O
bagful	O
of	O
small	O
shot	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
roll	O
of	O
sheet-lead	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
last	O
was	O
so	O
heavy	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
hoist	O
it	O
up	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
over	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
side	O
.	O

Besides	O
these	O
things	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
all	O
the	O
men	O
's	O
clothes	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
find	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
spare	O
fore-topsail	O
,	O
a	O
hammock	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
bedding	O
;	O
and	O
with	O
this	O
I	O
loaded	O
my	O
second	O
raft	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
them	O
all	O
safe	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
to	O
my	O
very	O
great	O
comfort	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
under	O
some	O
apprehension	O
,	O
during	O
my	O
absence	O
from	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
that	O
at	O
least	O
my	O
provisions	O
might	O
be	O
devoured	O
on	O
shore	O
:	O
but	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
back	O
I	O
found	O
no	O
sign	O
of	O
any	O
visitor	O
;	O
only	O
there	O
sat	O
a	O
creature	O
like	O
a	O
wild	O
cat	O
upon	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
chests	O

which	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
towards	O
it	O

ran	O
away	O
a	O
little	O

and	O
then	O
stood	O
still	O

She	O
sat	O
very	O
composed	O
and	O
unconcerned	O

and	O
looked	O
full	O
in	O
my	O

as	O
if	O
she	O
had	O
a	O
mind	O
to	O

I	O
presented	O
my	O

at	O
her	O

but	O
,	O
as	O
she	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
it	O

she	O
was	O
perfectly	O
unconcerned	O
at	O
it	O
,	O
nor	O
did	O
she	O
offer	O
to	O
stir	O
away	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
I	O
tossed	O
her	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
biscuit	O

though	O
by	O
the	O

I	O
was	O
not	O
very	O
free	O
of	O
it	O

for	O
my	O

was	O
not	O
great	O

however	O

I	O
spared	O
her	O
a	O
bit	O

I	O
say	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
went	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
smelled	O
at	O
it	O

ate	O
it	O

and	O
looked	O
-LRB-	O

for	O
more	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
thanked	O
her	O

and	O
could	O
spare	O
no	O
more	O

so	O
she	O
marched	O
off	O

Having	O
got	O
my	O

cargo	O
on	O

I	O
went	O
to	O

make	O
me	O
a	O
little	O

with	O
the	O

some	O

which	O
I	O
cut	O
for	O
that	O

into	O
this	O

I	O

everything	O
that	O
I	O
knew	O

I	O
piled	O

up	O
in	O

done	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
blocked	O
up	O
the	O
door	O
of	O
the	O
tent	O
with	O
some	O
boards	O
within	O
,	O
and	O
an	O
empty	O
chest	O
set	O
up	O
on	O
end	O
without	O
;	O
and	O
spreading	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
beds	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
laying	O
my	O
two	O
pistols	O
just	O
at	O
my	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
gun	O
at	O
length	O
by	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
bed	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
slept	O
very	O
quietly	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
weary	O
and	O
heavy	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
night	O
before	O
I	O
had	O
slept	O
little	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
laboured	O
very	O
hard	O
all	O
day	O
to	O
fetch	O
all	O
those	O
things	O
from	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
get	O
them	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
biggest	O
magazine	O
of	O
all	O
kinds	O
now	O
that	O
ever	O
was	O
laid	O
up	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
,	O
for	O
one	O
man	O
:	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
satisfied	O
still	O
,	O
for	O
while	O
the	O
ship	O
sat	O
upright	O
in	O
that	O
posture	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O
ought	O
to	O
get	O
everything	O
out	O
of	O
her	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
;	O
so	O
every	O
day	O
at	O
low	O
water	O
I	O
went	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
away	O
something	O
or	O
other	O
;	O
but	O
particularly	O
the	O
third	O
time	O
I	O
went	O
I	O
brought	O
away	O
as	O
much	O
of	O
the	O
rigging	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
as	O
also	O
all	O
the	O
small	O
ropes	O
and	O
rope-twine	O
I	O
could	O
get	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
spare	O
canvas	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
to	O
mend	O
the	O
sails	O
upon	O
occasion	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
barrel	O
of	O
wet	O
gunpowder	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
I	O
brought	O
away	O
all	O
the	O
sails	O
,	O
first	O
and	O
last	O
;	O
only	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
fain	O
to	O
cut	O
them	O
in	O
pieces	O
,	O
and	O
bring	O
as	O
much	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
no	O
more	O
useful	O
to	O
be	O
sails	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
mere	O
canvas	O
only	O
.	O

But	O
that	O
which	O
comforted	O
me	O
more	O
still	O
,	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
last	O
of	O
all	O
,	O
after	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
such	O
voyages	O
as	O
these	O
,	O
and	O
thought	O
I	O
had	O
nothing	O
more	O
to	O
expect	O
from	O
the	O
ship	O
that	O
was	O
worth	O
my	O
meddling	O
with	O
--	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
after	O
all	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
great	O
hogshead	O
of	O
bread	O
,	O
three	O
large	O
runlets	O
of	O
rum	O
,	O
or	O
spirits	O
,	O
a	O
box	O
of	O
sugar	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
barrel	O
of	O
fine	O
flour	O
;	O
this	O
was	O
surprising	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
had	O
given	O
over	O
expecting	O
any	O
more	O
provisions	O
,	O
except	O
what	O
was	O
spoiled	O
by	O
the	O
water	O
.	O

I	O
soon	O
emptied	O
the	O
hogshead	O
of	O
the	O
bread	O
,	O
and	O
wrapped	O
it	O
up	O
,	O
parcel	O
by	O
parcel	O
,	O
in	O
pieces	O
of	O
the	O
sails	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
cut	O
out	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
I	O
got	O
all	O
this	O
safe	O
on	O
shore	O
also	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
I	O
made	O
another	O
voyage	O
,	O
and	O
now	O
,	O
having	O
plundered	O
the	O
ship	O
of	O
what	O
was	O
portable	O
and	O
fit	O
to	O
hand	O
out	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
with	O
the	O
cables	O
.	O

Cutting	O
the	O
great	O
cable	O
into	O
pieces	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
move	O
,	O
I	O
got	O
two	O
cables	O
and	O
a	O
hawser	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
ironwork	O
I	O
could	O
get	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
cut	O
down	O
the	O
spritsail-yard	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
mizzen-yard	O
,	O
and	O
everything	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
large	O
raft	O
,	O
I	O
loaded	O
it	O
with	O
all	O
these	O
heavy	O
goods	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
away	O
.	O

But	O
my	O
good	O
luck	O
began	O
now	O
to	O
leave	O
me	O
;	O
for	O
this	O
raft	O
was	O
so	O
unwieldy	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
overladen	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
after	O
I	O
had	O
entered	O
the	O
little	O
cove	O
where	O
I	O
had	O
landed	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
my	O
goods	O
,	O
not	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
guide	O
it	O
so	O
handily	O
as	O
I	O
did	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
it	O
overset	O
,	O
and	O
threw	O
me	O
and	O
all	O
my	O
cargo	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
.	O

As	O
for	O
myself	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
no	O
great	O
harm	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
to	O
my	O
cargo	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
lost	O
,	O
especially	O
the	O
iron	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
expected	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
of	O
great	O
use	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
tide	O
was	O
out	O
,	O
I	O
got	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
pieces	O
of	O
the	O
cable	O
ashore	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
iron	O
,	O
though	O
with	O
infinite	O
labour	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
fain	O
to	O
dip	O
for	O
it	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
a	O
work	O
which	O
fatigued	O
me	O
very	O
much	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
every	O
day	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
away	O
what	O
I	O
could	O
get	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
been	O
now	O
thirteen	O
days	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
been	O
eleven	O
times	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
time	O
I	O
had	O
brought	O
away	O
all	O
that	O
one	O
pair	O
of	O
hands	O
could	O
well	O
be	O
supposed	O
capable	O
to	O
bring	O
;	O
though	O
I	O
believe	O
verily	O
,	O
had	O
the	O
calm	O
weather	O
held	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
brought	O
away	O
the	O
whole	O
ship	O
,	O
piece	O
by	O
piece	O
.	O

But	O
preparing	O
the	O
twelfth	O
time	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
the	O
wind	O
began	O
to	O
rise	O
:	O
however	O
,	O
at	O
low	O
water	O
I	O
went	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
though	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O
had	O
rummaged	O
the	O
cabin	O
so	O
effectually	O
that	O
nothing	O
more	O
could	O
be	O
found	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
discovered	O
a	O
locker	O
with	O
drawers	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
found	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
razors	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
pair	O
of	O
large	O
scissors	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
ten	O
or	O
a	O
dozen	O
of	O
good	O
knives	O
and	O
forks	O
:	O
in	O
another	O
I	O
found	O
about	O
thirty-six	O
pounds	O
value	O
in	O
money	O
--	O
some	O
European	O
coin	O
,	O
some	O
Brazil	O
,	O
some	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
,	O
some	O
gold	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
silver	O
.	O

I	O
smiled	O
to	O
myself	O
at	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
this	O
money	O
:	O
``	O
O	O
drug	O
!	O
''	O

said	O
I	O
,	O
aloud	O
,	O
``	O
what	O
art	O

Thou	O

However	O
,	O
upon	O
second	O
thoughts	O
I	O
took	O
it	O
away	O
;	O
and	O
wrapping	O
all	O
this	O
in	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
canvas	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
making	O
another	O
raft	O
;	O
but	O
while	O
I	O
was	O
preparing	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
the	O
sky	O
overcast	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
wind	O
began	O
to	O
rise	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
it	O
blew	O
a	O
fresh	O
gale	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

It	O
presently	O
occurred	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
vain	O
to	O
pretend	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
raft	O
with	O
the	O
wind	O
offshore	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
my	O
business	O
to	O
be	O
gone	O
before	O
the	O
tide	O
of	O
flood	O
began	O
,	O
otherwise	O
I	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
reach	O
the	O
shore	O
at	O
all	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
I	O
let	O
myself	O
down	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
swam	O
across	O
the	O
channel	O
,	O
which	O
lay	O
between	O
the	O
ship	O
and	O
the	O
sands	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
that	O
with	O
difficulty	O
enough	O
,	O
partly	O
with	O
the	O
weight	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
I	O
had	O
about	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
partly	O
the	O
roughness	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
wind	O
rose	O
very	O
hastily	O
,	O
and	O
before	O
it	O
was	O
quite	O
high	O
water	O
it	O
blew	O
a	O
storm	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
had	O
got	O
home	O
to	O
my	O
little	O
tent	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
lay	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
my	O
wealth	O
about	O
me	O
,	O
very	O
secure	O
.	O

It	O
blew	O
very	O
hard	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
looked	O
out	O
,	O
behold	O
,	O
no	O
more	O
ship	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
!	O

I	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
surprised	O
,	O
but	O
recovered	O
myself	O
with	O
the	O
satisfactory	O
reflection	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
lost	O
no	O
time	O
,	O
nor	O
abated	O
any	O
diligence	O
,	O
to	O
get	O
everything	O
out	O
of	O
her	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
useful	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
little	O
left	O
in	O
her	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
bring	O
away	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
had	O
more	O
time	O
.	O

I	O
now	O
gave	O
over	O
any	O
more	O
thoughts	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
or	O
of	O
anything	O
out	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
except	O
what	O
might	O
drive	O
on	O
shore	O
from	O
her	O
wreck	O
;	O
as	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
divers	O
pieces	O
of	O
her	O
afterwards	O
did	O
;	O
but	O
those	O
things	O
were	O
of	O
small	O
use	O
to	O
me	O
.	O

My	O
thoughts	O
were	O
now	O
wholly	O
employed	O
about	O
securing	O
myself	O
against	O
either	O
savages	O
,	O
if	O
any	O
should	O
appear	O
,	O
or	O
wild	O
beasts	O
,	O
if	O
any	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
many	O
thoughts	O
of	O
the	O
method	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
this	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
dwelling	O
to	O
make	O
--	O
whether	O
I	O
should	O
make	O
me	O
a	O
cave	O
in	O
the	O
earth	O
,	O
or	O
a	O
tent	O
upon	O
the	O
earth	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
upon	O
both	O
;	O
the	O
manner	O
and	O
description	O
of	O
which	O
,	O
it	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
improper	O
to	O
give	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
.	O

I	O
soon	O
found	O
the	O
place	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
was	O
not	O
fit	O
for	O
my	O
settlement	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
upon	O
a	O
low	O
,	O
moorish	O
ground	O
,	O
near	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
believed	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
wholesome	O
,	O
and	O
more	O
particularly	O
because	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
fresh	O
water	O
near	O
it	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
find	O
a	O
more	O
healthy	O
and	O
more	O
convenient	O
spot	O
of	O
ground	O
.	O

I	O
consulted	O
several	O
things	O
in	O
my	O
situation	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
found	O
would	O
be	O
proper	O
for	O
me	O
:	O
1st	O
,	O
health	O
and	O
fresh	O
water	O
,	O
I	O
just	O
now	O
mentioned	O
;	O
2ndly	O
,	O
shelter	O
from	O
the	O
heat	O
of	O
the	O
sun	O
;	O
3rdly	O
,	O
security	O
from	O
ravenous	O
creatures	O
,	O
whether	O
man	O
or	O
beast	O
;	O
4thly	O
,	O
a	O
view	O
to	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
God	O
sent	O
any	O
ship	O
in	O
sight	O
,	O
I	O
might	O
not	O
lose	O
any	O
advantage	O
for	O
my	O
deliverance	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
willing	O
to	O
banish	O
all	O
my	O
expectation	O
yet	O
.	O

In	O
search	O
of	O
a	O
place	O
proper	O
for	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
little	O
plain	O
on	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
a	O
rising	O
hill	O
,	O
whose	O
front	O
towards	O
this	O
little	O
plain	O
was	O
steep	O
as	O
a	O
house-side	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
nothing	O
could	O
come	O
down	O
upon	O
me	O
from	O
the	O
top	O

On	O
the	O
one	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
rock	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
hollow	O
place	O
,	O
worn	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
in	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
entrance	O
or	O
door	O
of	O
a	O
cave	O
but	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
really	O
any	O
cave	O
or	O
way	O
into	O
the	O
rock	O
at	O
all	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
flat	O
of	O
the	O
green	O
,	O
just	O
before	O
this	O
hollow	O
place	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
pitch	O
my	O
tent	O
.	O

This	O
plain	O
was	O
not	O
above	O
a	O
hundred	O
yards	O
broad	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
twice	O
as	O
long	O
,	O
and	O
lay	O
like	O
a	O
green	O
before	O
my	O
door	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
descended	O
irregularly	O
every	O
way	O
down	O
into	O
the	O
low	O
ground	O
by	O
the	O
seaside	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
N.N.W.	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
sheltered	O
from	O
the	O
heat	O
every	O
day	O
,	O
till	O
it	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
W.	O
and	O
by	O
S.	O
sun	O
,	O
or	O
thereabouts	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
in	O
those	O
countries	O
,	O
is	O
near	O
the	O
setting	O
.	O

Before	O
I	O
set	O
up	O
my	O
tent	O
I	O
drew	O
a	O
half-circle	O
before	O
the	O
hollow	O
place	O
,	O
which	O
took	O
in	O
about	O
ten	O
yards	O
in	O
its	O
semi-diameter	O
from	O
the	O
rock	O
,	O
and	O
twenty	O
yards	O
in	O
its	O
diameter	O
from	O
its	O
beginning	O
and	O
ending	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
half-circle	O
I	O
pitched	O
two	O
rows	O
of	O
strong	O
stakes	O
,	O
driving	O
them	O
into	O
the	O
ground	O
till	O
they	O
stood	O
very	O
firm	O
like	O
piles	O
,	O
the	O
biggest	O
end	O
being	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ground	O
above	O
five	O
feet	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
,	O
and	O
sharpened	O
on	O
the	O
top	O
.	O

The	O
two	O
rows	O
did	O
not	O
stand	O
above	O
six	O
inches	O
from	O
one	O
another	O
.	O

Then	O
I	O
took	O
the	O
pieces	O
of	O
cable	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
cut	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
laid	O
them	O
in	O
rows	O
,	O
one	O
upon	O
another	O
,	O
within	O
the	O
circle	O
,	O
between	O
these	O
two	O
rows	O
of	O
stakes	O
,	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
top	O
,	O
placing	O
other	O
stakes	O
in	O
the	O
inside	O
,	O
leaning	O
against	O
them	O
,	O
about	O
two	O
feet	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
high	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
spur	O
to	O
a	O
post	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
fence	O
was	O
so	O
strong	O
,	O
that	O
neither	O
man	O
nor	O
beast	O
could	O
get	O
into	O
it	O
or	O
over	O
it	O
.	O

This	O
cost	O
me	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
time	O
and	O
labour	O
,	O
especially	O
to	O
cut	O
the	O
piles	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
bring	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
drive	O
them	O
into	O
the	O
earth	O
.	O

The	O
entrance	O
into	O
this	O
place	O
I	O
made	O
to	O
be	O
,	O
not	O
by	O
a	O
door	O
,	O
but	O
by	O
a	O
short	O
ladder	O
to	O
go	O
over	O
the	O
top	O
;	O
which	O
ladder	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
,	O
I	O
lifted	O
over	O
after	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
I	O
was	O
completely	O
fenced	O
in	O
and	O
fortified	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
from	O
all	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
slept	O
secure	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
which	O
otherwise	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
done	O
;	O
though	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
appeared	O
afterwards	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
need	O
of	O
all	O
this	O
caution	O
from	O
the	O
enemies	O
that	O
I	O
apprehended	O
danger	O
from	O
.	O

Into	O
this	O
fence	O
or	O
fortress	O
,	O
with	O
infinite	O
labour	O
,	O
I	O
carried	O
all	O
my	O
riches	O
,	O
all	O
my	O
provisions	O
,	O
ammunition	O
,	O
and	O
stores	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
you	O
have	O
the	O
account	O
above	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
large	O
tent	O
,	O
which	O
to	O
preserve	O
me	O
from	O
the	O
rains	O
that	O
in	O
one	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
are	O
very	O
violent	O
there	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
double	O
--	O
one	O
smaller	O
tent	O
within	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
larger	O
tent	O
above	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
covered	O
the	O
uppermost	O
with	O
a	O
large	O
tarpaulin	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
saved	O
among	O
the	O
sails	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
I	O
lay	O
no	O
more	O
for	O
a	O
while	O
in	O
the	O
bed	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
brought	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
a	O
hammock	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
indeed	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
one	O
,	O
and	O
belonged	O
to	O
the	O
mate	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

Into	O
this	O
tent	O
I	O
brought	O
all	O
my	O
provisions	O
,	O
and	O
everything	O
that	O
would	O
spoil	O
by	O
the	O
wet	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
thus	O
enclosed	O
all	O
my	O
goods	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
up	O
the	O
entrance	O
,	O
which	O
till	O
now	O
I	O
had	O
left	O
open	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
passed	O
and	O
repassed	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
by	O
a	O
short	O
ladder	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
work	O
my	O
way	O
into	O
the	O
rock	O
,	O
and	O
bringing	O
all	O
the	O
earth	O
and	O
stones	O
that	O
I	O
dug	O
down	O
out	O
through	O
my	O
tent	O
,	O
I	O
laid	O
them	O
up	O
within	O
my	O
fence	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
a	O
terrace	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
raised	O
the	O
ground	O
within	O
about	O
a	O
foot	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
I	O
made	O
me	O
a	O
cave	O
,	O
just	O
behind	O
my	O
tent	O
,	O
which	O
served	O
me	O
like	O
a	O
cellar	O
to	O
my	O
house	O
.	O

It	O
cost	O
me	O
much	O
labour	O
and	O
many	O
days	O
before	O
all	O
these	O
things	O
were	O
brought	O
to	O
perfection	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
I	O
must	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
some	O
other	O
things	O
which	O
took	O
up	O
some	O
of	O
my	O
thoughts	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
it	O
happened	O
,	O
after	O
I	O
had	O
laid	O
my	O
scheme	O
for	O
the	O
setting	O
up	O
my	O
tent	O
,	O
and	O
making	O
the	O
cave	O
,	O
that	O
a	O
storm	O
of	O
rain	O
falling	O
from	O
a	O
thick	O
,	O
dark	O
cloud	O
,	O
a	O
sudden	O
flash	O
of	O
lightning	O
happened	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
that	O
a	O
great	O
clap	O
of	O
thunder	O
,	O
as	O
is	O
naturally	O
the	O
effect	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
surprised	O
with	O
the	O
lightning	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
with	O
the	O
thought	O
which	O
darted	O
into	O
my	O
mind	O
as	O
swift	O
as	O
the	O
lightning	O
itself	O
--	O
Oh	O
,	O
my	O
powder	O
!	O

My	O
very	O
heart	O
sank	O
within	O
me	O
when	O
I	O
thought	O
that	O
,	O
at	O
one	O
blast	O
,	O
all	O
my	O
powder	O
might	O
be	O
destroyed	O
;	O
on	O
which	O
,	O
not	O
my	O
defence	O
only	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
providing	O
my	O
food	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
entirely	O
depended	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
nothing	O
near	O
so	O
anxious	O
about	O
my	O
own	O
danger	O
,	O
though	O
,	O
had	O
the	O
powder	O
took	O
fire	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
never	O
have	O
known	O
who	O
had	O
hurt	O
me	O
.	O

Such	O
impression	O
did	O
this	O
make	O
upon	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
after	O
the	O
storm	O
was	O
over	O
I	O
laid	O
aside	O
all	O
my	O
works	O
,	O
my	O
building	O
and	O
fortifying	O
,	O
and	O
applied	O
myself	O
to	O
make	O
bags	O
and	O
boxes	O
,	O
to	O
separate	O
the	O
powder	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
keep	O
it	O
a	O
little	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
in	O
a	O
parcel	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
hope	O
that	O
,	O
whatever	O
might	O
come	O
,	O
it	O
might	O
not	O
all	O
take	O
fire	O
at	O
once	O
;	O
and	O
to	O
keep	O
it	O
so	O
apart	O
that	O
it	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
possible	O
to	O
make	O
one	O
part	O
fire	O
another	O
.	O

I	O
finished	O
this	O
work	O
in	O
about	O
a	O
fortnight	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
my	O
powder	O
,	O
which	O
in	O
all	O
was	O
about	O
two	O
hundred	O
and	O
forty	O
pounds	O
weight	O
,	O
was	O
divided	O
in	O
not	O
less	O
than	O
a	O
hundred	O
parcels	O
.	O

As	O
to	O
the	O
barrel	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
wet	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
apprehend	O
any	O
danger	O
from	O
that	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
placed	O
it	O
in	O
my	O
new	O
cave	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
fancy	O
,	O
I	O
called	O
my	O
kitchen	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
rest	O
I	O
hid	O
up	O
and	O
down	O
in	O
holes	O
among	O
the	O
rocks	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
no	O
wet	O
might	O
come	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
marking	O
very	O
carefully	O
where	O
I	O
laid	O
it	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
interval	O
of	O
time	O
while	O
this	O
was	O
doing	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
out	O
once	O
at	O
least	O
every	O
day	O
with	O
my	O
gun	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
to	O
divert	O
myself	O
as	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
kill	O
anything	O
fit	O
for	O
food	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
near	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
to	O
acquaint	O
myself	O
with	O
what	O
the	O
island	O
produced	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
time	O
I	O
went	O
out	O
,	O
I	O
presently	O
discovered	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
goats	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
satisfaction	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
but	O
then	O
it	O
was	O
attended	O
with	O
this	O
misfortune	O
to	O
me	O
--	O
viz.	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
shy	O
,	O
so	O
subtle	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
swift	O
of	O
foot	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
most	O
difficult	O
thing	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
to	O
come	O
at	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
discouraged	O
at	O
this	O
,	O
not	O
doubting	O
but	O
I	O
might	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
shoot	O
one	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
soon	O
happened	O
;	O
for	O
after	O
I	O
had	O
found	O
their	O
haunts	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
I	O
laid	O
wait	O
in	O
this	O
manner	O
for	O
them	O
:	O
I	O
observed	O
if	O
they	O
saw	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
valleys	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
were	O
upon	O
the	O
rocks	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
run	O
away	O
,	O
as	O
in	O
a	O
terrible	O
fright	O
;	O
but	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
feeding	O
in	O
the	O
valleys	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
upon	O
the	O
rocks	O
,	O
they	O
took	O
no	O
notice	O
of	O
me	O
;	O
from	O
whence	O
I	O
concluded	O
that	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
position	O
of	O
their	O
optics	O
,	O
their	O
sight	O
was	O
so	O
directed	O
downward	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
readily	O
see	O
objects	O
that	O
were	O
above	O
them	O
;	O
so	O
afterwards	O
I	O
took	O
this	O
method	O
--	O
I	O
always	O
climbed	O
the	O
rocks	O
first	O
,	O
to	O
get	O
above	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
had	O
frequently	O
a	O
fair	O
mark	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
shot	O
I	O
made	O
among	O
these	O
creatures	O
,	O
I	O
killed	O
a	O
she-goat	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
a	O
little	O
kid	O
by	O
her	O
,	O
which	O
she	O
gave	O
suck	O
to	O
,	O
which	O
grieved	O
me	O
heartily	O
;	O
for	O
when	O
the	O
old	O
one	O
fell	O
,	O
the	O
kid	O
stood	O
stock	O
still	O
by	O
her	O
,	O
till	O
I	O
came	O
and	O
took	O
her	O
up	O
;	O
and	O
not	O
only	O
so	O
,	O
but	O
when	O
I	O
carried	O
the	O
old	O
one	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
upon	O
my	O
shoulders	O
,	O
the	O
kid	O
followed	O
me	O
quite	O
to	O
my	O
enclosure	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
I	O
laid	O
down	O
the	O
dam	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
the	O
kid	O
in	O
my	O
arms	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
it	O
over	O
my	O
pale	O
,	O
in	O
hopes	O
to	O
have	O
bred	O
it	O
up	O
tame	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
eat	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
kill	O
it	O
and	O
eat	O
it	O
myself	O
.	O

These	O
two	O
supplied	O
me	O
with	O
flesh	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
ate	O
sparingly	O
,	O
and	O
saved	O
my	O
provisions	O
,	O
my	O
bread	O
especially	O
,	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
possibly	O
I	O
could	O
.	O

Having	O
now	O
fixed	O
my	O
habitation	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
it	O
absolutely	O
necessary	O
to	O
provide	O
a	O
place	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
fire	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
fuel	O
to	O
burn	O
:	O
and	O
what	O
I	O
did	O
for	O
that	O
,	O
and	O
also	O
how	O
I	O
enlarged	O
my	O
cave	O

and	O
what	O

I	O
must	O
now	O
give	O
some	O

account	O
of	O

of	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
dismal	O
prospect	O
of	O
my	O
condition	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
cast	O
away	O
upon	O
that	O
island	O
without	O
being	O
driven	O
,	O
as	O
is	O
said	O

by	O
a	O
violent	O
storm	O
,	O
quite	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
our	O
intended	O
voyage	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
,	O
viz.	O
some	O
hundreds	O
of	O

,	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ordinary	O
course	O
of	O
the	O
trade	O
of	O
mankind	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
great	O
reason	O
to	O
consider	O
it	O
as	O
a	O
determination	O
of	O
Heaven	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
this	O
desolate	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
this	O
desolate	O
manner	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
end	O
my	O
life	O
.	O

The	O
tears	O
would	O
run	O
plentifully	O
down	O
my	O
face	O
when	O
I	O
made	O
these	O
reflections	O
;	O
and	O
sometimes	O
I	O
would	O
expostulate	O
with	O
myself	O
why	O
Providence	O
should	O
thus	O
completely	O
ruin	O
His	O
creatures	O
,	O
and	O
render	O
them	O
so	O
absolutely	O
miserable	O
;	O
so	O
without	O
help	O
,	O
abandoned	O
,	O
so	O
entirely	O
depressed	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
could	O
hardly	O
be	O
rational	O
to	O
be	O
thankful	O
for	O
such	O
a	O
life	O
.	O

But	O
something	O
always	O
returned	O
swift	O
upon	O
me	O
to	O
check	O
these	O
thoughts	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
reprove	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
particularly	O
one	O
day	O
,	O
walking	O
with	O
my	O
gun	O
in	O
my	O
hand	O
by	O
the	O
seaside	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
pensive	O
upon	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
my	O
present	O
condition	O

when	O

me	O

:	O
``	O

was	O
by	O

the	O
30th	O
of	O
September	O

when	O

in	O
the	O

in	O
the	O

,	O
as	O

made	O

got	O
several	O

not	O
at	O

less	O
useful	O

I	O

together	O
,	O
whether	O
I	O
might	O
want	O
them	O
or	O
no	O
;	O
also	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
three	O
very	O
good	O
Bibles	O
,	O
which	O
came	O
to	O
me	O
in	O
my	O
cargo	O
from	O
England	PNM

and	O
which	O
I	O
had	O

up	O

two	O

and	O
several	O
other	O
books	O

all	O
which	O
I	O
carefully	O
secured	O

And	O
I	O
must	O
not	O
forget	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
a	O
dog	O
and	O
two	O
cats	O
,	O
of	O
whose	O
eminent	O
history	O
I	O
may	O
have	O
occasion	O
to	O
say	O
something	O
in	O
its	O
place	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
carried	O
both	O
the	O
cats	O
with	O
me	O
;	O

as	O
for	O
the	O
dog	O

he	O
jumped	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
of	O
himself	O
,	O
and	O
swam	O
on	O
shore	O
to	O
me	O
the	O
day	O
after	O
I	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
with	O
my	O
first	O
cargo	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
a	O
trusty	O
servant	O
to	O
me	O
many	O
years	O
;	O
I	O
wanted	O
nothing	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
fetch	O
me	O

nor	O
any	O
company	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
make	O
up	O

only	O
wanted	O

him	O
talk	O
to	O
me	O

but	O
that	O
would	O
not	O
do	O

As	O
I	O
observed	O
before	O

I	O
found	O
pens	O

ink	O

I	O
husbanded	O
them	O
to	O
the	O

;	O

I	O
shall	O
show	O
that	O
while	O
my	O
ink	O
lasted	O
,	O
I	O
kept	O
things	O
very	O
exact	O
,	O

after	O
that	O
was	O
gone	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
make	O
any	O
ink	O
by	O
any	O
means	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
devise	O
.	O

And	O
this	O
put	O
me	O
in	O
mind	O
that	O
I	O
wanted	O
many	O
things	O
notwithstanding	O
all	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
amassed	O
together	O
;	O
and	O
of	O
these	O

ink	O
was	O
one	O

a	O

thread	O

as	O
for	O

I	O
soon	O
learned	O
to	O
want	O
that	O
without	O
much	O
difficulty	O

This	O
want	O
of	O
tools	O
made	O
every	O

did	O
go	O
on	O
heavily	O

it	O
was	O
near	O
a	O

more	O

by	O

in	O

so	O
that	O
I	O
spent	O
sometimes	O
two	O
days	O
in	O
cutting	O
and	O
bringing	O
home	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
posts	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
third	O
day	O
in	O
driving	O
it	O
into	O
the	O
ground	O
;	O
for	O
which	O
purpose	O
I	O
got	O
a	O
heavy	O
piece	O
of	O
wood	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
but	O
at	O
last	O
bethought	O
myself	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
iron	O
crows	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
found	O
it	O

made	O
driving	O
those	O
posts	O
or	O
piles	O
very	O
laborious	O
and	O
tedious	O
work	O
.	O

But	O
what	O
need	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
concerned	O
at	O
the	O
tediousness	O
of	O
anything	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
seeing	O
I	O
had	O
time	O
enough	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
in	O

nor	O
had	O
I	O
any	O
other	O
employment	O

if	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
over	O

at	O

the	O
ranging	O

I	O
did	O

more	O

every	O

after	O

-LRB-	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
year	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
-RRB-	O
I	O
raised	O

from	O

thatched	O

out	O

which	O
I	O
found	O
at	O
some	O
times	O
of	O
the	O

very	O
violent	O

I	O
have	O
already	O
observed	O
how	O
I	O
brought	O
all	O
my	O

into	O
this	O
pale	O
,	O
and	O
into	O
the	O
cave	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
behind	O
me	O

But	O
I	O
must	O
observe	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
that	O
at	O
first	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
confused	O
heap	O
of	O
goods	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
lay	O
in	O
no	O
order	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
took	O
up	O
all	O
my	O
place	O
;	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
room	O
to	O
turn	O
myself	O
:	O
so	O
I	O
set	O
myself	O
to	O
enlarge	O
my	O
cave	O
,	O
and	O
work	O
farther	O
into	O
the	O
earth	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
loose	O
sandy	O
rock	O
,	O
which	O
yielded	O
easily	O
to	O
the	O
labour	O
I	O
bestowed	O
on	O
it	O
:	O
and	O
so	O
when	O
I	O
found	O
I	O
was	O
pretty	O
safe	O
as	O
to	O
beasts	O
of	O
prey	O
,	O
I	O
worked	O
sideways	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
right	O
hand	O
,	O
into	O
the	O
rock	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
turning	O
to	O
the	O
right	O
again	O
,	O
worked	O
quite	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
me	O
a	O
door	O
to	O
come	O
out	O
on	O
the	O
outside	O
of	O
my	O
pale	O
or	O
fortification	O
.	O

This	O
gave	O
me	O
not	O
only	O
egress	O
and	O
regress	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
back	O
way	O
to	O
my	O
tent	O
and	O
to	O
my	O
storehouse	O
,	O
but	O
gave	O
me	O
room	O
to	O
store	O
my	O
goods	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
apply	O
myself	O
to	O
make	O
such	O
necessary	O
things	O
as	O
I	O
found	O
I	O
most	O
wanted	O
,	O
particularly	O
a	O
chair	O
and	O
a	O
table	O
;	O
for	O
without	O
these	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
enjoy	O
the	O
few	O
comforts	O
I	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
;	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
write	O
or	O
eat	O
,	O
or	O
do	O
several	O
things	O
,	O
with	O
so	O
much	O
pleasure	O
without	O
a	O
table	O
:	O
so	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
.	O

And	O
here	O
I	O
must	O
needs	O
observe	O
,	O
that	O
as	O
reason	O
is	O
the	O
substance	O
and	O
origin	O
of	O
the	O
mathematics	O
,	O
so	O
by	O
stating	O
and	O
squaring	O
everything	O
by	O
reason	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
making	O
the	O
most	O
rational	O
judgment	O
of	O
things	O
,	O
every	O
man	O
may	O
be	O
,	O
in	O
time	O
,	O
master	O
of	O
every	O
mechanic	O
art	O

I	O
had	O
never	O
handled	O
a	O
tool	O
in	O
my	O
life	O
;	O
and	O
yet	O
,	O
in	O
time	O
,	O
by	O
labour	O
,	O
application	O
,	O
and	O
contrivance	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
at	O
last	O
that	O
I	O
wanted	O
nothing	O
but	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
made	O
it	O
,	O
especially	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
had	O
tools	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
abundance	O
of	O
things	O
,	O
even	O
without	O
tools	O
;	O
and	O
some	O
with	O
no	O
more	O
tools	O
than	O
an	O
adze	O
and	O
a	O
hatchet	O
,	O
which	O
perhaps	O
were	O
never	O
made	O
that	O
way	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
with	O
infinite	O
labour	O
.	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
wanted	O
a	O
board	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
other	O
way	O
but	O
to	O
cut	O
down	O
a	O
tree	O
,	O
set	O
it	O
on	O
an	O
edge	O
before	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
hew	O
it	O
flat	O
on	O
either	O
side	O
with	O
my	O
axe	O
,	O
till	O
I	O
brought	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
thin	O
as	O
a	O
plank	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
dub	O
it	O
smooth	O
with	O
my	O
adze	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
true	O
,	O
by	O
this	O
method	O
I	O
could	O
make	O
but	O
one	O
board	O
out	O
of	O
a	O
whole	O
tree	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
remedy	O
for	O
but	O
patience	O
,	O
any	O
more	O
than	O
I	O
had	O
for	O
the	O
prodigious	O
deal	O
of	O
time	O
and	O
labour	O
which	O
it	O
took	O
me	O
up	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
plank	O
or	O
board	O
:	O
but	O
my	O
time	O
or	O
labour	O
was	O
little	O
worth	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
as	O
well	O
employed	O
one	O
way	O
as	O
another	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
me	O
a	O
table	O
and	O
a	O
chair	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
observed	O
above	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
I	O
did	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
short	O
pieces	O
of	O
boards	O
that	O
I	O
brought	O
on	O
my	O
raft	O
from	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

But	O
when	O
I	O
had	O
wrought	O
out	O
some	O
boards	O
as	O
above	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
large	O
shelves	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
breadth	O
of	O
a	O
foot	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
,	O
one	O
over	O
another	O
all	O
along	O
one	O
side	O
of	O
my	O
cave	O
,	O
to	O
lay	O
all	O
my	O
tools	O
,	O
nails	O
and	O
ironwork	O
on	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
to	O
separate	O
everything	O
at	O
large	O
into	O
their	O
places	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
come	O
easily	O
at	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
knocked	O
pieces	O
into	O
the	O
wall	O
of	O
the	O
rock	O
to	O
hang	O
my	O
guns	O
and	O
all	O
things	O
that	O
would	O
hang	O
up	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
had	O
my	O
cave	O
been	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
,	O
it	O
looked	O
like	O
a	O
general	O
magazine	O
of	O
all	O
necessary	O
things	O
;	O
and	O
had	O
everything	O
so	O
ready	O
at	O
my	O
hand	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
pleasure	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
see	O
all	O
my	O
goods	O
in	O
such	O

to	O

And	O

the	O

that	O

a	O

to	O
consider	O
how	O
to	O
supply	O
that	O

some	O

for	O
the	O

I	O
made	O
use	O
of	O
the	O
iron	O

which	O
were	O
proper	O
enough	O

though	O
heavy	O

the	O
next	O
thing	O
was	O
a	O
shovel	O

this	O
was	O
so	O
absolutely	O

that	O

indeed	O

I	O
could	O
do	O
nothing	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
in	O
searching	O
the	O

I	O
found	O
a	O
tree	O
of	O

like	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
in	O
the	O
Brazils	O
they	O
call	O
the	O
iron-tree	O

for	O
its	O
exceeding	O
hardness	O

this	O
,	O
with	O
great	O
labour	O

and	O
almost	O
spoiling	O
my	O

I	O
cut	O
a	O

brought	O
it	O
home	O

too	O

with	O
difficulty	O

for	O
it	O
was	O
exceeding	O
heavy	O

The	O

of	O

a	O

not	O
last	O
me	O

I	O

to	O
put	O
it	O
to	O

could	O

as	O

I	O
fancied	O
I	O
could	O
make	O

the	O
wheel	O

that	O
I	O
had	O
no	O

how	O

of	O
the	O

to	O
run	O
in	O

I	O
gave	O
it	O
over	O

away	O
the	O

I	O
dug	O

as	O
may	O
be	O
observed	O
hereafter	O
,	O
upon	O
a	O
very	O
remarkable	O
occasion	O
.	O

During	O
this	O
time	O
I	O
made	O
my	O
rounds	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
for	O
game	O
every	O
day	O
when	O
the	O
rain	O
permitted	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
frequent	O
discoveries	O
in	O
these	O
walks	O
of	O
something	O
or	O
other	O
to	O
my	O
advantage	O
;	O
particularly	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
wild	O
pigeons	O
,	O
which	O
build	O
,	O
not	O
as	O
wood-pigeons	O
in	O
a	O
tree	O
,	O
but	O
rather	O
as	O
house-pigeons	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
holes	O
of	O
the	O
rocks	O
;	O
and	O
taking	O
some	O
young	O
ones	O
,	O
I	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
breed	O
them	O
up	O
tame	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
so	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
they	O
grew	O
older	O
they	O
flew	O
away	O
,	O
which	O
perhaps	O
was	O
at	O
first	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
feeding	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
frequently	O
found	O
their	O
nests	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
their	O
young	O
ones	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
very	O
good	O
meat	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
managing	O
my	O
household	O
affairs	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
myself	O
wanting	O
in	O
many	O
things	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
thought	O
at	O
first	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
make	O
;	O
as	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
it	O
was	O
:	O
for	O
instance	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
never	O
make	O
a	O
cask	O
to	O
be	O
hooped	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
small	O
runlet	O
or	O
two	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
observed	O
before	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
could	O
never	O
arrive	O
at	O
the	O
capacity	O
of	O
making	O
one	O
by	O
them	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
spent	O
many	O
weeks	O
about	O
it	O
;	O
I	O
could	O
neither	O
put	O
in	O
the	O
heads	O
,	O
or	O
join	O
the	O
staves	O
so	O
true	O
to	O
one	O
another	O
as	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
hold	O
water	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
gave	O
that	O
also	O
over	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
next	O
place	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
loss	O
for	O
candles	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
ever	O
it	O
was	O
dark	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
generally	O
by	O
seven	O
o'clock	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
bed	O
.	O

I	O
remembered	O
the	O
lump	O
of	O
beeswax	O
with	O
which	O
I	O
made	O
candles	O
in	O
my	O
African	PNM
adventure	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
had	O
none	O
of	O
that	O
now	O
;	O
the	O
only	O
remedy	O
I	O
had	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
had	O
killed	O
a	O
goat	O
I	O
saved	O
the	O
tallow	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
a	O
little	O
dish	O
made	O
of	O
clay	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
baked	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
to	O
which	O
I	O
added	O
a	O
wick	O
of	O
some	O
oakum	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
me	O
a	O
lamp	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
gave	O
me	O
light	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
a	O
clear	O
,	O
steady	O
light	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
candle	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
all	O
my	O
labours	O
it	O
happened	O
that	O
,	O
rummaging	O
my	O
things	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
little	O
bag	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
hinted	O
before	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
filled	O
with	O
corn	O
for	O
the	O
feeding	O
of	O
poultry	O
--	O
not	O
for	O
this	O
voyage	O
,	O
but	O
before	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
suppose	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
ship	O
came	O
from	O
Lisbon	PNM
.	O

The	O
little	O
remainder	O
of	O
corn	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
the	O
bag	O
was	O
all	O
devoured	O
by	O
the	O
rats	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
saw	O
nothing	O
in	O
the	O
bag	O
but	O
husks	O
and	O
dust	O
;	O
and	O
being	O
willing	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
bag	O
for	O
some	O
other	O
use	O
-LRB-	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
put	O
powder	O
in	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
divided	O
it	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
the	O
lightning	O
,	O
or	O
some	O
such	O
use	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
I	O
shook	O
the	O
husks	O
of	O
corn	O
out	O
of	O
it	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
of	O
my	O
fortification	O
,	O
under	O
the	O
rock	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
before	O
the	O
great	O
rains	O
just	O
now	O
mentioned	O
that	O
I	O
threw	O
this	O
stuff	O
away	O
,	O
taking	O
no	O
notice	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
remembering	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
thrown	O
anything	O
there	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
about	O
a	O
month	O
after	O
,	O
or	O
thereabouts	O
,	O
I	O
saw	O
some	O
few	O
stalks	O
of	O
something	O
green	O
shooting	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
fancied	O
might	O
be	O
some	O
plant	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
seen	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
surprised	O
,	O
and	O
perfectly	O
astonished	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
after	O
a	O
little	O
longer	O
time	O
,	O
I	O
saw	O
about	O
ten	O
or	O
twelve	O
ears	O
come	O
out	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
perfect	O
green	O
barley	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
kind	O
as	O
our	O
European	O
--	O
nay	O
,	O
as	O
our	O
English	O
barley	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
impossible	O
to	O
express	O
the	O
astonishment	O
and	O
confusion	O
of	O
my	O
thoughts	O
on	O
this	O
occasion	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
hitherto	O
acted	O
upon	O
no	O
religious	O
foundation	O
at	O
all	O
;	O
indeed	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
very	O
few	O
notions	O
of	O
religion	O
in	O
my	O
head	O
,	O
nor	O
had	O
entertained	O
any	O
sense	O
of	O
anything	O
that	O
had	O
befallen	O
me	O
otherwise	O
than	O
as	O
chance	O
,	O
or	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
lightly	O
say	O
,	O
what	O
pleases	O
God	O
,	O
without	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
inquiring	O
into	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
Providence	PNM
in	O
these	O
things	O
,	O
or	O
His	O
order	O
in	O
governing	O
events	O
for	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

But	O
after	O
I	O
saw	O
barley	O
grow	O
there	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
climate	O
which	O
I	O
knew	O
was	O
not	O
proper	O
for	O
corn	O
,	O
and	O
especially	O
that	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
how	O
it	O
came	O
there	O
,	O
it	O
startled	O
me	O
strangely	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
suggest	O
that	O
God	O
had	O
miraculously	O
caused	O
His	O
grain	O
to	O
grow	O
without	O
any	O
help	O
of	O
seed	O
sown	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
directed	O
purely	O
for	O
my	O
sustenance	O
on	O
that	O
wild	O
,	O
miserable	O
place	O
.	O

This	O
touched	O
my	O
heart	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
tears	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
eyes	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
bless	O
myself	O
that	O
such	O
a	O
prodigy	O
of	O
nature	O
should	O
happen	O
upon	O
my	O
account	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
more	O
strange	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
saw	O
near	O
it	O
still	O
,	O
all	O
along	O
by	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
rock	O
,	O
some	O
other	O
straggling	O
stalks	O
,	O
which	O
proved	O
to	O
be	O
stalks	O
of	O
rice	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
I	O
knew	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
it	O
grow	O
in	O
Africa	PNM
when	O
I	O
was	O
ashore	O
there	O
.	O

I	O
not	O
only	O
thought	O
these	O
the	O
pure	O
productions	O
of	O
Providence	PNM
for	O
my	O
support	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
doubting	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
more	O
in	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
all	O
over	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
before	O
,	O
peering	O
in	O
every	O
corner	O
,	O
and	O
under	O
every	O
rock	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
for	O
more	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
find	O
any	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
it	O
occurred	O
to	O
my	O
thoughts	O
that	O
I	O
shook	O
a	O
bag	O
of	O
chickens	O
'	O
meat	O
out	O
in	O
that	O
place	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
wonder	O
began	O
to	O
cease	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
must	O
confess	O
my	O
religious	O
thankfulness	O
to	O
God	O
's	O
providence	O
began	O
to	O
abate	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
upon	O
the	O
discovering	O
that	O
all	O
this	O
was	O
nothing	O
but	O
what	O
was	O
common	O
;	O
though	O
I	O
ought	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
as	O
thankful	O
for	O
so	O
strange	O
and	O
unforeseen	O
a	O
providence	O
as	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
miraculous	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
really	O
the	O
work	O
of	O
Providence	PNM
to	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
should	O
order	O
or	O
appoint	O
that	O
ten	O
or	O
twelve	O
grains	O
of	O
corn	O
should	O
remain	O
unspoiled	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
rats	O
had	O
destroyed	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
dropped	O
from	O
heaven	O
;	O
as	O
also	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
throw	O
it	O
out	O
in	O
that	O
particular	O
place	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
it	O
being	O
in	O
the	O
shade	O
of	O
a	O
high	O
rock	O
,	O
it	O
sprang	O
up	O
immediately	O
;	O
whereas	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
thrown	O
it	O
anywhere	O
else	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
burnt	O
up	O
and	O
destroyed	O
.	O

I	O
carefully	O
saved	O
the	O
ears	O
of	O
this	O
corn	O
,	O
you	O
may	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
in	O
their	O
season	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
about	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
June	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
laying	O
up	O
every	O
corn	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
sow	O
them	O
all	O
again	O
,	O
hoping	O
in	O
time	O
to	O
have	O
some	O
quantity	O
sufficient	O
to	O
supply	O
me	O
with	O
bread	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
till	O
the	O
fourth	O
year	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
allow	O
myself	O
the	O
least	O
grain	O
of	O
this	O
corn	O
to	O
eat	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
then	O
but	O
sparingly	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
shall	O
say	O
afterwards	O
,	O
in	O
its	O
order	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
lost	O
all	O
that	O
I	O
sowed	O
the	O
first	O
season	O
by	O
not	O
observing	O
the	O
proper	O
time	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
sowed	O
it	O
just	O
before	O
the	O
dry	O
season	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
never	O
came	O
up	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
not	O
as	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
done	O
;	O
of	O
which	O
in	O
its	O
place	O
.	O

Besides	O
this	O
barley	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
,	O
as	O
above	O
,	O
twenty	O
or	O
thirty	O
stalks	O
of	O
rice	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
preserved	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
care	O
and	O
for	O
the	O
same	O
use	O
,	O
or	O
to	O
the	O
same	O
purpose	O
--	O
to	O
make	O
me	O
bread	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
food	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
found	O
ways	O
to	O
cook	O
it	O
without	O

though	O
I	O
did	O
that	O
also	O
after	O
some	O

But	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
my	O
Journal	O

I	O
worked	O
excessive	O
hard	O
these	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
months	O
to	O
get	O
my	O
wall	O
done	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
14th	O
of	O
April	O
I	O
closed	O
it	O
up	O
,	O
contriving	O
to	O
go	O
into	O
it	O
,	O
not	O
by	O
a	O
door	O

over	O
the	O
wall	O

by	O
a	O
ladder	O

--	O
I	O
finished	O
the	O
ladder	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
went	O
up	O
the	O
ladder	O
to	O
the	O
top	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
pulled	O
it	O
up	O
after	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
it	O
down	O
in	O
the	O
inside	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
complete	O
enclosure	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
for	O
within	O
I	O
had	O
room	O
enough	O
,	O
and	O
nothing	O
could	O
come	O
at	O
me	O
from	O
without	O
,	O
unless	O
it	O
could	O
first	O
mount	O
my	O
wall	O

The	O
very	O
next	O
day	O
after	O
this	O
wall	O
was	O
finished	O
I	O
had	O
almost	O
had	O
all	O
my	O
labour	O
overthrown	O
at	O
once	O
,	O
and	O
myself	O
killed	O

The	O
case	O
was	O
thus	O
:	O
As	O
I	O
was	O
busy	O
in	O
the	O
inside	O

behind	O
my	O
tent	O
,	O
just	O
at	O
the	O
entrance	O
into	O
my	O
cave	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
terribly	O
frighted	O
with	O
a	O
most	O
dreadful	O
,	O
surprising	O
thing	O
indeed	O
;	O
for	O
all	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
I	O
found	O
the	O
earth	O
come	O
crumbling	O
down	O
from	O
the	O
roof	O
of	O
my	O
cave	O

and	O
from	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

over	O
my	O

set	O
up	O
in	O

in	O
a	O
frightful	O
manner	O

I	O
was	O
heartily	O

thought	O
nothing	O

for	O

for	O
the	O

stood	O
on	O

three	O

at	O
about	O
eight	O

with	O
three	O
such	O
shocks	O

a	O

stood	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
me	O
next	O
the	O
sea	O
fell	O
down	O
with	O
such	O
a	O
terrible	O
noise	O
as	O
I	O
never	O
heard	O
in	O
all	O
my	O
life	O

I	O
perceived	O
also	O
the	O
very	O
sea	O
was	O
put	O
into	O
violent	O
motion	O
by	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
believe	O
the	O
shocks	O
were	O
stronger	O
under	O
the	O
water	O
than	O
on	O
the	O
island	O

I	O
was	O
so	O
much	O
amazed	O
with	O
the	O
thing	O
itself	O
,	O
having	O
never	O
felt	O
the	O

nor	O
discoursed	O
with	O
any	O
one	O
that	O
had	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
like	O
one	O
dead	O
or	O
stupefied	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
motion	O
of	O
the	O
earth	O
made	O
my	O
stomach	O
sick	O
,	O
like	O
one	O
that	O
was	O
tossed	O
at	O
sea	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
noise	O
of	O
the	O
falling	O
of	O
the	O
rock	O
awakened	O
me	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
and	O
rousing	O
me	O
from	O
the	O
stupefied	O
condition	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
,	O
filled	O
me	O
with	O
horror	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
thought	O
of	O
nothing	O
then	O
but	O
the	O
hill	O
falling	O
upon	O
my	O
tent	O

all	O
my	O

this	O
sunk	O
my	O

a	O
second	O
time	O

After	O
the	O
third	O
shock	O
was	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
felt	O
no	O
more	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
take	O
courage	O
;	O
and	O
yet	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
heart	O
enough	O
to	O
go	O
over	O
my	O
wall	O
again	O
,	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
being	O
buried	O
alive	O
,	O
but	O
sat	O
still	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
greatly	O
cast	O
down	O
and	O
disconsolate	O
,	O
not	O
knowing	O
what	O
to	O

All	O
this	O

I	O
had	O
not	O
the	O

serious	O

thought	O
;	O
nothing	O

the	O
common	O
``	O

''	O

and	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
over	O
that	O
went	O
away	O
too	O
.	O

While	O
I	O
sat	O
thus	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
the	O
air	O
overcast	O
and	O
grow	O
cloudy	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
it	O
would	O
rain	O
.	O

Soon	O
after	O
that	O
the	O
wind	O
arose	O
by	O
little	O
and	O
little	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
half-an-hour	O
it	O
blew	O
a	O
most	O
dreadful	O
hurricane	O
;	O
the	O
sea	O
was	O
all	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
covered	O
over	O
with	O
foam	O
and	O
froth	O
;	O
the	O
shore	O
was	O
covered	O
with	O
the	O
breach	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
the	O
trees	O
were	O
torn	O
up	O
by	O
the	O
roots	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
terrible	O
storm	O
it	O
was	O
.	O

This	O
held	O
about	O
three	O
hours	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
began	O
to	O
abate	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
two	O
hours	O
more	O
it	O
was	O
quite	O
calm	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
rain	O
very	O
hard	O
.	O

All	O
this	O
while	O
I	O
sat	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
very	O
much	O
terrified	O
and	O
dejected	O
;	O
when	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
it	O
came	O
into	O
my	O
thoughts	O
,	O
that	O
these	O
winds	O
and	O
rain	O
being	O
the	O
consequences	O
of	O
the	O
earthquake	O
,	O
the	O
earthquake	O
itself	O
was	O
spent	O
and	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
might	O
venture	O
into	O
my	O
cave	O
again	O
.	O

With	O
this	O
thought	O
my	O
spirits	O
began	O
to	O
revive	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
rain	O
also	O
helping	O
to	O
persuade	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
in	O
and	O
sat	O
down	O
in	O
my	O
tent	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
rain	O
was	O
so	O
violent	O
that	O
my	O
tent	O
was	O
ready	O
to	O
be	O
beaten	O
down	O
with	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
go	O
into	O
my	O
cave	O
,	O
though	O
very	O
much	O
afraid	O
and	O
uneasy	O
,	O
for	O
fear	O
it	O
should	O
fall	O
on	O
my	O
head	O
.	O

This	O
violent	O
rain	O
forced	O
me	O
to	O
a	O
new	O
work	O
--	O
viz.	O
to	O
cut	O
a	O
hole	O
through	O
my	O
new	O
fortification	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
sink	O
,	O
to	O
let	O
the	O
water	O
go	O
out	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
else	O
have	O
flooded	O
my	O
cave	O
.	O

After	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
my	O
cave	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
still	O
no	O
more	O
shocks	O
of	O
the	O
earthquake	O
follow	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
composed	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
,	O
to	O
support	O
my	O
spirits	O
,	O
which	O
indeed	O
wanted	O
it	O
very	O
much	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
my	O
little	O
store	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
a	O
small	O
sup	O
of	O
rum	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
then	O
and	O
always	O
very	O
sparingly	O
,	O
knowing	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
no	O
more	O
when	O
that	O
was	O
gone	O
.	O

It	O
continued	O
raining	O
all	O
that	O
night	O
and	O
great	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
stir	O
abroad	O
;	O
but	O
my	O
mind	O
being	O
more	O
composed	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
best	O
do	O
;	O
concluding	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
island	O
was	O
subject	O
to	O
these	O
earthquakes	O
,	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
no	O
living	O
for	O
me	O
in	O
a	O
cave	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
must	O
consider	O
of	O
building	O
a	O
little	O
hut	O
in	O
an	O
open	O
place	O
which	O
I	O
might	O
surround	O
with	O
a	O
wall	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
make	O
myself	O
secure	O
from	O
wild	O
beasts	O
or	O
men	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
concluded	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
stayed	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
certainly	O
one	O
time	O
or	O
other	O
be	O
buried	O
alive	O
.	O

With	O
these	O
thoughts	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
remove	O
my	O
tent	O
from	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
it	O
stood	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
just	O
under	O
the	O
hanging	O
precipice	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
;	O
and	O
which	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
shaken	O
again	O
,	O
would	O
certainly	O
fall	O
upon	O
my	O
tent	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
spent	O
the	O
two	O
next	O
days	O
,	O
being	O
the	O
19th	O
and	O
20th	O
of	O
April	O
,	O
in	O
contriving	O
where	O
and	O
how	O
to	O
remove	O
my	O
habitation	O
.	O

The	O
fear	O
of	O
being	O
swallowed	O
up	O
alive	O
made	O
me	O
that	O
I	O
never	O
slept	O
in	O
quiet	O
;	O
and	O
yet	O
the	O
apprehension	O
of	O
lying	O
abroad	O
without	O
any	O
fence	O
was	O
almost	O
equal	O
to	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
still	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
looked	O
about	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
how	O
everything	O
was	O
put	O
in	O
order	O
,	O
how	O
pleasantly	O
concealed	O
I	O
was	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
safe	O
from	O
danger	O
,	O
it	O
made	O
me	O
very	O
loath	O
to	O
remove	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
meantime	O
,	O
it	O
occurred	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
require	O
a	O
vast	O
deal	O
of	O
time	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
do	O
this	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
must	O
be	O
contented	O
to	O
venture	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
,	O
till	O
I	O
had	O
formed	O
a	O
camp	O
for	O
myself	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
secured	O
it	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
remove	O
to	O
it	O
.	O

So	O
with	O
this	O
resolution	O
I	O
composed	O
myself	O
for	O
a	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
all	O
speed	O
to	O
build	O
me	O
a	O
wall	O
with	O
piles	O
and	O
cables	O
,	O
&	O
c.	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
circle	O
,	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
my	O
tent	O
up	O
in	O
it	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
finished	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
venture	O
to	O
stay	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
till	O
it	O
was	O
finished	O
,	O
and	O
fit	O
to	O
remove	O

The	O
next	O

I	O
begin	O
to	O
consider	O
of	O
means	O
to	O
put	O
this	O
resolve	O
into	O
execution	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
loss	O
about	O
my	O
tools	O

I	O
had	O
three	O
large	O
axes	O

and	O
abundance	O
of	O
hatchets	O
-LRB-	O

we	O
carried	O
the	O
hatchets	O
for	O
traffic	O
with	O
the	O
Indians	O

;	O
but	O
with	O
much	O
chopping	O
and	O
cutting	O
knotty	O
hard	O

they	O
were	O
all	O
full	O
of	O

dull	O

though	O
I	O

a	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
turn	O
it	O
and	O
grind	O
my	O

This	O

by	O
this	O

the	O

it	O

Then	O
the	O

out	O

I	O

In	O
this	O
interval	O
the	O
good	O
advice	O
of	O
my	O
father	O
came	O
to	O
my	O
mind	O

and	O
presently	O
his	O
prediction	O

which	O
I	O
mentioned	O
at	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
this	O
story	O
--	O
viz.	O
that	O
if	O
I	O
did	O
take	O
this	O

God	O
would	O
not	O

I	O
would	O
have	O
leisure	O
hereafter	O
to	O
reflect	O
upon	O

neglected	O
his	O
counsel	O
when	O
there	O
might	O
be	O
none	O

assist	O
in	O
my	O

now	O
I	O
am	O
left	O
to	O
mourn	O

the	O
consequences	O

I	O
abused	O
their	O

me	O

--	O
Having	O
been	O
somewhat	O
refreshed	O
with	O
the	O
sleep	O
I	O
had	O
had	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
fit	O
being	O
entirely	O
off	O
,	O
I	O
got	O
up	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
the	O
fright	O
and	O
terror	O
of	O
my	O
dream	O
was	O
very	O
great	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
considered	O
that	O
the	O
fit	O
of	O
the	O
ague	O
would	O
return	O
again	O
the	O
next	O
day	O

and	O
now	O
was	O
my	O
time	O
to	O
get	O
something	O
to	O
refresh	O
and	O
support	O
myself	O
when	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
ill	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
I	O
did	O
,	O
I	O
filled	O
a	O
large	O
square	O
case-bottle	O
with	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
it	O
upon	O
my	O
table	O
,	O
in	O
reach	O
of	O
my	O
bed	O
;	O
and	O
to	O
take	O
off	O
the	O
chill	O
or	O
aguish	O
disposition	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
I	O
put	O
about	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
pint	O
of	O
rum	O
into	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
mixed	O
them	O
together	O
.	O

Then	O
I	O
got	O
me	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
the	O
goat	O
's	O
flesh	O
and	O
broiled	O
it	O
on	O
the	O
coals	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
eat	O
very	O
little	O
.	O

I	O
walked	O
about	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
very	O
weak	O
,	O
and	O
withal	O
very	O
sad	O
and	O
heavy-hearted	O
under	O
a	O
sense	O
of	O
my	O
miserable	O
condition	O
,	O
dreading	O
,	O
the	O
return	O
of	O
my	O
distemper	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
.	O

At	O
night	O
I	O
made	O
my	O
supper	O
of	O
three	O
of	O
the	O
turtle	O
's	O
eggs	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
roasted	O
in	O
the	O
ashes	O
,	O
and	O
ate	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
shell	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
bit	O
of	O
meat	O
I	O
had	O
ever	O
asked	O
God	O
's	O
blessing	O
to	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
remember	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
whole	O
life	O
.	O

After	O
I	O
had	O
eaten	O
I	O
tried	O
to	O
walk	O
,	O
but	O
found	O
myself	O
so	O
weak	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
hardly	O
carry	O
a	O
gun	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
never	O
went	O
out	O
without	O
that	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
went	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
sat	O
down	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
looking	O
out	O
upon	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
just	O
before	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
calm	O
and	O
smooth	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
sat	O
here	O
some	O
such	O
thoughts	O
as	O
these	O
occurred	O
to	O
me	O
:	O
What	O
is	O
this	O
earth	O
and	O
sea	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
have	O
seen	O
so	O
much	O
?	O

Whence	O
is	O
it	O
produced	O
?	O

And	O
what	O
am	O
I	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
other	O
creatures	O
wild	O
and	O
tame	O
,	O
human	O
and	O
brutal	O
?	O

Whence	O
are	O
we	O
?	O

Sure	O
we	O
are	O
all	O
made	O
by	O
some	O
secret	O
Power	O
,	O
who	O
formed	O
the	O
earth	O
and	O
sea	O
,	O
the	O
air	O
and	O
sky	O
.	O

And	O
who	O
is	O
that	O
?	O

Then	O
it	O
followed	O
most	O
naturally	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
God	O
that	O
has	O
made	O
all	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
but	O
then	O
it	O
came	O
on	O
strangely	O
,	O
if	O
God	O
has	O
made	O
all	O
these	O
things	O
,	O
He	O
guides	O
and	O
governs	O
them	O
all	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
things	O
that	O
concern	O
them	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
Power	O
that	O
could	O
make	O
all	O
things	O
must	O
certainly	O
have	O
power	O
to	O
guide	O
and	O
direct	O
them	O
.	O

If	O
so	O
,	O
nothing	O
can	O
happen	O
in	O
the	O
great	O
circuit	O
of	O
His	O
works	O
,	O
either	O
without	O
His	O
knowledge	O
or	O
appointment	O
.	O

And	O
if	O
nothing	O
happens	O
without	O
His	O
knowledge	O
,	O
He	O
knows	O
that	O
I	O
am	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
am	O
in	O
this	O
dreadful	O
condition	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
nothing	O
happens	O
without	O
His	O
appointment	O
,	O
He	O
has	O
appointed	O
all	O
this	O
to	O
befall	O
me	O
.	O

Nothing	O
occurred	O
to	O
my	O
thought	O
to	O
contradict	O
any	O
of	O
these	O
conclusions	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
it	O
rested	O
upon	O
me	O
with	O
the	O
greater	O
force	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
must	O
needs	O
be	O
that	O
God	O
had	O
appointed	O
all	O
this	O
to	O
befall	O
me	O
;	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
brought	O
into	O
this	O
miserable	O
circumstance	O
by	O
His	O
direction	O
,	O
He	O
having	O
the	O
sole	O
power	O
,	O
not	O
of	O
me	O
only	O
,	O
but	O
of	O
everything	O
that	O
happened	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

Immediately	O
it	O
followed	O
:	O
Why	O
has	O
God	O
done	O
this	O
to	O
me	O
?	O

What	O
have	O
I	O
done	O
to	O
be	O
thus	O
used	O
?	O

My	O
conscience	O
presently	O
checked	O
me	O
in	O
that	O
inquiry	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
blasphemed	O
,	O
and	O
methought	O
it	O
spoke	O
to	O
me	O
like	O
a	O
voice	O
:	O
``	O

I	O
was	O
struck	O
dumb	O
with	O
these	O
reflections	O
,	O
as	O
one	O
astonished	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
not	O
a	O
word	O
to	O
say	O
--	O
no	O
,	O
not	O
to	O
answer	O
to	O
myself	O

but	O
rose	O
up	O
pensive	O
and	O
sad	O
,	O
walked	O
back	O
to	O
my	O
retreat	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
up	O
over	O
my	O
wall	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
going	O
to	O
bed	O
;	O
but	O
my	O
thoughts	O
were	O
sadly	O
disturbed	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
inclination	O
to	O
sleep	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
sat	O
down	O
in	O
my	O
chair	O
,	O
and	O
lighted	O
my	O
lamp	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
dark	O
.	O

Now	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
apprehension	O
of	O
the	O
return	O
of	O
my	O
distemper	O
terrified	O
me	O
very	O
much	O
,	O
it	O
occurred	O
to	O
my	O
thought	O
that	O
the	O
Brazilians	O
take	O
no	O
physic	O
but	O
their	O
tobacco	O
for	O
almost	O
all	O
distempers	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
a	O
roll	O
of	O
tobacco	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
chests	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
quite	O
cured	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
also	O
that	O
was	O
green	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
quite	O
cured	O
.	O

I	O
went	O
,	O
directed	O
by	O
Heaven	O
no	O
doubt	O
;	O
for	O
in	O
this	O
chest	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
cure	O
both	O
for	O
soul	O
and	O
body	O
.	O

I	O
opened	O
the	O
chest	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
what	O
I	O
looked	O
for	O
,	O
the	O
tobacco	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
the	O
few	O
books	O
I	O
had	O
saved	O
lay	O
there	O
too	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
out	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Bibles	O
which	O
I	O
mentioned	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
to	O
this	O
time	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
found	O
leisure	O
or	O
inclination	O
to	O
look	O
into	O
.	O

I	O
say	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
it	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
both	O
that	O
and	O
the	O
tobacco	O
with	O
me	O
to	O
the	O
table	O
.	O

What	O
use	O
to	O
make	O
of	O
the	O
tobacco	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
distemper	O
,	O
or	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
good	O
for	O
it	O
or	O
no	O
:	O
but	O
I	O
tried	O
several	O
experiments	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
resolved	O
it	O
should	O
hit	O
one	O
way	O
or	O
other	O
.	O

I	O
first	O
took	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
leaf	O
,	O
and	O
chewed	O
it	O
in	O
my	O
mouth	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
at	O
first	O
almost	O
stupefied	O
my	O
brain	O
,	O
the	O
tobacco	O
being	O
green	O
and	O
strong	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
much	O
used	O
to	O
.	O

Then	O
I	O
took	O
some	O
and	O
steeped	O
it	O
an	O
hour	O
or	O
two	O
in	O
some	O
rum	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
dose	O
of	O
it	O
when	O
I	O
lay	O
down	O
;	O
and	O
lastly	O
,	O
I	O
burnt	O
some	O
upon	O
a	O
pan	O
of	O
coals	O
,	O
and	O
held	O
my	O
nose	O
close	O
over	O
the	O
smoke	O
of	O
it	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
bear	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
for	O
the	O
heat	O
as	O
almost	O
for	O
suffocation	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
interval	O
of	O
this	O
operation	O
I	O
took	O
up	O
the	O
Bible	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
read	O
;	O
but	O
my	O
head	O
was	O
too	O
much	O
disturbed	O
with	O
the	O
tobacco	O
to	O
bear	O
reading	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
;	O
only	O
,	O
having	O
opened	O
the	O
book	O
casually	O
,	O
the	O
first	O
words	O
that	O
occurred	O
to	O
me	O
were	O
these	O
,	O
``	O
Call	O
on	O
Me	O
in	O
the	O
day	O
of	O
trouble	O

and	O
I	O
will	O
deliver	O
thee	O
,	O
and	O
thou	O
shalt	O
glorify	O
Me	O

''	O

These	O
words	O
were	O
very	O
apt	O
to	O
my	O
case	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
some	O
impression	O
upon	O
my	O
thoughts	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
reading	O
them	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
they	O
did	O
afterwards	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
for	O
being	O
_	O
delivered	O

the	O

,	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
the	O
thing	O
was	O
so	O
remote	O
,	O
so	O
impossible	O
in	O
my	O
apprehension	O
of	O
things	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
children	O
of	O
Israel	O
did	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
promised	O
flesh	O
to	O
eat	O
,	O
``	O
Can	O
God	O
spread	O
a	O
table	O
in	O
the	O
wilderness	O

''	O

so	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
``	O
Can	O
God	O
Himself	O
deliver	O
me	O
from	O
this	O
place	O

''	O

And	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
for	O
many	O
years	O
that	O
any	O
hopes	O
appeared	O
,	O
this	O
prevailed	O
very	O
often	O
upon	O
my	O
thoughts	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
the	O
words	O
made	O
a	O
great	O
impression	O
upon	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
mused	O
upon	O
them	O
very	O
often	O
.	O

It	O
grew	O
now	O
late	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
tobacco	O
had	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
dozed	O
my	O
head	O
so	O
much	O
that	O
I	O
inclined	O
to	O
sleep	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
left	O
my	O
lamp	O
burning	O
in	O
the	O
cave	O
,	O
lest	O
I	O
should	O
want	O
anything	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
to	O
bed	O
.	O

But	O
before	O
I	O
lay	O
down	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
what	O
I	O
never	O
had	O
done	O
in	O
all	O
my	O
life	O
--	O
I	O
kneeled	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
prayed	O
to	O
God	O
to	O
fulfil	O
the	O
promise	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
I	O
called	O
upon	O
Him	O
in	O
the	O
day	O
of	O
trouble	O
,	O
He	O
would	O
deliver	O
me	O
.	O

After	O
my	O
broken	O
and	O
imperfect	O
prayer	O
was	O
over	O
,	O
I	O
drank	O
the	O
rum	O
in	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
steeped	O
the	O
tobacco	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
so	O
strong	O
and	O
rank	O
of	O
the	O
tobacco	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
scarcely	O
get	O
it	O
down	O
;	O
immediately	O
upon	O
this	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
bed	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
presently	O
it	O
flew	O
up	O
into	O
my	O
head	O
violently	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
fell	O
into	O
a	O
sound	O

waked	O
no	O

to	O
this	O

I	O

I	O
should	O
have	O
lost	O
more	O
than	O
one	O
day	O
;	O

certainly	O
I	O
lost	O
a	O
day	O
in	O
my	O

never	O

up	O

in	O

I	O

killed	O
a	O

something	O

brought	O

was	O
not	O
very	O
forward	O
to	O

I	O

my	O

exceedingly	O
upon	O
this	O

``	O

;	O
and	O
the	O

upon	O

in	O

as	O
I	O
was	O

myself	O
with	O
such	O

I	O
was	O
as	O

In	O

took	O
the	O

;	O

at	O
the	O

I	O

every	O

not	O

long	O
as	O
my	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
first	O

I	O
could	O

in	O

that	O
I	O
prayed	O
in	O
all	O
my	O

;	O
for	O

I	O
prayed	O
with	O
a	O
sense	O
of	O
my	O

and	O
a	O
true	O
Scripture	O
view	O
of	O

from	O
this	O

may	O

I	O
began	O
to	O
hope	O
that	O

would	O

I	O
began	O
to	O
construe	O
the	O

``	O

on	O

in	O
a	O

from	O
what	O
I	O

before	O
;	O
for	O

I	O
had	O
no	O

my	O
being	O

from	O
the	O

was	O
in	O
;	O
for	O

I	O
was	O
indeed	O
at	O

place	O

the	O

now	O
I	O

to	O

another	O

now	O
I	O
looked	O
back	O
upon	O
my	O

with	O
such	O
horror	O

and	O
my	O
sins	O
appeared	O
so	O
dreadful	O

that	O
my	O
soul	O
sought	O
nothing	O
of	O

deliverance	O
from	O
the	O
load	O
of	O
guilt	O
that	O
bore	O
down	O
all	O

for	O

was	O

did	O
not	O
so	O

as	O
pray	O
to	O
be	O
delivered	O
from	O
it	O

think	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
all	O
of	O
no	O
consideration	O
in	O

to	O
this	O

And	O
I	O
add	O
this	O

here	O

to	O
hint	O
to	O
whoever	O
shall	O
read	O
it	O

that	O
whenever	O

a	O

will	O
find	O

a	O

off	O
the	O
fit	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
rather	O
contributed	O
to	O
weakening	O
me	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
frequent	O
convulsions	O
in	O
my	O
nerves	O
and	O
limbs	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
.	O

I	O
learned	O
from	O
it	O
also	O
this	O
,	O
in	O
particular	O
,	O
that	O
being	O
abroad	O
in	O
the	O
rainy	O
season	O
was	O
the	O
most	O
pernicious	O
thing	O
to	O
my	O
health	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
,	O
especially	O
in	O
those	O
rains	O
which	O
came	O
attended	O
with	O
storms	O
and	O
hurricanes	O
of	O
wind	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
the	O
rain	O
which	O
came	O
in	O
the	O
dry	O
season	O
was	O
almost	O
always	O
accompanied	O
with	O
such	O
storms	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
rain	O
was	O
much	O
more	O
dangerous	O
than	O
the	O
rain	O
which	O
fell	O

CHAPTER	O
VII	O
--	O
AGRICULTURAL	O
EXPERIENCE	O
I	O
had	O
now	O
been	O
in	O
this	O
unhappy	O
island	O
above	O
ten	O
months	O
.	O

All	O
possibility	O
of	O
deliverance	O
from	O
this	O
condition	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
entirely	O
taken	O
from	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
firmly	O
believe	O
that	O
no	O
human	O
shape	O
had	O
ever	O
set	O
foot	O
upon	O
that	O
place	O
.	O

Having	O
now	O
secured	O
my	O
habitation	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
fully	O
to	O
my	O
mind	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
desire	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
more	O
perfect	O
discovery	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
other	O
productions	O
I	O
might	O
find	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
yet	O
knew	O
nothing	O
of	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
15th	O
of	O
July	O
that	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
more	O
particular	O
survey	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
itself	O
.	O

I	O
went	O
up	O
the	O
creek	O
first	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
hinted	O
,	O
I	O
brought	O
my	O
rafts	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
after	O
I	O
came	O
about	O
two	O
miles	O
up	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
tide	O
did	O
not	O
flow	O
any	O
higher	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
little	O
brook	O
of	O
running	O
water	O
,	O
very	O
fresh	O
and	O
good	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
being	O
the	O
dry	O
season	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
hardly	O
any	O
water	O
in	O
some	O
parts	O
of	O
it	O
--	O
at	O
least	O
not	O
enough	O
to	O
run	O
in	O
any	O
stream	O
,	O
so	O
as	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
perceived	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
banks	O
of	O
this	O
brook	O
I	O
found	O
many	O
pleasant	O
savannahs	O
or	O
meadows	O
,	O
plain	O
,	O
smooth	O
,	O
and	O
covered	O
with	O
grass	O
;	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
rising	O
parts	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
next	O
to	O
the	O
higher	O
grounds	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
as	O
might	O
be	O
supposed	O
,	O
never	O
overflowed	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
tobacco	O
,	O
green	O
,	O
and	O
growing	O
to	O
a	O
great	O
and	O
very	O
strong	O
stalk	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
divers	O
other	O
plants	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
notion	O
of	O
or	O
understanding	O
about	O
,	O
that	O
might	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
have	O
virtues	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
find	O
out	O
.	O

I	O
searched	O
for	O
the	O
cassava	O
root	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
in	O
all	O
that	O
climate	O
,	O
make	O
their	O
bread	O
of	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
could	O
find	O
none	O
.	O

I	O
saw	O
large	O
plants	O
of	O
aloes	O
,	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
saw	O
several	O
sugar-canes	O
,	O
but	O
wild	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
cultivation	O
,	O
imperfect	O
.	O

I	O
contented	O
myself	O
with	O
these	O
discoveries	O
for	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
back	O
,	O
musing	O
with	O
myself	O
what	O
course	O
I	O
might	O
take	O
to	O
know	O
the	O
virtue	O
and	O
goodness	O
of	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
fruits	O
or	O
plants	O
which	O
I	O
should	O
discover	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
bring	O
it	O
to	O
no	O
conclusion	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
so	O
little	O
observation	O
while	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
Brazils	PNM
,	O
that	O
I	O
knew	O
little	O
of	O
the	O
plants	O
in	O
the	O
field	O
;	O
at	O
least	O
,	O
very	O
little	O
that	O
might	O
serve	O
to	O
any	O
purpose	O
now	O
in	O
my	O
distress	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
the	O
sixteenth	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
up	O
the	O
same	O
way	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
after	O
going	O
something	O
further	O
than	O
I	O
had	O
gone	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
the	O
brook	O
and	O
the	O
savannahs	O
cease	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
country	O
become	O
more	O
woody	O
than	O
before	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
part	O
I	O
found	O
different	O
fruits	O
,	O
and	O
particularly	O
I	O
found	O
melons	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
in	O
great	O
abundance	O
,	O
and	O
grapes	O
upon	O
the	O
trees	O
.	O

The	O
vines	O
had	O
spread	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
over	O
the	O
trees	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
clusters	O
of	O
grapes	O
were	O
just	O
now	O
in	O
their	O
prime	O
,	O
very	O
ripe	O
and	O
rich	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
surprising	O
discovery	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
exceeding	O
glad	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
warned	O
by	O
my	O
experience	O
to	O
eat	O
sparingly	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
remembering	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
ashore	O
in	O
Barbary	O
,	O
the	O
eating	O
of	O
grapes	O
killed	O
several	O
of	O
our	O
Englishmen	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
slaves	O
there	O
,	O
by	O
throwing	O
them	O
into	O
fluxes	O
and	O
fevers	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
found	O
an	O
excellent	O
use	O
for	O
these	O
grapes	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
,	O
to	O
cure	O
or	O
dry	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
and	O
keep	O
them	O
as	O
dried	O
grapes	O
or	O
raisins	O
are	O
kept	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
thought	O
would	O
be	O
,	O
as	O
indeed	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
wholesome	O
and	O
agreeable	O
to	O
eat	O
when	O
no	O
grapes	O
could	O
be	O
had	O
.	O

I	O
spent	O
all	O
that	O
evening	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
not	O
back	O
to	O
my	O
habitation	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
night	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
might	O
say	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
lain	O
from	O
home	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
my	O
first	O
contrivance	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
tree	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
slept	O
well	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
proceeded	O
upon	O
my	O
discovery	O
;	O
travelling	O
nearly	O
four	O
miles	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
might	O
judge	O
by	O
the	O
length	O
of	O
the	O
valley	O
,	O
keeping	O
still	O
due	O
north	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
ridge	O
of	O
hills	O
on	O
the	O
south	O
and	O
north	O
side	O
of	O
me	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
this	O
march	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
opening	O
where	O
the	O
country	O
seemed	O
to	O
descend	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
;	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
spring	O
of	O
fresh	O
water	O
,	O
which	O
issued	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
by	O
me	O
,	O
ran	O
the	O
other	O
way	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
due	O
east	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
country	O
appeared	O
so	O
fresh	O
,	O
so	O
green	O
,	O
so	O
flourishing	O
,	O
everything	O
being	O
in	O
a	O
constant	O
verdure	O
or	O
flourish	O
of	O
spring	O
that	O
it	O
looked	O
like	O
a	O
planted	O
garden	O
.	O

I	O
descended	O
a	O
little	O
on	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
that	O
delicious	O
vale	O
,	O
surveying	O
it	O
with	O
a	O
secret	O
kind	O
of	O
pleasure	O
,	O
though	O
mixed	O
with	O
my	O
other	O
afflicting	O
thoughts	O
,	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
all	O
my	O
own	O
;	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
king	O
and	O
lord	O
of	O
all	O
this	O
country	O
indefensibly	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
right	O
of	O
possession	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
convey	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
it	O
in	O
inheritance	O
as	O
completely	O
as	O
any	O
lord	O
of	O
a	O
manor	O
in	O
England	PNM
.	O

I	O
saw	O
here	O
abundance	O
of	O
cocoa	O
trees	O
,	O
orange	O
,	O
and	O
lemon	O
,	O
and	O
citron	O
trees	O
;	O
but	O
all	O
wild	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
few	O
bearing	O
any	O
fruit	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
not	O
then	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
green	O
limes	O
that	O
I	O
gathered	O
were	O
not	O
only	O
pleasant	O
to	O
eat	O
,	O
but	O
very	O
wholesome	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
mixed	O
their	O
juice	O
afterwards	O
with	O
water	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
it	O
very	O
wholesome	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
cool	O
and	O
refreshing	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
now	O
I	O
had	O
business	O
enough	O
to	O
gather	O
and	O
carry	O
home	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
lay	O
up	O
a	O
store	O
as	O
well	O
of	O
grapes	O
as	O
limes	O
and	O
lemons	O
,	O
to	O
furnish	O
myself	O
for	O
the	O
wet	O
season	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
knew	O
was	O
approaching	O
.	O

In	O
order	O
to	O
do	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
gathered	O
a	O
great	O
heap	O
of	O
grapes	O
in	O
one	O
place	O
,	O
a	O
lesser	O
heap	O
in	O
another	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
parcel	O
of	O
limes	O
and	O
lemons	O
in	O
another	O
place	O
;	O
and	O
taking	O
a	O
few	O
of	O
each	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
travelled	O
homewards	O
;	O
resolving	O
to	O
come	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
bring	O
a	O
bag	O
or	O
sack	O
,	O
or	O
what	O
I	O
could	O
make	O
,	O
to	O
carry	O
the	O
rest	O
home	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
having	O
spent	O
three	O
days	O
in	O
this	O
journey	O
,	O
I	O
came	O
home	O
-LRB-	O
so	O
I	O
must	O
now	O
call	O
my	O
tent	O
and	O
my	O
cave	O
-RRB-	O
;	O
but	O
before	O
I	O
got	O
thither	O
the	O
grapes	O
were	O
spoiled	O
;	O
the	O
richness	O
of	O
the	O
fruit	O
and	O
the	O
weight	O
of	O
the	O
juice	O
having	O
broken	O
them	O
and	O
bruised	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
good	O
for	O
little	O
or	O
nothing	O
;	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
limes	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
good	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
could	O
bring	O
but	O
a	O
few	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
being	O
the	O
nineteenth	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
back	O
,	O
having	O
made	O
me	O
two	O
small	O
bags	O
to	O
bring	O
home	O
my	O
harvest	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
surprised	O
,	O
when	O
coming	O
to	O
my	O
heap	O
of	O
grapes	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
so	O
rich	O
and	O
fine	O
when	O
I	O
gathered	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
find	O
them	O
all	O
spread	O
about	O
,	O
trod	O
to	O
pieces	O
,	O
and	O
dragged	O
about	O
,	O
some	O
here	O
,	O
some	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
abundance	O
eaten	O
and	O
devoured	O
.	O

By	O
this	O
I	O
concluded	O
there	O
were	O
some	O
wild	O
creatures	O
thereabouts	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
done	O
this	O
;	O
but	O
what	O
they	O
were	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
found	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
laying	O
them	O
up	O
on	O
heaps	O
,	O
and	O
no	O
carrying	O
them	O
away	O
in	O
a	O
sack	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
one	O
way	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
destroyed	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
way	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
crushed	O
with	O
their	O
own	O
weight	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
another	O
course	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
gathered	O
a	O
large	O
quantity	O
of	O
the	O
grapes	O
,	O
and	O
hung	O
upon	O
the	O
out-branches	O
of	O
the	O
trees	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
cure	O
and	O
dry	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
for	O
the	O
limes	O
and	O
lemons	O
,	O
I	O
carried	O
as	O
many	O
back	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
well	O
stand	O
under	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
came	O
home	O
from	O
this	O
journey	O
,	O
I	O
contemplated	O
with	O
great	O
pleasure	O
the	O
fruitfulness	O
of	O
that	O
valley	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
pleasantness	O
of	O
the	O
situation	O
;	O
the	O
security	O
from	O
storms	O
on	O
that	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
wood	O
:	O
and	O
concluded	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
pitched	O
upon	O
a	O
place	O
to	O
fix	O
my	O
abode	O
which	O
was	O
by	O
far	O
the	O
worst	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
.	O

Upon	O
the	O
whole	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
consider	O
of	O
removing	O
my	O
habitation	O
,	O
and	O
looking	O
out	O
for	O
a	O
place	O
equally	O
safe	O
as	O
where	O
now	O
I	O
was	O
situate	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
in	O
that	O
pleasant	O
,	O
fruitful	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

This	O
thought	O
ran	O
long	O
in	O
my	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
exceeding	O
fond	O
of	O
it	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
the	O
pleasantness	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
tempting	O
me	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
nearer	O
view	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
considered	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
now	O
by	O
the	O
seaside	O
,	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
at	O
least	O
possible	O
that	O
something	O
might	O
happen	O
to	O
my	O
advantage	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
same	O
ill	O
fate	O
that	O
brought	O
me	O
hither	O
might	O
bring	O
some	O
other	O
unhappy	O
wretches	O
to	O
the	O
same	O
place	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
scarce	O
probable	O
that	O
any	O
such	O
thing	O
should	O
ever	O
happen	O
,	O
yet	O
to	O
enclose	O
myself	O
among	O
the	O
hills	O
and	O
woods	O
in	O
the	O
centre	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
was	O
to	O
anticipate	O
my	O
bondage	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
render	O
such	O
an	O
affair	O
not	O
only	O
improbable	O
,	O
but	O
impossible	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
therefore	O
I	O
ought	O
not	O
by	O
any	O
means	O
to	O
remove	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
so	O
enamoured	O
of	O
this	O
place	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
spent	O
much	O
of	O
my	O
time	O
there	O
for	O
the	O
whole	O
of	O
the	O
remaining	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
month	O
of	O
July	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
upon	O
second	O
thoughts	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
not	O
to	O
remove	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
built	O
me	O
a	O
little	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
bower	O
,	O
and	O
surrounded	O
it	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
with	O
a	O
strong	O
fence	O
,	O
being	O
a	O
double	O
hedge	O
,	O
as	O
high	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
reach	O
,	O
well	O
staked	O
and	O
filled	O
between	O
with	O
brushwood	O
;	O
and	O
here	O
I	O
lay	O
very	O
secure	O
,	O
sometimes	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
nights	O
together	O
;	O
always	O
going	O
over	O
it	O
with	O
a	O
ladder	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
fancied	O
now	O
I	O
had	O
my	O
country	O
house	O
and	O
my	O
sea-coast	O
house	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
work	O
took	O
me	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
August	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
but	O
newly	O
finished	O
my	O
fence	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
enjoy	O
my	O
labour	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
rains	O
came	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
me	O
stick	O
close	O
to	O
my	O
first	O
habitation	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
me	O
a	O
tent	O
like	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
a	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
spread	O
it	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
the	O
shelter	O
of	O
a	O
hill	O
to	O
keep	O
me	O
from	O
storms	O
,	O
nor	O
a	O
cave	O
behind	O
me	O
to	O
retreat	O
into	O
when	O
the	O
rains	O
were	O
extraordinary	O
.	O

About	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
August	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
finished	O
my	O
bower	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
enjoy	O
myself	O
.	O

The	O
3rd	O
of	O
August	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
the	O
grapes	O
I	O
had	O
hung	O
up	O
perfectly	O
dried	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
were	O
excellent	O
good	O
raisins	O
of	O
the	O
sun	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
take	O
them	O
down	O
from	O
the	O
trees	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
happy	O
that	O
I	O
did	O
so	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
rains	O
which	O
followed	O
would	O
have	O
spoiled	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
lost	O
the	O
best	O
part	O
of	O
my	O
winter	O
food	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
above	O
two	O
hundred	O
large	O
bunches	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

No	O
sooner	O
had	O
I	O
taken	O
them	O
all	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
the	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
home	O
to	O
my	O
cave	O
,	O
than	O
it	O
began	O
to	O
rain	O
;	O
and	O
from	O
hence	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
14th	O
of	O
August	O
,	O
it	O
rained	O
,	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
,	O
every	O
day	O
till	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
October	O
;	O
and	O
sometimes	O
so	O
violently	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
stir	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
cave	O
for	O
several	O
days	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
season	O
I	O
was	O
much	O
surprised	O
with	O
the	O
increase	O
of	O
my	O
family	O
;	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
concerned	O
for	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
cats	O
,	O
who	O
ran	O
away	O
from	O
me	O
,	O
or	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
dead	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
heard	O
no	O
more	O
tidings	O
of	O
her	O
till	O
,	O
to	O
my	O
astonishment	O
,	O
she	O
came	O
home	O
about	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
August	O
with	O
three	O
kittens	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
more	O
strange	O
to	O
me	O
because	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
had	O
killed	O
a	O
wild	O
cat	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
called	O
it	O
,	O
with	O
my	O
gun	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
quite	O
a	O
different	O
kind	O
from	O
our	O
European	O
cats	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
young	O
cats	O
were	O
the	O
same	O
kind	O
of	O
house-breed	O
as	O
the	O
old	O
one	O
;	O
and	O
both	O
my	O
cats	O
being	O
females	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
very	O
strange	O
.	O

But	O
from	O
these	O
three	O
cats	O
I	O
afterwards	O
came	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
pestered	O
with	O
cats	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
kill	O
them	O
like	O
vermin	O
or	O
wild	O
beasts	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
drive	O
them	O
from	O
my	O
house	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
possible	O
.	O

From	O
the	O
14th	O
of	O
August	O
to	O
the	O
26th	O
,	O
incessant	O
rain	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
stir	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
now	O
very	O
careful	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
much	O
wet	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
confinement	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
straitened	O
for	O
food	O
:	O
but	O
venturing	O
out	O
twice	O
,	O
I	O
one	O
day	O
killed	O
a	O
goat	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
last	O
day	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
26th	O
,	O
found	O
a	O
very	O
large	O
tortoise	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
treat	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
food	O
was	O
regulated	O
thus	O
:	O
I	O
ate	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
raisins	O
for	O
my	O
breakfast	O
;	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
the	O
goat	O
's	O
flesh	O
,	O
or	O
of	O
the	O
turtle	O
,	O
for	O
my	O
dinner	O
,	O
broiled	O
--	O
for	O
,	O
to	O
my	O
great	O
misfortune	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
vessel	O
to	O
boil	O
or	O
stew	O
anything	O
;	O
and	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
of	O
the	O
turtle	O
's	O
eggs	O
for	O
my	O
supper	O
.	O

During	O
this	O
confinement	O
in	O
my	O
cover	O
by	O
the	O
rain	O
,	O
I	O
worked	O
daily	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
hours	O
at	O
enlarging	O
my	O
cave	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
degrees	O
worked	O
it	O
on	O
towards	O
one	O
side	O
,	O
till	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
outside	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
door	O
or	O
way	O
out	O
,	O
which	O
came	O
beyond	O
my	O
fence	O
or	O
wall	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
I	O
came	O
in	O
and	O
out	O
this	O
way	O

But	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
perfectly	O
easy	O
at	O
lying	O
so	O
open	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O

myself	O
before	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
perfect	O
enclosure	O
;	O

now	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O
lay	O
exposed	O

and	O
open	O
for	O
anything	O
to	O
come	O
in	O
upon	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
yet	O
I	O
could	O
not	O

that	O
there	O
was	O
any	O

thing	O

the	O

to	O
the	O

anniversary	O
of	O
my	O

I	O
cast	O
up	O

on	O

three	O

sixty-five	O
days	O

I	O
kept	O

as	O
a	O

setting	O
it	O

for	O

even	O
till	O
the	O
going	O
down	O
of	O

I	O
then	O
ate	O
a	O

a	O

and	O
went	O
to	O
bed	O

finishing	O
the	O
day	O
as	O
I	O
began	O
it	O

I	O
had	O
all	O
this	O
time	O
observed	O
no	O
Sabbath	O

;	O
for	O
as	O
at	O
first	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
sense	O
of	O

upon	O

I	O
had	O

after	O

omitted	O
to	O
distinguish	O

by	O

now	O

up	O

I	O
found	O
I	O

there	O
a	O

I	O
divided	O
it	O
into	O

set	O
apart	O
every	O
seventh	O
day	O
for	O
a	O

I	O
found	O
at	O

A	O
little	O
after	O
this	O
,	O
my	O
ink	O
began	O
to	O
fail	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
I	O
contented	O
myself	O
to	O
use	O
it	O
more	O
sparingly	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
write	O
down	O
only	O
the	O

The	O
rainy	O
season	O
and	O
the	O
dry	O
season	O
began	O
now	O
to	O
appear	O
regular	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
learned	O
to	O
divide	O
them	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
provide	O
for	O
them	O
accordingly	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
bought	O
all	O
my	O
experience	O
before	O
I	O
had	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
I	O
am	O
going	O
to	O
relate	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
discouraging	O
experiments	O
that	O
I	O
made	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
mentioned	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
saved	O
the	O
few	O
ears	O
of	O
barley	O
and	O
rice	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
so	O
surprisingly	O
found	O
spring	O
up	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
of	O
themselves	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
believe	O
there	O
were	O
about	O
thirty	O
stalks	O
of	O
rice	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
twenty	O
of	O
barley	O
;	O
and	O
now	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
a	O
proper	O
time	O
to	O
sow	O
it	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
rains	O
,	O
the	O
sun	O
being	O
in	O
its	O
southern	O
position	O
,	O
going	O
from	O
me	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
I	O
dug	O
up	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
ground	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
with	O
my	O
wooden	O
spade	O
,	O
and	O
dividing	O
it	O
into	O
two	O
parts	O
,	O
I	O
sowed	O
my	O
grain	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
sowing	O
,	O
it	O
casually	O
occurred	O
to	O
my	O
thoughts	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
sow	O
it	O
all	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
when	O
was	O
the	O
proper	O
time	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
sowed	O
about	O
two-thirds	O
of	O
the	O
seed	O
,	O
leaving	O
about	O
a	O
handful	O
of	O
each	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
comfort	O
to	O
me	O
afterwards	O
that	O
I	O
did	O
so	O
,	O
for	O
not	O
one	O
grain	O
of	O
what	O
I	O
sowed	O
this	O
time	O
came	O
to	O
anything	O
:	O
for	O
the	O
dry	O
months	O
following	O
,	O
the	O
earth	O
having	O
had	O
no	O
rain	O
after	O
the	O
seed	O
was	O
sown	O
,	O
it	O
had	O
no	O
moisture	O
to	O
assist	O
its	O
growth	O
,	O
and	O
never	O
came	O
up	O
at	O
all	O
till	O
the	O
wet	O
season	O
had	O
come	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
it	O
grew	O
as	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
but	O
newly	O
sown	O
.	O

Finding	O
my	O
first	O
seed	O
did	O
not	O
grow	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
easily	O
imagined	O
was	O
by	O
the	O
drought	O
,	O
I	O
sought	O
for	O
a	O
moister	O
piece	O
of	O
ground	O
to	O
make	O
another	O
trial	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
dug	O
up	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
ground	O
near	O
my	O
new	O
bower	O
,	O
and	O
sowed	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
my	O
seed	O
in	O
February	O
,	O
a	O
little	O
before	O
the	O
vernal	O
equinox	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
having	O
the	O
rainy	O
months	O
of	O
March	O
and	O
April	O
to	O
water	O
it	O
,	O
sprung	O
up	O
very	O
pleasantly	O
,	O
and	O
yielded	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
crop	O
;	O
but	O
having	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
seed	O
left	O
only	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
daring	O
to	O
sow	O
all	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
but	O
a	O
small	O
quantity	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
my	O
whole	O
crop	O
not	O
amounting	O
to	O
above	O
half	O
a	O
peck	O
of	O
each	O
kind	O
.	O

But	O
by	O
this	O
experiment	O
I	O
was	O
made	O
master	O
of	O
my	O
business	O
,	O
and	O
knew	O
exactly	O
when	O
the	O
proper	O
season	O
was	O
to	O
sow	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
expect	O
two	O
seed-times	O
and	O
two	O
harvests	O
every	O
year	O
.	O

While	O
this	O
corn	O
was	O
growing	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
little	O
discovery	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
of	O
use	O
to	O
me	O
afterwards	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
rains	O
were	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
weather	O
began	O
to	O
settle	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
about	O
the	O
month	O
of	O
November	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
visit	O
up	O
the	O
country	O
to	O
my	O
bower	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
some	O
months	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
found	O
all	O
things	O
just	O
as	O
I	O
left	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
circle	O
or	O
double	O
hedge	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
was	O
not	O
only	O
firm	O
and	O
entire	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
stakes	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
cut	O
out	O
of	O
some	O
trees	O
that	O
grew	O
thereabouts	O
were	O
all	O
shot	O
out	O
and	O
grown	O
with	O
long	O
branches	O
,	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
a	O
willow-tree	O
usually	O
shoots	O
the	O
first	O
year	O
after	O
lopping	O
its	O
head	O
.	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
what	O
tree	O
to	O
call	O
it	O
that	O
these	O
stakes	O
were	O
cut	O
from	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
surprised	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
very	O
well	O
pleased	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
young	O
trees	O
grow	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
pruned	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
led	O
them	O
up	O
to	O
grow	O
as	O
much	O
alike	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
scarce	O
credible	O
how	O
beautiful	O
a	O
figure	O
they	O
grew	O
into	O
in	O
three	O
years	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
though	O
the	O
hedge	O
made	O
a	O
circle	O
of	O
about	O
twenty-five	O
yards	O
in	O
diameter	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
trees	O
,	O
for	O
such	O
I	O
might	O
now	O
call	O
them	O
,	O
soon	O
covered	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
complete	O
shade	O
,	O
sufficient	O
to	O
lodge	O
under	O
all	O
the	O
dry	O
season	O
.	O

This	O
made	O
me	O
resolve	O
to	O
cut	O
some	O
more	O
stakes	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
me	O
a	O
hedge	O
like	O
this	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
semi-circle	O
round	O
my	O
wall	O
-LRB-	O
I	O
mean	O
that	O
of	O
my	O
first	O
dwelling	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
did	O
;	O
and	O
placing	O
the	O
trees	O
or	O
stakes	O
in	O
a	O
double	O
row	O
,	O
at	O
about	O
eight	O
yards	O
distance	O
from	O
my	O
first	O
fence	O
,	O
they	O
grew	O
presently	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
at	O
first	O
a	O
fine	O
cover	O
to	O
my	O
habitation	O
,	O
and	O
afterwards	O
served	O
for	O
a	O
defence	O
also	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
shall	O
observe	O
in	O
its	O
order	O

I	O
found	O
now	O
that	O
the	O
seasons	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
might	O
generally	O
be	O
divided	O

not	O
into	O

into	O

as	O
the	O

but	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
general	O
observation	O
I	O
made	O

After	O
I	O
had	O
found	O
by	O
experience	O
the	O
ill	O
consequences	O
of	O
being	O
abroad	O
in	O
the	O
rain	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
care	O
to	O
furnish	O
myself	O
with	O
provisions	O
beforehand	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
not	O
be	O

to	O
go	O
out	O

I	O
sat	O
within	O

as	O
much	O
as	O
possible	O
during	O
the	O
wet	O
months	O

This	O
time	O
I	O
found	O
much	O
employment	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
suitable	O
also	O
to	O
the	O
time	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
found	O
great	O
occasion	O
for	O
many	O
things	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
no	O

to	O
furnish	O
myself	O
with	O
but	O
by	O
hard	O
labour	O
and	O
constant	O
application	O
;	O
particularly	O
I	O
tried	O
many	O
ways	O
to	O

basket	O

but	O
all	O
the	O
twigs	O
I	O
could	O

for	O
the	O

proved	O
so	O

that	O
they	O
would	O
do	O
nothing	O

It	O
proved	O
of	O
excellent	O
advantage	O
to	O
me	O
now	O
,	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
a	O

in	O

very	O
officious	O
to	O

and	O
a	O

observer	O
of	O
the	O

in	O

they	O
worked	O
those	O
things	O

and	O
sometimes	O
lending	O
a	O

I	O
had	O
by	O
these	O
means	O
full	O
knowledge	O
of	O
the	O

of	O
it	O

and	O
I	O
wanted	O
nothing	O
but	O
the	O
materials	O
,	O
when	O
it	O
came	O
into	O
my	O
mind	O
that	O
the	O
twigs	O
of	O
that	O
tree	O
from	O
whence	O
I	O
cut	O
my	O
stakes	O
that	O

might	O

be	O
as	O

as	O
the	O
sallows	O

,	O
and	O
osiers	O
in	O
England	PNM
,	O
and	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
try	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
my	O
country	O
house	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
called	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
cutting	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
smaller	O
twigs	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
them	O
to	O
my	O
purpose	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
desire	O
;	O
whereupon	O
I	O
came	O
the	O
next	O
time	O
prepared	O
with	O
a	O
hatchet	O
to	O
cut	O
down	O
a	O
quantity	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
soon	O
found	O
,	O
for	O
there	O
was	O
great	O
plenty	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

These	O
I	O
set	O
up	O
to	O
dry	O
within	O
my	O
circle	O
or	O
hedge	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
fit	O
for	O
use	O
I	O
carried	O
them	O
to	O
my	O
cave	O
;	O
and	O
here	O
,	O
during	O
the	O
next	O
season	O
,	O
I	O
employed	O
myself	O
in	O
making	O

as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
a	O
great	O
many	O

to	O

to	O

lay	O
up	O
anything	O

as	O
I	O
had	O
occasion	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
finish	O
them	O
very	O
handsomely	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
made	O
them	O
sufficiently	O
serviceable	O
for	O
my	O
purpose	O
;	O
thus	O
,	O
afterwards	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
care	O
never	O
to	O
be	O
without	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
my	O
wicker-ware	O
decayed	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
more	O
,	O
especially	O
strong	O

deep	O
baskets	O
to	O
place	O
my	O

in	O

a	O

to	O
see	O

if	O

how	O
to	O
supply	O
two	O

I	O
had	O
no	O

to	O
hold	O
anything	O
that	O
was	O
liquid	O

except	O
two	O

were	O
almost	O
full	O

for	O
the	O

I	O
had	O

anything	O

a	O

SURVEYS	O
HIS	O
POSITION	O
I	O
mentioned	O
before	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
mind	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
whole	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
travelled	O
up	O
the	O
brook	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
on	O
to	O
where	O
I	O
built	O
my	O
bower	O

and	O
where	O
I	O
had	O
an	O
opening	O
quite	O
to	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O

I	O
now	O
resolved	O
to	O
travel	O
quite	O
across	O
to	O
the	O
sea-shore	O
on	O
that	O
side	O
;	O
so	O
,	O
taking	O
my	O
gun	O
,	O
a	O
hatchet	O

and	O
my	O
dog	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
larger	O
quantity	O
of	O
powder	O

than	O
usual	O

with	O
two	O
biscuit-cakes	O

a	O
great	O
bunch	O
of	O
raisins	O
in	O
my	O
pouch	O
for	O
my	O
store	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
my	O
journey	O

When	O
I	O
had	O
passed	O
the	O
vale	O
where	O
my	O
bower	O
stood	O
,	O
as	O
above	O
,	O
I	O
came	O
within	O
view	O
of	O
the	O

to	O
the	O
west	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
being	O
a	O
very	O
clear	O
day	O
,	O
I	O
fairly	O
descried	O
land	O
--	O
whether	O
an	O
island	O

a	O
continent	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
lay	O
very	O
high	O

extending	O
from	O
the	O
W.	O
to	O
the	O
W.S.W.	O
at	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
distance	O
;	O
by	O
my	O
guess	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
less	O
than	O
fifteen	O
or	O
twenty	O
leagues	O
off	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
what	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
this	O
might	O
be	O

otherwise	O
than	O
that	O
I	O
knew	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
part	O
of	O
America	PNM
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
concluded	O
by	O
all	O
my	O
observations	O
,	O
must	O
be	O
near	O
the	O
Spanish	O
dominions	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
was	O
all	O
inhabited	O
by	O
savages	O

where	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
landed	O

I	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
a	O
worse	O
condition	O
than	O
I	O
was	O
now	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
I	O
acquiesced	O
in	O
the	O
dispositions	O
of	O
Providence	PNM

which	O
I	O
began	O
now	O
to	O
own	O

to	O
believe	O
ordered	O
everything	O
for	O
the	O
best	O
;	O
I	O
say	O
I	O
quieted	O
my	O

and	O
left	O
off	O
afflicting	O
myself	O
with	O
fruitless	O
wishes	O
of	O
being	O
there	O
.	O

Besides	O
,	O
after	O
some	O
thought	O
upon	O
this	O
affair	O
,	O
I	O
considered	O
that	O
if	O
this	O
land	O
was	O
the	O
Spanish	O
coast	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
certainly	O
,	O
one	O
time	O
or	O
other	O
,	O
see	O
some	O
vessel	O
pass	O
or	O
repass	O
one	O
way	O
or	O
other	O
;	O
but	O
if	O
not	O
,	O
then	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
savage	O
coast	O
between	O
the	O
Spanish	O
country	O
and	O
Brazils	PNM
,	O
where	O
are	O
found	O
the	O
worst	O
of	O
savages	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
are	O
cannibals	O
or	O
men-eaters	O
,	O
and	O
fail	O
not	O
to	O
murder	O
and	O
devour	O
all	O
the	O
human	O
bodies	O
that	O
fall	O
into	O
their	O
hands	O
.	O

With	O
these	O
considerations	O
,	O
I	O
walked	O
very	O
leisurely	O
forward	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
that	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
where	O
I	O
now	O
was	O
much	O
pleasanter	O
than	O
mine	O
--	O
the	O
open	O
or	O
savannah	O
fields	O
sweet	O
,	O
adorned	O
with	O
flowers	O
and	O
grass	O
,	O
and	O
full	O
of	O
very	O
fine	O
woods	O
.	O

I	O
saw	O
abundance	O
of	O
parrots	O
,	O
and	O
fain	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
caught	O
one	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
to	O
have	O
kept	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
tame	O
,	O
and	O
taught	O
it	O
to	O
speak	O
to	O
me	O
.	O

I	O
did	O
,	O
after	O
some	O
painstaking	O
,	O
catch	O
a	O
young	O
parrot	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
knocked	O
it	O
down	O
with	O
a	O
stick	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
recovered	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
brought	O
it	O
home	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
some	O
years	O
before	O
I	O
could	O
make	O
him	O
speak	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
at	O
last	O
I	O
taught	O
him	O
to	O
call	O
me	O
by	O
name	O
very	O
familiarly	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
accident	O
that	O
followed	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
be	O
a	O
trifle	O
,	O
will	O
be	O
very	O
diverting	O
in	O
its	O
place	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
exceedingly	O
diverted	O
with	O
this	O
journey	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
low	O
grounds	O
hares	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
I	O
thought	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
-RRB-	O
and	O
foxes	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
differed	O
greatly	O
from	O
all	O
the	O
other	O
kinds	O
I	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
,	O
nor	O
could	O
I	O
satisfy	O
myself	O
to	O
eat	O
them	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
killed	O
several	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
venturous	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
want	O
of	O
food	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
that	O
which	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
too	O
,	O
especially	O
these	O
three	O
sorts	O
,	O
viz.	O
goats	O
,	O
pigeons	O
,	O
and	O
turtle	O
,	O
or	O
tortoise	O
,	O
which	O
added	O
to	O
my	O
grapes	O
,	O
Leadenhall	O
market	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
furnished	O
a	O
table	O
better	O
than	O
I	O
,	O
in	O
proportion	O
to	O
the	O
company	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
my	O
case	O
was	O
deplorable	O
enough	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
had	O
great	O
cause	O
for	O
thankfulness	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
driven	O
to	O
any	O
extremities	O
for	O
food	O
,	O
but	O
had	O
rather	O
plenty	O
,	O
even	O
to	O
dainties	O
.	O

I	O
never	O
travelled	O
in	O
this	O
journey	O
above	O
two	O
miles	O
outright	O
in	O
a	O
day	O
,	O
or	O
thereabouts	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
took	O
so	O
many	O
turns	O
and	O
re-turns	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
discoveries	O
I	O
could	O
make	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
came	O
weary	O
enough	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
sit	O
down	O
all	O
night	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
either	O
reposed	O
myself	O
in	O
a	O
tree	O
,	O
or	O
surrounded	O
myself	O
with	O
a	O
row	O
of	O
stakes	O
set	O
upright	O
in	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
either	O
from	O
one	O
tree	O
to	O
another	O
,	O
or	O
so	O
as	O
no	O
wild	O
creature	O
could	O
come	O
at	O
me	O
without	O
waking	O
me	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
sea-shore	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
surprised	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
taken	O
up	O
my	O
lot	O
on	O
the	O
worst	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
for	O
here	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
the	O
shore	O
was	O
covered	O
with	O
innumerable	O
turtles	O
,	O
whereas	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
I	O
had	O
found	O
but	O
three	O
in	O
a	O
year	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
.	O

Here	O
was	O
also	O
an	O
infinite	O
number	O
of	O
fowls	O
of	O
many	O
kinds	O
,	O
some	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
seen	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
very	O
good	O
meat	O
,	O
but	O
such	O
as	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
the	O
names	O
of	O
,	O
except	O
those	O
called	O
penguins	O
.	O

I	O
could	O
have	O
shot	O
as	O
many	O
as	O
I	O
pleased	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
very	O
sparing	O
of	O
my	O
powder	O
and	O
shot	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
had	O
more	O
mind	O
to	O
kill	O
a	O
she-goat	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
could	O
better	O
feed	O
on	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
there	O
were	O
many	O
goats	O
here	O
,	O
more	O
than	O
on	O
my	O
side	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
was	O
with	O
much	O
more	O
difficulty	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
come	O
near	O
them	O
,	O
the	O
country	O
being	O
flat	O
and	O
even	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
saw	O
me	O
much	O
sooner	O
than	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
hills	O
.	O

I	O
confess	O
this	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
was	O
much	O
pleasanter	O
than	O
mine	O
;	O
but	O
yet	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
the	O
least	O
inclination	O
to	O
remove	O
,	O
for	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
fixed	O
in	O
my	O
habitation	O
it	O
became	O
natural	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
seemed	O
all	O
the	O
while	O
I	O
was	O
here	O
to	O
be	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
upon	O
a	O
journey	O
,	O
and	O
from	O
home	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
travelled	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
towards	O
the	O
east	O
,	O
I	O
suppose	O
about	O
twelve	O
miles	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
setting	O
up	O
a	O
great	O
pole	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
for	O
a	O
mark	O
,	O
I	O
concluded	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
home	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
next	O
journey	O
I	O
took	O
should	O
be	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
east	O
from	O
my	O
dwelling	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
round	O
till	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
my	O
post	O
again	O
.	O

I	O
took	O
another	O
way	O
to	O
come	O
back	O
than	O
that	O
I	O
went	O
,	O
thinking	O
I	O
could	O
easily	O
keep	O
all	O
the	O
island	O
so	O
much	O
in	O
my	O
view	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
miss	O
finding	O
my	O
first	O
dwelling	O
by	O
viewing	O
the	O
country	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
found	O
myself	O
mistaken	O
,	O
for	O
being	O
come	O
about	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
miles	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
myself	O
descended	O
into	O
a	O
very	O
large	O
valley	O
,	O
but	O
so	O
surrounded	O
with	O
hills	O
,	O
and	O
those	O
hills	O
covered	O
with	O
wood	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
see	O
which	O
was	O
my	O
way	O
by	O
any	O
direction	O
but	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
nor	O
even	O
then	O
,	O
unless	O
I	O
knew	O
very	O
well	O
the	O
position	O
of	O
the	O
sun	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
.	O

It	O
happened	O
,	O
to	O
my	O
further	O
misfortune	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
weather	O
proved	O
hazy	O
for	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
days	O
while	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
valley	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
I	O
wandered	O
about	O
very	O
uncomfortably	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
seaside	O
,	O
look	O
for	O
my	O
post	O
,	O
and	O
come	O
back	O
the	O
same	O
way	O
I	O
went	O
:	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
by	O
easy	O
journeys	O
,	O
I	O
turned	O
homeward	O
,	O
the	O
weather	O
being	O
exceeding	O
hot	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
gun	O
,	O
ammunition	O
,	O
hatchet	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
things	O
very	O
heavy	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
journey	O
my	O
dog	O
surprised	O
a	O
young	O
kid	O
,	O
and	O
seized	O
upon	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
,	O
running	O
in	O
to	O
take	O
hold	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
caught	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
saved	O
it	O
alive	O
from	O
the	O
dog	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
mind	O
to	O
bring	O
it	O
home	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
often	O
been	O
musing	O
whether	O
it	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
possible	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
kid	O
or	O
two	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
raise	O
a	O
breed	O
of	O
tame	O
goats	O
,	O
which	O
might	O
supply	O
me	O
when	O
my	O
powder	O
and	O
shot	O
should	O
be	O
all	O
spent	O
.	O

I	O
made	O
a	O
collar	O
for	O
this	O
little	O
creature	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
a	O
string	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
made	O
of	O
some	O
rope-yam	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
always	O
carried	O
about	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
led	O
him	O
along	O
,	O
though	O
with	O
some	O
difficulty	O
,	O
till	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
my	O
bower	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
I	O
enclosed	O
him	O
and	O
left	O
him	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
impatient	O
to	O
be	O
at	O
home	O
,	O
from	O
whence	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
absent	O
above	O
a	O
month	O
.	O

I	O
can	O
not	O
express	O
what	O
a	O
satisfaction	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
come	O
into	O
my	O
old	O
hutch	O
,	O
and	O
lie	O
down	O
in	O
my	O
hammock-bed	O

This	O
little	O
wandering	O
journey	O
,	O
without	O
settled	O
place	O
of	O
abode	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
unpleasant	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
my	O
own	O
house	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
called	O
it	O
to	O
myself	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
perfect	O
settlement	O
to	O
me	O
compared	O
to	O
that	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
rendered	O
everything	O
about	O
me	O
so	O
comfortable	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
resolved	O
I	O
would	O
never	O
go	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
from	O
it	O
again	O
while	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
my	O
lot	O
to	O
stay	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

I	O
reposed	O
myself	O
here	O
a	O
week	O
,	O
to	O
rest	O
and	O
regale	O
myself	O
after	O
my	O
long	O
journey	O
;	O
during	O
which	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
time	O
was	O
taken	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
weighty	O
affair	O
of	O
making	O
a	O
cage	O
for	O
my	O
Poll	O
,	O
who	O
began	O
now	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
mere	O
domestic	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
be	O
well	O
acquainted	O
with	O
me	O
.	O

Then	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
the	O
poor	O
kid	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
penned	O
in	O
within	O
my	O
little	O
circle	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
fetch	O
it	O
home	O
,	O
or	O
give	O
it	O
some	O
food	O
;	O
accordingly	O
I	O
went	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
it	O
where	O
I	O
left	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
indeed	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
out	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
almost	O
starved	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
food	O
.	O

I	O
went	O
and	O
cut	O
boughs	O
of	O
trees	O
,	O
and	O
branches	O
of	O
such	O
shrubs	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
find	O
,	O
and	O
threw	O
it	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
fed	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
tied	O
it	O
as	O
I	O
did	O
before	O
,	O
to	O
lead	O
it	O
away	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
tame	O
with	O
being	O
hungry	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
need	O
to	O
have	O
tied	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
followed	O
me	O
like	O
a	O
dog	O
:	O
and	O
as	O
I	O
continually	O
fed	O
it	O
,	O
the	O
creature	O
became	O
so	O
loving	O
,	O
so	O
gentle	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
fond	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
became	O
from	O
that	O
time	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
domestics	O
also	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
never	O
leave	O
me	O
afterwards	O
.	O

The	O
rainy	O
season	O
of	O
the	O
autumnal	O
equinox	O
was	O
now	O
come	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
kept	O
the	O
30th	O
of	O
September	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
solemn	O
manner	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
being	O
the	O
anniversary	O
of	O
my	O
landing	O
on	O
the	O
island	O

now	O
been	O
there	O
two	O

no	O

prospect	O
of	O
being	O
delivered	O
than	O
the	O
first	O
day	O
I	O
came	O
there	O

I	O
spent	O
the	O
whole	O
day	O
in	O
humble	O
and	O
thankful	O
acknowledgments	O
of	O
the	O
many	O

I	O
gave	O
humble	O

hearty	O
thanks	O
that	O
God	O
had	O
been	O
pleased	O
to	O
discover	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
it	O

possible	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
more	O
happy	O

I	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
in	O
the	O
liberty	O
of	O
society	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
pleasures	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
;	O
that	O
He	O
could	O
fully	O
make	O
up	O
to	O
me	O
the	O
deficiencies	O
of	O
my	O
solitary	O
state	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
human	O
society	O
,	O
by	O
His	O
presence	O
and	O
the	O
communications	O
of	O
His	O
grace	O
to	O
my	O

It	O
was	O
now	O
that	O
I	O
began	O
sensibly	O
to	O
feel	O
how	O
much	O
more	O
happy	O
this	O
life	O
I	O
now	O
led	O
was	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
its	O
miserable	O
circumstances	O
,	O
than	O
the	O
wicked	O
,	O
cursed	O
,	O
abominable	O
life	O
I	O
led	O
all	O
the	O
past	O
part	O
of	O
my	O
days	O
;	O
and	O
now	O
I	O
changed	O
both	O
my	O
sorrows	O
and	O
my	O
joys	O
;	O
my	O
very	O
desires	O
altered	O
,	O
my	O
affections	O
changed	O
their	O
gusts	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
delights	O
were	O
perfectly	O
new	O
from	O
what	O
they	O
were	O
at	O
my	O
first	O
coming	O
,	O
or	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
two	O
years	O
past	O
.	O

Before	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
walked	O
about	O
,	O
either	O
on	O
my	O
hunting	O
or	O
for	O
viewing	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
the	O
anguish	O
of	O
my	O
soul	O
at	O
my	O
condition	O
would	O
break	O
out	O
upon	O
me	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
very	O
heart	O
would	O
die	O
within	O
me	O
,	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
the	O
mountains	O
,	O
the	O
deserts	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
prisoner	O
,	O
locked	O
up	O
with	O
the	O
eternal	O
bars	O
and	O
bolts	O
of	O
the	O
ocean	O
,	O
in	O
an	O
uninhabited	O
wilderness	O
,	O
without	O
redemption	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
midst	O
of	O
the	O
greatest	O
composure	O
of	O
my	O
mind	O
,	O
this	O
would	O
break	O
out	O
upon	O
me	O
like	O
a	O
storm	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
me	O
wring	O
my	O
hands	O
and	O
weep	O
like	O
a	O
child	O
.	O

Sometimes	O
it	O
would	O
take	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
my	O
work	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
immediately	O
sit	O
down	O
and	O
sigh	O
,	O
and	O
look	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
for	O
an	O
hour	O
or	O
two	O
together	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
still	O
worse	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
for	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
burst	O
out	O
into	O
tears	O
,	O
or	O
vent	O
myself	O
by	O
words	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
go	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
grief	O
,	O
having	O
exhausted	O
itself	O
,	O
would	O
abate	O
.	O

But	O
now	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
exercise	O
myself	O
with	O
new	O
thoughts	O
:	O
I	O
daily	O
read	O
the	O
word	O
of	O
God	O
,	O
and	O
applied	O
all	O
the	O
comforts	O
of	O
it	O
to	O
my	O
present	O
state	O
.	O

One	O
morning	O
,	O
being	O
very	O
sad	O
,	O
I	O
opened	O
the	O
Bible	O
upon	O
these	O
words	O
,	O
``	O
I	O
will	O
never	O
,	O
never	O
leave	O
thee	O
,	O
nor	O
forsake	O
thee	O
.	O
''	O

Immediately	O
it	O
occurred	O
that	O
these	O
words	O
were	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
why	O
else	O
should	O
they	O
be	O
directed	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
manner	O
,	O
just	O
at	O
the	O
moment	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
mourning	O
over	O
my	O
condition	O
,	O
as	O
one	O
forsaken	O
of	O
God	O
and	O
man	O
?	O

``	O
Well	O
,	O
then	O
,	O
''	O
said	O
I	O
,	O
``	O
if	O
God	O
does	O
not	O
forsake	O
me	O
,	O
of	O
what	O
ill	O
consequence	O
can	O
it	O
be	O
,	O
or	O
what	O
matters	O
it	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
world	O
should	O
all	O
forsake	O
me	O
,	O
seeing	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
all	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
and	O
should	O
lose	O
the	O
favour	O
and	O
blessing	O
of	O
God	O
,	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
no	O
comparison	O
in	O
the	O
loss	O
?	O
''	O

From	O
this	O
moment	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
conclude	O
in	O
my	O
mind	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
possible	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
happy	O
in	O
this	O
forsaken	O
,	O
solitary	O
condition	O
than	O
it	O
was	O
probable	O
I	O
should	O
ever	O
have	O
been	O
in	O
any	O
other	O
particular	O
state	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
;	O
and	O
with	O
this	O
thought	O
I	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
give	O
thanks	O
to	O
God	O
for	O
bringing	O
me	O
to	O
this	O
place	O
.	O

I	O
know	O
not	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
but	O
something	O
shocked	O
my	O
mind	O
at	O
that	O
thought	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
durst	O
not	O
speak	O
the	O
words	O
.	O

``	O
How	O
canst	O
thou	O
become	O
such	O
a	O
hypocrite	O
,	O
''	O
said	O
I	O
,	O
even	O
audibly	O
,	O
``	O
to	O
pretend	O
to	O
be	O
thankful	O
for	O
a	O
condition	O

thou	O

thou	O
wouldst	O
rather	O
pray	O
heartily	O
to	O
be	O
delivered	O
from	O

''	O

So	O
I	O
stopped	O
there	O
;	O
but	O
though	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
say	O
I	O
thanked	O
God	O
for	O
being	O
there	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
sincerely	O
gave	O
thanks	O
to	O
God	O
for	O
opening	O
my	O
eyes	O
,	O
by	O
whatever	O
afflicting	O
providences	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
former	O
condition	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
mourn	O
for	O
my	O
wickedness	O
,	O
and	O
repent	O
.	O

I	O
never	O
opened	O
the	O
Bible	O
,	O
or	O
shut	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
my	O
very	O
soul	O
within	O
me	O
blessed	O
God	O
for	O
directing	O
my	O
friend	O
in	O
England	PNM
,	O
without	O
any	O
order	O
of	O
mine	O
,	O
to	O
pack	O
it	O
up	O
among	O
my	O
goods	O

and	O
for	O

me	O
afterwards	O
to	O
save	O
it	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
wreck	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

Thus	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
this	O
disposition	O
of	O
mind	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
my	O
third	O
year	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
I	O
have	O
not	O
given	O
the	O
reader	O
the	O
trouble	O
of	O
so	O
particular	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
my	O

this	O
year	O
as	O
the	O
first	O
,	O
yet	O
in	O
general	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
observed	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
seldom	O
idle	O
,	O
but	O
having	O
regularly	O
divided	O
my	O
time	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
several	O
daily	O
employments	O
that	O
were	O
before	O
me	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
:	O
first	O
,	O
my	O
duty	O
to	O
God	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
reading	O
the	O
Scriptures	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
constantly	O
set	O
apart	O
some	O
time	O
for	O
thrice	O
every	O
day	O
;	O
secondly	O
,	O
the	O
going	O
abroad	O
with	O
my	O
gun	O
for	O
food	O
,	O
which	O
generally	O
took	O
me	O
up	O
three	O
hours	O
in	O
every	O
morning	O
,	O
when	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
rain	O
;	O
thirdly	O
,	O
the	O
ordering	O
,	O
cutting	O
,	O
preserving	O
,	O
and	O
cooking	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
killed	O
or	O
caught	O
for	O
my	O
supply	O
;	O
these	O
took	O
up	O
great	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
.	O

Also	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
considered	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
sun	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
zenith	O
,	O
the	O
violence	O
of	O
the	O
heat	O
was	O
too	O
great	O
to	O
stir	O
out	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
about	O
four	O
hours	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
was	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
I	O
could	O
be	O
supposed	O
to	O
work	O
in	O
,	O
with	O
this	O
exception	O
,	O
that	O
sometimes	O
I	O
changed	O
my	O
hours	O
of	O
hunting	O
and	O
working	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
abroad	O
with	O
my	O
gun	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
.	O

To	O
this	O
short	O
time	O
allowed	O
for	O
labour	O
I	O
desire	O
may	O
be	O
added	O
the	O
exceeding	O
laboriousness	O
of	O
my	O
work	O
;	O
the	O
many	O
hours	O
which	O
,	O
for	O
want	O
of	O

want	O
of	O
help	O
,	O
and	O
want	O
of	O
skill	O
,	O
everything	O
I	O
did	O
took	O
up	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
time	O
.	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
full	O
two	O
and	O
forty	O
days	O
in	O
making	O
a	O
board	O
for	O
a	O
long	O
shelf	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
wanted	O
in	O
my	O
cave	O
;	O
whereas	O
,	O
two	O
sawyers	O
,	O
with	O
their	O
tools	O
and	O
a	O
saw-pit	O
,	O
would	O
have	O
cut	O
six	O
of	O
them	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
tree	O
in	O
half	O
a	O
day	O
.	O

My	O
case	O
was	O
this	O
:	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
large	O
tree	O
which	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
cut	O
down	O
,	O
because	O
my	O
board	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
broad	O
one	O
.	O

This	O
tree	O
I	O
was	O
three	O
days	O
in	O
cutting	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
more	O
cutting	O
off	O
the	O
boughs	O
,	O
and	O
reducing	O
it	O
to	O
a	O
log	O
or	O
piece	O
of	O
timber	O
.	O

With	O
inexpressible	O
hacking	O
and	O
hewing	O
I	O
reduced	O
both	O
the	O
sides	O
of	O
it	O
into	O
chips	O
till	O
it	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
light	O
enough	O
to	O
move	O
;	O
then	O
I	O
turned	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
one	O
side	O
of	O
it	O
smooth	O
and	O
flat	O
as	O
a	O
board	O
from	O
end	O
to	O
end	O
;	O
then	O
,	O
turning	O
that	O
side	O
downward	O
,	O
cut	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
til	O
I	O
brought	O
the	O
plank	O
to	O
be	O
about	O
three	O
inches	O
thick	O
,	O
and	O
smooth	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O

Any	O
one	O
may	O
judge	O
the	O
labour	O
of	O
my	O
hands	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
work	O
;	O
but	O
labour	O
and	O
patience	O
carried	O
me	O
through	O
that	O
,	O
and	O
many	O
other	O
things	O
.	O

I	O
only	O
observe	O
this	O
in	O
particular	O
,	O
to	O
show	O
the	O
reason	O
why	O
so	O
much	O
of	O
my	O
time	O
went	O
away	O
with	O
so	O
little	O
work	O
--	O
viz.	O
that	O
what	O
might	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
with	O
help	O
and	O
tools	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
vast	O
labour	O
and	O
required	O
a	O
prodigious	O
time	O
to	O
do	O
alone	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
hand	O
.	O

But	O
notwithstanding	O
this	O
,	O
with	O
patience	O
and	O
labour	O
I	O
got	O
through	O
everything	O
that	O
my	O
circumstances	O
made	O
necessary	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
as	O
will	O
appear	O
by	O
what	O
follows	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
now	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
months	O
of	O
November	O
and	O
December	O
,	O
expecting	O
my	O
crop	O
of	O
barley	O
and	O
rice	O
.	O

The	O
ground	O
I	O
had	O
manured	O
and	O
dug	O
up	O
for	O
them	O
was	O
not	O
great	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
observed	O
,	O
my	O
seed	O
of	O
each	O
was	O
not	O
above	O
the	O
quantity	O
of	O
half	O
a	O
peck	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
lost	O
one	O
whole	O
crop	O
by	O
sowing	O
in	O
the	O
dry	O
season	O
.	O

But	O
now	O
my	O
crop	O
promised	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
when	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
I	O
found	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
danger	O
of	O
losing	O
it	O
all	O
again	O
by	O
enemies	O
of	O
several	O
sorts	O
,	O
which	O
it	O
was	O
scarcely	O
possible	O
to	O
keep	O
from	O
it	O
;	O
as	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
the	O
goats	O
,	O
and	O
wild	O
creatures	O
which	O
I	O
called	O
hares	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
tasting	O
the	O
sweetness	O
of	O
the	O
blade	O
,	O
lay	O
in	O
it	O
night	O
and	O
day	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
it	O
came	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
eat	O
it	O
so	O
close	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
could	O
get	O
no	O
time	O
to	O
shoot	O
up	O
into	O
stalk	O
.	O

This	O
I	O
saw	O
no	O
remedy	O
for	O
but	O
by	O
making	O
an	O
enclosure	O
about	O
it	O
with	O
a	O
hedge	O
;	O
which	O
I	O
did	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
toil	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
more	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
required	O
speed	O

However	O
,	O
as	O
my	O
arable	O
land	O
was	O
but	O
small	O
,	O
suited	O
to	O
my	O
crop	O

three	O

the	O

before	O

my	O

was	O

going	O
along	O
by	O
the	O

to	O
see	O
how	O
it	O

I	O
saw	O
my	O

of	O
I	O

stood	O

watching	O

I	O
should	O
be	O
gone	O
.	O

I	O
immediately	O
let	O
fly	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
always	O
had	O
my	O
gun	O
with	O
me	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
no	O
sooner	O
shot	O
,	O
but	O
there	O
rose	O
up	O
a	O
little	O
cloud	O
of	O
fowls	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
seen	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
from	O
among	O
the	O
corn	O
itself	O
.	O

This	O
touched	O
me	O
sensibly	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
foresaw	O
that	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
they	O
would	O
devour	O
all	O
my	O
hopes	O
;	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
starved	O
,	O
and	O
never	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
raise	O
a	O
crop	O
at	O
all	O
;	O
and	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
not	O
to	O
lose	O
my	O
corn	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
should	O
watch	O
it	O
night	O
and	O
day	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
among	O
it	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
damage	O
was	O
already	O
done	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
they	O
had	O
spoiled	O
a	O
good	O
deal	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
yet	O
too	O
green	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
the	O
loss	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
great	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
remainder	O
was	O
likely	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
good	O
crop	O
if	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
saved	O
.	O

I	O
stayed	O
by	O
it	O
to	O
load	O
my	O
gun	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
coming	O
away	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
easily	O
see	O
the	O
thieves	O
sitting	O
upon	O
all	O
the	O
trees	O
about	O
me	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
only	O
waited	O
till	O
I	O
was	O
gone	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
event	O
proved	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
I	O
walked	O
off	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
gone	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
no	O
sooner	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
sight	O
than	O
they	O
dropped	O
down	O
one	O
by	O
one	O
into	O
the	O
corn	O
again	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
so	O
provoked	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
patience	O
to	O
stay	O
till	O
more	O
came	O
on	O
,	O
knowing	O
that	O
every	O
grain	O
that	O
they	O
ate	O
now	O
was	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
said	O
,	O
a	O
peck-loaf	O
to	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
consequence	O
;	O
but	O
coming	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
hedge	O
,	O
I	O
fired	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
killed	O
three	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
what	O
I	O
wished	O
for	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
took	O
them	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
served	O
them	O
as	O
we	O
serve	O
notorious	O
thieves	O
in	O
England	PNM
--	O
hanged	O
them	O
in	O
chains	O
,	O
for	O
a	O
terror	O
to	O
others	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
impossible	O
to	O
imagine	O
that	O
this	O
should	O
have	O
such	O
an	O
effect	O
as	O
it	O
had	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
fowls	O
would	O
not	O
only	O
not	O
come	O
at	O
the	O
corn	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
they	O
forsook	O
all	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
could	O
never	O
see	O
a	O
bird	O
near	O
the	O
place	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
my	O
scarecrows	O
hung	O
there	O

This	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
glad	O
of	O
,	O
you	O
may	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
the	O
latter	O
end	O
of	O
December	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
our	O
second	O
harvest	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
,	O
I	O
reaped	O
my	O
corn	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
sadly	O
put	O
to	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
scythe	O
or	O
sickle	O
to	O
cut	O
it	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
I	O
could	O
do	O
was	O
to	O
make	O
one	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
out	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
broadswords	O
,	O
or	O
cutlasses	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
saved	O
among	O
the	O
arms	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
as	O
my	O
first	O
crop	O
was	O
but	O
small	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
great	O
difficulty	O
to	O
cut	O
it	O
down	O
;	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
I	O
reaped	O
it	O
in	O
my	O
way	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
cut	O
nothing	O
off	O
but	O
the	O
ears	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
it	O
away	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
basket	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
rubbed	O
it	O
out	O
with	O
my	O
hands	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
all	O
my	O
harvesting	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
half-peck	O
of	O
seed	O
I	O
had	O
near	O
two	O
bushels	O
of	O
rice	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
two	O
bushels	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
of	O
barley	O
;	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
by	O
my	O
guess	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
measure	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
encouragement	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
foresaw	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
time	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
please	O
God	O
to	O
supply	O
me	O
with	O
bread	O
.	O

And	O
yet	O
here	O
I	O
was	O
perplexed	O
again	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
neither	O
knew	O
how	O
to	O
grind	O
or	O
make	O
meal	O
of	O
my	O
corn	O
,	O
or	O
indeed	O
how	O
to	O
clean	O
it	O
and	O
part	O
it	O
;	O
nor	O
,	O
if	O
made	O
into	O
meal	O
,	O
how	O
to	O
make	O
bread	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
how	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
how	O
to	O
bake	O
it	O
.	O

These	O
things	O
being	O
added	O
to	O
my	O
desire	O
of	O
having	O
a	O
good	O
quantity	O
for	O
store	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
secure	O
a	O
constant	O
supply	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
not	O
to	O
taste	O
any	O
of	O
this	O
crop	O
but	O
to	O
preserve	O
it	O
all	O
for	O
seed	O
against	O
the	O
next	O
season	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
meantime	O
to	O
employ	O
all	O
my	O
study	O
and	O
hours	O
of	O
working	O
to	O
accomplish	O
this	O
great	O
work	O
of	O
providing	O
myself	O
with	O
corn	O
and	O
bread	O
.	O

It	O
might	O
be	O
truly	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
now	O
I	O
worked	O
for	O
my	O
bread	O
.	O

I	O
believe	O
few	O
people	O
have	O
thought	O
much	O
upon	O
the	O
strange	O
multitude	O
of	O
little	O
things	O
necessary	O
in	O
the	O
providing	O
,	O
producing	O
,	O
curing	O
,	O
dressing	O
,	O
making	O
,	O
and	O
finishing	O
this	O
one	O
article	O
of	O
bread	O
.	O

I	O
,	O
that	O
was	O
reduced	O
to	O
a	O
mere	O
state	O
of	O
nature	O
,	O
found	O
this	O
to	O
my	O
daily	O
discouragement	O
;	O
and	O
was	O
made	O
more	O
sensible	O
of	O
it	O
every	O
hour	O
,	O
even	O
after	O
I	O
had	O
got	O
the	O
first	O
handful	O
of	O
seed-corn	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
came	O
up	O
unexpectedly	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
to	O
a	O
surprise	O
.	O

First	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
plough	O
to	O
turn	O
up	O
the	O
earth	O
--	O
no	O
spade	O
or	O
shovel	O
to	O
dig	O
it	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
this	O
I	O
conquered	O
by	O
making	O
me	O
a	O
wooden	O
spade	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
observed	O
before	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
did	O
my	O
work	O
but	O
in	O
a	O
wooden	O
manner	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
it	O
cost	O
me	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
days	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
,	O
yet	O
,	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
iron	O
,	O
it	O
not	O
only	O
wore	O
out	O
soon	O
,	O
but	O
made	O
my	O
work	O
the	O
harder	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
it	O
be	O
performed	O
much	O
worse	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
this	O
I	O
bore	O
with	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
content	O
to	O
work	O
it	O
out	O
with	O
patience	O
,	O
and	O
bear	O
with	O
the	O
badness	O
of	O
the	O
performance	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
corn	O
was	O
sown	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
harrow	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
go	O
over	O
it	O
myself	O
,	O
and	O
drag	O
a	O
great	O
heavy	O
bough	O
of	O
a	O
tree	O
over	O
it	O
,	O
to	O
scratch	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
called	O
,	O
rather	O
than	O
rake	O
or	O
harrow	O
it	O
.	O

When	O
it	O
was	O
growing	O
,	O
and	O
grown	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
observed	O
already	O
how	O
many	O
things	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
fence	O
it	O
,	O
secure	O
it	O
,	O
mow	O
or	O
reap	O
it	O
,	O
cure	O
and	O
carry	O
it	O
home	O
,	O
thrash	O
,	O
part	O
it	O
from	O
the	O
chaff	O
,	O
and	O
save	O
it	O
.	O

Then	O
I	O
wanted	O
a	O
mill	O
to	O
grind	O
it	O
,	O
sieves	O
to	O
dress	O
it	O
,	O
yeast	O
and	O
salt	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
into	O
bread	O
,	O
and	O
an	O
oven	O
to	O
bake	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
all	O
these	O
things	O
I	O
did	O
without	O
,	O
as	O
shall	O
be	O
observed	O
;	O
and	O
yet	O
the	O
corn	O
was	O
an	O
inestimable	O
comfort	O
and	O
advantage	O
to	O
me	O
too	O
.	O

All	O
this	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
made	O
everything	O
laborious	O
and	O
tedious	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
help	O
for	O
.	O

Neither	O
was	O
my	O
time	O
so	O
much	O
loss	O
to	O
me	O

because	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
divided	O
it	O

a	O
certain	O
part	O

was	O
every	O

till	O
I	O
had	O
a	O

quantity	O

I	O
had	O
the	O

CHAPTER	O
IX	O
--	O
A	O
BOAT	O
But	O
first	O
I	O
was	O
to	O
prepare	O
more	O
land	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
now	O
seed	O
enough	O
to	O
sow	O
above	O
an	O
acre	O
of	O
ground	O
.	O

Before	O
I	O
did	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
week	O
's	O
work	O
at	O
least	O
to	O
make	O
me	O
a	O
spade	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
done	O
,	O
was	O
but	O
a	O
sorry	O
one	O
indeed	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
heavy	O
,	O
and	O
required	O
double	O
labour	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
it	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
got	O
through	O
that	O
,	O
and	O
sowed	O
my	O
seed	O
in	O
two	O
large	O
flat	O
pieces	O
of	O
ground	O
,	O
as	O
near	O
my	O
house	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
find	O
them	O
to	O
my	O
mind	O
,	O
and	O
fenced	O
them	O
in	O
with	O
a	O
good	O
hedge	O
,	O
the	O
stakes	O
of	O
which	O
were	O
all	O
cut	O
off	O
that	O
wood	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
set	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
knew	O
it	O
would	O
grow	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
year	O
's	O
time	O
,	O
I	O
knew	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
a	O
quick	O
or	O
living	O
hedge	O
,	O
that	O
would	O
want	O
but	O
little	O
repair	O
.	O

This	O
work	O
did	O
not	O
take	O
me	O
up	O
less	O
than	O
three	O
months	O
,	O
because	O
a	O
great	O
part	O
of	O
that	O

as	O
the	O

I	O
miscarried	O
so	O
much	O
in	O
my	O
design	O
for	O
large	O

yet	O
I	O
made	O
several	O

But	O
all	O
this	O
would	O
not	O
answer	O
my	O
end	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
to	O
get	O
an	O
earthen	O
pot	O
to	O
hold	O
what	O
was	O

and	O
bear	O

none	O

It	O
happened	O
after	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
making	O
a	O
pretty	O
large	O
fire	O
for	O
cooking	O
my	O
meat	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
put	O
it	O
out	O
after	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
broken	O
piece	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
earthenware	O
vessels	O
in	O
the	O
fire	O

burnt	O
as	O
hard	O
as	O
a	O
stone	O

red	O
as	O
a	O

I	O
was	O
agreeably	O
surprised	O
to	O
see	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
to	O
myself	O
,	O
that	O
certainly	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
made	O
to	O
burn	O
whole	O

if	O
they	O
would	O
burn	O

This	O
set	O
me	O
to	O
study	O
how	O
to	O
order	O
my	O
fire	O
,	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
burn	O
some	O
pots	O

I	O
had	O
no	O
notion	O
of	O
a	O
kiln	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
potters	O
burn	O
in	O
,	O
or	O
of	O
glazing	O
them	O
with	O

,	O
though	O
I	O
had	O
some	O
lead	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
with	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
placed	O
three	O
large	O
pipkins	O
and	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
pots	O
in	O
a	O
pile	O
,	O
one	O
upon	O
another	O

and	O
placed	O
my	O
firewood	O
all	O
round	O
it	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
heap	O
of	O
embers	O
under	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
plied	O
the	O
fire	O
with	O
fresh	O
fuel	O
round	O
the	O
outside	O
and	O
upon	O
the	O
top	O
,	O
till	O
I	O
saw	O
the	O
pots	O
in	O
the	O
inside	O
red-hot	O
quite	O
through	O
,	O
and	O
observed	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
crack	O
at	O
all	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
saw	O
them	O
clear	O
red	O
,	O
I	O
let	O
them	O
stand	O
in	O
that	O
heat	O
about	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
hours	O
,	O
till	O
I	O
found	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
crack	O
,	O
did	O
melt	O
or	O
run	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
sand	O
which	O
was	O
mixed	O
with	O
the	O
clay	O
melted	O
by	O
the	O
violence	O
of	O
the	O
heat	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
have	O
run	O
into	O
glass	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
gone	O
on	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
slacked	O
my	O
fire	O
gradually	O
till	O
the	O
pots	O
began	O
to	O
abate	O
of	O
the	O
red	O
colour	O
;	O
and	O
watching	O
them	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
not	O
let	O
the	O
fire	O
abate	O
too	O
fast	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
I	O
had	O
three	O
very	O
good	O
-LRB-	O
I	O
will	O

handsome	O
-RRB-	O
pipkins	O

and	O
two	O
other	O
earthen	O
pots	O

as	O
hard	O
burnt	O
as	O
could	O
be	O
desired	O

and	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
perfectly	O
glazed	O
with	O
the	O
running	O
of	O
the	O
sand	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
experiment	O
,	O
I	O
need	O
not	O
say	O
that	O
I	O
wanted	O
no	O
sort	O
of	O
earthenware	O
for	O
my	O
use	O

but	O
I	O
must	O
needs	O
say	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
shapes	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
indifferent	O
,	O
as	O
any	O
one	O
may	O
suppose	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
way	O
of	O

them	O
but	O
as	O
the	O
children	O

as	O
a	O

No	O

a	O

a	O
nature	O
was	O
ever	O
equal	O
to	O
mine	O

when	O
I	O
found	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
an	O
earthen	O
pot	O
that	O
would	O
bear	O
the	O
fire	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
hardly	O
patience	O
to	O
stay	O
till	O
they	O
were	O
cold	O
before	O
I	O
set	O
one	O
on	O
the	O
fire	O
again	O
with	O
some	O
water	O
in	O
it	O
to	O
boil	O
me	O
some	O
meat	O

which	O
it	O
did	O
admirably	O
well	O
;	O
and	O
with	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
a	O
kid	O
I	O
made	O
some	O
very	O
good	O

I	O
wanted	O
oatmeal	O

and	O
several	O

to	O

it	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
had	O
it	O
been	O

My	O
next	O
concern	O
was	O
to	O
get	O
me	O
a	O
stone	O
mortar	O
to	O
stamp	O
or	O
beat	O
some	O
corn	O
in	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
mill	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
thought	O
of	O
arriving	O
at	O
that	O
perfection	O
of	O
art	O
with	O
one	O
pair	O
of	O

To	O
supply	O
this	O
want	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
loss	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
trades	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
as	O
perfectly	O
unqualified	O
for	O
a	O
stone-cutter	O
as	O
for	O
any	O
whatever	O
;	O
neither	O
had	O
I	O
any	O
tools	O
to	O
go	O
about	O
it	O
with	O
.	O

I	O
spent	O
many	O
a	O
day	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
a	O
great	O
stone	O
big	O
enough	O
to	O
cut	O
hollow	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
fit	O
for	O
a	O
mortar	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
find	O
none	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
except	O
what	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
solid	O
rock	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
way	O
to	O
dig	O
or	O
cut	O
out	O
;	O
nor	O
indeed	O
were	O
the	O
rocks	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
hardness	O
sufficient	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
all	O
of	O
a	O
sandy	O
,	O
crumbling	O
stone	O
,	O
which	O
neither	O
would	O
bear	O
the	O
weight	O
of	O
a	O
heavy	O
pestle	O
,	O
nor	O
would	O
break	O
the	O
corn	O
without	O
filling	O
it	O
with	O
sand	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
after	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
time	O
lost	O
in	O
searching	O
for	O
a	O
stone	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
it	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
to	O
look	O
out	O
for	O
a	O
great	O
block	O
of	O
hard	O
wood	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
found	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
much	O
easier	O
;	O
and	O
getting	O
one	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
strength	O
to	O
stir	O
,	O
I	O
rounded	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
formed	O
it	O
on	O
the	O
outside	O
with	O
my	O
axe	O
and	O
hatchet	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
with	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
fire	O
and	O
infinite	O
labour	O
,	O
made	O
a	O
hollow	O
place	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
Indians	O
in	O
Brazil	PNM
make	O
their	O
canoes	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
great	O
heavy	O
pestle	O
or	O
beater	O
of	O
the	O
wood	O
called	O
the	O
iron-wood	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
I	O
prepared	O
and	O
laid	O
by	O
against	O
I	O
had	O
my	O
next	O
crop	O
of	O
corn	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
proposed	O
to	O
myself	O
to	O
grind	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
pound	O
into	O
meal	O
to	O
make	O
bread	O
.	O

My	O
next	O
difficulty	O
was	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
sieve	O
or	O
searce	O
,	O
to	O
dress	O
my	O
meal	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
part	O
it	O
from	O
the	O
bran	O
and	O
the	O
husk	O
;	O
without	O
which	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
see	O
it	O
possible	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
any	O
bread	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
most	O
difficult	O
thing	O
even	O
to	O
think	O
on	O
,	O
for	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
I	O
had	O
nothing	O
like	O
the	O
necessary	O
thing	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
--	O

mean	O
fine	O

to	O
searce	O

meal	O
through	O

And	O
here	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
a	O
full	O
stop	O
for	O
many	O
months	O

nor	O
did	O
I	O
really	O

of	O
calico	O
or	O
muslin	O

and	O
with	O
some	O

of	O
these	O
I	O
made	O
three	O
small	O
sieves	O
proper	O
enough	O
for	O
the	O
work	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
I	O
made	O

I	O

afterwards	O

I	O

The	O
baking	O
part	O
was	O
the	O
next	O
thing	O
to	O
be	O
considered	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
I	O
should	O
make	O
bread	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
have	O
corn	O
;	O
for	O
first	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
yeast	O

As	O
to	O
that	O
part	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
supplying	O
the	O
want	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
concern	O
myself	O
much	O
about	O
it	O
.	O

But	O
for	O
an	O
oven	O
I	O
was	O
indeed	O
in	O
great	O
pain	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
I	O
found	O
out	O
an	O
experiment	O
for	O
that	O
also	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
this	O
:	O
I	O
made	O
some	O
earthen-vessels	O
very	O
broad	O
but	O
not	O
deep	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
about	O
two	O
feet	O
diameter	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
above	O
nine	O
inches	O
deep	O
.	O

These	O
I	O
burned	O
in	O
the	O
fire	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
and	O
laid	O
them	O
by	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
bake	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
great	O
fire	O
upon	O
my	O
hearth	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
paved	O
with	O
some	O
square	O
tiles	O
of	O
my	O
own	O
baking	O
and	O
burning	O
also	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
should	O
not	O
call	O
them	O
square	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
firewood	O
was	O
burned	O
pretty	O
much	O
into	O
embers	O
or	O
live	O
coals	O
,	O
I	O
drew	O
them	O
forward	O
upon	O
this	O
hearth	O
,	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
cover	O
it	O
all	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
I	O
let	O
them	O
lie	O
till	O
the	O
hearth	O
was	O
very	O
hot	O
.	O

Then	O
sweeping	O
away	O
all	O
the	O
embers	O
,	O
I	O
set	O
down	O
my	O
loaf	O
or	O
loaves	O
,	O
and	O
whelming	O
down	O
the	O
earthen	O
pot	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
drew	O
the	O
embers	O
all	O
round	O
the	O
outside	O
of	O
the	O
pot	O
,	O
to	O
keep	O
in	O
and	O
add	O
to	O
the	O
heat	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
in	O
the	O
best	O
oven	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
I	O
baked	O
my	O
barley-loaves	O
,	O
and	O
became	O
in	O
little	O
time	O
a	O
good	O
pastrycook	O
into	O
the	O
bargain	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
made	O
myself	O
several	O
cakes	O
and	O
puddings	O
of	O
the	O
rice	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
made	O
no	O
pies	O
,	O
neither	O
had	O
I	O
anything	O
to	O
put	O
into	O
them	O
supposing	O
I	O
had	O
,	O
except	O
the	O
flesh	O
either	O
of	O

.	O

It	O
need	O
not	O
be	O
wondered	O
at	O
if	O
all	O
these	O
things	O
took	O
me	O
up	O
most	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
third	O
year	O
of	O
my	O
abode	O
here	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
observed	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
intervals	O
of	O
these	O
things	O
I	O
had	O
my	O
new	O
harvest	O
and	O
husbandry	O
to	O
manage	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
reaped	O
my	O
corn	O
in	O
its	O
season	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
it	O
home	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
and	O
laid	O
it	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
ear	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
large	O
baskets	O
,	O
till	O
I	O
had	O
time	O
to	O
rub	O
it	O
out	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
floor	O
to	O
thrash	O
it	O
on	O
,	O
or	O
instrument	O
to	O
thrash	O
it	O
with	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
my	O
stock	O
of	O
corn	O
increasing	O
,	O
I	O
really	O
wanted	O
to	O
build	O
my	O
barns	O
bigger	O
;	O
I	O
wanted	O
a	O
place	O
to	O
lay	O
it	O
up	O
in	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
increase	O
of	O
the	O
corn	O
now	O
yielded	O
me	O
so	O
much	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
of	O
the	O
barley	O
about	O
twenty	O
bushels	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
rice	O
as	O
much	O
or	O
more	O
;	O
insomuch	O
that	O
now	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
begin	O
to	O
use	O
it	O
freely	O
;	O
for	O
my	O
bread	O
had	O
been	O
quite	O
gone	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
;	O
also	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
quantity	O
would	O
be	O
sufficient	O
for	O
me	O
a	O
whole	O
year	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
sow	O
but	O
once	O
a	O
year	O
.	O

Upon	O
the	O
whole	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
forty	O
bushels	O
of	O
barley	O
and	O
rice	O
were	O
much	O
more	O
than	O
I	O
could	O
consume	O
in	O
a	O
year	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
sow	O
just	O
the	O
same	O
quantity	O
every	O
year	O
that	O
I	O
sowed	O
the	O
last	O
,	O
in	O
hopes	O
that	O
such	O
a	O
quantity	O
would	O
fully	O
provide	O
me	O
with	O
bread	O
,	O
&	O
c.	O
All	O
the	O
while	O
these	O
things	O
were	O
doing	O
,	O
you	O
may	O
be	O
sure	O
my	O
thoughts	O
ran	O
many	O
times	O
upon	O
the	O
prospect	O
of	O
land	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
from	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
without	O
secret	O
wishes	O
that	O
I	O
were	O
on	O
shore	O
there	O
,	O
fancying	O
that	O
,	O
seeing	O
the	O
mainland	O
,	O
and	O
an	O
inhabited	O
country	O
,	O
I	O
might	O
find	O
some	O
way	O
or	O
other	O
to	O
convey	O
myself	O
further	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
at	O
last	O
find	O
some	O
means	O
of	O
escape	O
.	O

But	O
all	O
this	O
while	O
I	O
made	O
no	O
allowance	O
for	O
the	O
dangers	O
of	O
such	O
an	O
undertaking	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
I	O
might	O
fall	O
into	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
savages	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
such	O
as	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
reason	O
to	O
think	O
far	O
worse	O
than	O
the	O
lions	O
and	O
tigers	O
of	O
Africa	PNM
:	O
that	O
if	O
I	O
once	O
came	O
in	O
their	O
power	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
run	O
a	O
hazard	O
of	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
thousand	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
being	O
killed	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
of	O
being	O
eaten	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
heard	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
the	O
Caribbean	O
coast	O
were	O
cannibals	O
or	O
man-eaters	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
knew	O
by	O
the	O
latitude	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
far	O
from	O
that	O
shore	O
.	O

Then	O
,	O
supposing	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
cannibals	O
,	O
yet	O
they	O
might	O
kill	O
me	O
,	O
as	O
many	O
Europeans	O
who	O
had	O
fallen	O
into	O
their	O
hands	O
had	O
been	O
served	O
,	O
even	O
when	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
ten	O
or	O
twenty	O
together	O
--	O
much	O
more	O
I	O
,	O
that	O
was	O
but	O
one	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
make	O
little	O
or	O
no	O
defence	O
;	O
all	O
these	O
things	O
,	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
ought	O
to	O
have	O
considered	O
well	O
;	O
and	O
did	O
come	O
into	O
my	O
thoughts	O
afterwards	O
,	O
yet	O
gave	O
me	O
no	O
apprehensions	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
head	O
ran	O
mightily	O
upon	O
the	O
thought	O
of	O
getting	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

Now	O
I	O
wished	O
for	O
my	O
boy	O
Xury	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
long-boat	O
with	O
shoulder-of-mutton	O
sail	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
I	O
sailed	O
above	O
a	O
thousand	O
miles	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Africa	PNM
;	O
but	O
this	O
was	O
in	O
vain	O
:	O
then	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
and	O
look	O
at	O
our	O
ship	O
's	O
boat	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
was	O
blown	O
up	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
storm	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
first	O
cast	O
away	O
.	O

She	O
lay	O
almost	O
where	O
she	O
did	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
quite	O
;	O
and	O
was	O
turned	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
force	O
of	O
the	O
waves	O
and	O
the	O
winds	O
,	O
almost	O
bottom	O
upward	O
,	O
against	O
a	O
high	O
ridge	O
of	O
beachy	O
,	O
rough	O
sand	O
,	O
but	O
no	O
water	O
about	O
her	O

If	O
I	O
had	O
had	O
hands	O
to	O
have	O
refitted	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
have	O
launched	O
her	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
the	O
boat	O
would	O
have	O
done	O
well	O
enough	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
gone	O
back	O
into	O
the	O
Brazils	PNM
with	O
her	O
easily	O
enough	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
foreseen	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
no	O
more	O
turn	O
her	O
and	O
set	O
her	O
upright	O
upon	O
her	O
bottom	O
than	O
I	O
could	O
remove	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
and	O
cut	O
levers	O
and	O
rollers	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
resolving	O
to	O
try	O
what	O
I	O
could	O
do	O
;	O
suggesting	O
to	O
myself	O
that	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
but	O
turn	O
her	O
down	O
,	O
I	O
might	O
repair	O
the	O
damage	O
she	O
had	O
received	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
might	O
go	O
to	O
sea	O
in	O
her	O
very	O
easily	O
.	O

I	O
spared	O
no	O
pains	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
in	O
this	O
piece	O
of	O
fruitless	O
toil	O
,	O
and	O
spent	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
weeks	O
about	O
it	O
;	O
at	O
last	O
finding	O
it	O
impossible	O
to	O
heave	O
it	O
up	O
with	O
my	O
little	O
strength	O
,	O
I	O
fell	O
to	O
digging	O
away	O
the	O
sand	O
,	O
to	O
undermine	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
fall	O
down	O
,	O
setting	O
pieces	O
of	O
wood	O
to	O
thrust	O
and	O
guide	O
it	O
right	O
in	O
the	O
fall	O
.	O

But	O
when	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
unable	O
to	O
stir	O
it	O
up	O
again	O
,	O
or	O
to	O
get	O
under	O
it	O
,	O
much	O
less	O
to	O
move	O
it	O
forward	O
towards	O
the	O
water	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
give	O
it	O
over	O
;	O
and	O
yet	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
gave	O
over	O
the	O
hopes	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
my	O
desire	O
to	O
venture	O
over	O
for	O
the	O
main	O
increased	O
,	O
rather	O
than	O
decreased	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
means	O
for	O
it	O
seemed	O
impossible	O
.	O

This	O
at	O
length	O
put	O
me	O
upon	O
thinking	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
possible	O
to	O
make	O
myself	O
a	O
canoe	O
,	O
or	O
periagua	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
natives	O
of	O

even	O
without	O

as	O
I	O

say	O
,	O
without	O
hands	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
trunk	O
of	O
a	O
great	O
tree	O

This	O
I	O
not	O
only	O
thought	O
possible	O
,	O
but	O
easy	O
,	O
and	O
pleased	O
myself	O
extremely	O
with	O
the	O
thoughts	O
of	O
making	O
it	O

with	O
my	O

more	O

for	O
it	O
than	O
any	O
of	O

but	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
considering	O
the	O
particular	O
inconveniences	O
which	O
I	O
lay	O
under	O
more	O
than	O
the	O
Indians	O
did	O

viz.	O
want	O

move	O
it	O

when	O
it	O
was	O
made	O

into	O
the	O

a	O
difficulty	O

harder	O
for	O
me	O

than	O
all	O
the	O

of	O

for	O
what	O
was	O

my	O
thoughts	O
were	O
so	O
intent	O
upon	O
my	O
voyage	O
over	O
the	O
sea	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
never	O
once	O
considered	O
how	O
I	O
should	O
get	O
it	O
off	O
the	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
really	O
,	O
in	O
its	O
own	O
nature	O
,	O
more	O
easy	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
guide	O
it	O
over	O
forty-five	O
miles	O
of	O
sea	O
than	O
about	O
forty-five	O
fathoms	O
of	O
land	O

where	O
it	O
lay	O
,	O
to	O
set	O
it	O
afloat	O
in	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
upon	O
this	O
boat	O
the	O
most	O
like	O
a	O
fool	O
that	O
ever	O

who	O
had	O
any	O
of	O

I	O
pleased	O
myself	O
with	O
the	O
design	O
,	O
without	O
determining	O
whether	O
I	O
was	O
ever	O
able	O
to	O
undertake	O
it	O
;	O
not	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
difficulty	O
of	O
launching	O
my	O
boat	O
came	O
often	O
into	O
my	O
head	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
put	O
a	O
stop	O
to	O
my	O
inquiries	O
into	O
it	O
by	O
this	O
foolish	O
answer	O
which	O
I	O
gave	O
myself	O
--	O
``	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
most	O
preposterous	O
method	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
eagerness	O
of	O
my	O
fancy	O
prevailed	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
work	O
I	O
went	O
.	O

I	O
felled	O
a	O
cedar-tree	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
question	O
much	O
whether	O
Solomon	O
ever	O
had	O
such	O
a	O
one	O
for	O
the	O
building	O
of	O
the	O
Temple	O
of	O

the	O

of	O
twenty-two	O

after	O
which	O
it	O
lessened	O
for	O
a	O
while	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
parted	O
into	O
branches	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
without	O
infinite	O
labour	O
that	O
I	O
felled	O
this	O
tree	O
;	O
I	O
was	O
twenty	O
days	O
hacking	O
and	O
hewing	O
at	O
it	O
at	O
the	O
bottom	O

I	O
was	O
fourteen	O

the	O
vast	O

and	O
inexpressible	O
labour	O
;	O
after	O
this	O

it	O
cost	O
me	O
a	O
month	O
to	O
shape	O
it	O

dub	O
it	O
to	O
a	O
proportion	O

to	O
something	O

that	O
it	O
might	O
swim	O
upright	O
as	O
it	O
ought	O
to	O

It	O
cost	O
me	O
near	O
three	O
months	O
more	O
to	O
clear	O
the	O
inside	O
,	O
and	O
work	O
it	O
out	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
make	O
an	O
exact	O
boat	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
this	O
I	O
did	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
without	O
fire	O
,	O
by	O
mere	O
mallet	O
and	O
chisel	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
dint	O
of	O
hard	O
labour	O
,	O
till	O
I	O
had	O
brought	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
very	O
handsome	O
periagua	O
,	O
and	O
big	O
enough	O
to	O
have	O
carried	O
six-and-twenty	O
men	O

and	O
consequently	O
big	O
enough	O
to	O
have	O

all	O
my	O

When	O
I	O
had	O
gone	O
through	O
this	O
work	O
I	O
was	O
extremely	O
delighted	O
with	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
boat	O
was	O
really	O
much	O
bigger	O
than	O
ever	O
I	O
saw	O
a	O
canoe	O
or	O
periagua	O
,	O
that	O
was	O
made	O
of	O
one	O
tree	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
life	O

Many	O
a	O
weary	O
stroke	O
it	O
had	O
cost	O
,	O
you	O
may	O
be	O
sure	O
;	O
and	O
had	O
I	O
gotten	O
it	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
I	O
make	O
no	O
question	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
begun	O
the	O
maddest	O
voyage	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
most	O
unlikely	O
to	O
be	O
performed	O
,	O
that	O
ever	O
was	O
undertaken	O

But	O
all	O
my	O
devices	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
failed	O
me	O
;	O
though	O
they	O
cost	O
me	O
infinite	O
labour	O
too	O
.	O

It	O
lay	O
about	O
one	O

yards	O
from	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
more	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
first	O
inconvenience	O
was	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
up	O
hill	O
towards	O
the	O
creek	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
to	O
take	O
away	O
this	O
discouragement	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
dig	O
into	O
the	O
surface	O
of	O
the	O
earth	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
make	O
a	O
declivity	O
:	O
this	O
I	O
began	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
cost	O
me	O
a	O
prodigious	O
deal	O
of	O
pains	O
-LRB-	O
but	O
who	O
grudge	O
pains	O
who	O
have	O
their	O
deliverance	O
in	O

?	O
-RRB-	O

;	O
but	O
when	O
this	O
was	O
worked	O
through	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
difficulty	O
managed	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
still	O
much	O
the	O
same	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
could	O
no	O
more	O
stir	O
the	O
canoe	O
than	O
I	O
could	O
the	O
other	O
boat	O
.	O

Then	O
I	O
measured	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
to	O
cut	O
a	O
dock	O
or	O
canal	O
,	O
to	O
bring	O
the	O
water	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
canoe	O
,	O
seeing	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
bring	O
the	O
canoe	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
water	O

Well	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
this	O
work	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
enter	O
upon	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
calculate	O
how	O
deep	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
dug	O
,	O
how	O
broad	O
,	O
how	O
the	O
stuff	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
thrown	O
out	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
hands	O
I	O
had	O
,	O
being	O
none	O
but	O
my	O
own	O
,	O
it	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
ten	O
or	O
twelve	O
years	O
before	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
gone	O
through	O
with	O
it	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
shore	O
lay	O
so	O
high	O
,	O
that	O
at	O
the	O
upper	O
end	O
it	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
at	O

twenty	O
feet	O
deep	O
;	O
so	O
at	O
length	O
,	O
though	O
with	O
great	O
reluctancy	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
this	O
attempt	O
over	O
also	O
.	O

This	O
grieved	O
me	O
heartily	O
;	O
and	O
now	O
I	O
saw	O
,	O
though	O
too	O
late	O
,	O
the	O
folly	O
of	O
beginning	O
a	O
work	O
before	O
we	O
count	O
the	O
cost	O
,	O
and	O
before	O
we	O
judge	O
rightly	O
of	O
our	O
own	O
strength	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
with	O
it	O

In	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
this	O
work	O
I	O
finished	O
my	O
fourth	O

in	O
this	O

by	O
the	O

if	O
I	O
had	O
had	O
the	O

full	O
of	O
diamonds	O
,	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
the	O
same	O
case	O
--	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
of	O
no	O
manner	O

I	O
had	O
now	O
brought	O
my	O
state	O
of	O
life	O
to	O
be	O
much	O
easier	O
in	O
itself	O
than	O
it	O
was	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
much	O
easier	O
to	O
my	O
mind	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
to	O
my	O
body	O

I	O
frequently	O
sat	O
down	O
to	O
meat	O
with	O
thankfulness	O
,	O
and	O
admired	O
the	O
hand	O
of	O
God	O
's	O
providence	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
thus	O
spread	O
my	O
table	O
in	O
the	O
wilderness	O
.	O

I	O
learned	O
to	O
look	O
more	O
upon	O
the	O
bright	O
side	O
of	O
my	O
condition	O
,	O
and	O
less	O
upon	O
the	O
dark	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
consider	O
what	O
I	O
enjoyed	O
rather	O
than	O
what	O
I	O
wanted	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
gave	O
me	O
sometimes	O
such	O
secret	O
comforts	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
express	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
which	O
I	O
take	O
notice	O
of	O
here	O
,	O
to	O
put	O
those	O
discontented	O
people	O
in	O
mind	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
who	O
can	O
not	O
enjoy	O
comfortably	O
what	O
God	O
has	O
given	O
them	O

because	O
they	O
see	O
and	O
covet	O
something	O
that	O

has	O
not	O

All	O
our	O
discontents	O
about	O
what	O

appeared	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
spring	O
from	O
the	O

Another	O
reflection	O
was	O
of	O
great	O
use	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
doubtless	O
would	O
be	O
so	O
to	O
any	O
one	O
that	O
should	O
fall	O
into	O
such	O
distress	O
as	O
mine	O
was	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
,	O
to	O
compare	O
my	O

with	O
what	O
I	O
at	O

expected	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
;	O

with	O
what	O
it	O
would	O
certainly	O
have	O
been	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
good	O

of	O
God	O
had	O
not	O
wonderfully	O
ordered	O
the	O
ship	O
to	O
be	O
cast	O
up	O
nearer	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
not	O
only	O
could	O
come	O
at	O
her	O

could	O
bring	O
what	O
I	O

out	O

for	O
my	O

I	O
spent	O
whole	O

I	O
may	O
say	O
whole	O
days	O
,	O
in	O

to	O
myself	O

in	O
the	O
most	O

how	O

must	O
have	O

and	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
long	O
before	O
I	O
found	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
must	O
have	O
perished	O
first	O
;	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
lived	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
perished	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
mere	O

a	O

a	O

by	O
any	O
contrivance	O

and	O
pull	O
it	O
with	O
my	O

These	O

made	O
me	O
very	O

of	O
the	O

of	O

me	O

I	O

reflections	O

for	O
many	O

I	O
have	O

on	O

of	O

hardened	O
life	O
past	O

and	O
when	O
I	O
looked	O
about	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
considered	O
what	O
particular	O
providences	O
had	O
attended	O
me	O
since	O
my	O
coming	O
into	O
this	O
place	O

and	O
how	O
God	O
had	O
dealt	O
bountifully	O
with	O
me	O
--	O
had	O
not	O
only	O
punished	O
me	O
less	O
than	O
my	O
iniquity	O
had	O
deserved	O
,	O
but	O
had	O
so	O
plentifully	O
provided	O
for	O
me	O
--	O
this	O
gave	O
me	O
great	O
hopes	O
that	O
my	O
repentance	O
was	O
accepted	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
God	O
had	O
yet	O
mercy	O
in	O

for	O
me	O

With	O
these	O
reflections	O
I	O
worked	O
my	O

up	O

not	O

to	O
a	O

to	O
the	O

of	O

a	O

that	O
I	O

who	O

ought	O
not	O

I	O
had	O
no	O

that	O
I	O
ought	O
never	O
more	O
to	O

to	O

which	O
nothing	O

my	O

that	O

which	O
I	O
brought	O
out	O

one	O

I	O
was	O

before	O
I	O
got	O
any	O
corn	O
of	O
my	O

and	O
great	O
reason	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
be	O

that	O
I	O

any	O

My	O
clothes	O

too	O

began	O
to	O
decay	O

as	O

I	O
had	O
had	O
none	O
a	O

except	O
some	O
chequered	O

which	O
I	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
chests	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
seamen	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
I	O
carefully	O
preserved	O
;	O
because	O
many	O
times	O
I	O
could	O
bear	O
no	O
other	O
clothes	O
on	O
but	O
a	O
shirt	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
help	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
,	O
among	O
all	O
the	O
men	O
's	O
clothes	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
almost	O
three	O
dozen	O
of	O
shirts	O

There	O
were	O
also	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
several	O
thick	O
watch-coats	O
of	O
the	O
seamen	O
's	O
which	O
were	O
left	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
too	O
hot	O
to	O
wear	O

and	O
though	O
it	O
is	O
true	O
that	O
the	O

was	O
so	O

hot	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O

the	O

The	O
reason	O
why	O

was	O

I	O
could	O
not	O

when	O
quite	O

the	O

with	O

itself	O
made	O
some	O

and	O
whistling	O
under	O
the	O

was	O
twofold	O
cooler	O
than	O

No	O

could	O
I	O
ever	O
bring	O
myself	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
in	O

without	O

cap	O
or	O
a	O

beating	O
with	O
such	O
violence	O
as	O
it	O
does	O
in	O
that	O

would	O
give	O
me	O
the	O
headache	O
presently	O

by	O
darting	O

directly	O
on	O
my	O
head	O

without	O
a	O

on	O

so	O
that	O
I	O

bear	O
it	O
;	O
whereas	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
put	O
on	O
my	O
hat	O
it	O
would	O
presently	O
go	O
away	O

Upon	O
these	O
views	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
consider	O
about	O
putting	O
the	O
few	O
rags	O
I	O
had	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
called	O
clothes	O
,	O
into	O
some	O
order	O
;	O
I	O
had	O
worn	O
out	O
all	O
the	O
waistcoats	O
I	O
had	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
business	O
was	O
now	O
to	O
try	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
make	O
jackets	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
great	O
watch-coats	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
by	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
such	O
other	O
materials	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
set	O
to	O
work	O
,	O
tailoring	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
botching	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
made	O
most	O
piteous	O
work	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
shift	O
to	O
make	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
new	O
waistcoats	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
hoped	O
would	O
serve	O
me	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
:	O
as	O
for	O
breeches	O
or	O
drawers	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
but	O
a	O
very	O
sorry	O
shift	O
indeed	O
till	O
afterwards	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
mentioned	O
that	O
I	O
saved	O
the	O
skins	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
creatures	O
that	O
I	O
killed	O
,	O
I	O
mean	O
four-footed	O
ones	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
them	O
hung	O
up	O
,	O
stretched	O
out	O
with	O
sticks	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
means	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
so	O
dry	O
and	O
hard	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
fit	O
for	O
little	O
,	O
but	O
others	O
were	O
very	O
useful	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
thing	O
I	O
made	O
of	O
these	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
cap	O
for	O
my	O
head	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
hair	O
on	O
the	O
outside	O
,	O
to	O
shoot	O
off	O
the	O
rain	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
I	O
performed	O
so	O
well	O
,	O
that	O
after	O
I	O
made	O
me	O
a	O
suit	O
of	O
clothes	O
wholly	O
of	O
these	O
skins	O
--	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
a	O
waistcoat	O
,	O
and	O
breeches	O
open	O
at	O
the	O
knees	O
,	O
and	O
both	O
loose	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
rather	O
wanting	O
to	O
keep	O
me	O
cool	O
than	O
to	O
keep	O
me	O
warm	O
.	O

I	O
must	O
not	O
omit	O
to	O
acknowledge	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
wretchedly	O
made	O
;	O
for	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
bad	O
carpenter	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
worse	O
tailor	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
such	O
as	O
I	O
made	O
very	O
good	O
shift	O
with	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
out	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
happened	O
to	O
rain	O
,	O
the	O
hair	O
of	O
my	O
waistcoat	O
and	O
cap	O
being	O
outermost	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
kept	O
very	O
dry	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
spent	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
time	O
and	O
pains	O
to	O
make	O
an	O
umbrella	O
;	O
I	O
was	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
in	O
great	O
want	O
of	O
one	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
mind	O
to	O
make	O
one	O
;	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
them	O
made	O
in	O
the	O
Brazils	PNM
,	O
where	O
they	O
are	O
very	O
useful	O
in	O
the	O
great	O
heats	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
felt	O
the	O
heats	O
every	O
jot	O
as	O
great	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
greater	O
too	O
,	O
being	O
nearer	O
the	O
equinox	O
;	O
besides	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
be	O
much	O
abroad	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
most	O
useful	O
thing	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
for	O
the	O
rains	O
as	O
the	O

I	O
took	O
a	O
world	O
of	O
pains	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
before	O

could	O
make	O
anything	O
likely	O
to	O
hold	O

at	O

I	O
made	O
one	O
that	O
answered	O
indifferently	O
well	O

the	O
main	O
difficulty	O
I	O
found	O
was	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
let	O
down	O

I	O
could	O
make	O
it	O
spread	O

but	O
if	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
let	O
down	O
too	O

and	O
draw	O
in	O

it	O

not	O

for	O

any	O

but	O
just	O
over	O
my	O

which	O
would	O
not	O
do	O

However	O
,	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
one	O
to	O
answer	O

and	O
covered	O
it	O
with	O
skins	O
,	O
the	O
hair	O
upwards	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
cast	O
off	O
the	O
rain	O
like	O
a	O
pent-house	O
,	O
and	O
kept	O
off	O
the	O
sun	O
so	O
effectually	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
walk	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
hottest	O
of	O
the	O
weather	O
with	O
greater	O
advantage	O
than	O
I	O

when	O
I	O
had	O
no	O

of	O
it	O
could	O
close	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
carry	O
it	O
under	O
my	O
arm	O

Thus	O
I	O
lived	O
mighty	O

entirely	O

throwing	O
myself	O

for	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
in	O
one	O
place	O
,	O
crossing	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
already	O
described	O
it	O
,	O
over	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
so	O
the	O
discoveries	O
I	O
made	O
in	O
that	O
little	O
journey	O
made	O
me	O
very	O
eager	O
to	O
see	O
other	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
coast	O
;	O
and	O
now	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
boat	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
of	O
nothing	O
but	O
sailing	O
round	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

For	O
this	O
purpose	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
do	O
everything	O
with	O
discretion	O
and	O
consideration	O
,	O
I	O
fitted	O
up	O
a	O
little	O
mast	O
in	O
my	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
sail	O
too	O
out	O
of	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
pieces	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
sails	O
which	O
lay	O
in	O
store	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
stock	O
by	O
me	O
.	O

Having	O
fitted	O
my	O
mast	O
and	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
tried	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
she	O
would	O
sail	O
very	O
well	O
;	O
then	O
I	O
made	O
little	O
lockers	O
or	O
boxes	O
at	O
each	O
end	O
of	O
my	O
boat	O
,	O
to	O
put	O
provisions	O
,	O
necessaries	O
,	O
ammunition	O
,	O
&	O
c.	O
,	O
into	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
kept	O
dry	O
,	O
either	O
from	O
rain	O
or	O
the	O
spray	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
long	O
,	O
hollow	O
place	O
I	O
cut	O
in	O
the	O
inside	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
could	O
lay	O
my	O
gun	O
,	O
making	O
a	O
flap	O
to	O
hang	O
down	O
over	O
it	O
to	O
keep	O
it	O
dry	O
.	O

I	O
fixed	O
my	O
umbrella	O
also	O
in	O
the	O
step	O
at	O
the	O
stern	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
mast	O
,	O
to	O
stand	O
over	O
my	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
keep	O
the	O
heat	O
of	O
the	O
sun	O
off	O
me	O
,	O
like	O
an	O
awning	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
I	O
every	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
took	O
a	O
little	O
voyage	O
upon	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
but	O
never	O
went	O
far	O
out	O
,	O
nor	O
far	O
from	O
the	O
little	O
creek	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
,	O
being	O
eager	O
to	O
view	O
the	O
circumference	O
of	O
my	O
little	O
kingdom	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
upon	O
my	O
cruise	O
;	O
and	O
accordingly	O
I	O
victualled	O
my	O
ship	O
for	O
the	O
voyage	O
,	O
putting	O
in	O
two	O
dozen	O
of	O
loaves	O
-LRB-	O
cakes	O
I	O
should	O
call	O
them	O
-RRB-	O
of	O
barley-bread	O
,	O
an	O
earthen	O
pot	O
full	O
of	O
parched	O
rice	O
-LRB-	O
a	O
food	O
I	O
ate	O
a	O
good	O
deal	O
of	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
a	O
little	O
bottle	O
of	O
rum	O
,	O
half	O
a	O
goat	O
,	O
and	O
powder	O
and	O
shot	O
for	O
killing	O
more	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
large	O
watch-coats	O
,	O
of	O
those	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
mentioned	O
before	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
saved	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
seamen	O
's	O
chests	O
;	O
these	O
I	O
took	O
,	O
one	O
to	O
lie	O
upon	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
to	O
cover	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
6th	O
of	O
November	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
sixth	O
year	O
of	O
my	O
reign	O
--	O
or	O
my	O
captivity	O
,	O
which	O
you	O
please	O
--	O
that	O
I	O
set	O
out	O
on	O
this	O
voyage	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
found	O
it	O
much	O
longer	O
than	O
I	O
expected	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
the	O
island	O
itself	O
was	O
not	O
very	O
large	O
,	O
yet	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
great	O
ledge	O
of	O
rocks	O
lie	O
out	O
about	O
two	O
leagues	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
some	O
above	O
water	O
,	O
some	O
under	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
beyond	O
that	O
a	O
shoal	O
of	O
sand	O
,	O
lying	O
dry	O
half	O
a	O
league	O
more	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
go	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
out	O
to	O
sea	O
to	O
double	O
the	O
point	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
first	O
discovered	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
give	O
over	O
my	O
enterprise	O
,	O
and	O
come	O
back	O
again	O
,	O
not	O
knowing	O
how	O
far	O
it	O
might	O
oblige	O
me	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
to	O
sea	O
;	O
and	O
above	O
all	O
,	O
doubting	O
how	O
I	O
should	O
get	O
back	O
again	O
:	O
so	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
an	O
anchor	O
with	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
a	O
broken	O
grappling	O
which	O
I	O
got	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

Having	O
secured	O
my	O
boat	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
my	O
gun	O
and	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
climbing	O
up	O
a	O
hill	O
,	O
which	O
seemed	O
to	O
overlook	O
that	O
point	O
where	O
I	O
saw	O
the	O
full	O
extent	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
to	O
venture	O
.	O

In	O
my	O
viewing	O
the	O
sea	O
from	O
that	O
hill	O
where	O
I	O
stood	O
,	O
I	O
perceived	O
a	O
strong	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
a	O
most	O
furious	O
current	O
,	O
which	O
ran	O
to	O
the	O
east	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
came	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
took	O
the	O
more	O
notice	O
of	O
it	O
because	O
I	O
saw	O
there	O
might	O
be	O
some	O
danger	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
into	O
it	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
carried	O
out	O
to	O
sea	O
by	O
the	O
strength	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
island	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
indeed	O
,	O
had	O
I	O
not	O
got	O
first	O
upon	O
this	O
hill	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
so	O
;	O
for	O
there	O
was	O
the	O
same	O
current	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
only	O
that	O
it	O
set	O
off	O
at	O
a	O
further	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
saw	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
strong	O
eddy	O
under	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
but	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
current	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
should	O
presently	O
be	O
in	O
an	O
eddy	O
.	O

I	O
lay	O
here	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
two	O
days	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
wind	O
blowing	O
pretty	O
fresh	O
at	O
ESE.	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
being	O
just	O
contrary	O
to	O
the	O
current	O
,	O
made	O
a	O
great	O
breach	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
upon	O
the	O
point	O
:	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
safe	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
keep	O
too	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
for	O
the	O
breach	O
,	O
nor	O
to	O
go	O
too	O
far	O
off	O
,	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
stream	O
.	O

The	O
third	O
day	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
having	O
abated	O
overnight	O
,	O
the	O
sea	O
was	O
calm	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
ventured	O
:	O
but	O
I	O
am	O
a	O
warning	O
to	O
all	O
rash	O
and	O
ignorant	O
pilots	O
;	O
for	O
no	O
sooner	O
was	O
I	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
even	O
my	O
boat	O
's	O
length	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
found	O
myself	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
depth	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
current	O
like	O
the	O
sluice	O
of	O
a	O
mill	O
;	O
it	O
carried	O
my	O
boat	O
along	O
with	O
it	O
with	O
such	O
violence	O
that	O
all	O
I	O
could	O
do	O
could	O
not	O
keep	O
her	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
on	O
the	O
edge	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
found	O
it	O
hurried	O
me	O
farther	O
and	O
farther	O
out	O
from	O
the	O
eddy	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
on	O
my	O
left	O
hand	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
no	O
wind	O
stirring	O
to	O
help	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
I	O
could	O
do	O
with	O
my	O
paddles	O
signified	O
nothing	O
:	O
and	O
now	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
give	O
myself	O
over	O
for	O
lost	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
the	O
current	O
was	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
I	O
knew	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
leagues	O
distance	O
they	O
must	O
join	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
was	O
irrecoverably	O
gone	O
;	O
nor	O
did	O
I	O
see	O
any	O
possibility	O
of	O
avoiding	O
it	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
prospect	O
before	O
me	O
but	O
of	O
perishing	O
,	O
not	O
by	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
was	O
calm	O
enough	O
,	O
but	O
of	O
starving	O
from	O
hunger	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
found	O
a	O
tortoise	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
as	O
big	O
almost	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
lift	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
tossed	O
it	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
jar	O
of	O
fresh	O
water	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
earthen	O
pots	O
;	O
but	O
what	O
was	O
all	O
this	O
to	O
being	O
driven	O
into	O
the	O
vast	O
ocean	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
shore	O
,	O
no	O
mainland	O
or	O
island	O
,	O
for	O
a	O
thousand	O
leagues	O
at	O
least	O
?	O

And	O
now	O
I	O
saw	O
how	O
easy	O
it	O
was	O
for	O
the	O
providence	O
of	O
God	O
to	O
make	O
even	O
the	O
most	O
miserable	O
condition	O
of	O
mankind	O
worse	O
.	O

Now	O
I	O
looked	O
back	O
upon	O
my	O
desolate	O
,	O
solitary	O
island	O
as	O
the	O
most	O
pleasant	O
place	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
happiness	O
my	O
heart	O
could	O
wish	O
for	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
but	O
there	O
again	O
.	O

I	O
stretched	O
out	O
my	O
hands	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
with	O
eager	O
wishes	O
--	O
``	O
O	O
happy	O
desert	O

said	O
I	O
,	O
``	O
I	O

O	O
miserable	O

going	O
?	O
''	O

Then	O
I	O
reproached	O
myself	O
with	O
my	O
unthankful	O
temper	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
repined	O
at	O
my	O

condition	O
;	O
and	O
now	O
what	O
would	O
I	O
give	O
to	O
be	O
on	O
shore	O
there	O
again	O
!	O

Thus	O
,	O
we	O
never	O
see	O
the	O
true	O
state	O
of	O
our	O
condition	O
till	O
it	O
is	O

what	O

by	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
it	O

It	O
is	O
scarcely	O
possible	O
to	O
imagine	O
the	O
consternation	O
I	O
was	O
now	O
in	O
,	O
being	O
driven	O
from	O
my	O
beloved	O
island	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
so	O
it	O
appeared	O
to	O
me	O
now	O
to	O
be	O
-RRB-	O
into	O
the	O
wide	O
ocean	O
,	O
almost	O
two	O
leagues	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
utmost	O
despair	O
of	O
ever	O
recovering	O
it	O
again	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
worked	O
hard	O
till	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
my	O
strength	O
was	O
almost	O
exhausted	O
,	O
and	O
kept	O
my	O
boat	O
as	O
much	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
towards	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
current	O

the	O

lay	O
on	O

when	O
about	O
noon	O

as	O
the	O
sun	O
passed	O
the	O
meridian	O

I	O
thought	O
I	O
felt	O
a	O
little	O
breeze	O
of	O
wind	O
in	O
my	O
face	O
,	O
springing	O
up	O
from	O
SSE	O

This	O
cheered	O
my	O
heart	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
and	O
especially	O
when	O
,	O
in	O
about	O
half-an-hour	O
more	O
,	O
it	O
blew	O
a	O
pretty	O
gentle	O
gale	O

By	O
this	O
time	O
I	O
had	O
got	O
at	O
a	O
frightful	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
the	O
least	O
cloudy	O
or	O
hazy	O
weather	O
intervened	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
undone	O
another	O
way	O

too	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
compass	O
on	O

should	O
never	O

if	O
I	O

once	O
lost	O
sight	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
weather	O
continuing	O
clear	O

I	O
applied	O
myself	O
to	O
get	O
up	O
my	O

again	O

spread	O

the	O

at	O
about	O
half	O
a	O

a	O
breach	O
of	O

away	O

so	O
the	O

returned	O
by	O
the	O

of	O

made	O
a	O
strong	O

ran	O
back	O
again	O
to	O
the	O

with	O
a	O

what	O
my	O

was	O

and	O
how	O
gladly	O
I	O
put	O
my	O

into	O
the	O

with	O
a	O

back	O

directly	O
towards	O
the	O

about	O
two	O

at	O
first	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
came	O

When	O

by	O
the	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
that	O

between	O
two	O

currents	O
--	O
viz.	O
that	O
on	O
the	O

between	O

in	O

and	O
having	O

About	O

being	O

within	O
a	O

I	O

the	O

made	O
another	O

almost	O
full	O

However	O
,	O
having	O
a	O

I	O
stretched	O
across	O
this	O

slanting	O
north-west	O

and	O
in	O
about	O
an	O

it	O

my	O

westward	O
along	O

to	O
a	O

put	O

remained	O
near	O
a	O
year	O

and	O
lived	O
a	O
very	O
sedate	O

retired	O
life	O
,	O
as	O
you	O
may	O
well	O
suppose	O

and	O
my	O

very	O

composed	O

and	O
fully	O
comforted	O
in	O

myself	O
to	O
the	O

of	O
Providence	PNM

I	O
thought	O
I	O
lived	O
really	O
very	O
happily	O
in	O
all	O
things	O
except	O
that	O
of	O

I	O
improved	O
myself	O
in	O
this	O
time	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
mechanic	O
exercises	O
which	O
my	O
necessities	O
put	O
me	O
upon	O
applying	O
myself	O
to	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
believe	O
I	O
should	O
,	O
upon	O
occasion	O
,	O
have	O
made	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
carpenter	O
,	O
especially	O
considering	O
how	O
few	O
tools	O
I	O
had	O
.	O

Besides	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
arrived	O
at	O
an	O
unexpected	O
perfection	O
in	O
my	O
earthenware	O
,	O
and	O
contrived	O
well	O
enough	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
with	O
a	O
wheel	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
found	O
infinitely	O
easier	O
and	O
better	O
;	O
because	O
I	O
made	O
things	O
round	O
and	O
shaped	O
,	O
which	O
before	O
were	O
filthy	O
things	O
indeed	O
to	O
look	O
on	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
was	O
never	O
more	O
vain	O
of	O
my	O
own	O
performance	O
,	O
or	O
more	O
joyful	O
for	O
anything	O
I	O
found	O
out	O
,	O
than	O
for	O
my	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
tobacco-pipe	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
ugly	O
,	O
clumsy	O
thing	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
done	O
,	O
and	O
only	O
burned	O
red	O
,	O
like	O
other	O
earthenware	O
,	O
yet	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
hard	O
and	O
firm	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
draw	O
the	O
smoke	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
exceedingly	O
comforted	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
always	O
used	O
to	O
smoke	O
;	O
and	O
there	O
were	O
pipes	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
forgot	O
them	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
not	O
thinking	O
there	O
was	O
tobacco	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
and	O
afterwards	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
searched	O
the	O
ship	O
again	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
come	O
at	O
any	O
pipes	O
.	O

In	O
my	O
wicker-ware	O
also	O
I	O
improved	O
much	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
abundance	O
of	O
necessary	O
baskets	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
my	O
invention	O
showed	O
me	O
;	O
though	O
not	O
very	O
handsome	O
,	O
yet	O
they	O
were	O
such	O
as	O
were	O
very	O
handy	O
and	O
convenient	O
for	O
laying	O
things	O
up	O
in	O
,	O
or	O
fetching	O
things	O
home	O
.	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
killed	O
a	O
goat	O
abroad	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
hang	O
it	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
tree	O
,	O
flay	O
it	O
,	O
dress	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
cut	O
it	O
in	O
pieces	O
,	O
and	O
bring	O
it	O
home	O
in	O
a	O
basket	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
like	O
by	O
a	O
turtle	O
;	O
I	O
could	O
cut	O
it	O
up	O
,	O
take	O
out	O
the	O
eggs	O
and	O
a	O
piece	O
or	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
flesh	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
enough	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
bring	O
them	O
home	O
in	O
a	O
basket	O
,	O
and	O
leave	O
the	O
rest	O
behind	O
me	O
.	O

Also	O
,	O
large	O
deep	O
baskets	O
were	O
the	O
receivers	O
of	O
my	O
corn	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
always	O
rubbed	O
out	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
dry	O
and	O
cured	O
,	O
and	O
kept	O
it	O
in	O
great	O
baskets	O
.	O

I	O
began	O
now	O
to	O
perceive	O
my	O
powder	O
abated	O
considerably	O
;	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
want	O
which	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
supply	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
began	O
seriously	O
to	O
consider	O
what	O
I	O
must	O
do	O
when	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
no	O
more	O
powder	O
;	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
how	O
I	O
should	O
kill	O
any	O
goats	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
,	O
as	O
is	O
observed	O
in	O
the	O
third	O
year	O
of	O
my	O
being	O
here	O
,	O
kept	O
a	O
young	O
kid	O
,	O
and	O
bred	O
her	O
up	O
tame	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
hopes	O
of	O
getting	O
a	O
he-goat	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
by	O
any	O
means	O
bring	O
it	O
to	O
pass	O
,	O
till	O
my	O
kid	O
grew	O
an	O
old	O
goat	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
never	O
find	O
in	O
my	O
heart	O
to	O
kill	O
her	O
,	O
she	O
died	O
at	O
last	O
of	O
mere	O
age	O
.	O

But	O
being	O
now	O
in	O
the	O
eleventh	O
year	O
of	O
my	O
residence	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
my	O
ammunition	O
growing	O
low	O
,	O
I	O
set	O
myself	O
to	O
study	O
some	O
art	O
to	O
trap	O
and	O
snare	O
the	O
goats	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
whether	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
catch	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
alive	O
;	O
and	O
particularly	O
I	O
wanted	O
a	O
she-goat	O
great	O
with	O
young	O
.	O

For	O
this	O
purpose	O
I	O
made	O
snares	O
to	O
hamper	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
they	O
were	O
more	O
than	O
once	O
taken	O
in	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
my	O
tackle	O
was	O
not	O
good	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
wire	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
always	O
found	O
them	O
broken	O
and	O
my	O
bait	O
devoured	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
try	O
a	O
pitfall	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
dug	O
several	O
large	O
pits	O
in	O
the	O
earth	O
,	O
in	O
places	O
where	O
I	O
had	O
observed	O
the	O
goats	O
used	O
to	O
feed	O
,	O
and	O
over	O
those	O
pits	O
I	O
placed	O
hurdles	O
of	O
my	O
own	O
making	O
too	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
weight	O
upon	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
several	O
times	O
I	O
put	O
ears	O
of	O
barley	O
and	O
dry	O
rice	O
without	O
setting	O
the	O
trap	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
could	O
easily	O
perceive	O
that	O
the	O
goats	O
had	O
gone	O
in	O
and	O
eaten	O
up	O
the	O
corn	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
could	O
see	O
the	O
marks	O
of	O
their	O
feet	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
I	O
set	O
three	O
traps	O
in	O
one	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
going	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
I	O
found	O
them	O
,	O
all	O
standing	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
the	O
bait	O
eaten	O
and	O
gone	O
;	O
this	O
was	O
very	O
discouraging	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
altered	O
my	O
traps	O
;	O
and	O
not	O
to	O
trouble	O
you	O
with	O
particulars	O
,	O
going	O
one	O
morning	O
to	O
see	O
my	O
traps	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
a	O
large	O
old	O
he-goat	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
others	O
three	O
kids	O
,	O
a	O
male	O
and	O
two	O
females	O
.	O

As	O
to	O
the	O
old	O
one	O
,	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
him	O
;	O
he	O
was	O
so	O
fierce	O
I	O
durst	O
not	O
go	O
into	O
the	O
pit	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
to	O
bring	O
him	O
away	O
alive	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
what	O
I	O
wanted	O
.	O

I	O
could	O
have	O
killed	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
was	O
not	O
my	O
business	O
,	O
nor	O
would	O
it	O
answer	O
my	O
end	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
even	O
let	O
him	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
ran	O
away	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
frightened	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
wits	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
then	O
know	O
what	O
I	O
afterwards	O
learned	O
,	O
that	O
hunger	O
will	O
tame	O
a	O
lion	O
.	O

If	O
I	O
had	O
let	O
him	O
stay	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
days	O
without	O
food	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
have	O
carried	O
him	O
some	O
water	O
to	O
drink	O
and	O
then	O
a	O
little	O
corn	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
as	O
tame	O
as	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
kids	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
are	O
mighty	O
sagacious	O
,	O
tractable	O
creatures	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
are	O
well	O
used	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
present	O
I	O
let	O
him	O
go	O
,	O
knowing	O
no	O
better	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
:	O
then	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
three	O
kids	O
,	O
and	O
taking	O
them	O
one	O
by	O
one	O
,	O
I	O
tied	O
them	O
with	O
strings	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
some	O
difficulty	O
brought	O
them	O
all	O
home	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
while	O
before	O
they	O
would	O
feed	O
;	O
but	O
throwing	O
them	O
some	O
sweet	O
corn	O
,	O
it	O
tempted	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
tame	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
if	O
I	O
expected	O
to	O
supply	O
myself	O
with	O
goats	O
'	O
flesh	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
powder	O
or	O
shot	O
left	O
,	O
breeding	O
some	O
up	O
tame	O
was	O
my	O
only	O
way	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
them	O
about	O
my	O
house	O
like	O
a	O
flock	O
of	O
sheep	O
.	O

But	O
then	O
it	O
occurred	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
I	O
must	O
keep	O
the	O
tame	O
from	O
the	O
wild	O
,	O
or	O
else	O
they	O
would	O
always	O
run	O
wild	O
when	O
they	O
grew	O
up	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
only	O
way	O
for	O
this	O
was	O
to	O
have	O
some	O
enclosed	O
piece	O
of	O
ground	O
,	O
well	O
fenced	O
either	O
with	O
hedge	O
or	O
pale	O
,	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
in	O
so	O
effectually	O
,	O
that	O
those	O
within	O
might	O
not	O
break	O
out	O
,	O
or	O
those	O
without	O
break	O
in	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
undertaking	O
for	O
one	O
pair	O
of	O
hands	O
yet	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
saw	O
there	O
was	O
an	O
absolute	O
necessity	O
for	O
doing	O
it	O
,	O
my	O
first	O
work	O
was	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
a	O
proper	O
piece	O
of	O
ground	O
,	O
where	O
there	O
was	O
likely	O
to	O
be	O
herbage	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
eat	O
,	O
water	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
drink	O
,	O
and	O
cover	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
from	O
the	O
sun	O
.	O

Those	O
who	O
understand	O
such	O
enclosures	O
will	O
think	O
I	O
had	O
very	O
little	O
contrivance	O
when	O
I	O
pitched	O
upon	O
a	O
place	O
very	O
proper	O
for	O
all	O
these	O
-LRB-	O
being	O
a	O
plain	O

open	O
piece	O
of	O
meadow	O

as	O
our	O
people	O
call	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
western	O
colonies	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
little	O
drills	O
of	O
fresh	O
water	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
one	O
end	O
was	O
very	O
woody	O
--	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
they	O
will	O
smile	O
at	O
my	O
forecast	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
shall	O
tell	O
them	O
I	O
began	O
by	O
enclosing	O
this	O
piece	O
of	O
ground	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
manner	O
that	O
,	O
my	O
hedge	O
or	O
pale	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
at	O
least	O
two	O
miles	O
about	O
.	O

Nor	O
was	O
the	O
madness	O
of	O
it	O
so	O
great	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
compass	O
,	O
for	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
ten	O
miles	O
about	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
like	O
to	O
have	O
time	O
enough	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
in	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
consider	O
that	O
my	O
goats	O
would	O
be	O
as	O
wild	O
in	O
so	O
much	O
compass	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
had	O
the	O
whole	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
so	O
much	O
room	O
to	O
chase	O
them	O
in	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
never	O
catch	O
them	O
.	O

My	O
hedge	O
was	O
begun	O
and	O
carried	O
on	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
,	O
about	O
fifty	O
yards	O
when	O
this	O
thought	O
occurred	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
presently	O
stopped	O
short	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
beginning	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
enclose	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
about	O
one	O
hundred	O
and	O
fifty	O
yards	O
in	O
length	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
hundred	O
yards	O
in	O
breadth	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
would	O
maintain	O
as	O
many	O
as	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
in	O
any	O
reasonable	O
time	O
,	O
so	O
,	O
as	O
my	O
stock	O
increased	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
add	O
more	O
ground	O
to	O
my	O
enclosure	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
acting	O
with	O
some	O
prudence	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
courage	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
about	O
three	O
months	O
hedging	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
piece	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
till	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
tethered	O
the	O
three	O
kids	O
in	O
the	O
best	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
used	O
them	O
to	O
feed	O
as	O

me	O
as	O
possible	O

to	O
make	O
them	O

them	O
some	O
ears	O
of	O

or	O
a	O
handful	O
of	O
rice	O
,	O
and	O
feed	O
them	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
hand	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
after	O
my	O
enclosure	O
was	O
finished	O
and	O
I	O
let	O
them	O
loose	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
follow	O
me	O
up	O

down	O

bleating	O
after	O
me	O
for	O
a	O
handful	O
of	O

This	O
answered	O
my	O
end	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
about	O
a	O
year	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
flock	O
of	O
about	O
twelve	O
goats	O
,	O
kids	O
and	O
all	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
two	O
years	O
more	O
I	O
had	O
three-and-forty	O
,	O
besides	O
several	O
that	O
I	O
took	O
and	O
killed	O
for	O
my	O
food	O

After	O
that	O
,	O
I	O
enclosed	O
five	O
several	O
pieces	O
of	O
ground	O
to	O
feed	O
them	O
in	O
,	O
with	O
little	O
pens	O
to	O

them	O
to	O
take	O
them	O
as	O
I	O
wanted	O

out	O
of	O
one	O

But	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
all	O
;	O
for	O
now	O
I	O
not	O
only	O
had	O
goat	O

flesh	O
to	O

on	O
when	O
I	O
pleased	O

a	O
thing	O
which	O

indeed	O

in	O
the	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
so	O

which	O

when	O
it	O

I	O
set	O
up	O

a	O

and	O
became	O
indeed	O
troublesome	O
to	O
me	O
at	O

for	O
they	O
would	O
often	O
come	O
into	O

me	O

at	O

With	O
this	O

in	O
this	O

manner	O
I	O
lived	O
;	O
neither	O
could	O
I	O
be	O

to	O

society	O
;	O
and	O
of	O
that	O
,	O
some	O
time	O
after	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
likely	O
to	O
have	O
too	O
much	O

I	O
was	O
something	O
impatient	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
observed	O
,	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
my	O
boat	O

though	O
very	O
loath	O
to	O
run	O
any	O

;	O
and	O
therefore	O
sometimes	O
I	O
sat	O
contriving	O
ways	O
to	O
get	O
her	O
about	O
the	O
island	O

and	O
at	O
other	O
times	O
I	O
sat	O
myself	O
down	O
contented	O
enough	O
without	O
her	O

But	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
strange	O
uneasiness	O
in	O
my	O

to	O
go	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
where	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
in	O
my	O
last	O
ramble	O

I	O
went	O
up	O
the	O

to	O
see	O
how	O
the	O
shore	O
lay	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
the	O
current	O
set	O

that	O
I	O
might	O
see	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
:	O
this	O
inclination	O
increased	O
upon	O
me	O
every	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
at	O

I	O
resolved	O
to	O
travel	O
thither	O

the	O
edge	O

I	O
could	O
not	O

a	O

to	O
the	O

my	O

I	O
had	O
none	O

had	O
made	O
me	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
somethings	O

I	O
scarce	O
knew	O
what	O
to	O
call	O
them	O

to	O

over	O
my	O

of	O
a	O

as	O
indeed	O
were	O
all	O
the	O

of	O
my	O

I	O
had	O
on	O
a	O
broad	O
belt	O
of	O
goat	O
's	O
skin	O
dried	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
drew	O
together	O
with	O
two	O

of	O

in	O

I	O

another	O

not	O

fastened	O
in	O
the	O

manner	O

hung	O
over	O

at	O
the	O

it	O

under	O
my	O

At	O

which	O

I	O

about	O

As	O
for	O
my	O
face	O
,	O
the	O
colour	O
of	O
it	O
was	O
really	O
not	O
so	O
mulatto-like	O
as	O
one	O
might	O
expect	O
from	O
a	O
man	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
careful	O
of	O

and	O
living	O
within	O
nine	O

ten	O

My	O
beard	O
I	O
had	O
once	O
suffered	O
to	O
grow	O
till	O
it	O
was	O
about	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
yard	O
long	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
both	O
scissors	O
and	O
razors	O
sufficient	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
cut	O
it	O
pretty	O
short	O
,	O
except	O
what	O
grew	O
on	O
my	O
upper	O
lip	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
trimmed	O
into	O
a	O
large	O
pair	O
of	O
Mahometan	O
whiskers	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
worn	O
by	O
some	O
Turks	O
at	O
Sallee	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
Moors	O
did	O
not	O
wear	O
such	O

the	O
Turks	O
did	O
;	O
of	O
these	O
moustachios	O
,	O
or	O
whiskers	O
,	O
I	O
will	O
not	O
say	O
they	O
were	O
long	O
enough	O
to	O
hang	O
my	O
hat	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
of	O
a	O
length	O

shape	O
monstrous	O
enough	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
as	O
in	O
England	PNM
would	O
have	O
passed	O
for	O
frightful	O

But	O
all	O
this	O
is	O
by-the-bye	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
to	O
my	O
figure	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
so	O
few	O
to	O
observe	O
me	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
of	O
no	O
manner	O
of	O

I	O

no	O
more	O

In	O
this	O

I	O

was	O
out	O
five	O

having	O

any	O
more	O
there	O
than	O
in	O

I	O
was	O
at	O
a	O
strange	O
loss	O
to	O
understand	O
this	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
to	O
spend	O
some	O
time	O
in	O
the	O
observing	O
it	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
nothing	O
from	O
the	O
sets	O
of	O
the	O
tide	O
had	O
occasioned	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
presently	O
convinced	O
how	O
it	O
was	O
--	O
viz.	O
that	O
the	O
tide	O
of	O
ebb	O
setting	O
from	O
the	O
west	O
,	O
and	O
joining	O
with	O
the	O
current	O
of	O
waters	O
from	O
some	O
great	O
river	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
must	O
be	O
the	O
occasion	O
of	O
this	O
current	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
according	O
as	O
the	O
wind	O
blew	O
more	O
forcibly	O
from	O
the	O
west	O
or	O
from	O
the	O
north	O
,	O
this	O
current	O
came	O
nearer	O
or	O
went	O
farther	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
waiting	O
thereabouts	O
till	O
evening	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
rock	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
tide	O
of	O
ebb	O
being	O
made	O
,	O
I	O
plainly	O
saw	O
the	O
current	O
again	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
only	O
that	O
it	O
ran	O
farther	O
off	O
,	O
being	O
near	O
half	O
a	O
league	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
whereas	O
in	O
my	O
case	O
it	O
set	O
close	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
hurried	O
me	O
and	O
my	O
canoe	O
along	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
at	O
another	O
time	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
done	O
.	O

This	O
observation	O
convinced	O
me	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
but	O
to	O
observe	O
the	O
ebbing	O
and	O
the	O
flowing	O
of	O
the	O
tide	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
might	O
very	O
easily	O
bring	O
my	O
boat	O
about	O
the	O
island	O
again	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
putting	O
it	O
in	O
practice	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
such	O
terror	O
upon	O
my	O
spirits	O
at	O
the	O
remembrance	O
of	O
the	O
danger	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
think	O
of	O
it	O
again	O
with	O
any	O
patience	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
contrary	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
up	O
another	O
resolution	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
more	O
safe	O
,	O
though	O
more	O
laborious	O
--	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
build	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
make	O
,	O
me	O
another	O
periagua	O
or	O
canoe	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
have	O
one	O
for	O
one	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
for	O
the	O
other	O
.	O

You	O
are	O
to	O
understand	O
that	O
now	O
I	O
had	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
may	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
two	O
plantations	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
--	O
one	O
my	O
little	O

with	O
the	O
cave	O

by	O

One	O
of	O
these	O

which	O
was	O
the	O
driest	O

had	O
a	O

out	O

that	O

was	O
all	O
filled	O
up	O
with	O
the	O
large	O
earthen	O

given	O
an	O
account	O

with	O
fourteen	O

fifteen	O
great	O
baskets	O

which	O
would	O
hold	O
five	O

six	O

were	O

so	O
very	O

that	O

a	O
little	O
farther	O
within	O
the	O

upon	O

lay	O
my	O
two	O
pieces	O
of	O
corn	O
land	O

which	O
I	O
kept	O
duly	O
cultivated	O
and	O
sowed	O

and	O
which	O
duly	O
yielded	O
me	O
their	O
harvest	O
in	O

season	O
;	O
and	O
whenever	O
I	O
had	O
occasion	O
for	O
more	O
corn	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
more	O
land	O
adjoining	O
as	O
fit	O
as	O
that	O

Besides	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
my	O
country	O

I	O
had	O
now	O
a	O
tolerable	O
plantation	O
there	O
also	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
my	O
little	O
bower	O

as	O
I	O
called	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
kept	O
in	O
repair	O
--	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
I	O
kept	O
the	O
hedge	O
which	O
encircled	O
it	O
in	O
constantly	O
fitted	O
up	O
to	O
its	O
usual	O
height	O

the	O

in	O
the	O

I	O
kept	O
the	O
trees	O

which	O
at	O
first	O
were	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
stakes	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
now	O
grown	O
very	O
firm	O
and	O
tall	O
,	O
always	O
cut	O

so	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
spread	O
and	O
grow	O
thick	O
and	O
wild	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
the	O
more	O
agreeable	O
shade	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
did	O
effectually	O
to	O
my	O
mind	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
this	O
I	O
had	O
my	O
tent	O
always	O
standing	O
,	O
being	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
a	O
sail	O
spread	O
over	O
poles	O
,	O
set	O
up	O
for	O
that	O
purpose	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
never	O
wanted	O
any	O
repair	O
or	O
renewing	O
;	O
and	O
under	O
this	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
me	O
a	O
squab	O
or	O
couch	O
with	O
the	O
skins	O
of	O
the	O
creatures	O
I	O
had	O
killed	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
other	O
soft	O
things	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
blanket	O
laid	O
on	O
them	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
belonged	O
to	O
our	O
sea-bedding	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
saved	O
;	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
watch-coat	O
to	O
cover	O
me	O

And	O
here	O
,	O
whenever	O
I	O
had	O
occasion	O
to	O
be	O
absent	O
from	O
my	O
chief	O
seat	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
up	O
my	O
country	O
habitation	O
.	O

Adjoining	O
to	O
this	O
I	O
had	O
my	O
enclosures	O
for	O
my	O
cattle	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
my	O
goats	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
taken	O
an	O
inconceivable	O
deal	O
of	O
pains	O
to	O
fence	O
and	O
enclose	O
this	O
ground	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
so	O
anxious	O
to	O
see	O
it	O
kept	O
entire	O
,	O
lest	O
the	O
goats	O
should	O
break	O
through	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
never	O
left	O
off	O
till	O
,	O
with	O
infinite	O
labour	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
stuck	O
the	O
outside	O
of	O
the	O
hedge	O
so	O
full	O
of	O
small	O
stakes	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
near	O
to	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
rather	O
a	O
pale	O
than	O
a	O
hedge	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
scarce	O
room	O
to	O
put	O
a	O
hand	O
through	O
between	O
them	O
;	O
which	O
afterwards	O
,	O
when	O
those	O
stakes	O
grew	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
all	O
did	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
rainy	O
season	O
,	O
made	O
the	O
enclosure	O
strong	O
like	O
a	O
wall	O
,	O
indeed	O
stronger	O
than	O
any	O
wall	O
.	O

This	O
will	O
testify	O
for	O
me	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
idle	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
spared	O
no	O
pains	O
to	O
bring	O
to	O
pass	O
whatever	O
appeared	O
necessary	O
for	O
my	O
comfortable	O
support	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
considered	O
the	O
keeping	O
up	O
a	O
breed	O
of	O
tame	O
creatures	O
thus	O
at	O
my	O
hand	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
living	O
magazine	O
of	O
flesh	O
,	O
milk	O
,	O
butter	O
,	O
and	O
cheese	O
for	O
me	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
I	O
lived	O
in	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
forty	O
years	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
keeping	O
them	O
in	O
my	O
reach	O
depended	O
entirely	O
upon	O
my	O
perfecting	O
my	O
enclosures	O
to	O
such	O
a	O
degree	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
sure	O
of	O
keeping	O
them	O
together	O
;	O
which	O
by	O
this	O
method	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
I	O
so	O
effectually	O
secured	O
,	O
that	O
when	O
these	O
little	O
stakes	O
began	O
to	O
grow	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
planted	O
them	O
so	O
very	O
thick	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
pull	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
up	O
again	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
place	O
also	O
I	O
had	O
my	O
grapes	O
growing	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
principally	O
depended	O
on	O
for	O
my	O
winter	O
store	O
of	O
raisins	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
I	O
never	O
failed	O
to	O
preserve	O
very	O
carefully	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
best	O
and	O
most	O
agreeable	O
dainty	O
of	O
my	O
whole	O
diet	O
;	O
and	O
indeed	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
only	O
agreeable	O
,	O
but	O
medicinal	O
,	O
wholesome	O
,	O
nourishing	O
,	O
and	O
refreshing	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
degree	O

As	O
this	O
was	O
also	O
about	O
half-way	O
between	O
my	O

the	O
place	O

I	O
had	O

up	O

I	O
generally	O
stayed	O

lay	O
here	O
in	O
my	O

for	O
I	O
used	O
frequently	O
to	O

my	O

I	O
kept	O
all	O
things	O
about	O

her	O
in	O
very	O
good	O
order	O

Sometimes	O
I	O
went	O
out	O
in	O
her	O
to	O
divert	O
myself	O

no	O

scarcely	O

above	O
a	O
stone	O

I	O
was	O

now	O
I	O

a	O

It	O
happened	O
one	O
day	O

about	O
noon	O

going	O
towards	O
my	O

I	O
was	O

with	O
the	O

of	O
a	O
man	O

on	O

was	O

I	O
stood	O

up	O

I	O
went	O
up	O
the	O

ideas	O

I	O
fancied	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
the	O

and	O
reason	O

in	O
with	O
me	O
in	O

for	O
how	O
should	O
any	O

how	O
was	O
it	O
possible	O

then	O

to	O

that	O

upon	O
him	O

could	O

I	O
considered	O
that	O
the	O

might	O
have	O
found	O
out	O
abundance	O
of	O
other	O
ways	O
to	O
have	O
terrified	O
me	O
than	O
this	O
of	O
the	O
single	O
print	O
of	O
a	O
foot	O
;	O
that	O
as	O
I	O
lived	O
quite	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
never	O
have	O
been	O
so	O
simple	O
as	O
to	O
leave	O
a	O
mark	O
in	O
a	O
place	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
ten	O
thousand	O
to	O
one	O
whether	O
I	O
should	O
ever	O
see	O
it	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
sand	O
too	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
first	O
surge	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
upon	O
a	O
high	O
wind	O
,	O
would	O
have	O
defaced	O

All	O
this	O
seemed	O
inconsistent	O
with	O
the	O
thing	O
itself	O
and	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
notions	O
we	O
usually	O
entertain	O
of	O
the	O
subtlety	O
of	O
the	O
devil	O

Abundance	O
of	O
such	O
things	O
as	O
these	O
assisted	O
to	O
argue	O
me	O
out	O
of	O
all	O
apprehensions	O
of	O
its	O
being	O
the	O
devil	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
presently	O
concluded	O
then	O
that	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
some	O
more	O
dangerous	O
creature	O
--	O
viz.	O
that	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
of	O
the	O
mainland	O
opposite	O
who	O
had	O
wandered	O
out	O
to	O
sea	O
in	O
their	O
canoes	O
,	O
and	O
either	O
driven	O
by	O
the	O
currents	O
or	O
by	O
contrary	O
winds	O
,	O
had	O
made	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
been	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
gone	O
away	O
again	O
to	O
sea	O
;	O
being	O
as	O
loath	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
to	O
have	O
stayed	O
in	O
this	O
desolate	O
island	O
as	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
to	O
have	O
had	O
them	O

While	O
these	O
reflections	O
were	O
rolling	O
in	O
my	O
mind	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
thankful	O
in	O
my	O
thoughts	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
so	O
happy	O
as	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
thereabouts	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
or	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
see	O
my	O
boat	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
concluded	O
that	O
some	O
inhabitants	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
have	O
searched	O
farther	O
for	O
me	O
.	O

Then	O
terrible	O
thoughts	O
racked	O
my	O
imagination	O
about	O
their	O
having	O
found	O
out	O
my	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
people	O
here	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
so	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
certainly	O
have	O
them	O
come	O
again	O
in	O
greater	O
numbers	O
and	O
devour	O
me	O
;	O
that	O
if	O
it	O
should	O
happen	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
not	O
find	O
me	O
,	O
yet	O
they	O
would	O
find	O
my	O
enclosure	O
,	O
destroy	O
all	O
my	O
corn	O
,	O
and	O
carry	O
away	O
all	O
my	O
flock	O
of	O
tame	O
goats	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
should	O
perish	O
at	O
last	O
for	O
mere	O
want	O
.	O

Thus	O
my	O
fear	O
banished	O
all	O
my	O
religious	O
hope	O
,	O
all	O
that	O
former	O
confidence	O
in	O
God	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
founded	O
upon	O
such	O
wonderful	O
experience	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
had	O
of	O
His	O
goodness	O
;	O
as	O
if	O
He	O
that	O
had	O
fed	O
me	O
by	O
miracle	O
hitherto	O
could	O
not	O
preserve	O

by	O
His	O
power	O
,	O
the	O
provision	O
which	O
He	O
had	O
made	O
for	O
me	O
by	O
His	O
goodness	O

I	O
reproached	O
myself	O
with	O
my	O
laziness	O
,	O
that	O
would	O
not	O
sow	O
any	O
more	O

one	O

than	O
would	O
just	O
serve	O
me	O

the	O

as	O
if	O
no	O

to	O
prevent	O
my	O
enjoying	O
the	O
crop	O
that	O
was	O
upon	O

this	O
I	O
thought	O
so	O
just	O
a	O
reproof	O

I	O
resolved	O
for	O
the	O

two	O

corn	O

Such	O
is	O
the	O

when	O

One	O

up	O
a	O

I	O

that	O

I	O
could	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
tell	O
for	O
certain	O
where	O
I	O
had	O
trod	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
if	O
,	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
this	O
was	O
only	O
the	O
print	O
of	O
my	O
own	O
foot	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
played	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
those	O
fools	O
who	O
try	O
to	O
make	O
stories	O
of	O
spectres	O
and	O
apparitions	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
are	O
frightened	O
at	O
them	O
more	O
than	O
anybody	O
.	O

Now	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
take	O
courage	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
peep	O
abroad	O
again	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
stirred	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
castle	O
for	O
three	O
days	O
and	O
nights	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
starve	O
for	O
provisions	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
little	O
or	O
nothing	O
within	O
doors	O
but	O
some	O
barley-cakes	O
and	O
water	O
;	O
then	O
I	O
knew	O
that	O
my	O
goats	O
wanted	O
to	O
be	O
milked	O
too	O
,	O
which	O
usually	O
was	O
my	O
evening	O
diversion	O
:	O
and	O
the	O
poor	O
creatures	O
were	O
in	O
great	O
pain	O
and	O
inconvenience	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
it	O
almost	O
spoiled	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
almost	O
dried	O
up	O
their	O
milk	O
.	O

Encouraging	O
myself	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
belief	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
nothing	O
but	O
the	O
print	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
own	O
feet	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
truly	O
said	O
to	O
start	O
at	O
my	O
own	O
shadow	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
go	O
abroad	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
to	O
my	O
country	O
house	O
to	O
milk	O
my	O
flock	O
:	O
but	O
to	O
see	O
with	O
what	O
fear	O
I	O
went	O
forward	O
,	O
how	O
often	O
I	O
looked	O
behind	O
me	O
,	O
how	O
I	O
was	O
ready	O
every	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
to	O
lay	O
down	O
my	O
basket	O
and	O
run	O
for	O
my	O
life	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
made	O
any	O
one	O
have	O
thought	O
I	O
was	O
haunted	O
with	O
an	O
evil	O
conscience	O
,	O
or	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
lately	O
most	O
terribly	O
frightened	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
down	O
thus	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
seen	O
nothing	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
bolder	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
think	O
there	O
was	O
really	O
nothing	O
in	O
it	O
but	O
my	O
own	O
imagination	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
persuade	O
myself	O
fully	O
of	O
this	O
till	O
I	O
should	O
go	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
this	O
print	O
of	O
a	O
foot	O
,	O
and	O
measure	O
it	O
by	O
my	O
own	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
if	O
there	O
was	O
any	O
similitude	O
or	O
fitness	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
assured	O
it	O
was	O
my	O
own	O
foot	O
:	O
but	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
it	O
appeared	O
evidently	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
laid	O
up	O
my	O
boat	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
possibly	O
be	O
on	O
shore	O
anywhere	O
thereabouts	O
;	O
secondly	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
measure	O
the	O
mark	O
with	O
my	O
own	O
foot	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
my	O
foot	O
not	O
so	O
large	O
by	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
.	O

Both	O
these	O
things	O
filled	O
my	O
head	O
with	O
new	O
imaginations	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
me	O
the	O
vapours	O
again	O
to	O
the	O
highest	O
degree	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
shook	O
with	O
cold	O
like	O
one	O
in	O
an	O
ague	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
went	O
home	O
again	O
,	O
filled	O
with	O
the	O
belief	O
that	O
some	O
man	O
or	O
men	O
had	O
been	O
on	O
shore	O
there	O
;	O
or	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
island	O
was	O
inhabited	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
surprised	O
before	O
I	O
was	O
aware	O
;	O
and	O
what	O
course	O
to	O
take	O
for	O
my	O
security	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
.	O

Oh	O
,	O
what	O
ridiculous	O
resolutions	O
men	O
take	O
when	O
possessed	O
with	O
fear	O
!	O

It	O
deprives	O
them	O
of	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
those	O
means	O
which	O
reason	O
offers	O
for	O
their	O
relief	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
thing	O
I	O
proposed	O
to	O
myself	O
was	O
,	O
to	O
throw	O
down	O
my	O
enclosures	O
,	O
and	O
turn	O
all	O
my	O
tame	O
cattle	O
wild	O
into	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
lest	O
the	O
enemy	O
should	O
find	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
frequent	O
the	O
island	O
in	O
prospect	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
or	O
the	O
like	O
booty	O
:	O
then	O
the	O
simple	O
thing	O
of	O
digging	O
up	O
my	O
two	O
corn-fields	O
,	O
lest	O
they	O
should	O
find	O
such	O
a	O
grain	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
still	O
be	O
prompted	O
to	O
frequent	O
the	O
island	O
:	O
then	O
to	O
demolish	O
my	O
bower	O
and	O
tent	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
not	O
see	O
any	O
vestiges	O
of	O
habitation	O
,	O
and	O
be	O
prompted	O
to	O
look	O
farther	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
the	O
persons	O
inhabiting	O
.	O

These	O
were	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
night	O
's	O
cogitations	O
after	O
I	O
was	O
come	O
home	O
again	O
,	O
while	O
the	O
apprehensions	O
which	O
had	O
so	O
overrun	O
my	O
mind	O
were	O
fresh	O
upon	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
head	O
was	O
full	O
of	O
vapours	O
.	O

Thus	O
,	O
fear	O
of	O
danger	O
is	O
ten	O
thousand	O
times	O
more	O
terrifying	O
than	O
danger	O
itself	O
,	O
when	O
apparent	O
to	O
the	O
eyes	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
find	O
the	O
burden	O
of	O
anxiety	O
greater	O
,	O
by	O
much	O
,	O
than	O
the	O
evil	O
which	O
we	O
are	O
anxious	O
about	O
:	O
and	O
what	O
was	O
worse	O
than	O
all	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
that	O
relief	O
in	O
this	O
trouble	O
that	O
from	O
the	O
resignation	O
I	O
used	O
to	O
practise	O
I	O
hoped	O
to	O
have	O
.	O

I	O
looked	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
like	O
Saul	O
,	O
who	O
complained	O
not	O
only	O
that	O
the	O
Philistines	O
were	O
upon	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
God	O
had	O
forsaken	O
him	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
now	O
take	O
due	O
ways	O
to	O
compose	O
my	O
mind	O
,	O
by	O
crying	O
to	O
God	O
in	O
my	O
distress	O
,	O
and	O
resting	O
upon	O
His	O
providence	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
before	O
,	O
for	O
my	O
defence	O
and	O
deliverance	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
at	O
least	O
been	O
more	O
cheerfully	O
supported	O
under	O
this	O
new	O
surprise	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
carried	O
through	O
it	O
with	O
more	O
resolution	O
.	O

This	O
confusion	O
of	O
my	O
thoughts	O
kept	O
me	O
awake	O
all	O
night	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
I	O
fell	O
asleep	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
amusement	O
of	O
my	O
mind	O
,	O
been	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
tired	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
spirits	O
exhausted	O
,	O
I	O
slept	O
very	O
soundly	O
,	O
and	O
waked	O
much	O
better	O
composed	O
than	O
I	O
had	O
ever	O
been	O
before	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
think	O
sedately	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
upon	O
debate	O
with	O
myself	O
,	O
I	O
concluded	O
that	O
this	O
island	O
-LRB-	O
which	O
was	O
so	O
exceedingly	O
pleasant	O
,	O
fruitful	O
,	O
and	O
no	O
farther	O
from	O
the	O
mainland	O
than	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
-RRB-	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
entirely	O
abandoned	O
as	O
I	O
might	O
imagine	O
;	O
that	O
although	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
stated	O
inhabitants	O
who	O
lived	O
on	O
the	O
spot	O
,	O
yet	O
that	O
there	O
might	O
sometimes	O
come	O
boats	O
off	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
either	O
with	O
design	O
,	O
or	O
perhaps	O
never	O
but	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
driven	O
by	O
cross	O
winds	O
,	O
might	O
come	O
to	O
this	O
place	O
;	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
lived	O
there	O
fifteen	O
years	O
now	O
and	O
had	O
not	O
met	O
with	O
the	O
least	O
shadow	O
or	O
figure	O
of	O
any	O
people	O
yet	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
driven	O
here	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
probable	O
they	O
went	O
away	O
again	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
ever	O
they	O
could	O
,	O
seeing	O
they	O
had	O
never	O
thought	O
fit	O
to	O
fix	O
here	O
upon	O
any	O
occasion	O
;	O
that	O
the	O
most	O
I	O
could	O
suggest	O
any	O
danger	O
from	O
was	O
from	O
any	O
casual	O
accidental	O
landing	O
of	O
straggling	O
people	O
from	O
the	O
main	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
likely	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
driven	O
hither	O
,	O
were	O
here	O
against	O
their	O
wills	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
made	O
no	O
stay	O
here	O
,	O
but	O
went	O
off	O
again	O
with	O
all	O
possible	O
speed	O
;	O
seldom	O
staying	O
one	O
night	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
lest	O
they	O
should	O
not	O
have	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
the	O
tides	O
and	O
daylight	O
back	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
but	O
to	O
consider	O
of	O
some	O
safe	O
retreat	O
,	O
in	O
case	O
I	O
should	O
see	O
any	O
savages	O
land	O
upon	O
the	O
spot	O
.	O

Now	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
sorely	O
to	O
repent	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
dug	O
my	O
cave	O
so	O
large	O
as	O
to	O
bring	O
a	O
door	O
through	O
again	O
,	O
which	O
door	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
came	O
out	O
beyond	O
where	O
my	O
fortification	O
joined	O
to	O
the	O
rock	O
:	O
upon	O
maturely	O
considering	O
this	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
draw	O
me	O
a	O
second	O
fortification	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
a	O
semicircle	O
,	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
from	O
my	O
wall	O
,	O
just	O
where	O
I	O
had	O
planted	O
a	O
double	O
row	O
of	O
trees	O
about	O
twelve	O
years	O
before	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
made	O
mention	O
:	O
these	O
trees	O
having	O
been	O
planted	O
so	O
thick	O
before	O
,	O
they	O
wanted	O
but	O
few	O
piles	O
to	O
be	O
driven	O
between	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
thicker	O
and	O
stronger	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
wall	O
would	O
be	O
soon	O
finished	O
.	O

So	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
now	O
a	O
double	O
wall	O
;	O
and	O
my	O
outer	O
wall	O
was	O
thickened	O
with	O
pieces	O
of	O
timber	O
,	O
old	O
cables	O
,	O
and	O
everything	O
I	O
could	O
think	O
of	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
strong	O
;	O
having	O
in	O
it	O
seven	O
little	O
holes	O
,	O
about	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
I	O
might	O
put	O
my	O
arm	O
out	O
at	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
inside	O
of	O
this	O
I	O
thickened	O
my	O
wall	O
to	O
about	O
ten	O
feet	O
thick	O
with	O
continually	O
bringing	O
earth	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
cave	O
,	O
and	O
laying	O
it	O
at	O
the	O
foot	O
of	O
the	O
wall	O
,	O
and	O
walking	O
upon	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
through	O
the	O
seven	O
holes	O
I	O
contrived	O
to	O
plant	O
the	O
muskets	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
took	O
notice	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
got	O
seven	O
on	O
shore	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
these	O
I	O
planted	O
like	O
my	O
cannon	O
,	O
and	O
fitted	O
them	O
into	O
frames	O
,	O
that	O
held	O
them	O
like	O
a	O
carriage	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
fire	O
all	O
the	O
seven	O
guns	O
in	O
two	O
minutes	O
'	O
time	O
;	O
this	O
wall	O
I	O
was	O
many	O
a	O
weary	O
month	O
in	O
finishing	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
never	O
thought	O
myself	O
safe	O
till	O
it	O
was	O
done	O
.	O

When	O
this	O
was	O
done	O
I	O
stuck	O
all	O
the	O
ground	O
without	O
my	O
wall	O
,	O
for	O
a	O
great	O
length	O
every	O
way	O
,	O
as	O
full	O
with	O
stakes	O
or	O
sticks	O
of	O
the	O
osier-like	O
wood	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
found	O
so	O
apt	O
to	O
grow	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
well	O
stand	O
;	O
insomuch	O
that	O
I	O
believe	O
I	O
might	O
set	O
in	O
near	O
twenty	O
thousand	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
leaving	O
a	O
pretty	O
large	O
space	O
between	O
them	O
and	O
my	O
wall	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
room	O
to	O
see	O
an	O
enemy	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
no	O
shelter	O
from	O
the	O
young	O
trees	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
attempted	O
to	O
approach	O
my	O
outer	O
wall	O
.	O

Thus	O
in	O
two	O
years	O
'	O
time	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
thick	O
grove	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
years	O

a	O

before	O
my	O

growing	O
so	O
monstrously	O
thick	O
and	O
strong	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
indeed	O
perfectly	O
impassable	O
:	O
and	O
no	O
men	O

imagine	O
that	O

was	O
anything	O

As	O
for	O

I	O
proposed	O

A	O
CAVE	O
RETREAT	O
While	O
this	O
was	O
doing	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
altogether	O
careless	O
of	O
my	O
other	O
affairs	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
concern	O
upon	O
me	O
for	O
my	O
little	O
herd	O
of	O
goats	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
only	O
a	O
ready	O
supply	O
to	O
me	O
on	O
every	O
occasion	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
sufficient	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
without	O
the	O
expense	O
of	O
powder	O
and	O
shot	O
,	O
but	O
also	O
without	O
the	O
fatigue	O
of	O
hunting	O
after	O
the	O
wild	O
ones	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
loath	O
to	O
lose	O
the	O
advantage	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
have	O
them	O
all	O
to	O
nurse	O
up	O
over	O
again	O
.	O

For	O
this	O
purpose	O
,	O
after	O
long	O
consideration	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
think	O
of	O
but	O
two	O
ways	O
to	O
preserve	O
them	O
:	O
one	O
was	O
,	O
to	O
find	O
another	O
convenient	O
place	O
to	O
dig	O
a	O
cave	O
underground	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
drive	O
them	O
into	O
it	O
every	O
night	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
was	O
to	O
enclose	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
little	O
bits	O
of	O
land	O
,	O
remote	O
from	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
much	O
concealed	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
might	O
keep	O
about	O
half-a-dozen	O
young	O
goats	O
in	O
each	O
place	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
if	O
any	O
disaster	O
happened	O
to	O
the	O
flock	O
in	O
general	O
,	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
raise	O
them	O
again	O
with	O
little	O
trouble	O
and	O
time	O
:	O
and	O
this	O
though	O
it	O
would	O
require	O
a	O
good	O
deal	O
of	O
time	O
and	O
labour	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
was	O
the	O
most	O
rational	O
design	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
I	O
spent	O
some	O
time	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
the	O
most	O
retired	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
pitched	O
upon	O
one	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
as	O
private	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
as	O
my	O
heart	O
could	O
wish	O
:	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
damp	O
piece	O
of	O
ground	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
hollow	O
and	O
thick	O
woods	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
as	O
is	O
observed	O
,	O
I	O
almost	O
lost	O
myself	O
once	O
before	O
,	O
endeavouring	O
to	O
come	O
back	O
that	O
way	O
from	O
the	O
eastern	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

Here	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
clear	O
piece	O
of	O
land	O
,	O
near	O
three	O
acres	O
,	O
so	O
surrounded	O
with	O
woods	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
almost	O
an	O
enclosure	O
by	O
nature	O
;	O
at	O
least	O
,	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
want	O
near	O
so	O
much	O
labour	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
so	O
as	O
the	O
other	O
piece	O
of	O
ground	O
I	O
had	O
worked	O
so	O
hard	O
at	O
.	O

I	O
immediately	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
this	O
piece	O
of	O
ground	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
a	O
month	O
's	O
time	O
I	O
had	O
so	O
fenced	O
it	O
round	O
that	O
my	O
flock	O
,	O
or	O
herd	O
,	O
call	O
it	O
which	O
you	O
please	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
not	O
so	O
wild	O
now	O
as	O
at	O
first	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
,	O
were	O
well	O
enough	O
secured	O
in	O
it	O
:	O
so	O
,	O
without	O
any	O
further	O
delay	O
,	O
I	O
removed	O
ten	O
young	O
she-goats	O
and	O
two	O
he-goats	O
to	O
this	O
piece	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
there	O
I	O
continued	O
to	O
perfect	O
the	O
fence	O
till	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
it	O
as	O
secure	O
as	O
the	O
other	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
at	O
more	O
leisure	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
took	O
me	O
up	O
more	O
time	O
by	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
.	O

All	O
this	O
labour	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
the	O
expense	O
of	O
,	O
purely	O
from	O
my	O
apprehensions	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
print	O
of	O
a	O
man	O
's	O
foot	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
yet	O
I	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
any	O
human	O
creature	O
come	O
near	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
now	O
lived	O
two	O
years	O
under	O
this	O
uneasiness	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
made	O
my	O
life	O
much	O
less	O
comfortable	O
than	O
it	O
was	O
before	O
,	O
as	O
may	O
be	O
well	O
imagined	O
by	O
any	O
who	O
know	O
what	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
the	O
constant	O
snare	O
of	O
the	O
fear	O
of	O
man	O
.	O

And	O
this	O
I	O
must	O
observe	O
,	O
with	O
grief	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
discomposure	O
of	O
my	O
mind	O
had	O
great	O
impression	O
also	O
upon	O
the	O
religious	O
part	O
of	O
my	O
thoughts	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
dread	O
and	O
terror	O
of	O
falling	O
into	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
savages	O
and	O
cannibals	O
lay	O
so	O
upon	O
my	O
spirits	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
seldom	O
found	O
myself	O
in	O
a	O
due	O
temper	O
for	O
application	O
to	O
my	O
Maker	O
;	O
at	O
least	O
,	O
not	O
with	O
the	O
sedate	O
calmness	O
and	O
resignation	O
of	O
soul	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
wont	O
to	O
do	O
:	O
I	O
rather	O
prayed	O
to	O
God	O
as	O
under	O
great	O
affliction	O
and	O
pressure	O
of	O
mind	O
,	O
surrounded	O
with	O
danger	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
expectation	O
every	O
night	O
of	O
being	O
murdered	O
and	O
devoured	O
before	O
morning	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
must	O
testify	O
,	O
from	O
my	O
experience	O
,	O
that	O
a	O
temper	O
of	O
peace	O
,	O
thankfulness	O
,	O
love	O
,	O
and	O
affection	O
,	O
is	O
much	O
the	O
more	O
proper	O
frame	O
for	O
prayer	O
than	O
that	O
of	O
terror	O
and	O
discomposure	O
:	O
and	O
that	O
under	O
the	O
dread	O
of	O
mischief	O
impending	O
,	O
a	O
man	O
is	O
no	O
more	O
fit	O
for	O
a	O
comforting	O
performance	O
of	O
the	O
duty	O
of	O
praying	O
to	O
God	O
than	O
he	O
is	O
for	O
a	O
repentance	O
on	O
a	O
sick-bed	O
;	O
for	O
these	O
discomposures	O
affect	O
the	O
mind	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
others	O
do	O
the	O
body	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
discomposure	O
of	O
the	O
mind	O
must	O
necessarily	O
be	O
as	O
great	O
a	O
disability	O
as	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
body	O
,	O
and	O
much	O
greater	O
;	O
praying	O
to	O
God	O
being	O
properly	O
an	O
act	O
of	O
the	O
mind	O
,	O
not	O
of	O
the	O
body	O
.	O

But	O
to	O
go	O
on	O

After	O
I	O
had	O
thus	O
secured	O
one	O
part	O
of	O
my	O
little	O
living	O
stock	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
about	O
the	O
whole	O
island	O
,	O
searching	O
for	O
another	O
private	O
place	O
to	O
make	O
such	O
another	O

;	O
when	O
,	O
wandering	O
more	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
point	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
than	O
I	O
had	O
ever	O
done	O
yet	O
,	O
and	O
looking	O
out	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O
saw	O
a	O
boat	O
upon	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
found	O
a	O
perspective	O
glass	O
or	O
two	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
seamen	O
's	O
chests	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
saved	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
ship	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
had	O
it	O
not	O
about	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
so	O
remote	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
what	O
to	O
make	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
looked	O
at	O
it	O
till	O
my	O
eyes	O
were	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
hold	O
to	O
look	O
any	O
longer	O
;	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
boat	O
or	O
not	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
know	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
I	O
descended	O
from	O
the	O
hill	O
I	O
could	O
see	O
no	O
more	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
gave	O
it	O
over	O
;	O
only	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
no	O
more	O
out	O
without	O
a	O
perspective	O
glass	O
in	O
my	O
pocket	O

When	O
I	O
was	O

down	O
the	O
hill	O
to	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O

where	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
I	O
had	O

presently	O
convinced	O
that	O
the	O
seeing	O
the	O
print	O
of	O
a	O
man	O

was	O
not	O
such	O
a	O
strange	O
thing	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
as	O
I	O
imagined	O
:	O
and	O
but	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
special	O
providence	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
cast	O
upon	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
where	O
the	O
savages	O
never	O
came	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
easily	O
have	O
known	O
that	O
nothing	O
was	O
more	O
frequent	O
than	O
for	O
the	O
canoes	O
from	O
the	O
main	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
happened	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
too	O
far	O
out	O
at	O
sea	O
,	O
to	O
shoot	O
over	O
to	O
that	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
for	O
harbour	O
:	O
likewise	O

as	O
they	O
often	O
met	O

in	O
their	O
canoes	O

the	O
victors	O

having	O
taken	O

them	O
over	O
to	O
this	O
shore	O

where	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
their	O
dreadful	O

down	O

above	O

being	O

the	O

I	O
was	O
perfectly	O
confounded	O

amazed	O

is	O
it	O
possible	O
for	O
me	O
to	O

I	O
observed	O

and	O
a	O
circle	O

where	O
I	O
supposed	O
the	O

down	O
to	O
their	O

feastings	O
upon	O
the	O

I	O
was	O
so	O
astonished	O
with	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
these	O

that	O
I	O

the	O

I	O

my	O

walked	O
on	O
towards	O
my	O
own	O
habitation	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
came	O
a	O
little	O
out	O
of	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
I	O
stood	O
still	O
awhile	O
,	O
as	O
amazed	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
recovering	O
myself	O
,	O
I	O
looked	O
up	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
affection	O
of	O
my	O
soul	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
flood	O
of	O
tears	O
in	O
my	O
eyes	O
,	O
gave	O
God	O
thanks	O
,	O
that	O
had	O
cast	O
my	O
first	O
lot	O
in	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
distinguished	O
from	O
such	O
dreadful	O
creatures	O
as	O
these	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
had	O
esteemed	O
my	O
present	O
condition	O
very	O
miserable	O
,	O
had	O
yet	O
given	O
me	O
so	O
many	O
comforts	O
in	O
it	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
still	O
more	O
to	O
give	O
thanks	O
for	O
than	O
to	O
complain	O
of	O
:	O
and	O
this	O
,	O
above	O
all	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
,	O
even	O
in	O
this	O
miserable	O
condition	O
,	O
been	O
comforted	O
with	O
the	O
knowledge	O
of	O
Himself	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
hope	O
of	O
His	O
blessing	O
:	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
felicity	O
more	O
than	O
sufficiently	O
equivalent	O
to	O
all	O
the	O
misery	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
suffered	O
,	O
or	O
could	O
suffer	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
frame	O
of	O
thankfulness	O
I	O
went	O
home	O
to	O
my	O
castle	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
much	O
easier	O
now	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
safety	O
of	O
my	O
circumstances	O
,	O
than	O
ever	O
I	O
was	O
before	O
:	O
for	O
I	O
observed	O
that	O
these	O
wretches	O
never	O
came	O
to	O
this	O
island	O
in	O
search	O
of	O
what	O
they	O
could	O
get	O
;	O
perhaps	O
not	O
seeking	O
,	O
not	O
wanting	O
,	O
or	O
not	O
expecting	O
anything	O
here	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
often	O

no	O

been	O
up	O
the	O
covered	O

woody	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
without	O
finding	O
anything	O
to	O
their	O
purpose	O

I	O
knew	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
here	O
now	O
almost	O
eighteen	O
years	O
,	O
and	O
never	O
saw	O
the	O
least	O
footsteps	O
of	O
human	O
creature	O
there	O
before	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
eighteen	O
years	O
more	O
as	O
entirely	O
concealed	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
now	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
discover	O
myself	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
manner	O
of	O

to	O

;	O
it	O
being	O
my	O
only	O
business	O
to	O
keep	O
myself	O
entirely	O
concealed	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
,	O
unless	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
better	O
sort	O
of	O
creatures	O
than	O
cannibals	O
to	O
make	O
myself	O
known	O
to	O

Yet	O
I	O
entertained	O
such	O
an	O
abhorrence	O
of	O
the	O
savage	O
wretches	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
speaking	O
of	O

custom	O
of	O
their	O
devouring	O

eating	O
one	O
another	O
up	O

that	O
I	O
continued	O
pensive	O

and	O
kept	O
close	O
within	O
my	O

for	O
almost	O
two	O

when	O
I	O

my	O

this	O
for	O
any	O

an	O

for	O
my	O

;	O
for	O
the	O
aversion	O
which	O
nature	O
gave	O
me	O
to	O
these	O
hellish	O
wretches	O
was	O
such	O

that	O
I	O
was	O
as	O
fearful	O
of	O
seeing	O
them	O
as	O
of	O

the	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
go	O
to	O
look	O
after	O
my	O
boat	O
all	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
but	O
began	O
rather	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
making	O
another	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
could	O
not	O

the	O

that	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
no	O

of	O
being	O
discovered	O
by	O

began	O
to	O
wear	O
off	O
my	O
uneasiness	O
about	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
live	O
just	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
composed	O
manner	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
only	O
with	O
this	O
difference	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
used	O
more	O
caution	O

and	O
kept	O
my	O
eyes	O
more	O
about	O
me	O
than	O
I	O
did	O
before	O

lest	O
I	O
should	O
happen	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
by	O
any	O
of	O
them	O

I	O
was	O

any	O

on	O
the	O

should	O

to	O
hear	O
it	O

It	O
was	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
providence	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
furnished	O
myself	O
with	O
a	O

at	O

and	O
if	O
I	O
did	O
catch	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
after	O
this	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
by	O
traps	O

snares	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
before	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
for	O
two	O
years	O
after	O
this	O
I	O
believe	O
I	O
never	O
fired	O
my	O
gun	O
once	O
off	O

though	O
I	O
never	O
went	O
out	O
without	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
what	O
was	O
more	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
saved	O
three	O
pistols	O
out	O
of	O
the	O

out	O

made	O
me	O
a	O
belt	O
to	O
hang	O
it	O
on	O
also	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
now	O
a	O
most	O
formidable	O
fellow	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
when	O
I	O
went	O
abroad	O
,	O
if	O
you	O
add	O
to	O
the	O
former	O
description	O
of	O
myself	O

particular	O
of	O
two	O
pistols	O

and	O
a	O

without	O

Things	O
going	O
on	O
thus	O

as	O
I	O

for	O

to	O
my	O
former	O
calm	O

way	O
of	O

All	O
these	O
things	O
tended	O
to	O
show	O
me	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
how	O
far	O
my	O
condition	O
was	O
from	O
being	O
miserable	O

compared	O
to	O
some	O
others	O

to	O

it	O
might	O

It	O
put	O
me	O
upon	O
reflecting	O
how	O
little	O
repining	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
among	O
mankind	O
at	O
any	O
condition	O
of	O
life	O
if	O
people	O
would	O
rather	O
compare	O
their	O
condition	O
with	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
worse	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
be	O
thankful	O
,	O
than	O
be	O
always	O
comparing	O
them	O
with	O
those	O
which	O
are	O
better	O

to	O
assist	O
their	O
murmurings	O

As	O
in	O
my	O
present	O
condition	O
there	O
were	O
not	O
really	O
many	O
things	O
which	O
I	O
wanted	O
,	O
so	O
indeed	O
I	O
thought	O
that	O
the	O
frights	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
about	O
these	O
savage	O
wretches	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
concern	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
for	O
my	O
own	O
preservation	O

had	O
taken	O
off	O
the	O
edge	O
of	O
my	O
invention	O
,	O
for	O
my	O
own	O
conveniences	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
dropped	O
a	O
good	O
design	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
once	O
bent	O
my	O
thoughts	O
upon	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
to	O
try	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
make	O
some	O
of	O
my	O
barley	O
into	O
malt	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
try	O
to	O
brew	O
myself	O
some	O
beer	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
really	O
a	O
whimsical	O
thought	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
reproved	O
myself	O
often	O
for	O
the	O
simplicity	O
of	O
it	O
:	O
for	O
I	O
presently	O
saw	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
several	O
things	O
necessary	O
to	O
the	O
making	O
my	O
beer	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
impossible	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
supply	O
;	O
as	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
casks	O
to	O
preserve	O
it	O
in	O

which	O
was	O
a	O
thing	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
observed	O
already	O

I	O
could	O
never	O
compass	O

no	O

though	O
I	O
spent	O
not	O

in	O

to	O

In	O
the	O

I	O
had	O
no	O

perhaps	O

it	O

I	O
seldom	O

anything	O

I	O

it	O
in	O

But	O
my	O
invention	O
now	O
ran	O
quite	O
another	O
way	O
;	O
for	O
night	O
and	O
day	O
I	O
could	O
think	O

at	O

frightening	O
them	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
prevent	O
their	O

any	O

all	O
this	O
was	O
abortive	O

nothing	O

unless	O

among	O

might	O

Sometimes	O
I	O
thought	O

digging	O
a	O

under	O
the	O

where	O
they	O

fire	O

which	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
kindled	O
their	O

would	O
consequently	O
take	O
fire	O

and	O
blow	O
up	O
all	O
that	O
was	O
near	O
it	O
:	O
but	O
as	O
,	O
in	O
the	O

I	O
should	O
be	O
unwilling	O
to	O
waste	O

my	O

it	O
might	O

at	O

that	O

blow	O
the	O

about	O

them	O

not	O
sufficient	O
to	O

I	O
laid	O

with	O
my	O
three	O
guns	O
all	O
double-loaded	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
their	O
bloody	O
ceremony	O
let	O
fly	O
at	O

when	O
I	O
should	O
be	O

kill	O

two	O

three	O
at	O
every	O

then	O
falling	O
in	O
upon	O
them	O
with	O
my	O
three	O
pistols	O
and	O
my	O
sword	O

I	O
made	O
no	O

that	O
,	O
if	O

should	O

This	O
fancy	O
pleased	O
my	O
thoughts	O
for	O
some	O
weeks	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
so	O
full	O
of	O
it	O
that	O
I	O
often	O
dreamed	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
sometimes	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
just	O
going	O
to	O
let	O
fly	O
at	O
them	O
in	O
my	O
sleep	O
.	O

I	O
went	O
so	O
far	O
with	O
it	O
in	O
my	O
imagination	O
that	O
I	O
employed	O
myself	O
several	O
days	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
proper	O
places	O
to	O
put	O
myself	O
in	O
ambuscade	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
to	O
watch	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
went	O
frequently	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
itself	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
now	O
grown	O
more	O
familiar	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
but	O
while	O
my	O
mind	O
was	O
thus	O
filled	O
with	O
thoughts	O
of	O
revenge	O
and	O
a	O
bloody	O
putting	O
twenty	O
or	O
thirty	O
of	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
sword	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
may	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
the	O
horror	O
I	O
had	O
at	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
signals	O
of	O
the	O
barbarous	O
wretches	O
devouring	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
abetted	O
my	O
malice	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
at	O
length	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
place	O
in	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
satisfied	O
I	O
might	O
securely	O
wait	O
till	O
I	O
saw	O
any	O
of	O
their	O
boats	O
coming	O
;	O
and	O
might	O
then	O
,	O
even	O
before	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
ready	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
convey	O
myself	O
unseen	O
into	O
some	O
thickets	O
of	O
trees	O
,	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
which	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
hollow	O
large	O
enough	O
to	O
conceal	O
me	O
entirely	O
;	O
and	O
there	O
I	O
might	O
sit	O
and	O
observe	O
all	O
their	O
bloody	O
doings	O
,	O
and	O
take	O
my	O
full	O
aim	O
at	O
their	O
heads	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
close	O
together	O
as	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
next	O
to	O
impossible	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
miss	O
my	O
shot	O
,	O
or	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
fail	O
wounding	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
of	O
them	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
shot	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
place	O
,	O
then	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
fulfil	O
my	O
design	O
;	O
and	O
accordingly	O
I	O
prepared	O
two	O
muskets	O
and	O
my	O
ordinary	O
fowling-piece	O
.	O

The	O
two	O
muskets	O
I	O
loaded	O
with	O
a	O
brace	O
of	O
slugs	O
each	O
,	O
and	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
smaller	O
bullets	O
,	O
about	O
the	O
size	O
of	O
pistol	O
bullets	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
fowling-piece	O
I	O
loaded	O
with	O
near	O
a	O
handful	O
of	O
swan-shot	O
of	O
the	O
largest	O
size	O
;	O
I	O
also	O
loaded	O
my	O
pistols	O
with	O
about	O
four	O
bullets	O
each	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
this	O
posture	O
,	O
well	O
provided	O
with	O
ammunition	O
for	O
a	O
second	O
and	O
third	O
charge	O
,	O
I	O
prepared	O
myself	O
for	O
my	O
expedition	O

After	O
I	O
had	O
thus	O
laid	O
the	O
scheme	O
of	O
my	O
design	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
my	O
imagination	O
put	O
it	O
in	O
practice	O
,	O
I	O
continually	O
made	O
my	O
tour	O
every	O
morning	O
to	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
from	O
my	O
castle	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
called	O
it	O
,	O
about	O
three	O
miles	O
or	O
more	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
observe	O
any	O
boats	O
upon	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
coming	O
near	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
or	O
standing	O
over	O
towards	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
tire	O
of	O
this	O
hard	O
duty	O
,	O
after	O
I	O
had	O
for	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
months	O
constantly	O
kept	O
my	O
watch	O
,	O
but	O
came	O
always	O
back	O
without	O
any	O
discovery	O
;	O
there	O
having	O
not	O
,	O
in	O
all	O
that	O

the	O

on	O

so	O
far	O
as	O
my	O

could	O

I	O
kept	O
my	O

to	O
the	O
hill	O

to	O
look	O
out	O

so	O

also	O
I	O
kept	O
up	O
the	O

to	O
be	O
all	O
the	O

in	O
a	O
suitable	O
frame	O
for	O
so	O
outrageous	O
an	O
execution	O
as	O
the	O
killing	O
twenty	O
or	O
thirty	O
naked	O
savages	O
,	O
for	O
an	O

which	O
I	O
had	O

my	O

any	O
farther	O
than	O
my	O

were	O
at	O

fired	O
by	O
the	O
horror	O
I	O
conceived	O
at	O
the	O
unnatural	O
custom	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
that	O
country	O

who	O

suffered	O
by	O

in	O
His	O

of	O
the	O

to	O
have	O
no	O

than	O
that	O
of	O
their	O

consequently	O
were	O
left	O

and	O
perhaps	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
for	O
some	O
ages	O

to	O
act	O
such	O

things	O

that	O

I	O
gave	O

on	O
my	O

to	O
God	O

In	O
this	O

I	O

this	O

quite	O
on	O

the	O
island	O

was	O
out	O
of	O
danger	O
;	O
for	O
certain	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
that	O
these	O
savage	O
people	O
,	O
who	O
sometimes	O
haunted	O
this	O
island	O
,	O
never	O
came	O
with	O
any	O
thoughts	O
of	O
finding	O
anything	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
never	O
wandered	O
off	O
from	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
doubt	O
not	O
but	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
several	O
times	O
on	O
shore	O
after	O
my	O
apprehensions	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
made	O
me	O
cautious	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
before	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
I	O
looked	O
back	O
with	O
some	O
horror	O
upon	O
the	O
thoughts	O
of	O
what	O
my	O
condition	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
chopped	O
upon	O

been	O
discovered	O
before	O
that	O
;	O
when	O
,	O
naked	O
and	O
unarmed	O

except	O
with	O
one	O
gun	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
loaded	O
often	O
only	O
with	O
small	O
shot	O
,	O
I	O
walked	O
everywhere	O
,	O
peeping	O
and	O
peering	O
about	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
I	O
could	O
get	O
;	O
what	O
a	O
surprise	O
should	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
in	O
if	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
discovered	O
the	O
print	O
of	O
a	O
man	O
's	O
foot	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
that	O

seen	O
fifteen	O
or	O
twenty	O
savages	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
them	O
pursuing	O
me	O

and	O
by	O
the	O
swiftness	O
of	O
their	O
running	O
no	O
possibility	O
of	O
my	O
escaping	O
them	O
!	O

The	O
thoughts	O
of	O
this	O
sometimes	O
sank	O
my	O
very	O
soul	O
within	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
distressed	O
my	O
mind	O
so	O
much	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
soon	O
recover	O
it	O
,	O
to	O
think	O
what	O
I	O
should	O

done	O

and	O
how	O
I	O
should	O
not	O
only	O
have	O
been	O
unable	O
to	O
resist	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
even	O
should	O
not	O
have	O
had	O
presence	O
of	O
mind	O
enough	O
to	O
do	O
what	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
done	O

much	O
less	O
what	O
now	O

after	O
so	O

I	O
might	O
be	O

Indeed	O
,	O
after	O
serious	O
thinking	O
of	O
these	O
things	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
melancholy	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
it	O
would	O
last	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
resolved	O
it	O
all	O
at	O
last	O
into	O
thankfulness	O
to	O
that	O
Providence	O
which	O
had	O
delivered	O
me	O
from	O
so	O
many	O
unseen	O
dangers	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
kept	O
me	O
from	O
those	O
mischiefs	O
which	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
no	O
way	O
been	O
the	O
agent	O
in	O
delivering	O
myself	O
from	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
the	O

notion	O
of	O
any	O
such	O
thing	O
depending	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
least	O
supposition	O
of	O
its	O
being	O
possible	O

This	O
renewed	O
a	O
contemplation	O
which	O
often	O
had	O
come	O
into	O
my	O
thoughts	O
in	O
former	O
times	O
,	O
when	O
first	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
merciful	O
dispositions	O
of	O
Heaven	O

in	O
the	O
dangers	O
we	O
run	O
through	O
in	O
this	O
life	O
;	O
how	O
wonderfully	O
we	O
are	O
delivered	O
when	O
we	O
know	O
nothing	O

it	O
;	O
how	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
are	O
in	O
a	O
quandary	O
as	O
we	O
call	O
it	O

a	O
doubt	O

whether	O
to	O

this	O

that	O

a	O

,	O
when	O
sense	O

our	O

inclination	O

and	O
perhaps	O
business	O
has	O
called	O
us	O
to	O
go	O
the	O
other	O
way	O
,	O
yet	O
a	O
strange	O
impression	O
upon	O
the	O
mind	O
,	O
from	O
we	O
know	O
not	O
what	O
springs	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
we	O
know	O
not	O
what	O
power	O

shall	O
overrule	O
us	O
to	O
go	O
this	O
way	O

and	O
it	O
shall	O
afterwards	O
appear	O
that	O
had	O

gone	O
that	O
way	O

which	O
we	O
should	O

even	O

Upon	O
these	O

reflections	O
I	O
afterwards	O
made	O
it	O
a	O
certain	O
rule	O
with	O

upon	O

the	O
success	O
of	O
this	O

it	O
is	O

I	O

to	O
my	O
unspeakable	O
consolation	O

a	O
mere	O
natural	O
cave	O
in	O
the	O
earth	O

which	O
went	O
in	O
a	O
vast	O
way	O

and	O
where	O

I	O

,	O
no	O
savage	O

had	O
he	O
been	O
at	O
the	O
mouth	O

it	O

would	O
be	O
so	O
hardy	O

nor	O

indeed	O

would	O
any	O

but	O
one	O
who	O

like	O
me	O

wanted	O
nothing	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
a	O
safe	O
retreat	O

The	O
mouth	O
of	O
this	O

was	O
at	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
a	O
great	O
rock	O

where	O

by	O
mere	O
accident	O
-LRB-	O
I	O
would	O

if	O
I	O

abundant	O
reason	O

ascribe	O
all	O
such	O
things	O
now	O
to	O
Providence	PNM
-RRB-	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
cutting	O
down	O
some	O
thick	O
branches	O
of	O
trees	O
to	O
make	O
charcoal	O
;	O
and	O
before	O
I	O
go	O
on	O
I	O
must	O
observe	O
the	O
reason	O
of	O
my	O
making	O
this	O
charcoal	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
this	O
--	O
I	O
was	O
afraid	O
of	O
making	O
a	O
smoke	O
about	O
my	O
habitation	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
before	O

and	O
yet	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
live	O
there	O
without	O
baking	O
my	O
bread	O
,	O
cooking	O
my	O
meat	O
,	O
&	O
c.	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
contrived	O
to	O
burn	O
some	O
wood	O
here	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
done	O
in	O
England	PNM
,	O
under	O
turf	O
,	O
till	O
it	O
became	O
chark	O
or	O
dry	O
coal	O
:	O
and	O
then	O
putting	O
the	O
fire	O
out	O
,	O
I	O
preserved	O
the	O
coal	O
to	O
carry	O
home	O
,	O
and	O
perform	O
the	O

services	O
for	O
which	O

was	O
wanting	O

without	O

But	O
this	O
is	O
by-the-bye	O

While	O
I	O
was	O
cutting	O
down	O
some	O
wood	O
here	O
,	O
I	O
perceived	O
that	O
,	O
behind	O
a	O
very	O
thick	O
branch	O
of	O
low	O
brushwood	O
or	O
underwood	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
hollow	O
place	O
:	O
I	O
was	O
curious	O
to	O
look	O
in	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
getting	O
with	O
difficulty	O
into	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
it	O
was	O
pretty	O
large	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
sufficient	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
stand	O
upright	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
another	O
with	O
me	O
:	O
but	O
I	O
must	O
confess	O
to	O
you	O
that	O
I	O
made	O
more	O
haste	O
out	O
than	O
I	O
did	O
in	O
,	O
when	O
looking	O
farther	O
into	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
was	O
perfectly	O
dark	O
,	O
I	O
saw	O
two	O
broad	O
shining	O
eyes	O
of	O
some	O
creature	O
,	O
whether	O
devil	O
or	O
man	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
,	O
which	O
twinkled	O
like	O
two	O
stars	O
;	O
the	O
dim	O
light	O
from	O
the	O
cave	O
's	O
mouth	O
shining	O
directly	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
making	O
the	O
reflection	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
after	O
some	O
pause	O
I	O
recovered	O
myself	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
call	O
myself	O
a	O
thousand	O
fools	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
he	O
that	O
was	O
afraid	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
devil	O
was	O
not	O
fit	O
to	O
live	O
twenty	O
years	O
in	O
an	O
island	O
all	O
alone	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
well	O
think	O
there	O
was	O
nothing	O
in	O
this	O
cave	O
that	O
was	O
more	O
frightful	O
than	O
myself	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
,	O
plucking	O
up	O
my	O
courage	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
up	O
a	O
firebrand	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
I	O
rushed	O
again	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
stick	O
flaming	O
in	O
my	O
hand	O
:	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
gone	O
three	O
steps	O
in	O
before	O
I	O
was	O
almost	O
as	O
frightened	O
as	O
before	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
heard	O
a	O
very	O
loud	O
sigh	O
,	O
like	O
that	O
of	O
a	O
man	O
in	O
some	O
pain	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
followed	O
by	O
a	O
broken	O
noise	O
,	O
as	O
of	O
words	O
half	O
expressed	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
a	O
deep	O
sigh	O
again	O
.	O

I	O
stepped	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
indeed	O
struck	O
with	O
such	O
a	O
surprise	O
that	O
it	O
put	O
me	O
into	O
a	O
cold	O
sweat	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
had	O
a	O
hat	O
on	O
my	O
head	O
,	O
I	O
will	O
not	O
answer	O
for	O
it	O
that	O
my	O
hair	O
might	O
not	O
have	O
lifted	O
it	O
off	O
.	O

But	O
still	O
plucking	O
up	O
my	O
spirits	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
and	O
encouraging	O
myself	O
a	O
little	O
with	O
considering	O
that	O
the	O
power	O
and	O
presence	O
of	O
God	O
was	O
everywhere	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
protect	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
stepped	O
forward	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
light	O
of	O
the	O
firebrand	O
,	O
holding	O
it	O
up	O
a	O
little	O
over	O
my	O
head	O
,	O
I	O
saw	O
lying	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
a	O
monstrous	O
,	O
frightful	O
old	O
he-goat	O
,	O
just	O
making	O
his	O
will	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
say	O
,	O
and	O
gasping	O
for	O
life	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
dying	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
of	O
mere	O
old	O
age	O
.	O

I	O
stirred	O
him	O
a	O
little	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
get	O
him	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
essayed	O
to	O
get	O
up	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
raise	O
himself	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
thought	O
with	O
myself	O
he	O
might	O
even	O
lie	O
there	O
--	O
for	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
frightened	O
me	O
,	O
so	O
he	O
would	O
certainly	O
fright	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
,	O
if	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
should	O
be	O
so	O
hardy	O
as	O
to	O
come	O
in	O
there	O
while	O
he	O
had	O
any	O
life	O
in	O
him	O

I	O
was	O
now	O
recovered	O
from	O
my	O
surprise	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
look	O
round	O
me	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
found	O
the	O
cave	O
was	O
but	O
very	O
small	O
--	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
about	O
twelve	O
feet	O
over	O

but	O
in	O
no	O
manner	O
of	O
shape	O

neither	O
round	O
nor	O
square	O

no	O
hands	O

ever	O
been	O
employed	O
in	O
making	O
it	O
but	O
those	O
of	O
mere	PNM
Nature	PNM

I	O
observed	O
also	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
place	O
at	O
the	O
farther	O
side	O
of	O
it	O
that	O
went	O
in	O
further	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
so	O
low	O
that	O
it	O
required	O
me	O
to	O
creep	O
upon	O
my	O
hands	O
and	O
knees	O
to	O
go	O
into	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
whither	O
it	O
went	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
;	O
so	O
,	O
having	O
no	O
candle	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
it	O
over	O
for	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
but	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
again	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
provided	O
with	O
candles	O
and	O
a	O
tinder-box	O

the	O

I	O
came	O

with	O
six	O
large	O

of	O
my	O

for	O
I	O
made	O
very	O
good	O
candles	O
now	O
of	O
goat	O
's	O
tallow	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
hard	O
set	O
for	O
candle-wick	O

using	O
sometimes	O
rags	O
or	O
rope-yarn	O

and	O
sometimes	O
the	O
dried	O
rind	O
of	O
a	O
weed	O
like	O
nettles	O
-RRB-	O
;	O
and	O
going	O
into	O
this	O
low	O
place	O
I	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
creep	O
upon	O
all-fours	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
almost	O
ten	O
yards	O
--	O
which	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
was	O
a	O
venture	O
bold	O
enough	O
,	O
considering	O
that	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
how	O
far	O
it	O
might	O
go	O
,	O
nor	O
what	O
was	O
beyond	O
it	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
had	O
got	O
through	O
the	O
strait	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
the	O
roof	O
rose	O
higher	O
up	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
near	O
twenty	O
feet	O
;	O
but	O
never	O
was	O
such	O
a	O
glorious	O
sight	O
seen	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
I	O
daresay	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
look	O
round	O
the	O
sides	O
and	O
roof	O
of	O
this	O
vault	O
or	O
cave	O
--	O
the	O
wall	O
reflected	O
a	O
hundred	O
thousand	O
lights	O
to	O
me	O
from	O
my	O
two	O
candles	O

What	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
rock	O
--	O
whether	O
diamonds	O
or	O
any	O
other	O
precious	O
stones	O
,	O
or	O
gold	O
which	O
I	O
rather	O
supposed	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
--	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O

The	O
place	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
was	O
a	O
most	O
delightful	O
cavity	O
,	O
or	O
grotto	O
,	O
though	O
perfectly	O
dark	O
;	O
the	O
floor	O
was	O
dry	O
and	O
level	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
a	O
small	O
loose	O
gravel	O
upon	O
it	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
nauseous	O
or	O
venomous	O
creature	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
,	O
neither	O
was	O
there	O
any	O
damp	O
or	O
wet	O
on	O
the	O
sides	O
or	O
roof	O

The	O
only	O
difficulty	O
in	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
entrance	O
--	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
place	O
of	O
security	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
a	O
retreat	O
as	O
I	O
wanted	O
;	O
I	O
thought	O
was	O
a	O
convenience	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
really	O
rejoiced	O
at	O
the	O
discovery	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
,	O
without	O
any	O
delay	O
,	O
to	O
bring	O
some	O
of	O
those	O
things	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
most	O
anxious	O
about	O
to	O
this	O
place	O
:	O
particularly	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
bring	O
hither	O
my	O
magazine	O
of	O
powder	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
my	O
spare	O
arms	O
--	O
viz.	O
two	O
fowling-pieces	O
--	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
three	O
in	O
all	O
--	O
and	O
three	O
muskets	O
--	O
for	O
of	O
them	O
I	O
had	O
eight	O
in	O
all	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
kept	O
in	O
my	O
castle	O
only	O
five	O
,	O
which	O
stood	O
ready	O
mounted	O
like	O
pieces	O
of	O
cannon	O
on	O
my	O
outmost	O
fence	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
ready	O
also	O
to	O
take	O
out	O
upon	O
any	O
expedition	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
occasion	O
of	O
removing	O
my	O
ammunition	O
I	O
happened	O
to	O
open	O
the	O
barrel	O
of	O
powder	O
which	O
I	O
took	O
up	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
wet	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
water	O
had	O
penetrated	O
about	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
inches	O
into	O
the	O
powder	O
on	O
every	O
side	O
,	O
which	O
caking	O
and	O
growing	O
hard	O
,	O
had	O
preserved	O
the	O
inside	O
like	O
a	O
kernel	O
in	O
the	O
shell	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
near	O
sixty	O
pounds	O
of	O
very	O
good	O
powder	O
in	O
the	O
centre	O
of	O
the	O
cask	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
agreeable	O
discovery	O
to	O
me	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
carried	O
all	O
away	O
thither	O
,	O
never	O
keeping	O
above	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
pounds	O
of	O
powder	O
with	O
me	O
in	O
my	O
castle	O
,	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
a	O
surprise	O
of	O
any	O
kind	O
;	O
I	O
also	O
carried	O
thither	O
all	O
the	O
lead	O
I	O
had	O
left	O
for	O
bullets	O
.	O

I	O
fancied	O
myself	O
now	O
like	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
ancient	O
giants	O
who	O
were	O
said	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
caves	O
and	O
holes	O
in	O
the	O
rocks	O
,	O
where	O
none	O
could	O
come	O
at	O
them	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
persuaded	O
myself	O
,	O
while	O
I	O
was	O
here	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
five	O
hundred	O
savages	O
were	O
to	O
hunt	O
me	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
never	O
find	O
me	O
out	O
--	O
or	O
if	O
they	O
did	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
venture	O
to	O
attack	O
me	O
here	O
.	O

The	O
old	O
goat	O
whom	O
I	O
found	O
expiring	O
died	O
in	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
cave	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
after	O
I	O
made	O
this	O
discovery	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
found	O
it	O
much	O
easier	O
to	O
dig	O
a	O
great	O
hole	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
throw	O
him	O
in	O
and	O
cover	O
him	O
with	O
earth	O
,	O
than	O

--	O
WRECK	O
OF	O
A	O
SPANISH	O
SHIP	O
I	O
was	O
now	O
in	O
the	O
twenty-third	O
year	O
of	O
my	O
residence	O
in	O
this	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
so	O
naturalised	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
and	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
living	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
could	O
I	O
but	O
have	O
enjoyed	O
the	O
certainty	O
that	O
no	O
savages	O
would	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
to	O
disturb	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
content	O
to	O
have	O
capitulated	O
for	O
spending	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
my	O
time	O
there	O
,	O
even	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
moment	O
,	O
till	O
I	O
had	O
laid	O
me	O
down	O
and	O
died	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
old	O
goat	O
in	O
the	O
cave	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
also	O
arrived	O
to	O
some	O
little	O
diversions	O
and	O
amusements	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
the	O
time	O
pass	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
more	O
pleasantly	O
with	O
me	O
than	O
it	O
did	O
before	O
--	O
first	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
taught	O
my	O
Poll	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
noted	O
before	O
,	O
to	O
speak	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
did	O
it	O
so	O
familiarly	O
,	O
and	O
talked	O
so	O
articulately	O
and	O
plain	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
pleasant	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
lived	O
with	O
me	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
six-and-twenty	O
years	O
.	O

How	O
long	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
lived	O
afterwards	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
know	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
notion	O
in	O
the	O
Brazils	O
that	O
they	O
live	O
a	O
hundred	O
years	O
.	O

My	O
dog	O
was	O
a	O
pleasant	O
and	O
loving	O
companion	O
to	O
me	O
for	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
sixteen	O
years	O
of	O
my	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
died	O
of	O
mere	O
old	O
age	O
.	O

As	O
for	O
my	O
cats	O
,	O
they	O
multiplied	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
observed	O
,	O
to	O
that	O
degree	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
shoot	O
several	O
of	O
them	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
from	O
devouring	O
me	O
and	O
all	O
I	O
had	O
;	O
but	O
at	O
length	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
two	O
old	O
ones	O
I	O
brought	O
with	O
me	O
were	O
gone	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
some	O
time	O
continually	O
driving	O
them	O
from	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
letting	O
them	O
have	O
no	O
provision	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
they	O
all	O
ran	O
wild	O
into	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
except	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
favourites	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
kept	O
tame	O
,	O
and	O
whose	O
young	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
had	O
any	O
,	O
I	O
always	O
drowned	O
;	O
and	O
these	O
were	O
part	O
of	O
my	O
family	O
.	O

Besides	O
these	O
I	O
always	O
kept	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
household	O
kids	O
about	O
me	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
taught	O
to	O
feed	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
hand	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
two	O
more	O
parrots	O
,	O
which	O
talked	O
pretty	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
all	O
call	O
``	O
Robin	O
Crusoe	O
,	O
''	O
but	O
none	O
like	O
my	O
first	O
;	O
nor	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
did	O
I	O
take	O
the	O
pains	O
with	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
with	O
him	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
also	O
several	O
tame	O
sea-fowls	O
,	O
whose	O
name	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
caught	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
cut	O
their	O
wings	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
little	O
stakes	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
planted	O
before	O
my	O
castle-wall	O
being	O
now	O
grown	O
up	O
to	O
a	O
good	O
thick	O
grove	O
,	O
these	O
fowls	O
all	O
lived	O
among	O
these	O
low	O
trees	O
,	O
and	O
bred	O
there	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
very	O
agreeable	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
above	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
well	O
contented	O
with	O
the	O
life	O
I	O
led	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
secured	O
from	O
the	O
dread	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
was	O
otherwise	O
directed	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
amiss	O
for	O
all	O
people	O
who	O
shall	O
meet	O
with	O
my	O
story	O
to	O
make	O
this	O
just	O
observation	O
from	O
it	O
:	O
How	O
frequently	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
our	O
lives	O
,	O
the	O
evil	O
which	O
in	O
itself	O
we	O
seek	O
most	O
to	O
shun	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
are	O
fallen	O
into	O
,	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
dreadful	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
is	O
oftentimes	O
the	O
very	O
means	O
or	O
door	O
of	O
our	O
deliverance	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
alone	O
we	O
can	O
be	O
raised	O
again	O
from	O
the	O
affliction	O
we	O
are	O
fallen	O
into	O
.	O

I	O
could	O
give	O
many	O
examples	O
of	O
this	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
my	O
unaccountable	O
life	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
nothing	O
was	O
it	O
more	O
particularly	O
remarkable	O
than	O
in	O
the	O
circumstances	O
of	O
my	O
last	O
years	O
of	O
solitary	O
residence	O
in	O
this	O
island	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
now	O
the	O
month	O
of	O
December	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
above	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
twenty-third	O
year	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
,	O
being	O
the	O
southern	O
solstice	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
winter	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
call	O
it	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
was	O
the	O
particular	O
time	O
of	O
my	O
harvest	O
,	O
and	O
required	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
pretty	O
much	O
abroad	O
in	O
the	O
fields	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
going	O
out	O
early	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
even	O
before	O
it	O
was	O
thorough	O
daylight	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
surprised	O
with	O
seeing	O
a	O
light	O
of	O
some	O
fire	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
from	O
me	O
of	O
about	O
two	O
miles	O
,	O
toward	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
where	O
I	O
had	O
observed	O
some	O
savages	O
had	O
been	O
,	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
to	O
my	O
great	O
affliction	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
on	O
my	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
indeed	O
terribly	O
surprised	O
at	O
the	O
sight	O
,	O
and	O
stopped	O
short	O
within	O
my	O
grove	O
,	O
not	O
daring	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
,	O
lest	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
surprised	O
;	O
and	O
yet	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
more	O
peace	O
within	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
apprehensions	O
I	O
had	O
that	O
if	O
these	O
savages	O
,	O
in	O
rambling	O
over	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
should	O
find	O
my	O
corn	O
standing	O
or	O
cut	O
,	O
or	O
any	O
of	O
my	O
works	O
or	O
improvements	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
immediately	O
conclude	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
then	O
never	O
rest	O
till	O
they	O
had	O
found	O
me	O
out	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
extremity	O
I	O
went	O
back	O
directly	O
to	O
my	O
castle	O
,	O
pulled	O
up	O
the	O
ladder	O
after	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
all	O
things	O
without	O
look	O
as	O
wild	O
and	O
natural	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
.	O

Then	O
I	O
prepared	O
myself	O
within	O
,	O
putting	O
myself	O
in	O
a	O
posture	O
of	O
defence	O
.	O

I	O
loaded	O
all	O
my	O
cannon	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
called	O
them	O
--	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
my	O
muskets	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
mounted	O
upon	O
my	O
new	O
fortification	O
--	O
and	O
all	O
my	O
pistols	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
to	O
defend	O
myself	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
gasp	O
--	O
not	O
forgetting	O
seriously	O
to	O
commend	O
myself	O
to	O
the	O
Divine	O
protection	O
,	O
and	O
earnestly	O
to	O
pray	O
to	O
God	O
to	O
deliver	O
me	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
the	O
barbarians	O
.	O

I	O
continued	O
in	O
this	O
posture	O
about	O
two	O
hours	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
impatient	O
for	O
intelligence	O
abroad	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
spies	O
to	O
send	O
out	O
.	O

After	O
sitting	O
a	O
while	O
longer	O
,	O
and	O
musing	O
what	O
I	O
should	O
do	O
in	O
this	O
case	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
bear	O
sitting	O
in	O
ignorance	O
longer	O
;	O
so	O
setting	O
up	O
my	O
ladder	O
to	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
,	O
where	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
flat	O
place	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
observed	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
pulling	O
the	O
ladder	O
after	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
set	O
it	O
up	O
again	O
and	O
mounted	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
,	O
and	O
pulling	O
out	O
my	O
perspective	O
glass	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
taken	O
on	O
purpose	O
,	O
I	O
laid	O
me	O
down	O
flat	O
on	O
my	O
belly	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
the	O
place	O
.	O

I	O
presently	O
found	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
nine	O
naked	O
savages	O
sitting	O
round	O
a	O
small	O
fire	O
they	O
had	O
made	O
,	O
not	O
to	O
warm	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
need	O
of	O
that	O
,	O
the	O
weather	O
being	O
extremely	O
hot	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
supposed	O
,	O
to	O
dress	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
barbarous	O
diet	O
of	O
human	O
flesh	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
brought	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
whether	O
alive	O
or	O
dead	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
two	O
canoes	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
hauled	O
up	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
then	O
ebb	O
of	O
tide	O
,	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
the	O
return	O
of	O
the	O
flood	O
to	O
go	O
away	O
again	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
not	O
easy	O
to	O
imagine	O
what	O
confusion	O
this	O
sight	O
put	O
me	O
into	O
,	O
especially	O
seeing	O
them	O
come	O
on	O
my	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
near	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
I	O
considered	O
their	O
coming	O
must	O
be	O
always	O
with	O
the	O
current	O
of	O
the	O
ebb	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
afterwards	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
sedate	O
in	O
my	O
mind	O
,	O
being	O
satisfied	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
go	O
abroad	O
with	O
safety	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
the	O
flood	O
of	O
tide	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
on	O
shore	O
before	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
made	O
this	O
observation	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
abroad	O
about	O
my	O
harvest	O
work	O
with	O
the	O
more	O
composure	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
expected	O
,	O
so	O
it	O
proved	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
tide	O
made	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
I	O
saw	O
them	O
all	O
take	O
boat	O
and	O
row	O
-LRB-	O
or	O
paddle	O
as	O
we	O
call	O
it	O
-RRB-	O
away	O
.	O

I	O
should	O
have	O
observed	O
,	O
that	O
for	O
an	O
hour	O
or	O
more	O
before	O
they	O
went	O
off	O
they	O
were	O
dancing	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
could	O
easily	O
discern	O
their	O
postures	O
and	O
gestures	O
by	O
my	O
glass	O
.	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
perceive	O
,	O
by	O
my	O
nicest	O
observation	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
stark	O
naked	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
not	O
the	O
least	O
covering	O
upon	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
whether	O
they	O
were	O
men	O
or	O
women	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
distinguish	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
saw	O
them	O
shipped	O
and	O
gone	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
two	O
guns	O
upon	O
my	O
shoulders	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
pistols	O
in	O
my	O
girdle	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
great	O
sword	O
by	O
my	O
side	O
without	O
a	O
scabbard	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
speed	O
I	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
make	O
went	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
hill	O
where	O
I	O
had	O
discovered	O
the	O
first	O
appearance	O
of	O
all	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
got	O
thither	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
not	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
two	O
hours	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
go	O
quickly	O
,	O
being	O
so	O
loaded	O
with	O
arms	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
I	O
perceived	O
there	O
had	O
been	O
three	O
canoes	O
more	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
at	O
that	O
place	O
;	O
and	O
looking	O
out	O
farther	O
,	O
I	O
saw	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
at	O
sea	O
together	O
,	O
making	O
over	O
for	O
the	O
main	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
dreadful	O
sight	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
especially	O
as	O
,	O
going	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
see	O
the	O
marks	O
of	O
horror	O
which	O
the	O
dismal	O
work	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
about	O
had	O
left	O
behind	O

by	O
those	O

with	O

I	O
was	O
so	O
filled	O
with	O
indignation	O
at	O
the	O
sight	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
now	O
began	O
to	O
premeditate	O
the	O
destruction	O
of	O
the	O
next	O
that	O
I	O
saw	O
there	O
,	O
let	O
them	O
be	O
whom	O
or	O
how	O
many	O
soever	O
.	O

It	O
seemed	O
evident	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
the	O
visits	O
which	O
they	O
made	O
thus	O
to	O
this	O
island	O
were	O
not	O
very	O
frequent	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
above	O
fifteen	O
months	O
before	O
any	O
more	O
of	O
them	O
came	O
on	O
shore	O
there	O
again	O
--	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
I	O
neither	O
saw	O
them	O
nor	O
any	O
footsteps	O
or	O
signals	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
all	O
that	O
time	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
rainy	O
seasons	O
,	O
then	O
they	O
are	O
sure	O
not	O
to	O
come	O
abroad	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
not	O
so	O
far	O
.	O

Yet	O
all	O
this	O
while	O
I	O
lived	O
uncomfortably	O
,	O
by	O
reason	O
of	O
the	O
constant	O
apprehensions	O
of	O
their	O
coming	O
upon	O
me	O
by	O
surprise	O
:	O
from	O
whence	O
I	O
observe	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
expectation	O
of	O
evil	O
is	O
more	O
bitter	O
than	O
the	O
suffering	O
,	O
especially	O
if	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
room	O
to	O
shake	O
off	O
that	O
expectation	O
or	O
those	O
apprehensions	O
.	O

During	O
all	O
this	O
time	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
murdering	O
humour	O
,	O
and	O
spent	O
most	O
of	O
my	O
hours	O
,	O
which	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
better	O
employed	O
,	O
in	O
contriving	O
how	O
to	O
circumvent	O
and	O
fall	O
upon	O
them	O
the	O
very	O
next	O
time	O
I	O
should	O
see	O
them	O
--	O
especially	O
if	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
divided	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
the	O
last	O
time	O
,	O
into	O
two	O
parties	O
;	O
nor	O
did	O
I	O
consider	O
at	O
all	O
that	O
if	O
I	O
killed	O
one	O
party	O
--	O
suppose	O
ten	O
or	O
a	O
dozen	O
--	O
I	O
was	O
still	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
or	O
week	O
,	O
or	O
month	O
,	O
to	O
kill	O
another	O

and	O
so	O
another	O
,	O
even	O
_	O
ad	O

_	O
,	O
till	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
,	O
at	O
length	O
,	O
no	O
less	O
a	O
murderer	O
than	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
being	O
man-eaters	O
--	O
and	O
perhaps	O
much	O
more	O
so	O
.	O

I	O
spent	O
my	O
days	O
now	O
in	O
great	O
perplexity	O
and	O
anxiety	O
of	O
mind	O
,	O
expecting	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
one	O
day	O
or	O
other	O
fall	O
into	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
these	O
merciless	O
creatures	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
I	O
did	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
venture	O
abroad	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
without	O
looking	O
around	O
me	O
with	O
the	O
greatest	O
care	O
and	O
caution	O
imaginable	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
I	O
found	O
,	O
to	O
my	O
great	O
comfort	O
,	O
how	O
happy	O
it	O
was	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
provided	O
a	O
tame	O
flock	O
or	O
herd	O
of	O
goats	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
durst	O
not	O
upon	O
any	O
account	O
fire	O
my	O
gun	O
,	O
especially	O
near	O
that	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
where	O
they	O
usually	O
came	O
,	O
lest	O
I	O
should	O
alarm	O
the	O
savages	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
fled	O
from	O
me	O
now	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
sure	O
to	O
have	O
them	O
come	O
again	O
with	O
perhaps	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
hundred	O
canoes	O
with	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
knew	O
what	O
to	O
expect	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
wore	O
out	O
a	O
year	O
and	O
three	O
months	O
more	O
before	O
I	O
ever	O
saw	O
any	O
more	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
found	O
them	O
again	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
shall	O
soon	O
observe	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
true	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
there	O
once	O
or	O
twice	O
;	O
but	O
either	O
they	O
made	O
no	O
stay	O
,	O
or	O
at	O
least	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
see	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
month	O
of	O
May	O
,	O
as	O
near	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
calculate	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
my	O
four-and-twentieth	O
year	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
very	O
strange	O
encounter	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
of	O
which	O
in	O
its	O
place	O

The	O
perturbation	O
of	O
my	O
mind	O
during	O
this	O
fifteen	O
or	O
sixteen	O
months	O
'	O
interval	O
was	O
very	O
great	O
;	O
I	O
slept	O
unquietly	O
,	O
dreamed	O
always	O
frightful	O
dreams	O
,	O
and	O
often	O
started	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
sleep	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
day	O
great	O
troubles	O
overwhelmed	O
my	O
mind	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
I	O
dreamed	O
often	O
of	O
killing	O
the	O
savages	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
reasons	O
why	O
I	O
might	O
justify	O
doing	O
it	O
.	O

But	O
to	O
waive	O
all	O
this	O
for	O
a	O

It	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
May	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
sixteenth	O
day	O
,	O
I	O
think	O

as	O
well	O
as	O
my	O
poor	O
wooden	O
calendar	O
would	O
reckon	O

for	O
I	O

upon	O

I	O
say	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
sixteenth	O
of	O
May	O
that	O
it	O
blew	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
storm	O
of	O
wind	O
all	O
day	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O

thunder	O
,	O
and	O
;	O
a	O
very	O
foul	O
night	O
it	O
was	O
after	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
was	O
the	O
particular	O
occasion	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
reading	O
in	O
the	O
Bible	O
,	O
and	O
taken	O
up	O
with	O
very	O
serious	O
thoughts	O
about	O
my	O
present	O
condition	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
surprised	O
with	O
the	O
noise	O
of	O
a	O
gun	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
fired	O
at	O
sea	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
a	O
surprise	O
quite	O
of	O
a	O
different	O
nature	O
from	O
any	O
I	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
before	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
notions	O
this	O
put	O
into	O
my	O
thoughts	O
were	O
quite	O
of	O
another	O
kind	O
.	O

I	O
started	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
greatest	O
haste	O
imaginable	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
trice	O
,	O
clapped	O
my	O
ladder	O
to	O
the	O
middle	O
place	O
of	O
the	O
rock	O
,	O
and	O
pulled	O
it	O
after	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
mounting	O
it	O
the	O
second	O
time	O
,	O
got	O
to	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
the	O
very	O
moment	O
that	O
a	O
flash	O
of	O
fire	O
bid	O
me	O
listen	O
for	O
a	O
second	O
gun	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
accordingly	O
,	O
in	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
minute	O
I	O
heard	O
;	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
sound	O
,	O
knew	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
from	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
driven	O
down	O
the	O
current	O
in	O
my	O
boat	O
.	O

I	O
immediately	O
considered	O
that	O
this	O
must	O
be	O
some	O
ship	O
in	O
distress	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
some	O
comrade	O
,	O
or	O
some	O
other	O
ship	O
in	O
company	O
,	O
and	O
fired	O
these	O
for	O
signals	O
of	O
distress	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
obtain	O
help	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
presence	O
of	O
mind	O
at	O
that	O
minute	O
to	O
think	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
help	O
them	O
,	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
help	O
me	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
brought	O
together	O
all	O
the	O
dry	O
wood	O
I	O
could	O
get	O
at	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
making	O
a	O
good	O
handsome	O
pile	O
,	O
I	O
set	O
it	O
on	O
fire	O
upon	O
the	O
hill	O
.	O

The	O
wood	O
was	O
dry	O
,	O
and	O
blazed	O
freely	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
wind	O
blew	O
very	O
hard	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
burned	O
fairly	O
out	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
certain	O
,	O
if	O
there	O
was	O
any	O
such	O
thing	O
as	O
a	O
ship	O
,	O
they	O
must	O
needs	O
see	O
it	O
.	O

And	O
no	O
doubt	O
they	O
did	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
ever	O
my	O
fire	O
blazed	O
up	O
,	O
I	O
heard	O
another	O
gun	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
that	O
several	O
others	O
,	O
all	O
from	O
the	O
same	O
quarter	O
.	O

I	O
plied	O
my	O
fire	O
all	O
night	O
long	O
,	O
till	O
daybreak	O
:	O
and	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
broad	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
air	O
cleared	O
up	O
,	O
I	O
saw	O
something	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
at	O
sea	O
,	O
full	O
east	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
whether	O
a	O
sail	O
or	O
a	O
hull	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
distinguish	O
--	O
no	O
,	O
not	O
with	O
my	O
glass	O
:	O
the	O
distance	O
was	O
so	O
great	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
weather	O
still	O
something	O
hazy	O
also	O
;	O
at	O
least	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
out	O
at	O
sea	O
.	O

I	O
looked	O
frequently	O
at	O
it	O
all	O
that	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
perceived	O
that	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
move	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
presently	O
concluded	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
ship	O
at	O
anchor	O
;	O
and	O
being	O
eager	O
,	O
you	O
may	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
satisfied	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
my	O
gun	O
in	O
my	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
ran	O
towards	O
the	O
south	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
to	O
the	O
rocks	O
where	O
I	O
had	O
formerly	O
been	O
carried	O
away	O
by	O
the	O
current	O
;	O
and	O
getting	O
up	O
there	O
,	O
the	O
weather	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
being	O
perfectly	O
clear	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
plainly	O
see	O
,	O
to	O
my	O
great	O
sorrow	O
,	O
the	O
wreck	O
of	O
a	O
ship	O
,	O
cast	O
away	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
upon	O
those	O
concealed	O
rocks	O
which	O
I	O
found	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
out	O
in	O
my	O
boat	O
;	O
and	O
which	O
rocks	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
checked	O
the	O
violence	O
of	O
the	O
stream	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
counter-stream	O
,	O
or	O
eddy	O
,	O
were	O
the	O
occasion	O
of	O
my	O
recovering	O
from	O
the	O
most	O
desperate	O
,	O
hopeless	O
condition	O
that	O
ever	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
in	O
all	O
my	O
life	O
.	O

Thus	O
,	O
what	O
is	O
one	O
man	O
's	O
safety	O
is	O
another	O
man	O
's	O
destruction	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
seems	O
these	O
men	O
,	O
whoever	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
being	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
knowledge	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
rocks	O
being	O
wholly	O
under	O

upon	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
night	O

the	O

Had	O
they	O
seen	O
the	O
island	O

as	O
I	O
must	O
necessarily	O
suppose	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
,	O
they	O
must	O

as	O
I	O
thought	O

have	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
have	O
saved	O
themselves	O
on	O
shore	O
by	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
their	O
boat	O
;	O
but	O
their	O
firing	O
off	O
guns	O
for	O

especially	O
when	O
they	O
saw	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
imagined	O
,	O
my	O
fire	O
,	O
filled	O
me	O
with	O
many	O
thoughts	O
.	O

First	O
,	O
I	O
imagined	O
that	O
upon	O
seeing	O
my	O
light	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
put	O
themselves	O
into	O
their	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
shore	O
:	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
sea	O
running	O
very	O
high	O
,	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
cast	O
away	O
.	O

Other	O
times	O
I	O
imagined	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
lost	O
their	O
boat	O
before	O
,	O
as	O
might	O
be	O
the	O
case	O
many	O
ways	O
;	O
particularly	O
by	O
the	O
breaking	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
upon	O
their	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
many	O
times	O
obliged	O
men	O
to	O
stave	O
,	O
or	O
take	O
in	O
pieces	O
,	O
their	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
to	O
throw	O
it	O
overboard	O
with	O
their	O
own	O
hands	O
.	O

Other	O
times	O
I	O
imagined	O
they	O
had	O
some	O
other	O
ship	O
or	O
ships	O
in	O
company	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
upon	O
the	O
signals	O
of	O
distress	O
they	O
made	O
,	O
had	O
taken	O
them	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
them	O
off	O
.	O

Other	O
times	O
I	O
fancied	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
gone	O
off	O
to	O
sea	O
in	O
their	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
hurried	O
away	O
by	O
the	O
current	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
formerly	O
in	O
,	O
were	O
carried	O
out	O
into	O
the	O

that	O

I	O
learned	O
here	O

that	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
rare	O
that	O
the	O

casts	O
us	O

any	O

any	O

for	O

and	O
may	O
see	O
others	O
in	O
worse	O
circumstances	O
than	O
our	O

Such	O
certainly	O
was	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
these	O

of	O
whom	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
so	O

nothing	O
could	O

to	O

it	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
knew	O

from	O

it	O
proceeded	O

it	O
was	O

the	O
effect	O

wishes	O

of	O
strong	O
ideas	O
formed	O

either	O

both	O

forbade	O

till	O
the	O
last	O
year	O
of	O
my	O
being	O
on	O
this	O
island	O

I	O
never	O
knew	O
whether	O
any	O
were	O
saved	O
out	O
of	O
that	O
ship	O
or	O
no	O
;	O
and	O
had	O
only	O
the	O
affliction	O
,	O
some	O
days	O
after	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
corpse	O
of	O
a	O
drowned	O
boy	O
come	O
on	O
shore	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O

was	O
next	O
the	O
shipwreck	O

He	O
had	O
no	O

but	O
nothing	O
to	O
direct	O
me	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
to	O
guess	O
what	O
nation	O
he	O
was	O
of	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
nothing	O
in	O
his	O
pockets	O
but	O
two	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
and	O
a	O
tobacco	O
pipe	O
--	O
the	O
last	O
was	O
to	O
me	O
of	O
ten	O
times	O
more	O
value	O
than	O
the	O
first	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
now	O
calm	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
mind	O
to	O
venture	O
out	O
in	O
my	O
boat	O
to	O
this	O
wreck	O
,	O
not	O
doubting	O

I	O
might	O
find	O
something	O
on	O

that	O
might	O
be	O
useful	O
to	O
me	O

But	O
that	O
did	O
not	O
altogether	O
press	O
me	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
the	O
possibility	O
that	O
there	O
might	O
be	O
yet	O
some	O
living	O
creature	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
whose	O
life	O
I	O
might	O
not	O

might	O
,	O
by	O
saving	O
that	O
life	O
,	O
comfort	O
my	O
own	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
degree	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
thought	O
clung	O
so	O
to	O
my	O
heart	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
quiet	O
night	O
or	O
day	O

but	O
I	O
must	O
venture	O
out	O
in	O
my	O

on	O

this	O
wreck	O
;	O
and	O
committing	O
the	O
rest	O
to	O
God	O
's	O
providence	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
the	O
impression	O
was	O
so	O
strong	O
upon	O
my	O
mind	O
that	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
resisted	O
--	O
that	O
it	O
must	O
come	O
from	O
some	O
invisible	O
direction	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
wanting	O
to	O
myself	O
if	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
go	O
.	O

Under	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
this	O
impression	O
,	O
I	O
hastened	O
back	O
to	O
my	O
castle	O
,	O
prepared	O
everything	O
for	O
my	O
voyage	O
,	O
took	O
a	O
quantity	O
of	O
bread	O
,	O
a	O
great	O
pot	O
of	O
fresh	O
water	O
,	O
a	O
compass	O
to	O
steer	O
by	O
,	O
a	O
bottle	O
of	O
rum	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
still	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
that	O
left	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
basket	O
of	O
raisins	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
,	O
loading	O
myself	O
with	O
everything	O
necessary	O
.	O

I	O
went	O
down	O
to	O
my	O
boat	O
,	O
got	O
the	O
water	O
out	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
got	O
her	O
afloat	O

loaded	O
all	O
my	O

in	O
her	O

and	O
then	O
went	O
home	O
again	O
for	O
more	O

My	O
second	O
cargo	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
bag	O
of	O
rice	O

the	O
umbrella	O
to	O
set	O
up	O
over	O
my	O

for	O
a	O
shade	O
,	O
another	O
large	O
pot	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
two	O
dozen	O
of	O
small	O
loaves	O
,	O
or	O
barley	O
cakes	O
,	O
more	O
than	O
before	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
bottle	O
of	O
goat	O
's	O
milk	O
and	O
a	O
cheese	O
;	O
all	O
which	O
with	O
great	O
labour	O
and	O
sweat	O
I	O
carried	O
to	O
my	O
boat	O
;	O
and	O
praying	O
to	O
God	O
to	O
direct	O
my	O
voyage	O
,	O
I	O
put	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
rowing	O
or	O
paddling	O
the	O
canoe	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
came	O
at	O
last	O
to	O
the	O
utmost	O
point	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
on	O
the	O
north-east	O
side	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
I	O
was	O
to	O
launch	O
out	O
into	O
the	O
ocean	O
,	O
and	O
either	O
to	O
venture	O
or	O
not	O
to	O
venture	O
.	O

I	O
looked	O
on	O
the	O
rapid	O
currents	O
which	O
ran	O
constantly	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
were	O
very	O
terrible	O
to	O
me	O
from	O
the	O
remembrance	O
of	O
the	O
hazard	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
heart	O
began	O
to	O
fail	O
me	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
foresaw	O
that	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
driven	O
into	O
either	O
of	O
those	O
currents	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
carried	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
out	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
reach	O
or	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
then	O
,	O
as	O
my	O
boat	O
was	O
but	O
small	O
,	O
if	O
any	O
little	O
gale	O
of	O
wind	O
should	O
rise	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
inevitably	O
lost	O
.	O

These	O
thoughts	O
so	O
oppressed	O
my	O
mind	O
that	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
give	O
over	O
my	O
enterprise	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
hauled	O
my	O
boat	O
into	O
a	O
little	O
creek	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
I	O
stepped	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
sat	O
down	O
upon	O
a	O
rising	O
bit	O
of	O
ground	O
,	O
very	O
pensive	O
and	O
anxious	O
,	O
between	O
fear	O
and	O
desire	O
,	O
about	O
my	O
voyage	O
;	O
when	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
musing	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
perceive	O
that	O
the	O
tide	O
was	O
turned	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
flood	O
come	O
on	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
my	O
going	O
was	O
impracticable	O
for	O
so	O
many	O
hours	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
,	O
presently	O
it	O
occurred	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
go	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
highest	O
piece	O
of	O
ground	O
I	O
could	O
find	O
,	O
and	O
observe	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
how	O
the	O
sets	O
of	O
the	O
tide	O
or	O
currents	O
lay	O
when	O
the	O
flood	O
came	O
in	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
judge	O
whether	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
driven	O
one	O
way	O
out	O
,	O
I	O
might	O
not	O
expect	O
to	O
be	O
driven	O
another	O
way	O
home	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
rapidity	O
of	O
the	O
currents	O
.	O

This	O
thought	O
was	O
no	O
sooner	O
in	O
my	O
head	O
than	O
I	O
cast	O
my	O
eye	O
upon	O
a	O
little	O
hill	O
which	O
sufficiently	O
overlooked	O
the	O
sea	O
both	O
ways	O
,	O
and	O
from	O
whence	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
clear	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
currents	O
or	O
sets	O
of	O
the	O
tide	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
way	O
I	O
was	O
to	O
guide	O
myself	O
in	O
my	O
return	O
.	O

Here	O
I	O
found	O
,	O
that	O
as	O
the	O
current	O
of	O
ebb	O
set	O
out	O
close	O
by	O
the	O
south	O
point	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
so	O
the	O
current	O
of	O
the	O
flood	O
set	O
in	O
close	O
by	O
the	O
shore	O
of	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
but	O
to	O
keep	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
in	O
my	O
return	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
should	O
do	O
well	O
enough	O
.	O

Encouraged	O
by	O
this	O
observation	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
to	O
set	O
out	O
with	O
the	O
first	O
of	O
the	O
tide	O
;	O
and	O
reposing	O
myself	O
for	O
the	O
night	O
in	O
my	O

under	O
the	O
watch-coat	O
I	O
mentioned	O

I	O
launched	O
out	O

I	O
first	O
made	O
a	O
little	O
out	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
full	O
north	O
,	O
till	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
feel	O
the	O
benefit	O
of	O
the	O
current	O
,	O
which	O
set	O
eastward	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
carried	O
me	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
rate	O
;	O
and	O
yet	O
did	O
not	O
so	O
hurry	O
me	O
as	O
the	O
current	O
on	O
the	O
south	O
side	O
had	O
done	O
before	O
,	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
take	O
from	O
me	O
all	O
government	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
;	O
but	O
having	O
a	O
strong	O
steerage	O
with	O
my	O
paddle	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
rate	O
directly	O
for	O
the	O
wreck	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
two	O
hours	O
I	O
came	O
up	O
to	O
it	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
dismal	O
sight	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
;	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
by	O
its	O
building	O
was	O
Spanish	O
,	O
stuck	O
fast	O
,	O
jammed	O
in	O
between	O
two	O
rocks	O
.	O

All	O
the	O
stern	O
and	O
quarter	O
of	O
her	O
were	O
beaten	O
to	O
pieces	O
by	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
her	O
forecastle	O
,	O
which	O
stuck	O
in	O
the	O
rocks	O
,	O
had	O
run	O
on	O
with	O
great	O
violence	O
,	O
her	O
mainmast	O
and	O
foremast	O
were	O
brought	O
by	O
the	O
board	O
--	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
broken	O
short	O
off	O
;	O
but	O
her	O
bowsprit	O
was	O
sound	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
head	O
and	O
bow	O
appeared	O
firm	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
came	O
close	O
to	O
her	O
,	O
a	O
dog	O
appeared	O
upon	O
her	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
seeing	O
me	O
coming	O
,	O
yelped	O
and	O
cried	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
called	O
him	O
,	O
jumped	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
me	O
.	O

I	O
took	O
him	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
but	O
found	O
him	O
almost	O
dead	O
with	O
hunger	O
and	O
thirst	O
.	O

I	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
cake	O
of	O
my	O
bread	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
devoured	O
it	O
like	O
a	O
ravenous	O
wolf	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
starving	O
a	O
fortnight	O
in	O
the	O
snow	O
;	O
I	O
then	O
gave	O
the	O
poor	O
creature	O
some	O
fresh	O
water	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
let	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
burst	O
himself	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
I	O
went	O
on	O
board	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
first	O
sight	O
I	O
met	O
with	O
was	O
two	O
men	O
drowned	O
in	O
the	O
cook-room	O
,	O
or	O
forecastle	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
with	O
their	O
arms	O
fast	O
about	O
one	O
another	O
.	O

I	O
concluded	O
,	O
as	O
is	O
indeed	O
probable	O
,	O
that	O
when	O
the	O
ship	O
struck	O
,	O
it	O
being	O
in	O
a	O
storm	O
,	O
the	O
sea	O
broke	O
so	O
high	O
and	O
so	O
continually	O
over	O
her	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
men	O
were	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
bear	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
strangled	O
with	O
the	O
constant	O
rushing	O
in	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
under	O
water	O
.	O

Besides	O
the	O
dog	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
nothing	O
left	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
that	O
had	O
life	O
;	O
nor	O
any	O
goods	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
see	O
,	O
but	O
what	O
were	O
spoiled	O
by	O
the	O
water	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
some	O
casks	O
of	O
liquor	O
,	O
whether	O
wine	O
or	O
brandy	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
,	O
which	O
lay	O
lower	O
in	O
the	O
hold	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
,	O
the	O
water	O
being	O
ebbed	O
out	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
see	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
too	O
big	O
to	O
meddle	O
with	O
.	O

I	O
saw	O
several	O
chests	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
believe	O
belonged	O
to	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
seamen	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
got	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
without	O
examining	O
what	O
was	O
in	O
them	O
.	O

Had	O
the	O
stern	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
been	O
fixed	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
forepart	O
broken	O
off	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
persuaded	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
made	O
a	O
good	O
voyage	O
;	O
for	O
by	O
what	O
I	O
found	O
in	O
those	O
two	O
chests	O
I	O
had	O
room	O
to	O
suppose	O
the	O
ship	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
wealth	O
on	O
board	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
may	O
guess	O
from	O
the	O
course	O
she	O
steered	O
,	O
she	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
bound	O
from	O
Buenos	PNM
Ayres	PNM
,	O
or	O
the	O
Rio	PNM
de	PNM

Plata	PNM
,	O
in	O
the	O
south	O
part	O
of	O
America	PNM

the	O
Brazils	O
to	O
the	O
Havannah	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
Gulf	PNM
of	PNM
Mexico	PNM
,	O
and	O
so	O
perhaps	O
to	O
Spain	PNM
.	O

She	O
had	O
,	O
no	O
doubt	O
,	O
a	O
great	O
treasure	O
in	O
her	O
,	O
but	O
of	O
no	O
use	O
,	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
to	O
anybody	O
;	O
and	O
what	O
became	O
of	O
the	O
crew	O
I	O
then	O
knew	O
not	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
,	O
besides	O
these	O
chests	O
,	O
a	O
little	O
cask	O
full	O
of	O
liquor	O
,	O
of	O
about	O
twenty	O
gallons	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
got	O
into	O
my	O
boat	O
with	O
much	O
difficulty	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
several	O
muskets	O
in	O
the	O
cabin	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
powder-horn	O
,	O
with	O
about	O
four	O
pounds	O
of	O
powder	O
in	O
it	O
;	O
as	O
for	O
the	O
muskets	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
occasion	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
left	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
took	O
the	O
powder-horn	O
.	O

I	O
took	O
a	O
fire-shovel	O
and	O
tongs	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
wanted	O
extremely	O
,	O
as	O
also	O
two	O
little	O
brass	O
kettles	O
,	O
a	O
copper	O
pot	O
to	O
make	O
chocolate	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
gridiron	O
;	O
and	O
with	O
this	O
cargo	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
dog	O
,	O
I	O
came	O
away	O
,	O
the	O
tide	O
beginning	O
to	O
make	O
home	O
again	O
--	O
and	O
the	O
same	O
evening	O
,	O
about	O
an	O
hour	O
within	O
night	O
,	O
I	O
reached	O
the	O
island	O
again	O
,	O
weary	O
and	O
fatigued	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
degree	O
.	O

I	O
reposed	O
that	O
night	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
harbour	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
got	O
in	O
my	O
new	O
cave	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
carry	O
it	O
home	O
to	O
my	O
castle	O
.	O

After	O
refreshing	O
myself	O
,	O
I	O
got	O
all	O
my	O
cargo	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
examine	O
the	O
particulars	O
.	O

The	O
cask	O
of	O
liquor	O
I	O
found	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
rum	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
such	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
at	O
the	O
Brazils	PNM
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
good	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
open	O
the	O
chests	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
several	O
things	O
of	O
great	O
use	O
to	O
me	O
--	O
for	O
example	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
in	O
one	O
a	O
fine	O
case	O
of	O
bottles	O
,	O
of	O
an	O
extraordinary	O
kind	O
,	O
and	O
filled	O
with	O
cordial	O
waters	O
,	O
fine	O
and	O
very	O
good	O
;	O
the	O
bottles	O
held	O
about	O
three	O
pints	O
each	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
tipped	O
with	O
silver	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
two	O
pots	O
of	O
very	O
good	O
succades	O
,	O
or	O
sweetmeats	O
,	O
so	O
fastened	O
also	O
on	O
the	O
top	O
that	O
the	O
salt-water	O
had	O
not	O
hurt	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
two	O
more	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
water	O
had	O
spoiled	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
some	O
very	O
good	O
shirts	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
very	O
welcome	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
about	O
a	O
dozen	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
of	O
white	O
linen	O
handkerchiefs	O
and	O
coloured	O
neckcloths	O
;	O
the	O
former	O
were	O
also	O
very	O
welcome	O
,	O
being	O
exceedingly	O
refreshing	O
to	O
wipe	O
my	O
face	O
in	O
a	O
hot	O
day	O
.	O

Besides	O
this	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
till	O
in	O
the	O
chest	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
there	O
three	O
great	O
bags	O
of	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
,	O
which	O
held	O
about	O
eleven	O
hundred	O
pieces	O
in	O
all	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
wrapped	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
paper	O
,	O
six	O
doubloons	O
of	O
gold	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
small	O
bars	O
or	O
wedges	O
of	O
gold	O
;	O
I	O
suppose	O
they	O
might	O
all	O
weigh	O
near	O
a	O
pound	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
other	O
chest	O
were	O
some	O
clothes	O
,	O
but	O
of	O
little	O
value	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
circumstances	O
,	O
it	O
must	O
have	O
belonged	O
to	O
the	O
gunner	O
's	O
mate	O
;	O
though	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
powder	O
in	O
it	O

except	O
two	O
pounds	O
of	O
fine	O
glazed	O
powder	O

in	O
three	O
flasks	O

kept	O
,	O
I	O
suppose	O
,	O
for	O
charging	O
their	O
fowling-pieces	O
on	O
occasion	O
.	O

Upon	O
the	O
whole	O
,	O
I	O
got	O
very	O
little	O
by	O
this	O
voyage	O
that	O
was	O
of	O
any	O
use	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
for	O

as	O
to	O
the	O
money	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
manner	O
of	O
occasion	O
for	O
it	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
me	O
as	O
the	O
dirt	O
under	O
my	O
feet	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
given	O
it	O
all	O
for	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
pair	O
of	O
English	PNM
shoes	O
and	O
stockings	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
things	O
I	O
greatly	O
wanted	O
,	O
but	O
had	O
had	O
none	O
on	O
my	O
feet	O
for	O
many	O
years	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
got	O
two	O
pair	O
of	O
shoes	O
now	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
took	O
off	O
the	O
feet	O
of	O
two	O
drowned	O
men	O
whom	O
I	O
saw	O
in	O
the	O
wreck	O

and	O
I	O
found	O
two	O
pair	O
more	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
chests	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
very	O
welcome	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
like	O
our	O
English	O
shoes	O
,	O
either	O
for	O
ease	O
or	O
service	O
,	O
being	O
rather	O
what	O
we	O
call	O
pumps	O
than	O
shoes	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
in	O
this	O
seaman	O

about	O
fifty	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
,	O
in	O

no	O

supposed	O

which	O
seemed	O
to	O

Well	O

I	O
lugged	O
this	O

home	O
to	O
my	O

laid	O
it	O
up	O

it	O

jumped	O
away	O

ran	O
for	O

smiling	O
upon	O

that	O

I	O
waked	O
with	O
this	O

was	O
under	O
such	O

impressions	O
of	O
joy	O
at	O
the	O
prospect	O
of	O
my	O

in	O
my	O

that	O

I	O
felt	O
upon	O

finding	O
that	O

was	O
no	O

than	O
a	O
dream	O

were	O
equally	O
extravagant	O
the	O

and	O
threw	O
me	O
into	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
dejection	O
of	O
spirits	O

Upon	O
this	O
,	O

I	O
made	O
this	O
conclusion	O
:	O
that	O
my	O
only	O
way	O
to	O
go	O
about	O
to	O
attempt	O
an	O
escape	O
was	O

to	O
endeavour	O

get	O
a	O

into	O
my	O
possession	O
:	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O

it	O
should	O
be	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
prisoners	O

whom	O
they	O
had	O

to	O
be	O
eaten	O

and	O
should	O
bring	O
hither	O
to	O
kill	O

But	O
these	O
thoughts	O
still	O
were	O
attended	O
with	O
this	O
difficulty	O
:	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O
effect	O
this	O
without	O
attacking	O
a	O
whole	O
caravan	O
of	O
them	O

this	O
was	O

on	O
the	O

the	O

my	O

that	O

were	O
enemies	O
to	O
my	O

and	O
would	O
devour	O
me	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
;	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
self-preservation	O

in	O
the	O

to	O

myself	O
from	O
this	O

the	O

My	O

to	O

how	O
to	O
do	O
it	O

and	O
this	O

indeed	O

was	O
very	O

as	O
I	O
could	O
pitch	O
upon	O
no	O

so	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
put	O
myself	O
upon	O
the	O

to	O
see	O
them	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
on	O

leave	O

With	O
these	O
resolutions	O
in	O
my	O

I	O
set	O
myself	O
upon	O
the	O
scout	O
as	O
often	O
as	O
possible	O

and	O
indeed	O
so	O
often	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
heartily	O

for	O
it	O
was	O
above	O
a	O

a	O
half	O
that	O
I	O
waited	O

for	O

the	O

more	O
eager	O
I	O
was	O
for	O

:	O
in	O
a	O

I	O
was	O
not	O
at	O

so	O
careful	O
to	O

I	O
was	O

no	O

five	O

landed	O

out	O

my	O

The	O

broke	O
all	O
my	O

that	O

came	O
four	O

sometimes	O

in	O

lay	O
still	O
in	O
my	O

I	O
set	O

a	O
fire	O
kindled	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
meat	O
dressed	O
.	O

How	O
they	O
had	O
cooked	O
it	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
,	O
or	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
dancing	O
,	O
in	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
how	O
many	O
barbarous	O
gestures	O
and	O
figures	O
,	O
their	O
own	O
way	O
,	O
round	O
the	O
fire	O
.	O

While	O
I	O
was	O
thus	O
looking	O
on	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
perceived	O
,	O
by	O
my	O
perspective	O
,	O
two	O
miserable	O
wretches	O
dragged	O
from	O
the	O
boats	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
laid	O
by	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
now	O
brought	O
out	O
for	O
the	O
slaughter	O
.	O

I	O
perceived	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
immediately	O
fall	O
;	O
being	O
knocked	O
down	O
,	O
I	O
suppose	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
club	O
or	O
wooden	O
sword	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
was	O
their	O
way	O
;	O
and	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
others	O
were	O
at	O
work	O
immediately	O
,	O
cutting	O
him	O
open	O
for	O
their	O
cookery	O
,	O
while	O
the	O
other	O
victim	O
was	O
left	O
standing	O
by	O
himself	O
,	O
till	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
ready	O
for	O
him	O
.	O

In	O
that	O
very	O
moment	O
this	O
poor	O
wretch	O
,	O
seeing	O
himself	O
a	O
little	O
at	O
liberty	O
and	O
unbound	O
,	O
Nature	O
inspired	O
him	O
with	O
hopes	O
of	O
life	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
started	O
away	O
from	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
ran	O
with	O
incredible	O
swiftness	O
along	O
the	O
sands	O
,	O
directly	O
towards	O
me	O
;	O
I	O
mean	O
towards	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
coast	O
where	O
my	O
habitation	O
was	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
dreadfully	O
frightened	O
,	O
I	O
must	O
acknowledge	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
perceived	O
him	O
run	O
my	O
way	O
;	O
and	O
especially	O
when	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
I	O
saw	O
him	O
pursued	O
by	O
the	O
whole	O
body	O
:	O
and	O
now	O
I	O
expected	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
my	O
dream	O
was	O
coming	O
to	O
pass	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
certainly	O
take	O
shelter	O
in	O
my	O
grove	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
depend	O
,	O
by	O
any	O
means	O
,	O
upon	O
my	O
dream	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
other	O
savages	O
would	O
not	O
pursue	O
him	O
thither	O
and	O
find	O
him	O
there	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
kept	O
my	O
station	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
spirits	O
began	O
to	O
recover	O
when	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
above	O
three	O
men	O
that	O
followed	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
still	O
more	O
was	O
I	O
encouraged	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
he	O
outstripped	O
them	O
exceedingly	O
in	O
running	O
,	O
and	O
gained	O
ground	O
on	O
them	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
could	O
but	O
hold	O
out	O
for	O
half-an-hour	O
,	O
I	O
saw	O
easily	O
he	O
would	O
fairly	O
get	O
away	O
from	O
them	O
all	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
between	O
them	O
and	O
my	O
castle	O
the	O
creek	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
mentioned	O
often	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
part	O
of	O
my	O
story	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
landed	O
my	O
cargoes	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
I	O
saw	O
plainly	O
he	O
must	O
necessarily	O
swim	O
over	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
poor	O
wretch	O
would	O
be	O
taken	O
there	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
the	O
savage	O
escaping	O
came	O
thither	O
,	O
he	O
made	O
nothing	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
tide	O
was	O
then	O
up	O
;	O
but	O
plunging	O
in	O
,	O
swam	O
through	O
in	O
about	O
thirty	O
strokes	O
,	O
or	O
thereabouts	O
,	O
landed	O
,	O
and	O
ran	O
with	O
exceeding	O
strength	O
and	O
swiftness	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
three	O
persons	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
creek	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
could	O
swim	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
third	O
could	O
not	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
standing	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
,	O
he	O
looked	O
at	O
the	O
others	O
,	O
but	O
went	O
no	O
farther	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
after	O
went	O
softly	O
back	O
again	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
happened	O
,	O
was	O
very	O
well	O
for	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
end	O
.	O

I	O
observed	O
that	O
the	O
two	O
who	O
swam	O
were	O
yet	O
more	O
than	O
twice	O
as	O
strong	O
swimming	O
over	O
the	O
creek	O
as	O
the	O
fellow	O
was	O
that	O
fled	O
from	O
them	O
.	O

It	O
came	O
very	O
warmly	O
upon	O
my	O
thoughts	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
irresistibly	O
,	O
that	O
now	O
was	O
the	O
time	O
to	O
get	O
me	O
a	O
servant	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
a	O
companion	O
or	O
assistant	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
plainly	O
called	O
by	O
Providence	O
to	O
save	O
this	O
poor	O
creature	O
's	O
life	O
.	O

I	O
immediately	O
ran	O
down	O
the	O
ladders	O
with	O
all	O
possible	O
expedition	O
,	O
fetched	O
my	O
two	O
guns	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
both	O
at	O
the	O
foot	O
of	O
the	O
ladders	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
observed	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
getting	O
up	O
again	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
haste	O
to	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
,	O
I	O
crossed	O
towards	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
a	O
very	O
short	O
cut	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
down	O
hill	O
,	O
placed	O
myself	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
between	O
the	O
pursuers	O
and	O
the	O
pursued	O
,	O
hallowing	O
aloud	O
to	O
him	O
that	O
fled	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
looking	O
back	O
,	O
was	O
at	O
first	O
perhaps	O
as	O
much	O
frightened	O
at	O
me	O
as	O
at	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
beckoned	O
with	O
my	O
hand	O
to	O
him	O
to	O
come	O
back	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
meantime	O
,	O
I	O
slowly	O
advanced	O
towards	O
the	O
two	O
that	O
followed	O
;	O
then	O
rushing	O
at	O
once	O
upon	O
the	O
foremost	O
,	O
I	O
knocked	O
him	O
down	O
with	O
the	O
stock	O
of	O
my	O
piece	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
loath	O
to	O
fire	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
the	O
rest	O
hear	O
;	O
though	O
,	O
at	O
that	O
distance	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
easily	O
heard	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
out	O
of	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
smoke	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
known	O
what	O
to	O
make	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

Having	O
knocked	O
this	O
fellow	O
down	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
who	O
pursued	O
him	O
stopped	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
frightened	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
advanced	O
towards	O
him	O
:	O
but	O
as	O
I	O
came	O
nearer	O
,	O
I	O
perceived	O
presently	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
bow	O
and	O
arrow	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
fitting	O
it	O
to	O
shoot	O
at	O
me	O
:	O
so	O
I	O
was	O
then	O
obliged	O
to	O
shoot	O
at	O
him	O
first	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
did	O
,	O
and	O
killed	O
him	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
shot	O
.	O

The	O
poor	O
savage	O
who	O
fled	O
,	O
but	O
had	O
stopped	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
saw	O
both	O
his	O
enemies	O
fallen	O
and	O
killed	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
thought	O
,	O
yet	O
was	O
so	O
frightened	O
with	O
the	O
fire	O
and	O
noise	O
of	O
my	O
piece	O
that	O
he	O
stood	O
stock	O
still	O
,	O
and	O
neither	O
came	O
forward	O
nor	O
went	O
backward	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
seemed	O
rather	O
inclined	O
still	O
to	O
fly	O
than	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
.	O

I	O
hallooed	O
again	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
come	O
forward	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
easily	O
understood	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
;	O
then	O
stopped	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
a	O
little	O
farther	O
,	O
and	O
stopped	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
could	O
then	O
perceive	O
that	O
he	O
stood	O
trembling	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
taken	O
prisoner	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
just	O
been	O
to	O
be	O
killed	O
,	O
as	O
his	O
two	O
enemies	O
were	O
.	O

I	O
beckoned	O
to	O
him	O
again	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
him	O
all	O
the	O
signs	O
of	O
encouragement	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
think	O
of	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
came	O
nearer	O
and	O
nearer	O
,	O
kneeling	O
down	O
every	O
ten	O
or	O
twelve	O
steps	O
,	O
in	O
token	O
of	O
acknowledgment	O
for	O
saving	O
his	O
life	O
.	O

I	O
smiled	O
at	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
looked	O
pleasantly	O
,	O
and	O
beckoned	O
to	O
him	O
to	O
come	O
still	O
nearer	O
;	O
at	O
length	O
he	O
came	O
close	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
he	O
kneeled	O
down	O
again	O
,	O
kissed	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
laid	O
his	O
head	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
taking	O
me	O
by	O
the	O
foot	O
,	O
set	O
my	O
foot	O
upon	O
his	O
head	O
;	O
this	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
was	O
in	O
token	O
of	O
swearing	O
to	O
be	O
my	O
slave	O
for	O
ever	O
.	O

I	O
took	O
him	O
up	O
and	O
made	O
much	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
encouraged	O
him	O
all	O
I	O
could	O
.	O

But	O
there	O
was	O
more	O
work	O
to	O
do	O
yet	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
perceived	O
the	O
savage	O
whom	O
I	O
had	O
knocked	O
down	O
was	O
not	O
killed	O
,	O
but	O
stunned	O
with	O
the	O
blow	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
himself	O
:	O
so	O
I	O
pointed	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
showed	O
him	O
the	O
savage	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
dead	O
;	O
upon	O
this	O
he	O
spoke	O
some	O
words	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
though	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
understand	O
them	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
thought	O
they	O
were	O
pleasant	O
to	O
hear	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
the	O
first	O
sound	O
of	O
a	O
man	O
's	O
voice	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
heard	O
,	O
my	O
own	O
excepted	O
,	O
for	O
above	O
twenty-five	O
years	O
.	O

But	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
time	O
for	O
such	O
reflections	O
now	O
;	O
the	O
savage	O
who	O
was	O
knocked	O
down	O
recovered	O
himself	O
so	O
far	O
as	O
to	O
sit	O
up	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
perceived	O
that	O
my	O
savage	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
afraid	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
I	O
saw	O
that	O
,	O
I	O
presented	O
my	O
other	O
piece	O
at	O
the	O
man	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
shoot	O
him	O
:	O
upon	O
this	O
my	O
savage	O
,	O
for	O
so	O
I	O
call	O
him	O
now	O
,	O
made	O
a	O
motion	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
lend	O
him	O
my	O
sword	O
,	O
which	O
hung	O
naked	O
in	O
a	O
belt	O
by	O
my	O
side	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
did	O
.	O

He	O
no	O
sooner	O
had	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
runs	O
to	O
his	O
enemy	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
one	O
blow	O
cut	O
off	O
his	O
head	O
so	O
cleverly	O
,	O
no	O
executioner	O
in	O
Germany	O
could	O
have	O
done	O
it	O
sooner	O
or	O
better	O
;	O
which	O
I	O
thought	O
very	O
strange	O
for	O
one	O
who	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
,	O
never	O
saw	O
a	O
sword	O
in	O
his	O
life	O
before	O
,	O
except	O
their	O
own	O
wooden	O
swords	O
:	O
however	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
learned	O
afterwards	O
,	O
they	O
make	O
their	O
wooden	O
swords	O
so	O
sharp	O
,	O
so	O
heavy	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
wood	O
is	O
so	O
hard	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
will	O
even	O
cut	O
off	O
heads	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
ay	O
,	O
and	O
arms	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
at	O
one	O
blow	O
,	O
too	O
.	O

When	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
this	O
,	O
he	O
comes	O
laughing	O
to	O
me	O
in	O
sign	O
of	O
triumph	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
me	O
the	O
sword	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
abundance	O
of	O
gestures	O
which	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
,	O
laid	O
it	O
down	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
the	O
savage	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
killed	O
,	O
just	O
before	O
me	O
.	O

But	O
that	O
which	O
astonished	O
him	O
most	O
was	O
to	O
know	O
how	O
I	O
killed	O
the	O
other	O
Indian	O
so	O
far	O
off	O
;	O
so	O
,	O
pointing	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
let	O
him	O
go	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
bade	O
him	O
go	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
.	O

When	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
stood	O
like	O
one	O
amazed	O
,	O
looking	O
at	O
him	O
,	O
turning	O
him	O
first	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
,	O
then	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
;	O
looked	O
at	O
the	O
wound	O
the	O
bullet	O
had	O
made	O
,	O
which	O
it	O
seems	O
was	O
just	O
in	O
his	O
breast	O
,	O
where	O
it	O
had	O
made	O
a	O
hole	O
,	O
and	O
no	O
great	O
quantity	O
of	O
blood	O
had	O
followed	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
had	O
bled	O
inwardly	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
was	O
quite	O
dead	O
.	O

He	O
took	O
up	O
his	O
bow	O
and	O
arrows	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
back	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
turned	O
to	O
go	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
beckoned	O
him	O
to	O
follow	O
me	O
,	O
making	O
signs	O
to	O
him	O
that	O
more	O
might	O
come	O
after	O
them	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
he	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
bury	O
them	O
with	O
sand	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
seen	O
by	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
followed	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
I	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
him	O
again	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
.	O

He	O
fell	O
to	O
work	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
an	O
instant	O
he	O
had	O
scraped	O
a	O
hole	O
in	O
the	O
sand	O
with	O
his	O
hands	O
big	O
enough	O
to	O
bury	O
the	O
first	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
dragged	O
him	O
into	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
covered	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
did	O
so	O
by	O
the	O
other	O
also	O
;	O
I	O
believe	O
he	O
had	O
him	O
buried	O
them	O
both	O
in	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
.	O

Then	O
,	O
calling	O
away	O
,	O
I	O
carried	O
him	O
,	O
not	O
to	O
my	O
castle	O
,	O
but	O
quite	O
away	O
to	O
my	O
cave	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
farther	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
:	O
so	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
let	O
my	O
dream	O
come	O
to	O
pass	O
in	O
that	O
part	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
came	O
into	O
my	O
grove	O
for	O
shelter	O
.	O

Here	O
I	O
gave	O
him	O
bread	O
and	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
raisins	O
to	O
eat	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
draught	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
found	O
he	O
was	O
indeed	O
in	O
great	O
distress	O
for	O
,	O
from	O
his	O
running	O
:	O
and	O
having	O
refreshed	O
him	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
signs	O
for	O
him	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
lie	O
down	O
to	O
sleep	O
,	O
showing	O
him	O
a	O
place	O
where	O
I	O
had	O
laid	O
some	O
rice-straw	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
blanket	O
upon	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
used	O
to	O
sleep	O
upon	O
myself	O
sometimes	O
;	O
so	O
the	O
poor	O
creature	O
lay	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
to	O
sleep	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
a	O
comely	O
,	O
handsome	O
fellow	O
,	O
perfectly	O
well	O
made	O
,	O
with	O
straight	O
,	O
strong	O
limbs	O
,	O
not	O
too	O
large	O
;	O
tall	O
,	O
and	O
well-shaped	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
reckon	O
,	O
about	O
twenty-six	O
years	O
of	O
age	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
countenance	O
,	O
not	O
a	O
fierce	O
and	O
surly	O
aspect	O
,	O
but	O
seemed	O
to	O
have	O
something	O
very	O
manly	O
in	O
his	O
face	O
;	O
and	O
yet	O
he	O
had	O
all	O
the	O
sweetness	O
and	O
softness	O
of	O
a	O
European	O
in	O
his	O
countenance	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
especially	O
when	O
he	O
smiled	O
.	O

His	O
hair	O
was	O
long	O
and	O
black	O
,	O
not	O
curled	O
like	O
wool	O
;	O
his	O
forehead	O
very	O
high	O
and	O
large	O
;	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
vivacity	O
and	O
sparkling	O
sharpness	O
in	O
his	O
eyes	O
.	O

The	O
colour	O
of	O
his	O
skin	O
was	O
not	O
quite	O
black	O
,	O
but	O
very	O
tawny	O
;	O
and	O
yet	O
not	O
an	O
ugly	O
,	O
yellow	O
,	O
nauseous	O
tawny	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
Brazilians	O
and	O
Virginians	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
natives	O
of	O
America	PNM
are	O
,	O
but	O
of	O
a	O
bright	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
dun	O
olive-colour	O
,	O
that	O
had	O
in	O
it	O
something	O
very	O
agreeable	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
very	O
easy	O
to	O
describe	O
.	O

His	O
face	O
was	O
round	O
and	O
plump	O
;	O
his	O
nose	O
small	O
,	O
not	O
flat	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
negroes	O
;	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
mouth	O
,	O
thin	O
lips	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
fine	O
teeth	O
well	O
set	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
white	O
as	O
ivory	O
.	O

After	O
he	O
had	O
slumbered	O
,	O
rather	O
than	O
slept	O
,	O
about	O
half-an-hour	O
,	O
he	O
awoke	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
cave	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
milking	O
my	O
goats	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
enclosure	O
just	O
by	O
:	O
when	O
he	O
espied	O
me	O
he	O
came	O
running	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
laying	O
himself	O
down	O
again	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
possible	O
signs	O
of	O
an	O
humble	O
,	O
thankful	O
disposition	O
,	O
making	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
antic	O
gestures	O
to	O
show	O
it	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
he	O
lays	O
his	O
head	O
flat	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
close	O
to	O
my	O
foot	O
,	O
and	O
sets	O
my	O
other	O
foot	O
upon	O
his	O
head	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
before	O
;	O
and	O
after	O
this	O
made	O
all	O
the	O
signs	O
to	O
me	O
of	O
subjection	O
,	O
servitude	O
,	O
and	O
submission	O
imaginable	O
,	O
to	O
let	O
me	O
know	O
how	O
he	O
would	O
serve	O
me	O
so	O
long	O
as	O
he	O
lived	O
.	O

I	O
understood	O
him	O
in	O
many	O
things	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
him	O
know	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
well	O
pleased	O
with	O
him	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
little	O
time	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
speak	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
teach	O
him	O
to	O
speak	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
first	O
,	O
I	O
let	O
him	O
know	O
his	O
name	O
should	O
be	O
Friday	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
day	O
I	O
saved	O
his	O
life	O
;	O
I	O
called	O
him	O
so	O
for	O
the	O
memory	O
of	O
the	O
time	O
.	O

I	O
likewise	O
taught	O
him	O
to	O
say	O
Master	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
let	O
him	O
know	O
that	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
my	O
name	O
;	O
I	O
likewise	O
taught	O
him	O
to	O
say	O
Yes	O
and	O
No	O
and	O
to	O
know	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
gave	O
him	O
some	O
milk	O
in	O
an	O
earthen	O
pot	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
him	O
see	O
me	O
drink	O
it	O
before	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
sop	O
my	O
bread	O
in	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
cake	O
of	O
bread	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
like	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
quickly	O
complied	O
with	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
for	O
him	O
.	O

I	O
kept	O
there	O
with	O
him	O
all	O
that	O
night	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
day	O
I	O
beckoned	O
to	O
him	O
to	O
come	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
him	O
know	O
I	O
would	O
give	O
him	O
some	O
clothes	O
;	O
at	O
which	O
he	O
seemed	O
very	O
glad	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
was	O
stark	O
naked	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
went	O
by	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
he	O
had	O
buried	O
the	O
two	O
men	O
,	O
he	O
pointed	O
exactly	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
showed	O
me	O
the	O
marks	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
made	O
to	O
find	O
them	O
again	O
,	O
making	O
signs	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
dig	O
them	O
up	O
again	O
and	O
eat	O
them	O
.	O

At	O
this	O
I	O
appeared	O
very	O
angry	O
,	O
expressed	O
my	O
abhorrence	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
made	O
as	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
vomit	O
at	O
the	O
thoughts	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
beckoned	O
with	O
my	O
hand	O
to	O
him	O
to	O
come	O
away	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
did	O
immediately	O
,	O
with	O
great	O
submission	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
led	O
him	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
his	O
enemies	O
were	O
gone	O
;	O
and	O
pulling	O
out	O
my	O
glass	O
I	O
looked	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
plainly	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
,	O
but	O
no	O
appearance	O
of	O
them	O
or	O
their	O
canoes	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
plain	O
they	O
were	O
gone	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
left	O
their	O
two	O
comrades	O
behind	O
them	O
,	O
without	O
any	O
search	O
after	O
them	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
content	O
with	O
this	O
discovery	O
;	O
but	O
having	O
now	O
more	O
courage	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
more	O
curiosity	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
my	O
man	O
Friday	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
giving	O
him	O
the	O
sword	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
bow	O
and	O
arrows	O
at	O
his	O
back	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
found	O
he	O
could	O
use	O
very	O
dexterously	O
,	O
making	O
him	O
carry	O
one	O
gun	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
two	O
for	O
myself	O
;	O
and	O
away	O
we	O
marched	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
these	O
creatures	O
had	O
been	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
mind	O
now	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
further	O
intelligence	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
my	O
very	O
blood	O
ran	O
chill	O
in	O
my	O
veins	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
heart	O
sunk	O
within	O
me	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
horror	O
of	O
the	O
spectacle	O
;	O
indeed	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
dreadful	O
sight	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
though	O
Friday	O
made	O
nothing	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
place	O
was	O
covered	O
with	O
human	O
bones	O
,	O
the	O
ground	O
dyed	O
with	O
their	O
blood	O
,	O
and	O
great	O
pieces	O
of	O
flesh	O
left	O
here	O
and	O
there	O
,	O
half-eaten	O
,	O
mangled	O
,	O
and	O
scorched	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
tokens	O
of	O
the	O
triumphant	O
feast	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
making	O
there	O
,	O
after	O
a	O
victory	O
over	O
their	O
enemies	O
.	O

I	O
saw	O
three	O
skulls	O
,	O
five	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
bones	O
of	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
legs	O
and	O
feet	O
,	O
and	O
abundance	O
of	O
other	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
bodies	O
;	O
and	O
Friday	O
,	O
by	O
his	O
signs	O
,	O
made	O
me	O
understand	O
that	O
they	O
brought	O
over	O
four	O
prisoners	O
to	O
feast	O
upon	O
;	O
that	O
three	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
eaten	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
,	O
pointing	O
to	O
himself	O
,	O
was	O
the	O
fourth	O
;	O
that	O
there	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
great	O
battle	O
between	O
them	O
and	O
their	O
next	O
king	O
,	O
of	O
whose	O
subjects	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
one	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
taken	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
prisoners	O
;	O
all	O
which	O
were	O
carried	O
to	O
several	O
places	O
by	O
those	O
who	O
had	O
taken	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
fight	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
feast	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
was	O
done	O
here	O
by	O
these	O
wretches	O
upon	O
those	O
they	O
brought	O
hither	O
.	O

I	O
caused	O
Friday	O
to	O
gather	O
all	O
the	O
skulls	O
,	O
bones	O
,	O
flesh	O
,	O
and	O
whatever	O
remained	O
,	O
and	O
lay	O
them	O
together	O
in	O
a	O
heap	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
a	O
great	O
fire	O
upon	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
burn	O
them	O
all	O
to	O
ashes	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
Friday	O
had	O
still	O
a	O
hankering	O
stomach	O
after	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
flesh	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
still	O
a	O
cannibal	O
in	O
his	O
nature	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
showed	O
so	O
much	O
abhorrence	O
at	O
the	O
very	O
thoughts	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
least	O
appearance	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
durst	O
not	O
discover	O
it	O
:	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
,	O
by	O
some	O
means	O
,	O
let	O
him	O
know	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
kill	O
him	O
if	O
he	O
offered	O
it	O
.	O

When	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
this	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
back	O
to	O
our	O
castle	O
;	O
and	O
there	O
I	O
fell	O
to	O
work	O
for	O
my	O
man	O
Friday	O
;	O
and	O
first	O
of	O
all	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
linen	O

which	O
I	O
had	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
poor	O
gunner	O

mentioned	O

which	O
I	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
wreck	O

and	O
which	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
little	O
alteration	O
,	O
fitted	O
him	O
very	O
well	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
made	O
him	O
a	O
jerkin	O
of	O
goat	O

skin	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
my	O
skill	O

for	O
I	O
was	O
now	O
grown	O
a	O
tolerably	O
good	O

and	O
I	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O

I	O
made	O
of	O

very	O
convenient	O
,	O
and	O
fashionable	O
enough	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
he	O
was	O
clothed	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
present	O
,	O
tolerably	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
mighty	O
well	O
pleased	O
to	O
see	O
himself	O
almost	O
as	O
well	O
clothed	O
as	O
his	O
master	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
true	O
he	O
went	O
awkwardly	O
in	O
these	O
clothes	O
at	O
first	O
:	O
wearing	O
the	O
drawers	O
was	O
very	O
awkward	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sleeves	O
of	O
the	O
waistcoat	O
galled	O
his	O
shoulders	O
and	O
the	O
inside	O
of	O
his	O
arms	O
;	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
easing	O
them	O
where	O
he	O
complained	O
they	O
hurt	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
using	O
himself	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
he	O
took	O
to	O
them	O
at	O
length	O
very	O
well	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
after	O
I	O
came	O
home	O
to	O
my	O
hutch	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
consider	O
where	O
I	O
should	O
lodge	O
him	O
:	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
do	O
well	O
for	O
him	O
and	O
yet	O
be	O
perfectly	O
easy	O
myself	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
little	O
tent	O
for	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
vacant	O
place	O
between	O
my	O
two	O
fortifications	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
inside	O
of	O
the	O
last	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
outside	O
of	O
the	O
first	O

As	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
door	O
or	O
entrance	O
there	O
into	O
my	O
cave	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
formal	O
framed	O
door-case	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
door	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
of	O

set	O
it	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
passage	O

a	O
little	O
within	O
the	O
entrance	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
causing	O
the	O
door	O
to	O
open	O
in	O
the	O
inside	O

I	O
barred	O
it	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
taking	O
in	O
my	O
ladders	O
,	O
too	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
Friday	O
could	O
no	O
way	O
come	O
at	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
inside	O
of	O
my	O
innermost	O
wall	O
,	O
without	O
making	O
so	O
much	O
noise	O
in	O
getting	O
over	O
that	O
it	O
must	O
needs	O
awaken	O
me	O
;	O
for	O
my	O
first	O
wall	O
had	O
now	O
a	O
complete	O
roof	O
over	O
it	O
of	O
long	O
poles	O

covering	O
all	O
my	O
tent	O

and	O
leaning	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
;	O
which	O
was	O
again	O
laid	O
across	O
with	O
smaller	O
sticks	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
laths	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
thatched	O
over	O
a	O
great	O
thickness	O
with	O
the	O
rice-straw	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
strong	O
,	O
like	O
reeds	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
hole	O
or	O
place	O
which	O
was	O
left	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
or	O
out	O
by	O
the	O
ladder	O
I	O
had	O
placed	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
trap-door	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
attempted	O
on	O
the	O
outside	O
,	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
opened	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
but	O
would	O
have	O
fallen	O
down	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
great	O
noise	O
--	O
as	O
to	O
weapons	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
them	O
all	O
into	O
my	O
side	O
every	O
night	O

But	O
I	O
needed	O
none	O
of	O
all	O
this	O
precaution	O
;	O
for	O
never	O
man	O
had	O
a	O
more	O
faithful	O

than	O
Friday	O
was	O
to	O
me	O
:	O
without	O
passions	O
,	O
sullenness	O
,	O
or	O
designs	O
,	O
perfectly	O
obliged	O
and	O
engaged	O
;	O
his	O
very	O
affections	O
were	O
tied	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
like	O
those	O
of	O
a	O
child	O
to	O
a	O
father	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
daresay	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
sacrificed	O
his	O
life	O
to	O
save	O
mine	O
upon	O
any	O
occasion	O
whatsoever	O
--	O
the	O
many	O
testimonies	O
he	O
gave	O
me	O
of	O
this	O
put	O
it	O
out	O
of	O
doubt	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
convinced	O
me	O
that	O
I	O
needed	O
to	O
use	O
no	O
precautions	O
for	O
my	O
safety	O
on	O
his	O
account	O
.	O

This	O
frequently	O
gave	O
me	O
occasion	O
to	O
observe	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
with	O
wonder	O
,	O
that	O
however	O
it	O
had	O
pleased	O
God	O
in	O
His	O
providence	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
government	O
of	O
the	O
works	O
of	O
His	O
hands	O

to	O
take	O
from	O
so	O

a	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
of	O
His	O

their	O

the	O
powers	O

that	O
He	O

upon	O
them	O
the	O

the	O

the	O

that	O

This	O
made	O
me	O
very	O
melancholy	O
sometimes	O
,	O
in	O
reflecting	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
several	O
occasions	O
presented	O
,	O
how	O
mean	O
a	O
use	O
we	O
make	O
of	O
all	O
these	O
,	O
even	O
though	O
we	O
have	O
these	O
powers	O
enlightened	O
by	O
the	O
great	O
lamp	O
of	O
instruction	O
,	O
the	O
Spirit	O
of	O
God	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
knowledge	O
of	O
His	O
word	O
added	O
to	O
our	O
understanding	O
;	O
and	O
why	O
it	O
has	O
pleased	O
God	O
to	O
hide	O
the	O
like	O
saving	O
knowledge	O
from	O
so	O
many	O
millions	O
of	O
souls	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
might	O
judge	O
by	O
this	O
poor	O
savage	O
,	O
would	O
make	O
a	O
much	O
better	O
use	O
of	O
it	O
than	O
we	O
did	O
.	O

From	O
hence	O
I	O
sometimes	O
was	O
led	O
too	O
far	O
,	O
to	O
invade	O
the	O
sovereignty	O
of	O
Providence	PNM
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
arraign	O
the	O
justice	O
of	O
so	O
arbitrary	O
a	O
disposition	O
of	O
things	O
,	O
that	O
should	O
hide	O
that	O
sight	O
from	O
some	O
,	O
and	O
reveal	O
it	O
to	O
others	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
expect	O
a	O
like	O
duty	O
from	O
both	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
shut	O
it	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
checked	O
my	O
thoughts	O
with	O
this	O
conclusion	O
:	O
first	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
by	O
what	O
light	O
and	O
law	O
these	O
should	O
be	O
condemned	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
as	O
God	O
was	O
necessarily	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
His	O
being	O
,	O
infinitely	O
holy	O
and	O
just	O
,	O
so	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
,	O
but	O
if	O
these	O
creatures	O
were	O
all	O
sentenced	O
to	O
absence	O
from	O
Himself	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
sinning	O
against	O
that	O
light	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
Scripture	O
says	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
law	O
to	O
themselves	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
such	O
rules	O
as	O
their	O
consciences	O
would	O
acknowledge	O
to	O
be	O
just	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
foundation	O
was	O
not	O
discovered	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
secondly	O
,	O
that	O
still	O
as	O
we	O
all	O
are	O
the	O
clay	O
in	O
the	O
hand	O
of	O
the	O
potter	O
,	O
no	O
vessel	O
could	O
say	O
to	O
him	O

``	O
Why	O
hast	O
thou	O
formed	O
me	O
thus	O
?	O
''	O

But	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
my	O
new	O
companion	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
greatly	O
delighted	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
it	O
my	O
business	O
to	O
teach	O
him	O
everything	O
that	O
was	O
proper	O
to	O
make	O
him	O
useful	O
,	O
handy	O
,	O
and	O
helpful	O
;	O
but	O
especially	O
to	O
make	O
him	O
speak	O
,	O
and	O
understand	O
me	O
when	O
I	O
spoke	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
was	O
the	O
aptest	O
scholar	O
that	O
ever	O
was	O
;	O
and	O
particularly	O
was	O
so	O
merry	O
,	O
so	O
constantly	O
diligent	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
pleased	O
when	O
he	O
could	O
but	O
understand	O
me	O
,	O
or	O
make	O
me	O
understand	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
pleasant	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
talk	O
to	O
him	O

Now	O
my	O
life	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
easy	O
that	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
say	O
to	O
myself	O
that	O
could	O
I	O
but	O
have	O
been	O
safe	O
from	O
more	O
savages	O

I	O
cared	O

CHAPTER	O
XV	O
--	O
FRIDAY	O
'S	O
EDUCATION	O
After	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
returned	O
to	O
my	O
castle	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
bring	O
Friday	O
off	O
from	O
his	O
horrid	O
way	O
of	O
feeding	O
,	O
and	O
from	O
the	O
relish	O
of	O
a	O
cannibal	O
's	O
stomach	O
,	O
I	O
ought	O
to	O
let	O
him	O
taste	O
other	O
flesh	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
took	O
him	O
out	O
with	O
me	O
one	O
morning	O
to	O
the	O
woods	O
.	O

I	O
went	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
intending	O
to	O
kill	O
a	O
kid	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
own	O
flock	O
;	O
and	O
bring	O
it	O
home	O
and	O
dress	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
going	O
I	O
saw	O
a	O
she-goat	O
lying	O
down	O
in	O
the	O
shade	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
young	O
kids	O
sitting	O
by	O
her	O
.	O

I	O
catched	O
hold	O
of	O
Friday	O
.	O

``	O
Hold	O
,	O
''	O
said	O
I	O
,	O
``	O
stand	O
still	O
;	O
''	O
and	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
him	O
not	O
to	O
stir	O
:	O
immediately	O
I	O
presented	O
my	O
piece	O
,	O
shot	O
,	O
and	O
killed	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
kids	O
.	O

The	O
poor	O
creature	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
seen	O
me	O
kill	O
the	O
savage	O
,	O
his	O
enemy	O
,	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
,	O
nor	O
could	O
imagine	O
how	O
it	O
was	O
done	O
,	O
was	O
sensibly	O
surprised	O
,	O
trembled	O
,	O
and	O
shook	O
,	O
and	O
looked	O
so	O
amazed	O
that	O
I	O
thought	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
sunk	O
down	O
.	O

He	O
did	O
not	O
see	O
the	O
kid	O
I	O
shot	O
at	O
,	O
or	O
perceive	O
I	O
had	O
killed	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
ripped	O
up	O
his	O
waistcoat	O
to	O
feel	O
whether	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
wounded	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
found	O
presently	O
,	O
thought	O
I	O
was	O
resolved	O
to	O
kill	O
him	O
:	O
for	O
he	O
came	O
and	O
kneeled	O
down	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
embracing	O
my	O
knees	O
,	O
said	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
things	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
could	O
easily	O
see	O
the	O
meaning	O
was	O
to	O
pray	O
me	O
not	O
to	O
kill	O
him	O
.	O

I	O
soon	O
found	O
a	O
way	O
to	O
convince	O
him	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
do	O
him	O
no	O
harm	O
;	O
and	O
taking	O
him	O
up	O
by	O
the	O
hand	O
,	O
laughed	O
at	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
pointing	O
to	O
the	O
kid	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
killed	O
,	O
beckoned	O
to	O
him	O
to	O
run	O
and	O
fetch	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
did	O
:	O
and	O
while	O
he	O
was	O
wondering	O
,	O
and	O
looking	O
to	O
see	O
how	O
the	O
creature	O
was	O
killed	O
,	O
I	O
loaded	O
my	O
gun	O
again	O
.	O

By-and-by	O
I	O
saw	O
a	O
great	O
fowl	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
hawk	O
,	O
sitting	O
upon	O
a	O
tree	O
within	O
shot	O
;	O
so	O
,	O
to	O
let	O
Friday	O
understand	O
a	O
little	O
what	O
I	O
would	O
do	O
,	O
I	O
called	O
him	O
to	O
me	O
again	O
,	O
pointed	O
at	O
the	O
fowl	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
indeed	O
a	O
parrot	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
hawk	O
;	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
pointing	O
to	O
the	O
parrot	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
my	O
gun	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
ground	O
under	O
the	O
parrot	O
,	O
to	O
let	O
him	O
see	O
I	O
would	O
make	O
it	O
fall	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
him	O
understand	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
shoot	O
and	O
kill	O
that	O
bird	O
;	O
accordingly	O
,	O
I	O
fired	O
,	O
and	O
bade	O
him	O
look	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
he	O
saw	O
the	O
parrot	O
fall	O
.	O

He	O
stood	O
like	O
one	O
frightened	O
again	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
all	O
I	O
had	O
said	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
found	O
he	O
was	O
the	O
more	O
amazed	O
,	O
because	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
see	O
me	O
put	O
anything	O
into	O
the	O
gun	O
,	O
but	O
thought	O
that	O
there	O
must	O
be	O
some	O
wonderful	O
fund	O
of	O
death	O
and	O
destruction	O
in	O
that	O
thing	O
,	O
able	O
to	O
kill	O
man	O
,	O
beast	O
,	O
bird	O
,	O
or	O
anything	O
near	O
or	O
far	O
off	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
astonishment	O
this	O
created	O
in	O
him	O
was	O
such	O
as	O
could	O
not	O
wear	O
off	O
for	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
believe	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
let	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
worshipped	O
me	O
and	O
my	O
gun	O
.	O

As	O
for	O
the	O
gun	O
itself	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
touch	O
it	O
for	O
several	O
days	O
after	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
would	O
speak	O
to	O
it	O
and	O
talk	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
answered	O
him	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
was	O
by	O
himself	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
afterwards	O
learned	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
was	O
to	O
desire	O
it	O
not	O
to	O
kill	O
him	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
after	O
his	O
astonishment	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
over	O
at	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
pointed	O
to	O
him	O
to	O
run	O
and	O
fetch	O
the	O
bird	O
I	O
had	O
shot	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
did	O
,	O
but	O
stayed	O
some	O
time	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
parrot	O
,	O
not	O
being	O
quite	O
dead	O
,	O
had	O
fluttered	O
away	O
a	O
good	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
she	O
fell	O
:	O
however	O
,	O
he	O
found	O
her	O
,	O
took	O
her	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
her	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
perceived	O
his	O
ignorance	O
about	O
the	O
gun	O
before	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
this	O
advantage	O
to	O
charge	O
the	O
gun	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
to	O
let	O
him	O
see	O
me	O
do	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
ready	O
for	O
any	O
other	O
mark	O
that	O
might	O
present	O
;	O
but	O
nothing	O
more	O
offered	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
:	O
so	O
I	O
brought	O
home	O
the	O
kid	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
same	O
evening	O
I	O
took	O
the	O
skin	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
cut	O
it	O
out	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
a	O
pot	O
fit	O
for	O
that	O
purpose	O
,	O
I	O
boiled	O
or	O
stewed	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
flesh	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
some	O
very	O
good	O
broth	O
.	O

After	O
I	O
had	O
begun	O
to	O
eat	O
some	O
I	O
gave	O
some	O
to	O
my	O
man	O
,	O
who	O
seemed	O
very	O
glad	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
liked	O
it	O
very	O
well	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
which	O
was	O
strangest	O
to	O
him	O
was	O
to	O
see	O
me	O
eat	O
salt	O
with	O
it	O
.	O

He	O
made	O
a	O
sign	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
the	O
salt	O
was	O
not	O
good	O
to	O
eat	O
;	O
and	O
putting	O
a	O
little	O
into	O
his	O
own	O
mouth	O
,	O
he	O
seemed	O
to	O
nauseate	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
spit	O
and	O
sputter	O
at	O
it	O
,	O
washing	O
his	O
mouth	O
with	O
fresh	O
water	O
after	O
it	O
:	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
some	O
meat	O
into	O
my	O
mouth	O
without	O
salt	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
pretended	O
to	O
spit	O
and	O
sputter	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
salt	O
,	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
at	O
the	O
salt	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
do	O
;	O
he	O
would	O
never	O
care	O
for	O
salt	O
with	O
meat	O
or	O
in	O
his	O
broth	O
;	O
at	O
least	O
,	O
not	O
for	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
but	O
a	O
very	O
little	O
.	O

Having	O
thus	O
fed	O
him	O
with	O
boiled	O
meat	O
and	O
broth	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
resolved	O
to	O
feast	O
him	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
by	O
roasting	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
the	O
kid	O
:	O
this	O
I	O
did	O
by	O
hanging	O
it	O
before	O
the	O
fire	O
on	O
a	O
string	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
many	O
people	O
do	O
in	O
England	PNM
,	O
setting	O
two	O
poles	O
up	O
,	O
one	O
on	O
each	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
fire	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
across	O
the	O
top	O
,	O
and	O
tying	O
the	O
string	O
to	O
the	O
cross	O
stick	O
,	O
letting	O
the	O
meat	O
turn	O
continually	O
.	O

This	O
Friday	O
admired	O
very	O
much	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
taste	O
the	O
flesh	O
,	O
he	O
took	O
so	O
many	O
ways	O
to	O
tell	O
me	O
how	O
well	O
he	O
liked	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
but	O
understand	O
him	O
:	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
he	O
could	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
never	O
eat	O
man	O
's	O
flesh	O
any	O
more	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
glad	O
to	O
hear	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
I	O
set	O
him	O
to	O
work	O
beating	O
some	O
corn	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
sifting	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
manner	O
I	O
used	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
observed	O
before	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
soon	O
understood	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
,	O
especially	O
after	O
he	O
had	O
seen	O
what	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
make	O
bread	O
of	O
;	O
for	O
after	O
that	O
I	O
let	O
him	O
see	O
me	O
make	O
my	O
bread	O
,	O
and	O
bake	O
it	O
too	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
time	O
Friday	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
all	O
the	O
work	O
for	O
me	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
do	O
it	O
myself	O
.	O

I	O
began	O
now	O
to	O
consider	O
,	O
that	O
having	O
two	O
mouths	O
to	O
feed	O
instead	O
of	O
one	O
,	O
I	O
must	O
provide	O
more	O
ground	O
for	O
my	O
harvest	O
,	O
and	O
plant	O
a	O
larger	O
quantity	O
of	O
corn	O
than	O
I	O
used	O
to	O
do	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
marked	O
out	O
a	O
larger	O
piece	O
of	O
land	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
the	O
fence	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
manner	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
Friday	O
worked	O
not	O
only	O
very	O
willingly	O
and	O
very	O
hard	O
,	O
but	O
did	O
it	O
very	O
cheerfully	O
:	O
and	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
for	O
;	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
for	O
corn	O
to	O
make	O
more	O
bread	O
,	O
because	O
he	O
was	O
now	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
enough	O
for	O
him	O
and	O
myself	O
too	O
.	O

He	O
appeared	O
very	O
sensible	O
of	O
that	O
part	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
me	O
know	O
that	O
he	O
thought	O
I	O
had	O
much	O
more	O
labour	O
upon	O
me	O
on	O
his	O
account	O
than	O
I	O
had	O
for	O
myself	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
work	O
the	O
harder	O
for	O
me	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
tell	O
him	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
pleasantest	O
year	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
life	O
I	O
led	O
in	O
this	O
place	O
.	O

Friday	O
began	O
to	O
talk	O
pretty	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
understand	O
the	O
names	O
of	O
almost	O
everything	O
I	O
had	O
occasion	O
to	O
call	O
for	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
every	O
place	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
send	O
him	O
to	O
,	O
and	O
talked	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
now	O
to	O
have	O
some	O
use	O
for	O
my	O
tongue	O
again	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
very	O
little	O
occasion	O
for	O
before	O
.	O

Besides	O
the	O
pleasure	O
of	O
talking	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
singular	O
satisfaction	O
in	O
the	O
fellow	O
himself	O
:	O
his	O
simple	O
,	O
unfeigned	O
honesty	O
appeared	O
to	O
me	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
every	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
began	O
really	O
to	O
love	O
the	O
creature	O
;	O
and	O
on	O
his	O
side	O
I	O
believe	O
he	O
loved	O
me	O
more	O
than	O
it	O
was	O
possible	O
for	O
him	O
ever	O
to	O
love	O
anything	O
before	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
mind	O
once	O
to	O
try	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
any	O
inclination	O
for	O
his	O
own	O
country	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
taught	O
him	O
English	O
so	O
well	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
answer	O
me	O
almost	O
any	O
question	O
,	O
I	O
asked	O
him	O
whether	O
the	O
nation	O
that	O
he	O
belonged	O
to	O
never	O
conquered	O
in	O
battle	O
?	O

At	O
which	O
he	O
smiled	O

said	O

By	O
this	O
I	O
understood	O
that	O
my	O
man	O
Friday	O
had	O
formerly	O
been	O
among	O
the	O
savages	O
who	O
used	O
to	O
come	O
on	O

on	O
the	O
farther	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O

on	O
the	O
same	O
man-eating	O
occasions	O
he	O
was	O
now	O
brought	O
for	O

and	O
some	O
time	O
after	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
took	O
the	O
courage	O
to	O
carry	O
him	O
to	O
that	O
side	O
,	O
being	O
the	O
same	O
I	O
formerly	O
mentioned	O
,	O
he	O
presently	O
knew	O
the	O
place	O

and	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
was	O
there	O
once	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
ate	O
up	O
twenty	O
men	O
,	O
two	O
women	O

and	O
one	O
child	O
;	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
twenty	O
in	O
English	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
numbered	O
them	O
by	O
laying	O
so	O
many	O
stones	O
in	O
a	O
row	O
,	O
and	O
pointing	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
tell	O
them	O
over	O

I	O
have	O
told	O
this	O
passage	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
introduces	O
what	O
follows	O
:	O
that	O
after	O
this	O
discourse	O
I	O
had	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
I	O
asked	O
him	O
how	O
far	O
it	O
was	O
from	O
our	O
island	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O

and	O
whether	O
the	O

were	O
not	O

was	O

that	O
after	O
a	O

out	O

was	O
a	O

This	O
I	O
understood	O
to	O
be	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
the	O
sets	O
of	O
the	O
tide	O
,	O
as	O
going	O
out	O
or	O
coming	O
in	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
afterwards	O
understood	O
it	O
was	O
occasioned	O
by	O
the	O
great	O
draft	O
and	O
reflux	O
of	O
the	O
mighty	O
river	O
Orinoco	PNM
,	O
in	O
the	O
mouth	O
or	O
gulf	O
of	O
which	O
river	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
found	O
afterwards	O
,	O
our	O
island	O
lay	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
this	O
land	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
perceived	O
to	O
be	O
W.	O
and	O
NW.	O
,	O
was	O
the	O
great	O
island	O
Trinidad	PNM

on	O
the	O
north	O
point	O
of	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
river	O

I	O
asked	O
Friday	O
a	O
thousand	O
questions	O
about	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
nations	O
were	O
near	O
;	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
all	O
he	O
knew	O
with	O
the	O
greatest	O
openness	O
imaginable	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
the	O
names	O
of	O
the	O
several	O
nations	O
of	O
his	O
sort	O
of	O
people	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
get	O
no	O
other	O
name	O
than	O
Caribs	O
;	O
from	O
whence	O
I	O
easily	O
understood	O
that	O
these	O
were	O
the	O
Caribbees	O
,	O
which	O
our	O
maps	O
place	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
America	PNM
which	O
reaches	O
from	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
Orinoco	PNM
to	O
Guiana	PNM
,	O
and	O
onwards	O
to	O
St.	PNM
Martha	PNM
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
up	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
beyond	O
the	O
moon	O
,	O
that	O
was	O
beyond	O
the	O
setting	O
of	O
the	O
moon	O
,	O
which	O
must	O
be	O
west	O
from	O
their	O
country	O
,	O
there	O
dwelt	O
white	O
bearded	O
men	O
,	O
like	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
pointed	O
to	O
my	O
great	O
whiskers	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
mentioned	O
before	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
killed	O
much	O
mans	O
,	O
that	O
was	O
his	O
word	O
:	O
by	O
all	O
which	O
I	O
understood	O
he	O
meant	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
whose	O
cruelties	O
in	O
America	O
had	O
been	O
spread	O
over	O
the	O
whole	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
remembered	O
by	O
all	O
the	O
nations	O
from	O
father	O
to	O
son	O
.	O

I	O
inquired	O
if	O
he	O
could	O
tell	O
me	O
how	O
I	O
might	O
go	O
from	O
this	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
get	O
among	O
those	O
white	O
men	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
``	O
Yes	O
,	O
yes	O
,	O
you	O
may	O
go	O
in	O
two	O
canoe	O
.	O
''	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
understand	O
what	O
he	O
meant	O
,	O
or	O
make	O
him	O
describe	O
to	O
me	O
what	O
he	O
meant	O
by	O
two	O
canoe	O
,	O
till	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
with	O
great	O
difficulty	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
he	O
meant	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
large	O
boat	O
,	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
two	O
canoes	O
.	O

This	O
part	O
of	O
Friday	O
's	O
discourse	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
relish	O
very	O
well	O
;	O
and	O
from	O
this	O
time	O
I	O
entertained	O
some	O
hopes	O
that	O
,	O
one	O
time	O
or	O
other	O
,	O
I	O
might	O
find	O
an	O
opportunity	O
to	O
make	O
my	O
escape	O
from	O
this	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
this	O
poor	O
savage	O
might	O
be	O
a	O
means	O
to	O
help	O
me	O
.	O

During	O
the	O
long	O
time	O
that	O
Friday	O
had	O
now	O
been	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
speak	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
understand	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
wanting	O
to	O
lay	O
a	O
foundation	O
of	O
religious	O
knowledge	O
in	O
his	O
mind	O
;	O
particularly	O
I	O
asked	O
him	O
one	O
time	O
,	O
who	O
made	O
him	O
.	O

The	O
creature	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
me	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
but	O
thought	O
I	O
had	O
asked	O
who	O
was	O
his	O
father	O
--	O
but	O
I	O
took	O
it	O
up	O
by	O
another	O
handle	O
,	O
and	O
asked	O
him	O
who	O
made	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
the	O
ground	O
we	O
walked	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
hills	O
and	O
woods	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
``	O
It	O
was	O
one	O
Benamuckee	O
,	O
that	O
lived	O
beyond	O
all	O
;	O
''	O
he	O
could	O
describe	O
nothing	O
of	O
this	O
great	O
person	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
very	O
old	O
,	O
``	O
much	O
older	O
,	O
''	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
``	O
than	O
the	O
sea	O
or	O
land	O
,	O
than	O
the	O
moon	O
or	O
the	O
stars	O
.	O
''	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
then	O
,	O
if	O
this	O
old	O
person	O
had	O
made	O
all	O
things	O
,	O
why	O
did	O
not	O
all	O
things	O
worship	O
him	O
?	O

He	O
looked	O
very	O
grave	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
perfect	O
look	O
of	O
innocence	O
,	O
said	O
,	O
``	O
All	O
things	O
say	O
O	O
to	O
him	O
.	O
''	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
if	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
die	O
in	O
his	O
country	O
went	O
away	O
anywhere	O
?	O

He	O
said	O
,	O
``	O
Yes	O
;	O
they	O
all	O
went	O
to	O
Benamuckee	PNM
.	O
''	O

Then	O
I	O
asked	O
him	O
whether	O
those	O
they	O
eat	O
up	O
went	O
thither	O
too	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
,	O
``	O
Yes	O
.	O
''	O

From	O
these	O
things	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
instruct	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
knowledge	O
of	O
the	O
true	O
God	O
;	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
the	O
great	O
Maker	O
of	O
all	O
things	O
lived	O
up	O
there	O
,	O
pointing	O
up	O
towards	O
heaven	O
;	O
that	O
He	O
governed	O
the	O
world	O
by	O
the	O
same	O
power	O
and	O
providence	O
by	O
which	O
He	O
made	O
it	O
;	O
that	O
He	O
was	O
omnipotent	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
do	O
everything	O
for	O
us	O
,	O
give	O
everything	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
take	O
everything	O
from	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
,	O
by	O
degrees	O
,	O
I	O
opened	O
his	O
eyes	O
.	O

He	O
listened	O
with	O
great	O
attention	O
,	O
and	O
received	O
with	O
pleasure	O
the	O
notion	O
of	O
Jesus	O
Christ	O
being	O
sent	O
to	O
redeem	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
making	O
our	O
prayers	O
to	O
God	O
,	O
and	O
His	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
hear	O
us	O
,	O
even	O
in	O
heaven	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
one	O
day	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
our	O
God	O
could	O
hear	O
us	O
,	O
up	O
beyond	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
he	O
must	O
needs	O
be	O
a	O
greater	O
God	O
than	O
their	O
Benamuckee	O
,	O
who	O
lived	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
could	O
not	O
hear	O
till	O
they	O
went	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
great	O
mountains	O
where	O
he	O
dwelt	O
to	O
speak	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
if	O
ever	O
he	O
went	O
thither	O
to	O
speak	O
to	O
him	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
,	O
``	O
No	O
;	O
they	O
never	O
went	O
that	O
were	O
young	O
men	O
;	O
none	O
went	O
thither	O
but	O
the	O
old	O
men	O
,	O
''	O
whom	O
he	O
called	O
their	O
Oowokakee	O
;	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
made	O
him	O
explain	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
their	O
religious	O
,	O
or	O
clergy	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
went	O
to	O
say	O
O	O
-LRB-	O
so	O
he	O
called	O
saying	O
prayers	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
came	O
back	O
and	O
told	O
them	O
what	O
Benamuckee	O
said	O
.	O

By	O
this	O
I	O
observed	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
priestcraft	O
even	O
among	O
the	O
most	O
blinded	O
,	O
ignorant	O
pagans	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
policy	O
of	O
making	O
a	O
secret	O
of	O
religion	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
preserve	O
the	O
veneration	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
to	O
the	O
clergy	O
,	O
not	O
only	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
Roman	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
among	O
all	O
religions	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
even	O
among	O
the	O
most	O
brutish	O
and	O
barbarous	O
savages	O
.	O

I	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
clear	O
up	O
this	O
fraud	O
to	O
my	O
man	O
Friday	O
;	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
the	O
pretence	O
of	O
their	O
old	O
men	O
going	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
mountains	O
to	O
say	O
O	O
to	O
their	O
god	O
Benamuckee	O
was	O
a	O
cheat	O
;	O
and	O
their	O
bringing	O
word	O
from	O
thence	O
what	O
he	O
said	O
was	O
much	O
more	O
so	O
;	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
met	O
with	O
any	O
answer	O
,	O
or	O
spake	O
with	O
any	O
one	O
there	O
,	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
with	O
an	O
evil	O
spirit	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
entered	O
into	O
a	O
long	O
discourse	O
with	O
him	O
about	O
the	O
devil	O
,	O
the	O
origin	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
his	O
rebellion	O
against	O
God	O
,	O
his	O
enmity	O
to	O
man	O
,	O
the	O
reason	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
his	O
setting	O
himself	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
dark	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
to	O
be	O
worshipped	O
instead	O
of	O
God	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
God	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
many	O
stratagems	O
he	O
made	O
use	O
of	O
to	O
delude	O
mankind	O
to	O
their	O
ruin	O
;	O
how	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
secret	O
access	O
to	O
our	O
passions	O

to	O
our	O
affections	O

and	O
to	O
adapt	O
his	O
snares	O
to	O
our	O
inclinations	O

so	O
as	O
to	O
cause	O
us	O
even	O
to	O
be	O
our	O

tempters	O
,	O
and	O
run	O
upon	O
our	O
destruction	O
by	O
our	O
own	O
choice	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
easy	O
to	O
imprint	O
right	O
notions	O
in	O
his	O
mind	O
about	O
the	O
devil	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
about	O
the	O
being	O
of	O
a	O
God	O
.	O

Nature	O
assisted	O
all	O
my	O
arguments	O

evidence	O
to	O
him	O

the	O
necessity	O

a	O

paying	O
homage	O
to	O
Him	O
that	O
made	O
us	O

and	O
the	O
like	O

but	O
there	O
appeared	O
nothing	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
in	O
the	O
notion	O
of	O
an	O
evil	O
spirit	O

of	O
his	O
origin	O
,	O
his	O
being	O
,	O
his	O
nature	O

above	O
all	O

of	O
his	O
inclination	O

evil	O

and	O
to	O
draw	O
us	O
in	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
too	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
poor	O
creature	O
puzzled	O
me	O
once	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
manner	O
,	O
by	O
a	O
question	O
merely	O
natural	O
and	O
innocent	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
scarce	O
knew	O
what	O
to	O
say	O
to	O
him	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
been	O
talking	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
to	O
him	O
of	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
God	O
,	O
His	O
omnipotence	O

His	O
aversion	O
to	O

His	O
being	O
a	O
consuming	O
fire	O
to	O
the	O

of	O
iniquity	O

how	O

as	O
He	O

us	O
all	O

He	O
could	O
destroy	O
us	O
and	O
all	O
the	O

in	O
a	O

and	O
he	O
listened	O
with	O
great	O
seriousness	O
to	O
me	O
all	O
the	O

After	O
this	O
I	O
had	O

telling	O
him	O
how	O
the	O
devil	O
was	O
God	O
's	O
enemy	O
in	O
the	O
hearts	O
of	O

used	O

was	O
wonderfully	O
delighted	O
with	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
made	O
him	O
a	O
belt	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
frog	O
hanging	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
in	O
England	PNM
we	O
wear	O
hangers	O
in	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
frog	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
a	O
hanger	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
hatchet	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
not	O
only	O
as	O
good	O
a	O
weapon	O
in	O
some	O
cases	O
,	O
but	O
much	O
more	O
useful	O
upon	O
other	O
occasions	O
.	O

I	O
described	O
to	O
him	O
the	O
country	O
of	O
Europe	PNM
,	O
particularly	O
England	PNM
,	O
which	O
I	O
came	O
from	O
;	O
how	O
we	O
lived	O
,	O
how	O
we	O
worshipped	O
God	O
,	O
how	O
we	O
behaved	O
to	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
we	O
traded	O
in	O
ships	O
to	O
all	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

I	O
gave	O
him	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
wreck	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
on	O
board	O
of	O
,	O
and	O
showed	O
him	O
,	O
as	O
near	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
she	O
lay	O
;	O
but	O
she	O
was	O
all	O
beaten	O
in	O
pieces	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
gone	O
.	O

I	O
showed	O
him	O
the	O
ruins	O
of	O
our	O
boat	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
lost	O
when	O
we	O
escaped	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
stir	O
with	O
my	O
whole	O
strength	O
then	O
;	O
but	O
was	O
now	O
fallen	O
almost	O
all	O
to	O
pieces	O
.	O

Upon	O
seeing	O
this	O
boat	O
,	O
Friday	O
stood	O
,	O
musing	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
nothing	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
he	O
studied	O
upon	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
says	O
he	O
,	O
``	O
Me	O
see	O
such	O
boat	O
like	O
come	O
to	O
place	O
at	O
my	O
nation	O

''	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
him	O
a	O
good	O
while	O
;	O
but	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
had	O
examined	O
further	O
into	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
understood	O
by	O
him	O
that	O
a	O
boat	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
,	O
came	O
on	O
shore	O
upon	O
the	O
country	O
where	O
he	O
lived	O
:	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
explained	O
it	O
,	O
was	O
driven	O
thither	O
by	O
stress	O
of	O
weather	O
.	O

I	O
presently	O
imagined	O
that	O
some	O
European	O
ship	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
cast	O
away	O
upon	O
their	O
coast	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
boat	O
might	O
get	O
loose	O
and	O
drive	O
ashore	O
;	O
but	O
was	O
so	O
dull	O
that	O
I	O
never	O
once	O
thought	O
of	O
men	O
making	O
their	O
escape	O
from	O
a	O
wreck	O
thither	O
,	O
much	O
less	O
whence	O
they	O
might	O
come	O
:	O
so	O
I	O
only	O
inquired	O
after	O
a	O
description	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
.	O

Friday	O
described	O
the	O
boat	O
to	O
me	O
well	O
enough	O
;	O
but	O
brought	O
me	O
better	O
to	O
understand	O
him	O
when	O
he	O
added	O
with	O
some	O
warmth	O
,	O
``	O
We	O
save	O
the	O
white	O
mans	O
from	O
drown	O
.	O
''	O

Then	O
I	O
presently	O
asked	O
if	O
there	O
were	O
any	O
white	O
mans	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
called	O
them	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
.	O

``	O
Yes	O
,	O
''	O
he	O
said	O
;	O
``	O
the	O
boat	O
full	O
of	O
white	O
mans	O
.	O
''	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
how	O
many	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
upon	O
his	O
fingers	O
seventeen	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
then	O
what	O
became	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
``	O
They	O
live	O
,	O
they	O
dwell	O
at	O
my	O
nation	O
.	O
''	O

This	O
put	O
new	O
thoughts	O
into	O
my	O
head	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
presently	O
imagined	O
that	O
these	O
might	O
be	O
the	O
men	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
that	O
was	O
cast	O
away	O
in	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
my	O
island	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
now	O
called	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
who	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
struck	O
on	O
the	O
rock	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
saw	O
her	O
inevitably	O
lost	O
,	O
had	O
saved	O
themselves	O
in	O
their	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
landed	O
upon	O
that	O
wild	O
shore	O
among	O
the	O
savages	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
I	O
inquired	O
of	O
him	O
more	O
critically	O
what	O
was	O
become	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

He	O
assured	O
me	O
they	O
lived	O
still	O
there	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
there	O
about	O
four	O
years	O
;	O
that	O
the	O
savages	O
left	O
them	O
alone	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
them	O
victuals	O
to	O
live	O
on	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
how	O
it	O
came	O
to	O
pass	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
kill	O
them	O
and	O
eat	O
them	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
,	O
``	O
No	O
,	O
they	O
make	O
brother	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
''	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
understood	O
him	O
,	O
a	O
truce	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
he	O
added	O
,	O
``	O
They	O
no	O
eat	O
mans	O
but	O
when	O
make	O
the	O
war	O
fight	O
;	O
''	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
they	O
never	O
eat	O
any	O
men	O
but	O
such	O
as	O
come	O
to	O
fight	O
with	O
them	O
and	O
are	O
taken	O
in	O
battle	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
after	O
this	O
some	O
considerable	O
time	O
,	O
that	O
being	O
upon	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
at	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
from	O
whence	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
clear	O
day	O
,	O
discovered	O
the	O
main	O
or	O
continent	O
of	O
America	PNM
,	O
Friday	O
,	O
the	O
weather	O
being	O
very	O
serene	O
,	O
looks	O
very	O
earnestly	O
towards	O
the	O
mainland	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
surprise	O
,	O
falls	O
a	O
jumping	O
and	O
dancing	O
,	O
and	O
calls	O
out	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
some	O
distance	O
from	O
him	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
what	O
was	O
the	O
matter	O
.	O

``	O
Oh	O
,	O
joy	O

says	O
he	O

``	O
Oh	O

there	O

my	O
country	O

there	O
my	O

''	O

I	O
observed	O
an	O
extraordinary	O
sense	O
of	O
pleasure	O
appeared	O
in	O
his	O
face	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
eyes	O
sparkled	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
countenance	O
discovered	O
a	O
strange	O
eagerness	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
mind	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
his	O
own	O
country	O
again	O
.	O

This	O
observation	O
of	O
mine	O
put	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
thoughts	O
into	O
me	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
me	O
at	O
first	O
not	O
so	O
easy	O
about	O
my	O
new	O
man	O
Friday	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
before	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
made	O
no	O
doubt	O
but	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
Friday	O
could	O
get	O
back	O
to	O
his	O
own	O
nation	O
again	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
only	O
forget	O
all	O
his	O
religion	O
but	O
all	O
his	O
obligation	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
be	O
forward	O
enough	O
to	O
give	O
his	O
countrymen	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
come	O
back	O
,	O
perhaps	O
with	O
a	O
hundred	O
or	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
a	O
feast	O
upon	O
me	O
,	O
at	O
which	O
he	O
might	O
be	O
as	O
merry	O
as	O
he	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
with	O
those	O
of	O
his	O
enemies	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
taken	O
in	O
war	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
wronged	O
the	O
poor	O
honest	O
creature	O
very	O
much	O
,	O
for	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
sorry	O
afterwards	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
as	O
my	O
jealousy	O
increased	O
,	O
and	O
held	O
some	O
weeks	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
circumspect	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
so	O
familiar	O
and	O
kind	O
to	O
him	O
as	O
before	O
:	O
in	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
certainly	O
wrong	O
too	O
;	O
the	O
honest	O
,	O
grateful	O
creature	O
having	O
no	O
thought	O
about	O
it	O
but	O
what	O
consisted	O
with	O
the	O
best	O
principles	O
,	O
both	O
as	O
a	O
religious	O
Christian	O
and	O
as	O
a	O
grateful	O
friend	O
,	O
as	O
appeared	O
afterwards	O
to	O
my	O
full	O
satisfaction	O
.	O

While	O
my	O
jealousy	O
of	O
him	O
lasted	O
,	O
you	O
may	O
be	O
sure	O
I	O
was	O
every	O
day	O
pumping	O
him	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
discover	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
new	O
thoughts	O
which	O
I	O
suspected	O
were	O
in	O
him	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
found	O
everything	O
he	O
said	O
was	O
so	O
honest	O
and	O
so	O
innocent	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
find	O
nothing	O
to	O
nourish	O
my	O
suspicion	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
spite	O
of	O
all	O
my	O
uneasiness	O
,	O
he	O
made	O
me	O
at	O
last	O
entirely	O
his	O
own	O
again	O
;	O
nor	O
did	O
he	O
in	O
the	O
least	O
perceive	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
uneasy	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
I	O
could	O
not	O

him	O
of	O
deceit	O

One	O
day	O

no	O

not	O

way	O
of	O
discourse	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
I	O
would	O
give	O
him	O
a	O
boat	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
his	O
own	O
nation	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
accordingly	O
,	O
I	O
carried	O
him	O
to	O
my	O
frigate	O
,	O
which	O
lay	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
cleared	O
it	O
of	O
water	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
I	O
always	O
kept	O
it	O
sunk	O
in	O
water	O
-RRB-	O

I	O
brought	O
it	O
out	O
,	O
showed	O
it	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
both	O
went	O
into	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
most	O
dexterous	O
fellow	O
at	O
managing	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
make	O
it	O
go	O
almost	O
as	O
swift	O
again	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
.	O

So	O
when	O
he	O
was	O
in	O
,	O
I	O
said	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
``	O
Well	O

He	O
looked	O
very	O
dull	O
at	O
my	O
saying	O
so	O
;	O
which	O
it	O
seems	O
was	O
because	O
he	O
thought	O
the	O
boat	O
was	O
too	O
small	O
to	O
go	O
so	O
far	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
told	O
him	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
bigger	O
;	O
so	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
the	O
first	O
boat	O
lay	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
,	O
but	O
which	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
that	O
was	O
big	O
enough	O
;	O
but	O
then	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
taken	O
no	O
care	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
had	O
lain	O
two	O

three	O

twenty	O
years	O
there	O

the	O
sun	O
had	O
so	O
split	O

dried	O
it	O

that	O
it	O
was	O

Friday	O
told	O
me	O
such	O
a	O

would	O
do	O
very	O
well	O

Upon	O
the	O
whole	O

I	O
was	O
by	O
this	O

fixed	O
upon	O
my	O
design	O
of	O
going	O
over	O
with	O
him	O
to	O
the	O

that	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
we	O
would	O
go	O

make	O
one	O

big	O
as	O
that	O

and	O

should	O
go	O

He	O
answered	O
not	O

looked	O
very	O
grave	O
and	O
sad	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
what	O
was	O
the	O
matter	O
with	O
him	O

He	O
asked	O
me	O
again	O

I	O

him	O

``	O

In	O
a	O

He	O
looked	O

again	O
at	O
that	O

running	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
the	O

This	O
he	O
spoke	O
so	O
earnestly	O
that	O
I	O
saw	O
tears	O
stand	O
in	O
his	O
eyes	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
I	O
so	O
plainly	O
discovered	O
the	O
utmost	O
affection	O
in	O
him	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
firm	O
resolution	O
in	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
then	O
and	O
often	O
after	O

that	O
I	O
would	O
never	O
send	O
him	O
away	O
from	O
me	O
if	O
he	O
was	O
willing	O
to	O
stay	O
with	O
me	O

Upon	O
the	O
whole	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
found	O
by	O
all	O
his	O
discourse	O
a	O
settled	O
affection	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
nothing	O
could	O
part	O
him	O
from	O
me	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
found	O
all	O
the	O
foundation	O
of	O
his	O
desire	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
his	O
own	O
country	O
was	O
laid	O
in	O
his	O
ardent	O
affection	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
hopes	O
of	O
my	O
doing	O
them	O
good	O
;	O
a	O
thing	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
notion	O
of	O
myself	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
the	O
least	O
thought	O
or	O
intention	O
,	O
or	O
desire	O
of	O
undertaking	O
it	O
.	O

But	O
still	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
strong	O
inclination	O
to	O
attempting	O
my	O
escape	O
,	O
founded	O
on	O
the	O
supposition	O
gathered	O
from	O
the	O
discourse	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
seventeen	O
bearded	O
men	O
there	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
,	O
without	O
any	O
more	O
delay	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
Friday	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
a	O
great	O
tree	O
proper	O
to	O
fell	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
a	O
large	O
periagua	O
,	O
or	O
canoe	O
,	O
to	O
undertake	O
the	O
voyage	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
trees	O
enough	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
to	O
have	O
built	O
a	O
little	O
fleet	O
,	O
not	O
of	O
periaguas	O
or	O
canoes	O
,	O
but	O
even	O
of	O
good	O
,	O
large	O
vessels	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
main	O
thing	O
I	O
looked	O
at	O
was	O
,	O
to	O
get	O
one	O
so	O
near	O
the	O
water	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
launch	O
it	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
made	O
,	O
to	O
avoid	O
the	O
mistake	O
I	O
committed	O
at	O
first	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
Friday	O
pitched	O
upon	O
a	O
tree	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
found	O
he	O
knew	O
much	O
better	O
than	O
I	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
wood	O
was	O
fittest	O
for	O
it	O
;	O
nor	O
can	O
I	O
tell	O
to	O
this	O
day	O
what	O
wood	O
to	O
call	O
the	O
tree	O
we	O
cut	O
down	O
,	O
except	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
like	O
the	O
tree	O
we	O
call	O
fustic	O
,	O
or	O
between	O
that	O
and	O
the	O
Nicaragua	O
wood	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
much	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
colour	O
and	O
smell	O
.	O

Friday	O
wished	O
to	O
burn	O
the	O
hollow	O
or	O
cavity	O
of	O
this	O
tree	O
out	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
boat	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
showed	O
him	O
how	O
to	O
cut	O
it	O
with	O
tools	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
after	O
I	O
had	O
showed	O
him	O
how	O
to	O
use	O
,	O
he	O
did	O
very	O
handily	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
about	O
a	O
month	O
's	O
hard	O
labour	O
we	O
finished	O
it	O
and	O
made	O
it	O
very	O
handsome	O
;	O
especially	O
when	O
,	O
with	O
our	O
axes	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
showed	O
him	O
how	O
to	O
handle	O
,	O
we	O
cut	O
and	O
hewed	O
the	O
outside	O
into	O
the	O
true	O
shape	O
of	O
a	O
boat	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
it	O
cost	O
us	O
near	O
a	O
fortnight	O
's	O
time	O
to	O
get	O
her	O
along	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
inch	O
by	O
inch	O
,	O
upon	O
great	O
rollers	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
she	O
was	O
in	O
,	O
she	O
would	O
have	O
carried	O
twenty	O
men	O
with	O
great	O
ease	O
.	O

When	O
she	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
though	O
she	O
was	O
so	O
big	O
,	O
it	O
amazed	O
me	O
to	O
see	O
with	O
what	O
dexterity	O
and	O
how	O
swift	O
my	O
man	O
Friday	O
could	O
manage	O
her	O
,	O
turn	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
paddle	O
her	O
along	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
asked	O
him	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
we	O
might	O
venture	O
over	O
in	O
her	O
.	O

``	O
Yes	O
,	O
''	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
``	O
we	O
venture	O
over	O
in	O
her	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
though	O
great	O
blow	O
wind	O
.	O
''	O

However	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
further	O
design	O
that	O
he	O
knew	O
nothing	O
of	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
mast	O
and	O
a	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
fit	O
her	O
with	O
an	O
anchor	O
and	O
cable	O
.	O

As	O
to	O
a	O
mast	O
,	O
that	O
was	O
easy	O
enough	O
to	O
get	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
pitched	O
upon	O
a	O
straight	O
young	O
cedar-tree	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
found	O
near	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
there	O
were	O
great	O
plenty	O
of	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
set	O
Friday	O
to	O
work	O
to	O
cut	O
it	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
him	O
directions	O
how	O
to	O
shape	O
and	O
order	O
it	O
.	O

But	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
sail	O
,	O
that	O
was	O
my	O
particular	O
care	O
.	O

I	O
knew	O
I	O
had	O
old	O
sails	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
pieces	O
of	O
old	O
sails	O
,	O
enough	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
had	O
them	O
now	O
six-and-twenty	O
years	O
by	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
very	O
careful	O
to	O
preserve	O
them	O

not	O
imagining	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
ever	O
have	O
this	O

of	O

for	O
them	O

I	O
did	O
not	O

they	O
were	O
all	O
rotten	O

and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
so	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
two	O
pieces	O
which	O
appeared	O
pretty	O
good	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
these	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
work	O

and	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O

you	O
may	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
needles	O
,	O
I	O
at	O
length	O
made	O
a	O
three-cornered	O
ugly	O
thing	O

like	O
what	O
we	O
call	O
in	O
England	PNM
a	O

and	O

what	O
was	O
more	O
than	O
all	O

I	O
fixed	O
a	O
rudder	O
to	O
the	O
stern	O
of	O
her	O
to	O
steer	O
with	O

I	O
was	O
but	O
a	O
bungling	O
shipwright	O

yet	O
as	O
I	O
knew	O
the	O
usefulness	O
and	O
even	O
necessity	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
thing	O
,	O
I	O
applied	O
myself	O
with	O
so	O
much	O
pains	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
at	O
last	O
I	O
brought	O
it	O
to	O
pass	O
;	O
though	O

considering	O
the	O
many	O
dull	O
contrivances	O
I	O
had	O
for	O
it	O
that	O
failed	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
cost	O
me	O
almost	O
as	O
much	O
labour	O
as	O
making	O
the	O
boat	O
.	O

After	O
all	O
this	O
was	O
done	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
my	O
man	O
Friday	O
to	O
teach	O
as	O
to	O
what	O
belonged	O
to	O
the	O
navigation	O
of	O
my	O
boat	O
;	O
though	O
he	O
knew	O
very	O
well	O
how	O
to	O
paddle	O
a	O
canoe	O
,	O
he	O
knew	O
nothing	O
of	O
what	O
belonged	O
to	O
a	O
sail	O
and	O
a	O
rudder	O
;	O
and	O
was	O
the	O
most	O
amazed	O
when	O
he	O
saw	O
me	O
work	O
the	O
boat	O
to	O
and	O
again	O
in	O
the	O
sea	O
by	O
the	O
rudder	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
the	O
sail	O
jibed	O
,	O
and	O
filled	O
this	O
way	O
or	O
that	O
way	O
as	O
the	O
course	O
we	O
sailed	O
changed	O
;	O
I	O
say	O
when	O
he	O
saw	O
this	O
he	O
stood	O
like	O
one	O
astonished	O
and	O
amazed	O

However	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
little	O
use	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
all	O
these	O
things	O
familiar	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
became	O
an	O
expert	O
sailor	O
,	O
except	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
compass	O
I	O
could	O
make	O
him	O
understand	O
very	O

On	O
the	O

I	O
was	O

on	O
the	O
seven-and-twentieth	O
year	O
of	O
my	O
captivity	O
in	O
this	O

though	O
the	O

that	O
I	O
had	O
this	O

left	O
out	O

in	O
all	O

I	O
kept	O
the	O
anniversary	O
of	O
my	O
landing	O
here	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
thankfulness	O
to	O
God	O
for	O
His	O

as	O
at	O
first	O
:	O
and	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
such	O
cause	O
of	O
acknowledgment	O
at	O
first	O

I	O
had	O
much	O
more	O
so	O
now	O

having	O
such	O

testimonies	O
of	O
the	O
care	O
of	O

over	O

the	O
great	O
hopes	O
I	O
had	O
of	O
being	O
effectually	O
and	O
speedily	O
delivered	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
an	O
invincible	O
impression	O
upon	O
my	O
thoughts	O
that	O
my	O
deliverance	O
was	O
at	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
another	O
year	O
in	O
this	O
place	O

I	O
went	O
on	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
with	O
my	O
husbandry	O
;	O
digging	O
,	O
planting	O
,	O
and	O
fencing	O
as	O
usual	O

I	O
gathered	O
and	O
cured	O
my	O
grapes	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
every	O
necessary	O
thing	O
as	O
before	O
.	O

The	O
rainy	O
season	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
meantime	O
upon	O
me	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
kept	O
more	O
within	O
doors	O
than	O
at	O
other	O
times	O

We	O
had	O
stowed	O
our	O
new	O
vessel	O
as	O
secure	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
bringing	O
her	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
creek	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
in	O
the	O
beginning	O
,	O
I	O
landed	O
my	O
rafts	O
from	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
and	O
hauling	O
her	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
at	O
high-water	O
mark	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
my	O
man	O
Friday	O
dig	O
a	O
little	O
dock	O
,	O
just	O
big	O
enough	O
to	O
hold	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
just	O
deep	O
enough	O
to	O
give	O
her	O
water	O
enough	O
to	O
float	O
in	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
tide	O
was	O
out	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
a	O
strong	O
dam	O
across	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
water	O
out	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
she	O
lay	O
,	O
dry	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
tide	O
from	O
the	O
sea	O
:	O
and	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
rain	O
off	O
we	O
laid	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
boughs	O
of	O
trees	O
,	O
so	O
thick	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
as	O
well	O
thatched	O
as	O
a	O
house	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
we	O
waited	O
for	O
the	O
months	O
of	O
November	O
and	O
December	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
I	O
designed	O
to	O
make	O
my	O
adventure	O

When	O
the	O
settled	O
season	O
began	O
to	O
come	O
in	O

as	O
the	O
thought	O
of	O
my	O

returned	O
with	O
the	O
fair	O
weather	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
preparing	O
daily	O
for	O
the	O
voyage	O
.	O

And	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
I	O
did	O
was	O
to	O
lay	O
by	O
a	O
certain	O
quantity	O
of	O
provisions	O
,	O
being	O
the	O
stores	O
for	O
our	O
voyage	O

and	O
intended	O
in	O
a	O
week	O
or	O
a	O
fortnight	O

time	O
to	O
open	O
the	O
dock	O
,	O
and	O
launch	O
out	O
our	O
boat	O

I	O
was	O
busy	O
one	O
morning	O
upon	O
something	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
called	O
to	O
Friday	O
,	O
and	O
bid	O
him	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
sea-shore	O
and	O
see	O
if	O
he	O
could	O
find	O
a	O
turtle	O
or	O
a	O
tortoise	O
,	O
a	O
thing	O
which	O
we	O
generally	O
got	O
once	O
a	O
week	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
the	O
eggs	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
flesh	O

Friday	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
long	O
gone	O
when	O
he	O
came	O
running	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
flew	O
over	O
my	O
outer	O
wall	O

fence	O

like	O
one	O
that	O

I	O

up	O

However	O

I	O
saw	O
the	O

terribly	O
scared	O

for	O
nothing	O

in	O

that	O

would	O
cut	O
him	O

the	O

trembled	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
scarcely	O

I	O
comforted	O

I	O

So	O
I	O
went	O
and	O
fetched	O
a	O
good	O
dram	O

gave	O
him	O
;	O
for	O
I	O

so	O
good	O
a	O
husband	O
of	O
my	O

that	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
left	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
drunk	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
him	O
take	O
the	O
two	O
fowling-pieces	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
always	O
carried	O
,	O
and	O
loaded	O
them	O
with	O
large	O
swan-shot	O

as	O
big	O

Then	O
I	O
took	O
four	O
muskets	O

loaded	O
them	O
with	O
two	O
slugs	O

five	O

my	O
two	O
pistols	O
I	O
loaded	O

a	O
brace	O

I	O
hung	O
my	O
great	O

as	O

naked	O
by	O

gave	O
Friday	O
his	O

When	O
I	O
had	O
thus	O
prepared	O
myself	O

I	O
took	O
my	O
perspective	O

went	O
up	O
to	O

side	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O

to	O
see	O
what	O
I	O
could	O
discover	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
found	O
quickly	O
by	O
my	O
glass	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
one-and-twenty	O
savages	O
,	O
three	O
prisoners	O
,	O
and	O
three	O
canoes	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
their	O
whole	O
business	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
triumphant	O
banquet	O
upon	O
these	O
three	O
human	O
bodies	O
:	O
a	O
barbarous	O
feast	O
,	O
indeed	O

but	O
nothing	O
more	O
than	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
observed	O
,	O
was	O
usual	O
with	O
them	O

I	O
observed	O
also	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
landed	O
,	O
not	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
done	O
when	O
Friday	O
made	O
his	O
escape	O
,	O
but	O
nearer	O
to	O
my	O
creek	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
shore	O
was	O
low	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
a	O
thick	O
wood	O
came	O
almost	O
close	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
sea	O

This	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
abhorrence	O
of	O
the	O
inhuman	O
errand	O
these	O
wretches	O
came	O
about	O
,	O
filled	O
me	O
with	O
such	O
indignation	O
that	O
I	O
came	O
down	O
again	O
to	O
Friday	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
I	O
was	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
down	O
to	O
them	O
and	O
kill	O
them	O
all	O
;	O
and	O
asked	O
him	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
stand	O
by	O
me	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
now	O
got	O
over	O
his	O
fright	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
spirits	O
being	O
a	O
little	O
raised	O
with	O
the	O
dram	O
I	O
had	O
given	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
very	O
cheerful	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
die	O
when	O
I	O
bid	O
die	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
fit	O
of	O
fury	O
I	O
divided	O
the	O
arms	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
charged	O
,	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
between	O
us	O
;	O
I	O
gave	O
Friday	O
one	O
pistol	O
to	O
stick	O
in	O
his	O
girdle	O
,	O
and	O
three	O
guns	O
upon	O
his	O
shoulder	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
took	O
one	O
pistol	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
three	O
guns	O
myself	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
this	O
posture	O
we	O
marched	O
out	O
.	O

I	O
took	O
a	O
small	O
bottle	O
of	O
rum	O
in	O
my	O
pocket	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
Friday	O
a	O
large	O
bag	O
with	O
more	O
powder	O
and	O
bullets	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
to	O
orders	O
,	O
I	O
charged	O
him	O
to	O
keep	O
close	O
behind	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
to	O
stir	O
,	O
or	O
shoot	O
,	O
or	O
do	O
anything	O
till	O
I	O
bid	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
meantime	O
not	O
to	O
speak	O
a	O
word	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
posture	O
I	O
fetched	O
a	O
compass	O
to	O
my	O
right	O

which	O
I	O

by	O
my	O

While	O
I	O
was	O
making	O
this	O
march	O

my	O
former	O
thoughts	O
returning	O

I	O

to	O

my	O
resolution	O
:	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
mean	O
that	O
I	O
entertained	O
any	O
fear	O
of	O
their	O
number	O
,	O
for	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
naked	O
,	O
unarmed	O

,	O
it	O
is	O
certain	O
I	O
was	O
superior	O
to	O
them	O
--	O
nay	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
alone	O

But	O
it	O
occurred	O
to	O
my	O
thoughts	O
,	O
what	O
call	O
,	O
what	O
occasion	O
,	O
much	O
less	O
what	O
necessity	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
dip	O
my	O
hands	O
in	O
blood	O
,	O
to	O
attack	O
people	O
who	O
had	O
neither	O
done	O
or	O
intended	O
me	O
any	O
wrong	O

who	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
were	O
innocent	O
,	O
and	O
whose	O
barbarous	O
customs	O
were	O
their	O
own	O
disaster	O
,	O
being	O
in	O
them	O
a	O
token	O

indeed	O

of	O
God	O

with	O
the	O

to	O
such	O

and	O
to	O
such	O
inhuman	O
courses	O
,	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
call	O
me	O
to	O
take	O
upon	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
judge	O
of	O
their	O
actions	O
,	O
much	O
less	O
an	O
executioner	O
of	O
His	O
justice	O
--	O
that	O
whenever	O
He	O
thought	O
fit	O
He	O
would	O
take	O
the	O
cause	O
into	O
His	O
own	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
national	O
vengeance	O
punish	O
them	O
as	O
a	O
people	O
for	O
national	O
crimes	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
meantime	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
none	O
of	O
my	O
business	O
--	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
true	O
Friday	O
might	O
justify	O
it	O
,	O
because	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
declared	O
enemy	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
state	O
of	O
war	O
with	O
those	O
very	O
particular	O
people	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
lawful	O
for	O
him	O
to	O
attack	O
them	O
--	O
but	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
say	O
the	O
same	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
myself	O
.	O

These	O
things	O
were	O
so	O
warmly	O
pressed	O
upon	O
my	O
thoughts	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
as	O
I	O
went	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
resolved	O
I	O
would	O
only	O
go	O
and	O
place	O
myself	O
near	O
them	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
observe	O
their	O
barbarous	O
feast	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
act	O
then	O
as	O
God	O
should	O
direct	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
unless	O
something	O
offered	O
that	O
was	O
more	O
a	O
call	O
to	O
me	O
than	O
yet	O
I	O
knew	O
of	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
meddle	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

With	O
this	O
resolution	O
I	O
entered	O
the	O
wood	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
possible	O
wariness	O
and	O
silence	O
,	O
Friday	O
following	O
close	O
at	O
my	O
heels	O
,	O
I	O
marched	O
till	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
skirts	O
of	O
the	O
wood	O
on	O
the	O
side	O
which	O
was	O
next	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
only	O
that	O
one	O
corner	O
of	O
the	O
wood	O
lay	O
between	O
me	O
and	O
them	O
.	O

Here	O
I	O
called	O
softly	O
to	O
Friday	O
,	O
and	O
showing	O
him	O
a	O
great	O
tree	O
which	O
was	O
just	O
at	O
the	O
corner	O
of	O
the	O
wood	O
,	O
I	O
bade	O
him	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
and	O
bring	O
me	O
word	O
if	O
he	O
could	O
see	O
there	O
plainly	O
what	O
they	O
were	O
doing	O
.	O

He	O
did	O
so	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
immediately	O
back	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
plainly	O
viewed	O
there	O
--	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
about	O
their	O
fire	O
,	O
eating	O
the	O
flesh	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
prisoners	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
another	O
lay	O
bound	O
upon	O
the	O
sand	O
a	O
little	O
from	O
them	O
,	O
whom	O
he	O
said	O
they	O
would	O
kill	O
next	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
fired	O
the	O
very	O
soul	O
within	O
me	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
nation	O
,	O
but	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
bearded	O
men	O
he	O
had	O
told	O
me	O
of	O
,	O
that	O
came	O
to	O
their	O
country	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
filled	O
with	O
horror	O
at	O
the	O
very	O
naming	O
of	O
the	O
white	O
bearded	O
man	O
;	O
and	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
I	O
saw	O
plainly	O
by	O
my	O
glass	O
a	O
white	O
man	O
,	O
who	O
lay	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
with	O
his	O
hands	O
and	O
his	O
feet	O
tied	O
with	O
flags	O
,	O
or	O
things	O
like	O
rushes	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
an	O
European	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
clothes	O
on	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
another	O
tree	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
thicket	O
beyond	O
it	O
,	O
about	O
fifty	O
yards	O
nearer	O
to	O
them	O
than	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
by	O
going	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
about	O
,	O
I	O
saw	O
I	O
might	O
come	O
at	O
undiscovered	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
then	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
within	O
half	O
a	O
shot	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
withheld	O
my	O
passion	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
was	O
indeed	O
enraged	O
to	O
the	O
highest	O
degree	O
;	O
and	O
going	O
back	O
about	O
twenty	O
paces	O
,	O
I	O
got	O
behind	O
some	O
bushes	O
,	O
which	O
held	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
till	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
tree	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
little	O
rising	O
ground	O
,	O
which	O
gave	O
me	O
a	O
full	O
view	O
of	O
them	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
about	O
eighty	O
yards	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
now	O
not	O
a	O
moment	O
to	O
lose	O
,	O
for	O
nineteen	O
of	O
the	O
dreadful	O
wretches	O
sat	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
all	O
close	O
huddled	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
just	O
sent	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
to	O
butcher	O
the	O
poor	O
Christian	O
,	O
and	O
bring	O
him	O
perhaps	O
limb	O
by	O
limb	O
to	O
their	O
fire	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
stooping	O
down	O
to	O
untie	O
the	O
bands	O
at	O
his	O
feet	O
.	O

I	O
turned	O
to	O
Friday	O
.	O

``	O
Now	O
,	O
Friday	O
,	O
''	O
said	O
I	O
,	O
``	O
do	O
as	O
I	O

Friday	O
said	O
he	O
would	O

``	O
Then	O
,	O
Friday	O

says	O
I	O
,	O
``	O

exactly	O
as	O
you	O
see	O
me	O
do	O
;	O
fail	O

''	O

So	O
I	O
set	O
down	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
muskets	O
and	O
the	O
fowling-piece	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
Friday	O
did	O
the	O
like	O
by	O
his	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
the	O
other	O
musket	O
I	O
took	O
my	O
aim	O
at	O
the	O
savages	O
,	O
bidding	O
him	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
like	O
;	O
then	O
asking	O
him	O
if	O
he	O
was	O
ready	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
``	O
Yes	O

''	O

``	O
Then	O
fire	O
at	O
them	O

''	O
said	O
I	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
moment	O
I	O
fired	O
also	O
.	O

Friday	O
took	O
his	O
aim	O
so	O
much	O
better	O
than	O
I	O
,	O
that	O
on	O
the	O
side	O
that	O
he	O
shot	O
he	O
killed	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
wounded	O
three	O
more	O
;	O
and	O
on	O
my	O
side	O
I	O
killed	O
one	O
,	O
and	O
wounded	O
two	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
,	O
you	O
may	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
dreadful	O
consternation	O
:	O
and	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
that	O
were	O
not	O
hurt	O
jumped	O
upon	O
their	O
feet	O
,	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
immediately	O
know	O
which	O
way	O
to	O
run	O

or	O
which	O
way	O
to	O
look	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
knew	O
not	O
from	O
whence	O
their	O
destruction	O
came	O
.	O

Friday	O
kept	O
his	O
eyes	O
close	O
upon	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
bid	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
might	O
observe	O
what	O
I	O
did	O
;	O
so	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
first	O
shot	O
was	O
made	O
,	O
I	O
threw	O
down	O
the	O
piece	O

and	O
took	O
up	O
the	O
fowling-piece	O
,	O
and	O
Friday	O
did	O
the	O
like	O
;	O
he	O
saw	O
me	O
cock	O
and	O
present	O
;	O
he	O
did	O
the	O

again	O

``	O

with	O
that	O
I	O
fired	O
again	O
among	O
the	O
amazed	O
wretches	O

and	O
so	O
did	O
Friday	O
;	O

as	O
our	O

loaded	O
with	O
what	O
I	O
call	O
swan-shot	O

or	O
small	O
pistol-bullets	O

we	O
found	O
only	O
two	O

so	O
many	O
were	O
wounded	O
that	O
they	O
ran	O
about	O

all	O

``	O

upon	O

I	O
rushed	O
out	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
perceived	O

me	O

I	O

loud	O
as	O
I	O
could	O

do	O
so	O
too	O

I	O
could	O

was	O
not	O
very	O
fast	O

being	O
loaded	O
with	O
arms	O
as	O
I	O
was	O

I	O
made	O
directly	O
towards	O
the	O
poor	O

The	O
two	O
butchers	O
who	O
were	O
just	O
going	O
to	O

with	O
him	O
had	O
left	O
him	O
at	O
the	O
surprise	O
of	O
our	O

and	O
fled	O
in	O
a	O

to	O

had	O

into	O

I	O
turned	O
to	O
Friday	O

and	O
bade	O
him	O
step	O
forwards	O
and	O
fire	O
at	O
them	O

he	O

running	O
about	O
forty	O
yards	O

to	O
be	O
nearer	O

he	O
shot	O
at	O

I	O
thought	O

them	O
all	O

for	O
I	O
saw	O
them	O
all	O
fall	O
of	O
a	O
heap	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O

though	O
I	O
saw	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
up	O
again	O
quickly	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
he	O
killed	O
two	O
of	O
them	O

wounded	O
the	O
third	O

so	O
that	O
he	O

fired	O
at	O

I	O
pulled	O
out	O
my	O

the	O
poor	O

loosing	O
his	O
hands	O

feet	O

I	O
lifted	O
him	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
asked	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
tongue	O
what	O
he	O
was	O
.	O

He	O
answered	O
in	O
Latin	O
,	O
Christianus	O
;	O
but	O
was	O
so	O
weak	O
and	O
faint	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
scarce	O
stand	O
or	O
speak	O

I	O
took	O
my	O
bottle	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
pocket	O

gave	O
it	O
him	O

making	O
signs	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
drink	O

he	O
did	O

I	O

him	O
what	O

he	O
was	O

he	O
said	O

a	O
little	O
recovered	O
,	O
let	O
me	O
know	O

by	O
all	O
the	O
signs	O
he	O
could	O

how	O

he	O
was	O
in	O
my	O

for	O
his	O

``	O
Seignior	O

I	O

with	O
as	O
much	O

as	O
I	O
could	O

up	O

``	O

He	O
took	O
them	O
very	O

no	O

the	O
truth	O

as	O
the	O
whole	O
was	O
a	O
surprise	O
to	O
them	O

so	O
the	O
poor	O
creatures	O
were	O
so	O
much	O
frightened	O
with	O
the	O
noise	O
of	O
our	O
pieces	O
that	O
they	O
fell	O
down	O
for	O
mere	O
amazement	O

fear	O

and	O
had	O
no	O
more	O
power	O
to	O

their	O

than	O
their	O
flesh	O
had	O
to	O

our	O

that	O
was	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
those	O

Friday	O
shot	O
at	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O

for	O

I	O
kept	O
my	O

in	O

still	O
without	O
firing	O
,	O
being	O
willing	O
to	O
keep	O
my	O
charge	O
ready	O

because	O
I	O
had	O
given	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
my	O
pistol	O

sword	O
:	O
so	O
I	O
called	O
to	O
Friday	O
,	O
and	O
bade	O
him	O
run	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
tree	O
from	O
whence	O
we	O
first	O
fired	O
,	O
and	O
fetch	O
the	O
arms	O
which	O
lay	O
there	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
discharged	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
did	O
with	O
great	O
swiftness	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
giving	O
him	O
my	O
musket	O

I	O
sat	O
down	O
myself	O
to	O
load	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
again	O

and	O
bade	O
them	O
come	O
to	O
me	O
when	O
they	O
wanted	O

While	O
I	O
was	O
loading	O
these	O
pieces	O
,	O
there	O
happened	O
a	O
fierce	O
engagement	O
between	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
,	O
who	O
made	O
at	O
him	O
with	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
great	O
wooden	O
swords	O

the	O
weapon	O
that	O

to	O

him	O
before	O

if	O

it	O

The	O
Spaniard	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
as	O
bold	O
and	O
brave	O
as	O
could	O
be	O
imagined	O
,	O
though	O
weak	O
,	O
had	O
fought	O
the	O
Indian	O
a	O
good	O
while	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
cut	O
two	O
great	O
wounds	O
on	O
his	O
head	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
savage	O
being	O
a	O
stout	O
,	O
lusty	O
fellow	O
,	O
closing	O
in	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
had	O
thrown	O
him	O
down	O
,	O
being	O
faint	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
wringing	O
my	O
sword	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
hand	O
;	O
when	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
,	O
though	O
undermost	O

wisely	O
quitting	O
the	O
sword	O
,	O
drew	O
the	O
pistol	O
from	O
his	O
girdle	O
,	O
shot	O
the	O
savage	O
through	O
the	O
body	O
,	O
and	O
killed	O
him	O
upon	O
the	O
spot	O
,	O
before	O
I	O

who	O
was	O
running	O
to	O

him	O

him	O

Friday	O
,	O
being	O
now	O
left	O
to	O
his	O
liberty	O
,	O
pursued	O
the	O
flying	O
wretches	O
,	O
with	O
no	O
weapon	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
but	O
his	O
hatchet	O
:	O
and	O
with	O
that	O
he	O
despatched	O
those	O
three	O
who	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
before	O
,	O
were	O
wounded	O
at	O
first	O
,	O

fallen	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O

he	O
could	O
come	O
up	O
with	O
:	O
and	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
coming	O
to	O
me	O
for	O
a	O
gun	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
him	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
fowling-pieces	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
he	O
pursued	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O

wounded	O
them	O
both	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
run	O
,	O
they	O
both	O
got	O
from	O
him	O
into	O
the	O
wood	O
,	O
where	O
Friday	O
pursued	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
killed	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
other	O
was	O
too	O
nimble	O
for	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
he	O
was	O
wounded	O
,	O
yet	O
had	O
plunged	O
himself	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
swam	O
with	O
all	O
his	O
might	O
off	O
to	O
those	O
two	O
who	O
were	O
left	O
in	O
the	O
canoe	O
;	O
which	O
three	O
in	O
the	O
canoe	O
,	O
with	O
one	O
wounded	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
whether	O
he	O
died	O
or	O
no	O
,	O
were	O
all	O
that	O
escaped	O
our	O
hands	O
of	O
one-and-twenty	O

The	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
is	O
as	O
follows	O
:	O
Three	O
killed	O
at	O
our	O
first	O
shot	O
from	O
the	O
tree	O
;	O
two	O
killed	O
at	O
the	O
next	O

in	O

of	O

there	O

of	O
the	O
wounds	O

or	O
killed	O
by	O
Friday	O
in	O
his	O

whereof	O
one	O

--	O
twenty-one	O
in	O
all	O

Those	O
that	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
canoe	O
worked	O
hard	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
gun-shot	O
,	O
and	O
though	O
Friday	O
made	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
shots	O
at	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
find	O
that	O
he	O
hit	O
any	O
of	O
them	O

Friday	O
would	O
fain	O
have	O
had	O
me	O
take	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
canoes	O
,	O
and	O
pursue	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
indeed	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
anxious	O
about	O
their	O
escape	O
,	O
lest	O
,	O
carrying	O
the	O
news	O
home	O
to	O
their	O
people	O
,	O
they	O
should	O
come	O
back	O
perhaps	O
with	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
hundred	O
of	O
the	O
canoes	O
and	O
devour	O
us	O
by	O
mere	O
multitude	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
consented	O
to	O
pursue	O
them	O
by	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
running	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
canoes	O
,	O
I	O
jumped	O
in	O
and	O
bade	O
Friday	O
follow	O
me	O
:	O
but	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
canoe	O
I	O
was	O
surprised	O
to	O
find	O
another	O
poor	O
creature	O
lie	O
there	O
,	O
bound	O
hand	O
and	O
foot	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
was	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
slaughter	O
,	O
and	O
almost	O
dead	O
with	O
fear	O
,	O
not	O
knowing	O
what	O
was	O
the	O
matter	O
;	O
for	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
look	O
up	O
over	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
tied	O
so	O
hard	O
neck	O
and	O
heels	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
been	O
tied	O
so	O
long	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
really	O
but	O
little	O
life	O
in	O
him	O
.	O

I	O
immediately	O
cut	O
the	O
twisted	O
flags	O
or	O
rushes	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
bound	O
him	O
with	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
have	O
helped	O
him	O
up	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
stand	O
or	O
speak	O
,	O
but	O
groaned	O
most	O
piteously	O
,	O
believing	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
still	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
only	O
unbound	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
be	O
killed	O
.	O

When	O
Friday	O
came	O
to	O
him	O
I	O
bade	O
him	O
speak	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
tell	O
him	O
of	O
his	O
deliverance	O
;	O
and	O
pulling	O
out	O
my	O
bottle	O
,	O
made	O
him	O
give	O
the	O
poor	O
wretch	O
a	O
dram	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
news	O
of	O
his	O
being	O
delivered	O
,	O
revived	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
sat	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
.	O

But	O
when	O
Friday	O
came	O
to	O
hear	O
him	O
speak	O
,	O
and	O
look	O
in	O
his	O
face	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
moved	O
any	O
one	O
to	O
tears	O
to	O
have	O
seen	O
how	O
Friday	O
kissed	O
him	O
,	O
embraced	O
him	O
,	O
hugged	O
him	O
,	O
cried	O
,	O
laughed	O
,	O
hallooed	O
,	O
jumped	O
about	O
,	O
danced	O
,	O
sang	O
;	O
then	O
cried	O
again	O
,	O
wrung	O
his	O
hands	O
,	O
beat	O
his	O
own	O
face	O
and	O
head	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
sang	O
and	O
jumped	O
about	O
again	O
like	O
a	O
distracted	O
creature	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
while	O
before	O
I	O
could	O
make	O
him	O
speak	O
to	O
me	O
or	O
tell	O
me	O
what	O
was	O
the	O
matter	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
he	O
came	O
a	O
little	O
to	O
himself	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
his	O
father	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
not	O
easy	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
express	O
how	O
it	O
moved	O
me	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
ecstasy	O
and	O
filial	O
affection	O
had	O
worked	O
in	O
this	O
poor	O
savage	O
at	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
his	O
father	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
his	O
being	O
delivered	O
from	O
death	O
;	O
nor	O
indeed	O
can	O
I	O
describe	O
half	O
the	O
extravagances	O
of	O
his	O
affection	O
after	O
this	O
:	O
for	O
he	O
went	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
and	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
times	O
:	O
when	O
he	O
went	O
in	O
to	O
him	O
he	O
would	O
sit	O
down	O
by	O
him	O
,	O
open	O
his	O
breast	O
,	O
and	O
hold	O
his	O
father	O
's	O
head	O
close	O
to	O
his	O
bosom	O
for	O
many	O
minutes	O
together	O
,	O
to	O
nourish	O
it	O
;	O
then	O
he	O
took	O
his	O
arms	O
and	O
ankles	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
numbed	O
and	O
stiff	O
with	O
the	O
binding	O
,	O
and	O
chafed	O
and	O
rubbed	O
them	O
with	O
his	O
hands	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
,	O
perceiving	O
what	O
the	O
case	O
was	O
,	O
gave	O
him	O
some	O
rum	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
bottle	O
to	O
rub	O
them	O
with	O
,	O
which	O
did	O
them	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
good	O
.	O

This	O
affair	O
put	O
an	O
end	O
to	O
our	O
pursuit	O
of	O
the	O
canoe	O
with	O
the	O
other	O
savages	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
now	O
almost	O
out	O
of	O
sight	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
happy	O
for	O
us	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
blew	O
so	O
hard	O
within	O
two	O
hours	O
after	O
,	O
and	O
before	O
they	O
could	O
be	O
got	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
their	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
continued	O
blowing	O
so	O
hard	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
from	O
the	O
north-west	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
against	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
suppose	O
their	O
boat	O
could	O
live	O
,	O
or	O
that	O
they	O
ever	O
reached	O
their	O
own	O
coast	O
.	O

But	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
Friday	O
;	O
he	O
was	O
so	O
busy	O
about	O
his	O
father	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
find	O
in	O
my	O
heart	O
to	O
take	O
him	O
off	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
;	O
but	O
after	O
I	O
thought	O
he	O
could	O
leave	O
him	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
I	O
called	O
him	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
came	O
jumping	O
and	O
laughing	O
,	O
and	O
pleased	O
to	O
the	O
highest	O
extreme	O
:	O
then	O
I	O
asked	O
him	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
given	O
his	O
father	O
any	O
bread	O
.	O

He	O
shook	O
his	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
,	O
``	O
None	O
;	O
ugly	O
dog	O
eat	O
all	O
up	O
self	O
.	O
''	O

I	O
then	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
cake	O
of	O
bread	O
out	O
of	O
a	O
little	O
pouch	O
I	O
carried	O
on	O
purpose	O
;	O
I	O
also	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
dram	O
for	O
himself	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
taste	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
carried	O
it	O
to	O
his	O
father	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
in	O
my	O
pocket	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
bunches	O
of	O
raisins	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
handful	O
of	O
them	O
for	O
his	O
father	O

He	O
had	O
no	O
sooner	O
given	O
his	O
father	O
these	O
raisins	O
but	O
I	O
saw	O
him	O
come	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
run	O
away	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
bewitched	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
was	O
the	O
swiftest	O
fellow	O
on	O
his	O
feet	O
that	O
ever	O
I	O
saw	O
:	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
he	O
ran	O
at	O
such	O
a	O
rate	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
out	O
of	O
sight	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
in	O
an	O
instant	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
I	O
called	O
,	O
and	O
hallooed	O
out	O
too	O
after	O
him	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
all	O
one	O
--	O
away	O
he	O
went	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
I	O
saw	O
him	O
come	O
back	O
again	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
so	O
fast	O
as	O
he	O
went	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
he	O
came	O
nearer	O
I	O
found	O
his	O
pace	O
slacker	O
,	O
because	O
he	O
had	O
something	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
.	O

When	O
he	O
came	O
up	O
to	O
me	O
I	O
found	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
quite	O
home	O
for	O
an	O
earthen	O
jug	O
or	O
pot	O
,	O
to	O
bring	O
his	O
father	O
some	O
fresh	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
got	O
two	O
more	O
cakes	O
or	O
loaves	O
of	O
bread	O
:	O
the	O
bread	O
he	O
gave	O
me	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
water	O
he	O
carried	O
to	O
his	O
father	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
thirsty	O
too	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
a	O
little	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
water	O
revived	O
his	O
father	O
more	O
than	O
all	O
the	O
rum	O
or	O
spirits	O
I	O
had	O
given	O
him	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
was	O
fainting	O
with	O
thirst	O
.	O

When	O
his	O
father	O
had	O
drunk	O
,	O
I	O
called	O
to	O
him	O
to	O
know	O
if	O
there	O
was	O
any	O
water	O
left	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
,	O
``	O
Yes	O
''	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
bade	O
him	O
give	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
poor	O
Spaniard	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
in	O
as	O
much	O
want	O
of	O
it	O
as	O
his	O
father	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
sent	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
cakes	O
that	O
Friday	O
brought	O
to	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
too	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
indeed	O
very	O
weak	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
reposing	O
himself	O
upon	O
a	O
green	O
place	O
under	O
the	O
shade	O
of	O
a	O
tree	O
;	O
and	O
whose	O
limbs	O
were	O
also	O
very	O
stiff	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
much	O
swelled	O
with	O
the	O
rude	O
bandage	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
tied	O
with	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
saw	O
that	O
upon	O
Friday	O
's	O
coming	O
to	O
him	O
with	O
the	O
water	O
he	O
sat	O
up	O
and	O
drank	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
the	O
bread	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
eat	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
him	O
and	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
handful	O
of	O
raisins	O
.	O

He	O
looked	O
up	O
in	O
my	O
face	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
tokens	O
of	O
gratitude	O
and	O
thankfulness	O
that	O
could	O
appear	O
in	O
any	O
countenance	O
;	O
but	O
was	O
so	O
weak	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
he	O
had	O
so	O
exerted	O
himself	O
in	O
the	O
fight	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
stand	O
up	O
upon	O
his	O
feet	O
--	O
he	O
tried	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
times	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
really	O
not	O
able	O
,	O
his	O
ankles	O
were	O
so	O
swelled	O
and	O
so	O
painful	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
bade	O
him	O
sit	O
still	O
,	O
and	O
caused	O
Friday	O
to	O
rub	O
his	O
ankles	O
,	O
and	O
bathe	O
them	O
with	O
rum	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
his	O
father	O
's	O
.	O

I	O
observed	O
the	O
poor	O
affectionate	O
creature	O
,	O
every	O
two	O
minutes	O
,	O
or	O
perhaps	O
less	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
while	O
he	O
was	O
here	O
,	O
turn	O
his	O
head	O
about	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
his	O
father	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
place	O
and	O
posture	O
as	O
he	O
left	O
him	O
sitting	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
he	O
found	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
;	O
at	O
which	O
he	O
started	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
without	O
speaking	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
flew	O
with	O
that	O
swiftness	O
to	O
him	O
that	O
one	O
could	O
scarce	O
perceive	O
his	O
feet	O
to	O
touch	O
the	O
ground	O
as	O
he	O
went	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
he	O
came	O
,	O
he	O
only	O
found	O
he	O
had	O
laid	O
himself	O
down	O
to	O
ease	O
his	O
limbs	O
,	O
so	O
Friday	O
came	O
back	O
to	O
me	O
presently	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
spoke	O
to	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
to	O
let	O
Friday	O
help	O
him	O
up	O
if	O
he	O
could	O
,	O
and	O
lead	O
him	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
he	O
should	O
carry	O
him	O
to	O
our	O
dwelling	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
would	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
him	O
.	O

But	O
Friday	O
,	O
a	O
lusty	O
,	O
strong	O
fellow	O
,	O
took	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
upon	O
his	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
him	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
him	O
down	O
softly	O
upon	O
the	O
side	O
or	O
gunnel	O
of	O
the	O
canoe	O
,	O
with	O
his	O
feet	O
in	O
the	O
inside	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
lifting	O
him	O
quite	O
in	O
,	O
he	O
set	O
him	O
close	O
to	O
his	O
father	O
;	O
and	O
presently	O
stepping	O
out	O
again	O
,	O
launched	O
the	O
boat	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
paddled	O
it	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
faster	O
than	O
I	O
could	O
walk	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
wind	O
blew	O
pretty	O
hard	O
too	O
;	O
so	O
he	O
brought	O
them	O
both	O
safe	O
into	O
our	O
creek	O
,	O
and	O
leaving	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
ran	O
away	O
to	O
fetch	O
the	O
other	O
canoe	O
.	O

As	O
he	O
passed	O
me	O
I	O
spoke	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
asked	O
him	O
whither	O
he	O
went	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
``	O
Go	O
fetch	O
more	O
boat	O
;	O
''	O
so	O
away	O
he	O
went	O
like	O
the	O
wind	O
,	O
for	O
sure	O
never	O
man	O
or	O
horse	O
ran	O
like	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
had	O
the	O
other	O
canoe	O
in	O
the	O
creek	O
almost	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
got	O
to	O
it	O
by	O
land	O
;	O
so	O
he	O
wafted	O
me	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
went	O
to	O
help	O
our	O
new	O
guests	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
did	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
neither	O
of	O
them	O
able	O
to	O
walk	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
poor	O
Friday	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
.	O

To	O
remedy	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
in	O
my	O
thought	O
,	O
and	O
calling	O
to	O
Friday	O
to	O
bid	O
them	O
sit	O
down	O
on	O
the	O
bank	O
while	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
soon	O
made	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
hand-barrow	O
to	O
lay	O
them	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
Friday	O
and	O
I	O
carried	O
them	O
both	O
up	O
together	O
upon	O
it	O
between	O
us	O
.	O

But	O
when	O
we	O
got	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
outside	O
of	O
our	O
wall	O
,	O
or	O
fortification	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
a	O
worse	O
loss	O
than	O
before	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O
get	O
them	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
resolved	O
not	O
to	O
break	O
it	O
down	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
set	O
to	O
work	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
Friday	O
and	O
I	O
,	O
in	O
about	O
two	O
hours	O
'	O
time	O
,	O
made	O
a	O
very	O
handsome	O
tent	O
,	O
covered	O
with	O
old	O
sails	O
,	O
and	O
above	O
that	O
with	O
boughs	O
of	O
trees	O
,	O
being	O
in	O
the	O
space	O
without	O
our	O
outward	O
fence	O
and	O
between	O
that	O
and	O
the	O
grove	O
of	O
young	O
wood	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
planted	O
;	O
and	O
here	O
we	O
made	O
them	O
two	O
beds	O
of	O
such	O
things	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
--	O
viz.	O
of	O
good	O
rice-straw	O
,	O
with	O
blankets	O
laid	O
upon	O
it	O
to	O
lie	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
another	O
to	O
cover	O
them	O
,	O
on	O
each	O
bed	O
.	O

My	O
island	O
was	O
now	O
peopled	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
thought	O
myself	O
very	O
rich	O
in	O
subjects	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
merry	O
reflection	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
frequently	O
made	O
,	O
how	O
like	O
a	O
king	O
I	O
looked	O
.	O

First	O
of	O
all	O
,	O
the	O
whole	O
country	O
was	O
my	O
own	O
property	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
an	O
undoubted	O
right	O
of	O
dominion	O
.	O

Secondly	O
,	O
my	O
people	O
were	O
perfectly	O
subjected	O
--	O
I	O
was	O
absolutely	O
lord	O
and	O
lawgiver	O
--	O
they	O
all	O
owed	O
their	O
lives	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
ready	O
to	O
lay	O
down	O
their	O
lives	O
,	O
if	O
there	O
had	O
been	O
occasion	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
me	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
remarkable	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
but	O
three	O
subjects	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
of	O
three	O
different	O
religions	O
--	O
my	O
man	O
Friday	O
was	O
a	O
Protestant	O
,	O
his	O
father	O
was	O
a	O
Pagan	O
and	O
a	O
cannibal	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
was	O
a	O
Papist	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
allowed	O
liberty	O
of	O
conscience	O
throughout	O
my	O
dominions	O
.	O

But	O
this	O
is	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
secured	O
my	O
two	O
weak	O
,	O
rescued	O
prisoners	O
,	O
and	O
given	O
them	O
shelter	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
place	O
to	O
rest	O
them	O
upon	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
making	O
some	O
provision	O
for	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
I	O
did	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
Friday	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
yearling	O
goat	O
,	O
betwixt	O
a	O
kid	O
and	O
a	O
goat	O
,	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
particular	O
flock	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
killed	O
;	O
when	O
I	O
cut	O
off	O
the	O
hinder-quarter	O
,	O
and	O
chopping	O
it	O
into	O
small	O
pieces	O
,	O
I	O
set	O
Friday	O
to	O
work	O
to	O
boiling	O
and	O
stewing	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
them	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
dish	O
,	O
I	O
assure	O
you	O
,	O
of	O
flesh	O
and	O
broth	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
I	O
cooked	O
it	O
without	O
doors	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
made	O
no	O
fire	O
within	O
my	O
inner	O
wall	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
carried	O
it	O
all	O
into	O
the	O
new	O
tent	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
set	O
a	O
table	O
there	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
sat	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
ate	O
my	O
own	O
dinner	O
also	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
cheered	O
them	O
and	O
encouraged	O
them	O
.	O

Friday	O
was	O
my	O
interpreter	O
,	O
especially	O
to	O
his	O
father	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
too	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
spoke	O
the	O
language	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
pretty	O
well	O
.	O

After	O
we	O
had	O
dined	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
supped	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
Friday	O
to	O
take	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
canoes	O
,	O
and	O
go	O
and	O
fetch	O
our	O
muskets	O
and	O
other	O
firearms	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
time	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
left	O
upon	O
the	O
place	O
of	O
battle	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
I	O
ordered	O
him	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
bury	O
the	O
dead	O
bodies	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
,	O
which	O
lay	O
open	O
to	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
presently	O
be	O
offensive	O
.	O

I	O
also	O
ordered	O
him	O
to	O
bury	O
the	O
horrid	O
remains	O
of	O
their	O
barbarous	O
feast	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
think	O
of	O
doing	O
myself	O
;	O
nay	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
bear	O
to	O
see	O
them	O
if	O
I	O
went	O
that	O
way	O
;	O
all	O
which	O
he	O
punctually	O
performed	O
,	O
and	O
effaced	O
the	O
very	O
appearance	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
being	O
there	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
went	O
again	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
scarce	O
know	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
otherwise	O
than	O
by	O
the	O
corner	O
of	O
the	O
wood	O
pointing	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
began	O
to	O
enter	O
into	O
a	O
little	O
conversation	O
with	O
my	O
two	O
new	O
subjects	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
I	O
set	O
Friday	O
to	O
inquire	O
of	O
his	O
father	O
what	O
he	O
thought	O
of	O
the	O
escape	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
in	O
that	O
canoe	O
,	O
and	O
whether	O
we	O
might	O
expect	O
a	O
return	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
power	O
too	O
great	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
resist	O
.	O

His	O
first	O
opinion	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
savages	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
never	O
could	O
live	O
out	O
the	O
storm	O
which	O
blew	O
that	O
night	O
they	O
went	O
off	O
,	O
but	O
must	O
of	O
necessity	O
be	O
drowned	O
,	O
or	O
driven	O
south	O
to	O
those	O
other	O
shores	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
as	O
sure	O
to	O
be	O
devoured	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
drowned	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
cast	O
away	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
what	O
they	O
would	O
do	O
if	O
they	O
came	O
safe	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
he	O
knew	O
not	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
his	O
opinion	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
dreadfully	O
frightened	O
with	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
their	O
being	O
attacked	O
,	O
the	O
noise	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
fire	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
believed	O
they	O
would	O
tell	O
the	O
people	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
killed	O
by	O
thunder	O
and	O
lightning	O
,	O
not	O
by	O
the	O
hand	O
of	O
man	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
two	O
which	O
appeared	O
--	O
viz.	O
Friday	O
and	O
I	O
--	O
were	O
two	O
heavenly	O
spirits	O
,	O
or	O
furies	O
,	O
come	O
down	O
to	O
destroy	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
men	O
with	O
weapons	O
.	O

This	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
he	O
knew	O
;	O
because	O
he	O
heard	O
them	O
all	O
cry	O
out	O
so	O
,	O
in	O
their	O
language	O
,	O
one	O
to	O
another	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
conceive	O
that	O
a	O
man	O
could	O
dart	O
fire	O
,	O
and	O
speak	O
thunder	O
,	O
and	O
kill	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
without	O
lifting	O
up	O
the	O
hand	O
,	O
as	O
was	O
done	O
now	O
:	O
and	O
this	O
old	O
savage	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
right	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
understood	O
since	O
,	O
by	O
other	O
hands	O
,	O
the	O
savages	O
never	O
attempted	O
to	O
go	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
afterwards	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
terrified	O
with	O
the	O
accounts	O
given	O
by	O
those	O
four	O
men	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
it	O
seems	O
they	O
did	O
escape	O
the	O
sea	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
believed	O
whoever	O
went	O
to	O
that	O
enchanted	O
island	O
would	O
be	O
destroyed	O
with	O
fire	O
from	O
the	O
gods	O
.	O

This	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
was	O
under	O
continual	O
apprehensions	O
for	O
a	O
good	O

and	O
kept	O
always	O
upon	O

there	O
were	O

CHAPTER	O
XVII	O
--	O
VISIT	O
OF	O
MUTINEERS	O
In	O
a	O
little	O
time	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
no	O
more	O
canoes	O
appearing	O
,	O
the	O
fear	O
of	O
their	O
coming	O
wore	O
off	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
take	O
my	O
former	O
thoughts	O
of	O
a	O
voyage	O
to	O
the	O
main	O
into	O
consideration	O
;	O
being	O
likewise	O
assured	O
by	O
Friday	O
's	O
father	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
depend	O
upon	O
good	O
usage	O
from	O
their	O
nation	O
,	O
on	O
his	O
account	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
.	O

But	O
my	O
thoughts	O
were	O
a	O
little	O
suspended	O
when	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
serious	O
discourse	O
with	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
understood	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
sixteen	O
more	O
of	O
his	O
countrymen	O
and	O
Portuguese	O
,	O
who	O
having	O
been	O
cast	O
away	O
and	O
made	O
their	O
escape	O
to	O
that	O
side	O
,	O
lived	O
there	O
at	O
peace	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
savages	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
very	O
sore	O
put	O
to	O
it	O
for	O
necessaries	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
for	O
life	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
all	O
the	O
particulars	O
of	O
their	O
voyage	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
they	O
were	O
a	O
Spanish	O
ship	O
,	O
bound	O
from	O
the	O
Rio	PNM
de	PNM
la	PNM
Plata	PNM
to	O
the	O
Havanna	O
,	O
being	O
directed	O
to	O
leave	O
their	O
loading	O
there	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
chiefly	O
hides	O
and	O
silver	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
bring	O
back	O
what	O
European	O
goods	O
they	O
could	O
meet	O
with	O
there	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
five	O
Portuguese	O
seamen	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
whom	O
they	O
took	O
out	O
of	O
another	O
wreck	O
;	O
that	O
five	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
men	O
were	O
drowned	O
when	O
first	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
lost	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
these	O
escaped	O
through	O
infinite	O
dangers	O
and	O
hazards	O
,	O
and	O
arrived	O
,	O
almost	O
starved	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
cannibal	O
coast	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
expected	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
devoured	O
every	O
moment	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
they	O
had	O
some	O
arms	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
perfectly	O
useless	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
neither	O
powder	O
nor	O
ball	O
,	O
the	O
washing	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
having	O
spoiled	O
all	O
their	O
powder	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
used	O
at	O
their	O
first	O
landing	O
to	O
provide	O
themselves	O
with	O
some	O
food	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
what	O
he	O
thought	O
would	O
become	O
of	O
them	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
formed	O
any	O
design	O
of	O
making	O
their	O
escape	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
they	O
had	O
many	O
consultations	O
about	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
having	O
neither	O
vessel	O
nor	O
tools	O
to	O
build	O
one	O
,	O
nor	O
provisions	O
of	O
any	O
kind	O
,	O
their	O
councils	O
always	O
ended	O
in	O
tears	O
and	O
despair	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
how	O
he	O
thought	O
they	O
would	O
receive	O
a	O
proposal	O
from	O
me	O
,	O
which	O
might	O
tend	O
towards	O
an	O
escape	O
;	O
and	O
whether	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
here	O
,	O
it	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
done	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
with	O
freedom	O
,	O
I	O
feared	O
mostly	O
their	O
treachery	O
and	O
ill-usage	O
of	O
me	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
put	O
my	O
life	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O
;	O
for	O
that	O
gratitude	O
was	O
no	O
inherent	O
virtue	O
in	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
man	O
,	O
nor	O
did	O
men	O
always	O
square	O
their	O
dealings	O
by	O
the	O
obligations	O
they	O
had	O
received	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
they	O
did	O
by	O
the	O
advantages	O
they	O
expected	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
very	O
hard	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
made	O
the	O
instrument	O
of	O
their	O
deliverance	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
afterwards	O
make	O
me	O
their	O
prisoner	O
in	O
New	PNM
Spain	PNM
,	O
where	O
an	O
Englishman	O
was	O
certain	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
a	O
sacrifice	O
,	O
what	O
necessity	O
or	O
what	O
accident	O
soever	O
brought	O
him	O
thither	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
rather	O
be	O
delivered	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
savages	O
,	O
and	O
be	O
devoured	O
alive	O
,	O
than	O
fall	O
into	O
the	O
merciless	O
claws	O
of	O
the	O
priests	O
,	O
and	O
be	O
carried	O
into	O
the	O
Inquisition	O
.	O

I	O
added	O
that	O
,	O
otherwise	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
persuaded	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
here	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
,	O
with	O
so	O
many	O
hands	O
,	O
build	O
a	O
barque	O
large	O
enough	O
to	O
carry	O
us	O
all	O
away	O
,	O
either	O
to	O
the	O
Brazils	PNM
southward	O
,	O
or	O
to	O
the	O
islands	O
or	O
Spanish	PNM
coast	O
northward	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
if	O
,	O
in	O
requital	O
,	O
they	O
should	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
had	O
put	O
weapons	O
into	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
carry	O
me	O
by	O
force	O
among	O
their	O
own	O
people	O
,	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
ill-used	O
for	O
my	O
kindness	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
my	O
case	O
worse	O
than	O
it	O
was	O
before	O
.	O

He	O
answered	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
candour	O
and	O
ingenuousness	O
,	O
that	O
their	O
condition	O
was	O
so	O
miserable	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
sensible	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
believed	O
they	O
would	O
abhor	O
the	O
thought	O
of	O
using	O
any	O
man	O
unkindly	O
that	O
should	O
contribute	O
to	O
their	O
deliverance	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
pleased	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
go	O
to	O
them	O
with	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
,	O
and	O
discourse	O
with	O
them	O
about	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
return	O
again	O
and	O
bring	O
me	O
their	O
answer	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
make	O
conditions	O
with	O
them	O
upon	O
their	O
solemn	O
oath	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
absolutely	O
under	O
my	O
direction	O
as	O
their	O
commander	O
and	O
captain	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
should	O
swear	O
upon	O
the	O
holy	O
sacraments	O
and	O
gospel	O
to	O
be	O
true	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
go	O
to	O
such	O
Christian	O
country	O
as	O
I	O
should	O
agree	O
to	O
,	O
and	O
no	O
other	O
;	O
and	O
to	O
be	O
directed	O
wholly	O
and	O
absolutely	O
by	O
my	O
orders	O
till	O
they	O
were	O
landed	O
safely	O
in	O
such	O
country	O
as	O
I	O
intended	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
bring	O
a	O
contract	O
from	O
them	O
,	O
under	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
purpose	O
.	O

Then	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
would	O
first	O
swear	O
to	O
me	O
himself	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
never	O
stir	O
from	O
me	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
he	O
lived	O
till	O
I	O
gave	O
him	O
orders	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
take	O
my	O
side	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
drop	O
of	O
his	O
blood	O
,	O
if	O
there	O
should	O
happen	O
the	O
least	O
breach	O
of	O
faith	O
among	O
his	O
countrymen	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
very	O
civil	O
,	O
honest	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
under	O
the	O
greatest	O
distress	O
imaginable	O
,	O
having	O
neither	O
weapons	O
nor	O
clothes	O
,	O
nor	O
any	O
food	O
,	O
but	O
at	O
the	O
mercy	O
and	O
discretion	O
of	O
the	O
savages	O
;	O
out	O
of	O
all	O
hopes	O
of	O
ever	O
returning	O
to	O
their	O
own	O
country	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
sure	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
undertake	O
their	O
relief	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
live	O
and	O
die	O
by	O
me	O
.	O

Upon	O
these	O
assurances	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
venture	O
to	O
relieve	O
them	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
send	O
the	O
old	O
savage	O
and	O
this	O
Spaniard	O
over	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
treat	O
.	O

But	O
when	O
we	O
had	O
got	O
all	O
things	O
in	O
readiness	O
to	O
go	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
himself	O
started	O
an	O
objection	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
so	O
much	O
prudence	O
in	O
it	O
on	O
one	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
much	O
sincerity	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
but	O
be	O
very	O
well	O
satisfied	O
in	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
by	O
his	O
advice	O
,	O
put	O
off	O
the	O
deliverance	O
of	O
his	O
comrades	O
for	O
at	O
least	O
half	O
a	O
year	O
.	O

The	O
case	O
was	O
thus	O
:	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
with	O
us	O
now	O
about	O
a	O
month	O
,	O
during	O
which	O
time	O
I	O
had	O
let	O
him	O
see	O
in	O
what	O
manner	O
I	O
had	O
provided	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
assistance	O
of	O
Providence	O
,	O
for	O
my	O
support	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
saw	O
evidently	O
what	O
stock	O
of	O
corn	O
and	O
rice	O
I	O
had	O
laid	O
up	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
more	O
than	O
sufficient	O
for	O
myself	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
sufficient	O
,	O
without	O
good	O
husbandry	O
,	O
for	O
my	O
family	O
,	O
now	O
it	O
was	O
increased	O
to	O
four	O
;	O
but	O
much	O
less	O
would	O
it	O
be	O
sufficient	O
if	O
his	O
countrymen	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
sixteen	O
,	O
still	O
alive	O
,	O
should	O
come	O
over	O
;	O
and	O
least	O
of	O
all	O
would	O
it	O
be	O
sufficient	O
to	O
victual	O
our	O
vessel	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
should	O
build	O
one	O
,	O
for	O
a	O
voyage	O
to	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
Christian	O
colonies	O
of	O
America	PNM
;	O
so	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
thought	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
advisable	O
to	O
let	O
him	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
dig	O
and	O
cultivate	O
some	O
more	O
land	O
,	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
spare	O
seed	O
to	O
sow	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
wait	O
another	O
harvest	O
,	O

I	O

I	O
showed	O

I	O
had	O
hewed	O
a	O

by	O

we	O
got	O
about	O

up	O

where	O
the	O

these	O

it	O
was	O
enough	O
to	O
answer	O
our	O
end	O
;	O
for	O
from	O
twenty-two	O
bushels	O
of	O
barley	O
we	O
brought	O
in	O

out	O

two	O

twenty	O

and	O
the	O

in	O

of	O

which	O
was	O

enough	O
for	O
our	O
food	O
to	O
the	O
next	O

,	O
though	O
all	O
the	O
sixteen	O
Spaniards	O
had	O
been	O
on	O

with	O
me	O
;	O
or	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
ready	O
for	O
a	O
voyage	O

it	O
would	O
very	O
plentifully	O
have	O

us	O
to	O
any	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
thus	O
housed	O
and	O
secured	O
our	O
magazine	O
of	O
corn	O
,	O
we	O
fell	O
to	O
work	O
to	O
make	O
more	O
wicker-ware	O
,	O
viz.	O
great	O
baskets	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
we	O
kept	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
was	O
very	O
handy	O
and	O
dexterous	O
at	O
this	O
part	O
,	O
and	O
often	O
blamed	O
me	O
that	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
make	O
some	O
things	O
for	O
defence	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
work	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
saw	O
no	O
need	O
of	O
it	O

And	O
now	O
,	O
having	O
a	O
full	O
supply	O
of	O
food	O
for	O
all	O
the	O
guests	O
I	O
expected	O

I	O
gave	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
leave	O
to	O
go	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
main	O

to	O
see	O
what	O
he	O
could	O
do	O
with	O
those	O
he	O
had	O
left	O
behind	O
him	O
there	O

I	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
strict	O
charge	O
not	O
to	O
bring	O
any	O
man	O
who	O
would	O
not	O
first	O
swear	O
in	O
the	O
presence	O
of	O
himself	O
and	O
the	O
old	O
savage	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
in	O
no	O
way	O
injure	O
,	O
fight	O
with	O
,	O
or	O
attack	O
the	O
person	O
he	O
should	O
find	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
so	O
kind	O
as	O
to	O
send	O
for	O
them	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
their	O
deliverance	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
stand	O
by	O
him	O
and	O
defend	O
him	O
against	O
all	O
such	O
attempts	O
,	O
and	O
wherever	O
they	O
went	O
would	O
be	O
entirely	O
under	O

to	O
his	O
command	O

and	O
that	O
this	O
should	O
be	O
put	O
in	O

signed	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O

How	O
they	O
were	O
to	O

this	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
knew	O
they	O
had	O
neither	O

was	O
a	O

we	O

Under	O
these	O

the	O
Spaniard	O
and	O
the	O
old	O
savage	O
,	O
the	O
father	O
of	O
Friday	O
,	O
went	O
away	O
in	O
one	O
of	O

they	O
might	O
be	O

to	O
have	O

in	O

when	O
they	O
came	O
as	O
prisoners	O
to	O
be	O
devoured	O
by	O
the	O
savages	O

I	O
gave	O
each	O
of	O
them	O
a	O
musket	O

with	O
a	O

on	O
it	O
,	O

about	O
eight	O

not	O
to	O

wishing	O

I	O
saw	O
them	O
go	O

agreeing	O
with	O
them	O
about	O
a	O

should	O
hang	O
out	O

when	O
my	O

came	O

called	O

I	O
jumped	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
regardless	O

I	O
went	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
get	O
my	O

on	O

through	O
my	O

which	O

by	O
the	O
way	O

was	O
by	O
this	O

be	O
a	O
very	O
thick	O
wood	O

I	O
say	O
,	O
regardless	O
of	O
danger	O
I	O
went	O
without	O
my	O
arms	O

was	O
not	O
my	O
custom	O

I	O
was	O
surprised	O

turning	O
my	O
eyes	O
to	O
the	O
sea	O

I	O
presently	O
saw	O
a	O
boat	O
at	O
about	O
a	O
league	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
distance	O
,	O
standing	O
in	O
for	O
the	O
shore	O

with	O
a	O
shoulder-of-mutton	O
sail	O

as	O
they	O
call	O
it	O

and	O
the	O
wind	O
blowing	O
pretty	O
fair	O
to	O
bring	O
them	O
in	O
:	O
also	O
I	O
observed	O
,	O
presently	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
come	O
from	O
that	O
side	O
which	O
the	O

lay	O
on	O

from	O
the	O
southernmost	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O

Upon	O
this	O
I	O
called	O
Friday	O
in	O
,	O

bade	O
him	O
lie	O
close	O

I	O

in	O
to	O

my	O

taken	O

out	O

I	O
climbed	O
up	O

I	O

my	O

the	O
hill	O
when	O
my	O
eye	O
plainly	O
discovered	O
a	O
ship	O
lying	O
at	O
anchor	O
,	O
at	O
about	O
two	O
leagues	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
distance	O
from	O
me	O

,	O
but	O
not	O
above	O
a	O
league	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

By	O
my	O
observation	O
it	O
appeared	O
plainly	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
English	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
boat	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
English	O
long-boat	O
.	O

I	O
can	O
not	O
express	O
the	O
confusion	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
joy	O
of	O
seeing	O
a	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
was	O
manned	O
by	O
my	O
own	O
countrymen	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
friends	O
,	O
was	O
such	O
as	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
describe	O
;	O
but	O
yet	O
I	O
had	O
some	O
secret	O
doubts	O
hung	O
about	O
me	O
--	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
tell	O
from	O
whence	O
they	O
came	O
--	O
bidding	O
me	O
keep	O
upon	O
my	O
guard	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
,	O
it	O
occurred	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
consider	O
what	O
business	O
an	O
English	O
ship	O
could	O
have	O
in	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
since	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
or	O
from	O
any	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
where	O
the	O
English	O
had	O
any	O
traffic	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
knew	O
there	O
had	O
been	O
no	O
storms	O
to	O
drive	O
them	O
in	O
there	O
in	O
distress	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
really	O
English	O
it	O
was	O
most	O
probable	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
here	O
upon	O
no	O
good	O
design	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
better	O
continue	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
than	O
fall	O
into	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
thieves	O
and	O
murderers	O
.	O

Let	O
no	O
man	O
despise	O
the	O
secret	O
hints	O
and	O
notices	O
of	O
danger	O
which	O
sometimes	O
are	O
given	O
him	O
when	O
he	O
may	O
think	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
possibility	O
of	O
its	O
being	O
real	O
.	O

That	O
such	O
hints	O
and	O
notices	O
are	O
given	O
us	O
I	O
believe	O
few	O
that	O
have	O
made	O
any	O
observation	O
of	O
things	O
can	O
deny	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
certain	O
discoveries	O
of	O
an	O
invisible	O
world	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
converse	O
of	O
spirits	O
,	O
we	O
can	O
not	O
doubt	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
the	O
tendency	O
of	O
them	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
to	O
warn	O
us	O
of	O
danger	O
,	O
why	O
should	O
we	O
not	O
suppose	O
they	O
are	O
from	O
some	O
friendly	O
agent	O
-LRB-	O
whether	O
supreme	O
,	O
or	O
inferior	O
and	O
subordinate	O
,	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
question	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
given	O
for	O
our	O
good	O
?	O

The	O
present	O
question	O
abundantly	O
confirms	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
justice	O
of	O
this	O
reasoning	O
;	O
for	O
had	O
I	O
not	O
been	O
made	O
cautious	O
by	O
this	O
secret	O
admonition	O
,	O
come	O
it	O
from	O
whence	O
it	O
will	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
done	O
inevitably	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
far	O
worse	O
condition	O
than	O
before	O
,	O
as	O
you	O
will	O
see	O
presently	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
not	O
kept	O
myself	O
long	O
in	O
this	O
posture	O
till	O
I	O
saw	O
the	O
boat	O
draw	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
looked	O
for	O
a	O
creek	O
to	O
thrust	O
in	O
at	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
convenience	O
of	O
landing	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
come	O
quite	O
far	O
enough	O
,	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
see	O
the	O
little	O
inlet	O
where	O
I	O
formerly	O
landed	O
my	O
rafts	O
,	O
but	O
ran	O
their	O
boat	O
on	O
shore	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
at	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
me	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
very	O
happy	O
for	O
me	O
;	O
for	O
otherwise	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
landed	O
just	O
at	O
my	O
door	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
may	O
say	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
soon	O
have	O
beaten	O
me	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
castle	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
have	O
plundered	O
me	O
of	O
all	O
I	O
had	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
were	O
on	O
shore	O
I	O
was	O
fully	O
satisfied	O
they	O
were	O
Englishmen	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
one	O

two	O

it	O
did	O
not	O

so	O
;	O
there	O
were	O
in	O
all	O
eleven	O

whereof	O
three	O

I	O
found	O
were	O
unarmed	O

as	O
I	O
thought	O

and	O
when	O
the	O
first	O
four	O

five	O
of	O
them	O
were	O

out	O
of	O
the	O

one	O
of	O
the	O

I	O
could	O

not	O

the	O

All	O

had	O
no	O

of	O

really	O
was	O

but	O
stood	O
trembling	O
with	O
the	O
horror	O
of	O
the	O
sight	O

expecting	O
every	O
moment	O
when	O
the	O
three	O
prisoners	O
should	O
be	O
killed	O
;	O
nay	O
,	O
once	O
I	O
saw	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
villains	O
lift	O
up	O
his	O
arm	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
cutlass	O

as	O
the	O

call	O
it	O
,	O
or	O
sword	O
,	O
to	O
strike	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
poor	O
men	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
expected	O
to	O
see	O
him	O
fall	O
every	O
moment	O
;	O
at	O
which	O
all	O
the	O
blood	O
in	O
my	O
body	O
seemed	O
to	O
run	O
chill	O
in	O
my	O
veins	O
.	O

I	O
wished	O
heartily	O
now	O
for	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
savage	O
that	O
had	O
gone	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
or	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
any	O
way	O
to	O
have	O
come	O
undiscovered	O
within	O
shot	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
secured	O
the	O
three	O
men	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
saw	O
no	O
firearms	O
they	O
had	O
among	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
fell	O
out	O
to	O
my	O
mind	O
another	O
way	O
.	O

After	O
I	O
had	O
observed	O
the	O
outrageous	O
usage	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
men	O
by	O
the	O
insolent	O
seamen	O
,	O
I	O
observed	O
the	O
fellows	O
run	O
scattering	O
about	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
wanted	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
country	O
.	O

I	O
observed	O
that	O
the	O
three	O
other	O
men	O
had	O
liberty	O
to	O
go	O
also	O
where	O
they	O
pleased	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
sat	O
down	O
all	O
three	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
very	O
pensive	O
,	O
and	O
looked	O
like	O
men	O
in	O
despair	O
.	O

This	O
put	O
me	O
in	O
mind	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
look	O
about	O
me	O
;	O
how	O
I	O
gave	O
myself	O
over	O
for	O
lost	O
;	O
how	O
wildly	O
I	O
looked	O
round	O
me	O
;	O
what	O
dreadful	O
apprehensions	O
I	O
had	O
;	O
and	O
how	O
I	O
lodged	O
in	O
the	O
tree	O
all	O
night	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
being	O
devoured	O
by	O
wild	O
beasts	O

As	O
I	O
knew	O
nothing	O
that	O
night	O
of	O
the	O
supply	O
I	O
was	O
to	O
receive	O
by	O
the	O
providential	O
driving	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
nearer	O
the	O
land	O
by	O
the	O
storms	O
and	O
tide	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
I	O
have	O
since	O
been	O
so	O
long	O
nourished	O
and	O
supported	O
;	O
so	O
these	O
three	O
poor	O
desolate	O
men	O
knew	O
nothing	O
how	O
certain	O
of	O
deliverance	O
and	O
supply	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
how	O
near	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
effectually	O
and	O
really	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
a	O
condition	O
of	O
safety	O
,	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
that	O
they	O
thought	O
themselves	O
lost	O
and	O
their	O
case	O
desperate	O
.	O

So	O
little	O
do	O
we	O
see	O
before	O
us	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
much	O
reason	O
have	O
we	O
to	O
depend	O
cheerfully	O
upon	O
the	O
great	O
Maker	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
that	O
He	O
does	O
not	O
leave	O
His	O
creatures	O
so	O
absolutely	O
destitute	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
worst	O
circumstances	O
they	O
have	O
always	O
something	O
to	O
be	O
thankful	O
for	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
are	O
nearer	O
deliverance	O
than	O
they	O
imagine	O
;	O
nay	O

are	O
even	O
brought	O
to	O
their	O
deliverance	O
by	O
the	O
means	O
by	O
which	O
they	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
brought	O
to	O
their	O
destruction	O

It	O
was	O
just	O
at	O
high-water	O
when	O
these	O
people	O
came	O
on	O
shore	O
;	O
and	O
while	O
they	O
rambled	O
about	O
to	O

what	O

were	O
in	O

they	O

was	O

the	O

left	O

I	O
found	O
afterwards	O

drunk	O
a	O
little	O

much	O
brandy	O

fell	O
asleep	O

the	O

hallooed	O
out	O

were	O

about	O

upon	O
which	O
they	O
all	O
soon	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O

it	O
was	O
past	O
all	O
their	O
strength	O
to	O
launch	O
her	O
,	O
the	O
boat	O
being	O
very	O
heavy	O

the	O

side	O
being	O
a	O
soft	O

almost	O

In	O
this	O

it	O
would	O

ordered	O
Friday	O
also	O

whom	O

had	O
made	O
an	O
excellent	O
marksman	O
with	O
his	O
gun	O

to	O
load	O
himself	O

I	O
took	O
myself	O
two	O
fowling-pieces	O

I	O
gave	O
him	O
three	O
muskets	O

My	O
figure	O

indeed	O

was	O
very	O
fierce	O

I	O
had	O
my	O
formidable	O
goat-skin	O
coat	O
on	O

with	O
the	O
great	O
cap	O
I	O
have	O
mentioned	O

a	O

sword	O
by	O
my	O
side	O

two	O
pistols	O
in	O
my	O

It	O
was	O
my	O

not	O
to	O
have	O
made	O
any	O

it	O
was	O
dark	O

about	O
two	O
o'clock	O
,	O
being	O
the	O
heat	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
gone	O
straggling	O
into	O
the	O
woods	O

The	O
three	O

for	O

had	O
,	O

out	O

Upon	O
this	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
discover	O
myself	O
to	O
them	O

learn	O
something	O
of	O
their	O

;	O
immediately	O
I	O
marched	O

above	O

my	O
man	O
Friday	O
at	O
a	O
good	O
distance	O
behind	O
me	O
,	O
as	O
formidable	O
for	O
his	O
arms	O
as	O
I	O
,	O

not	O
making	O
quite	O
so	O
staring	O

I	O
did	O

I	O
came	O

could	O

and	O
then	O
,	O
before	O
any	O

the	O
two	O

the	O
captain	O
wisely	O
reserving	O
his	O

piece	O

They	O
had	O
so	O
well	O
aimed	O
their	O
shot	O
at	O
the	O
men	O
they	O
knew	O
,	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
killed	O
on	O
the	O
spot	O

and	O
the	O
other	O
very	O
much	O
wounded	O
;	O
but	O
not	O
being	O
dead	O
,	O
he	O
started	O
up	O
on	O
his	O
feet	O
,	O
and	O
called	O
eagerly	O
for	O
help	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
captain	O
stepping	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
told	O
him	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
late	O
to	O
cry	O
for	O
help	O
,	O
he	O
should	O
call	O
upon	O
God	O
to	O
forgive	O
his	O
villainy	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
that	O
word	O
knocked	O
him	O
down	O
with	O
the	O
stock	O
of	O
his	O
musket	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
he	O
never	O
spoke	O
more	O
;	O
there	O
were	O
three	O
more	O
in	O
the	O
company	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
slightly	O
wounded	O
.	O

By	O
this	O
time	O
I	O
was	O
come	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
saw	O
their	O
danger	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
vain	O
to	O
resist	O
,	O
they	O
begged	O
for	O
mercy	O
.	O

The	O
captain	O
told	O
them	O
he	O
would	O
spare	O
their	O
lives	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
give	O
him	O
an	O
assurance	O
of	O
their	O
abhorrence	O
of	O
the	O
treachery	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
guilty	O
of	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
swear	O
to	O
be	O
faithful	O
to	O
him	O
in	O
recovering	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
afterwards	O
in	O
carrying	O
her	O
back	O
to	O
Jamaica	PNM
,	O
from	O
whence	O
they	O
came	O
.	O

They	O
gave	O
him	O
all	O
the	O
protestations	O
of	O
their	O
sincerity	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
desired	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
was	O
willing	O
to	O
believe	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
spare	O
their	O
lives	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
against	O
,	O
only	O
that	O
I	O
obliged	O
him	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
bound	O
hand	O
and	O
foot	O
while	O
they	O
were	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

While	O
this	O
was	O
doing	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
Friday	O
with	O
the	O
captain	O
's	O
mate	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
with	O
orders	O
to	O
secure	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
bring	O
away	O
the	O
oars	O
and	O
sails	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
did	O
;	O
and	O
by-and-by	O
three	O
straggling	O
men	O
,	O
that	O
were	O
-LRB-	O
happily	O
for	O
them	O
-RRB-	O
parted	O
from	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
came	O
back	O
upon	O
hearing	O
the	O
guns	O
fired	O
;	O
and	O
seeing	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
before	O
their	O
prisoner	O
,	O
now	O
their	O
conqueror	O
,	O
they	O
submitted	O
to	O
be	O
bound	O
also	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
our	O
victory	O
was	O
complete	O
.	O

It	O
now	O
remained	O
that	O
the	O
captain	O
and	O
I	O
should	O
inquire	O
into	O
one	O
another	O
's	O
circumstances	O
.	O

I	O
began	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
my	O
whole	O
history	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
heard	O
with	O
an	O
attention	O
even	O
to	O
amazement	O
--	O
and	O
particularly	O
at	O
the	O
wonderful	O
manner	O
of	O
my	O
being	O
furnished	O
with	O
provisions	O
and	O
ammunition	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
as	O
my	O
story	O
is	O
a	O
whole	O
collection	O
of	O
wonders	O
,	O
it	O
affected	O
him	O
deeply	O
.	O

But	O
when	O
he	O
reflected	O
from	O
thence	O
upon	O
himself	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
I	O
seemed	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
preserved	O
there	O
on	O
purpose	O
to	O
save	O
his	O
life	O
,	O
the	O
tears	O
ran	O
down	O
his	O
face	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
speak	O
a	O
word	O
more	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
communication	O
was	O
at	O
an	O
end	O
,	O
I	O
carried	O
him	O
and	O
his	O
two	O
men	O
into	O
my	O
apartment	O
,	O
leading	O
them	O
in	O
just	O
where	O
I	O
came	O
out	O
,	O
viz.	O
at	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
refreshed	O
them	O
with	O
such	O
provisions	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
,	O
and	O
showed	O
them	O
all	O
the	O
contrivances	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
during	O
my	O
long	O
,	O
long	O
inhabiting	O
that	O
place	O
.	O

All	O
I	O
showed	O
them	O
,	O
all	O
I	O
said	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
was	O
perfectly	O
amazing	O
;	O
but	O
above	O
all	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
admired	O
my	O
fortification	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
perfectly	O
I	O
had	O
concealed	O
my	O
retreat	O
with	O
a	O
grove	O
of	O
trees	O
,	O
which	O
having	O
been	O
now	O
planted	O
nearly	O
twenty	O
years	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
trees	O
growing	O
much	O
faster	O
than	O
in	O
England	PNM
,	O
was	O
become	O
a	O
little	O
wood	O
,	O
so	O
thick	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
impassable	O
in	O
any	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
but	O
at	O
that	O
one	O
side	O
where	O
I	O
had	O
reserved	O
my	O
little	O
winding	O
passage	O
into	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
this	O
was	O
my	O
castle	O
and	O
my	O
residence	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
seat	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
as	O
most	O
princes	O
have	O
,	O
whither	O
I	O
could	O
retreat	O
upon	O
occasion	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
show	O
him	O
that	O
too	O
another	O
time	O
;	O
but	O
at	O
present	O
our	O
business	O
was	O
to	O
consider	O
how	O
to	O
recover	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

He	O
agreed	O
with	O
me	O
as	O
to	O
that	O
,	O
but	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
was	O
perfectly	O
at	O
a	O
loss	O
what	O
measures	O
to	O
take	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
still	O
six-and-twenty	O
hands	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
having	O
entered	O
into	O
a	O
cursed	O
conspiracy	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
all	O
forfeited	O
their	O
lives	O
to	O
the	O
law	O
,	O
would	O
be	O
hardened	O
in	O
it	O
now	O
by	O
desperation	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
carry	O
it	O
on	O
,	O
knowing	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
subdued	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
brought	O
to	O
the	O
gallows	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
England	PNM
,	O
or	O
to	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
English	O
colonies	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
no	O
attacking	O
them	O
with	O
so	O
small	O
a	O
number	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
.	O

I	O
mused	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
on	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
said	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
rational	O
conclusion	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
therefore	O
something	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
resolved	O
on	O
speedily	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
to	O
draw	O
the	O
men	O
on	O
board	O
into	O
some	O
snare	O
for	O
their	O
surprise	O
as	O
to	O
prevent	O
their	O
landing	O
upon	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
destroying	O
us	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
,	O
it	O
presently	O
occurred	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
while	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
crew	O
,	O
wondering	O
what	O
was	O
become	O
of	O
their	O
comrades	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
would	O
certainly	O
come	O
on	O
shore	O
in	O
their	O
other	O
boat	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
then	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
they	O
might	O
come	O
armed	O
,	O
and	O
be	O
too	O
strong	O
for	O
us	O
:	O
this	O
he	O
allowed	O
to	O
be	O
rational	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
was	O
to	O
stave	O
the	O
boat	O
which	O
lay	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
not	O
carry	O
her	O
of	O
,	O
and	O
taking	O
everything	O
out	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
leave	O
her	O
so	O
far	O
useless	O
as	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
fit	O
to	O
swim	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
took	O
the	O
arms	O
which	O
were	O
left	O
on	O
board	O
out	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
whatever	O
else	O
we	O
found	O
there	O
--	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
bottle	O
of	O
brandy	O
,	O
and	O
another	O
of	O
rum	O
,	O
a	O
few	O
biscuit-cakes	O
,	O
a	O
horn	O
of	O
powder	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
lump	O
of	O
sugar	O
in	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
canvas	O
-LRB-	O
the	O
sugar	O
was	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
pounds	O
-RRB-	O
:	O
all	O
which	O
was	O
very	O
welcome	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
especially	O
the	O
brandy	O
and	O
sugar	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
had	O
none	O
left	O
for	O
many	O
years	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
carried	O
all	O
these	O
things	O
on	O
shore	O
-LRB-	O
the	O
oars	O
,	O
mast	O
,	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
rudder	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
were	O
carried	O
away	O
before	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
we	O
knocked	O
a	O
great	O
hole	O
in	O
her	O
bottom	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
come	O
strong	O
enough	O
to	O
master	O
us	O
,	O
yet	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
carry	O
off	O
the	O
boat	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
much	O
in	O
my	O
thoughts	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
recover	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
but	O
my	O
view	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
went	O
away	O
without	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
much	O
question	O
to	O
make	O
her	O
again	O
fit	O
to	O
carry	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
Leeward	PNM
Islands	PNM
,	O
and	O
call	O
upon	O
our	O
friends	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
in	O
my	O
way	O

CHAPTER	O
XVIII	O
--	O
THE	O
SHIP	O
RECOVERED	O
While	O
we	O
were	O
thus	O
preparing	O
our	O
designs	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
first	O
,	O
by	O
main	O
strength	O
,	O
heaved	O
the	O
boat	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
so	O
high	O
that	O
the	O
tide	O
would	O
not	O
float	O
her	O
off	O
at	O
high-water	O
mark	O
,	O
and	O
besides	O
,	O
had	O
broke	O
a	O
hole	O
in	O
her	O
bottom	O
too	O
big	O
to	O
be	O
quickly	O
stopped	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
set	O
down	O
musing	O
what	O
we	O
should	O
do	O
,	O
we	O
heard	O
the	O
ship	O
fire	O
a	O
gun	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
a	O
waft	O
with	O
her	O
ensign	O
as	O
a	O
signal	O
for	O
the	O
boat	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
--	O
but	O
no	O
boat	O
stirred	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
fired	O
several	O
times	O
,	O
making	O
other	O
signals	O
for	O
the	O
boat	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
,	O
when	O
all	O
their	O
signals	O
and	O
firing	O
proved	O
fruitless	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
found	O
the	O
boat	O
did	O
not	O
stir	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
them	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
my	O
glasses	O
,	O
hoist	O
another	O
boat	O
out	O
and	O
row	O
towards	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
approached	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
ten	O
men	O
in	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
firearms	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

As	O
the	O
ship	O
lay	O
almost	O
two	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
full	O
view	O
of	O
them	O
as	O
they	O
came	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
plain	O
sight	O
even	O
of	O
their	O
faces	O
;	O
because	O
the	O
tide	O
having	O
set	O
them	O
a	O
little	O
to	O
the	O
east	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
boat	O
,	O
they	O
rowed	O
up	O
under	O
shore	O
,	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
same	O
place	O
where	O
the	O
other	O
had	O
landed	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
the	O
boat	O
lay	O
;	O
by	O
this	O
means	O
,	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
full	O
view	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
captain	O
knew	O
the	O
persons	O
and	O
characters	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
men	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
of	O
whom	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
three	O
very	O
honest	O
fellows	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
sure	O
,	O
were	O
led	O
into	O
this	O
conspiracy	O
by	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
being	O
over-powered	O
and	O
frightened	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
as	O
for	O
the	O
boatswain	O
,	O
who	O
it	O
seems	O
was	O
the	O
chief	O
officer	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
as	O
outrageous	O
as	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
crew	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
no	O
doubt	O
made	O
desperate	O
in	O
their	O
new	O
enterprise	O
;	O
and	O
terribly	O
apprehensive	O
he	O
was	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
too	O
powerful	O
for	O
us	O
.	O

I	O
smiled	O
at	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
men	O
in	O
our	O
circumstances	O
were	O
past	O
the	O
operation	O
of	O
fear	O
;	O
that	O
seeing	O
almost	O
every	O
condition	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
was	O
better	O

two	O
of	O

were	O
kept	O

indeed	O

because	O
the	O

was	O
not	O

to	O
trust	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
the	O

seven	O
men	O
,	O
well	O
armed	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
made	O
no	O
doubt	O
we	O
should	O

to	O
deal	O
well	O
enough	O
with	O
the	O
ten	O

three	O

men	O
among	O

also	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
got	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
their	O
other	O
boat	O
lay	O
,	O
they	O
ran	O
their	O
boat	O
into	O
the	O
beach	O

came	O
all	O
on	O
shore	O

hauling	O
the	O

up	O
after	O

which	O
I	O
was	O

for	O
I	O
was	O
afraid	O
they	O
would	O
rather	O
have	O
left	O
the	O
boat	O
at	O
an	O
anchor	O
some	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
hands	O
in	O
her	O
to	O
guard	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
we	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
seize	O
the	O
boat	O
.	O

Being	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
they	O
did	O
,	O
they	O
ran	O
all	O
to	O
their	O
other	O
boat	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
easy	O
to	O
see	O
they	O
were	O
under	O
a	O
great	O
surprise	O
to	O
find	O
her	O
stripped	O
,	O
as	O
above	O
,	O
of	O
all	O
that	O
was	O
in	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
hole	O
in	O
her	O
bottom	O
.	O

After	O
they	O
had	O
mused	O
a	O
while	O
upon	O
this	O
,	O
they	O
set	O
up	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
great	O
shouts	O
,	O
hallooing	O
with	O
all	O
their	O
might	O
,	O
to	O
try	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
make	O
their	O
companions	O
hear	O
;	O
but	O
all	O
was	O
to	O
no	O
purpose	O
.	O

Then	O
they	O
came	O
all	O
close	O
in	O
a	O
ring	O
,	O
and	O
fired	O
a	O
volley	O
of	O
their	O
small	O
arms	O
,	O
which	O
indeed	O
we	O
heard	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
echoes	O
made	O
the	O
woods	O
ring	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
was	O
all	O
one	O
;	O
those	O
in	O
the	O
cave	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
sure	O
,	O
could	O
not	O
hear	O
;	O
and	O
those	O
in	O
our	O
keeping	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
heard	O
it	O
well	O
enough	O
,	O
yet	O
durst	O
give	O
no	O
answer	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
so	O
astonished	O
at	O
the	O
surprise	O
of	O
this	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
told	O
us	O
afterwards	O
,	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
all	O
on	O
board	O
again	O
to	O
their	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
them	O
know	O
that	O
the	O
men	O
were	O
all	O
murdered	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
long-boat	O
staved	O
;	O
accordingly	O
,	O
they	O
immediately	O
launched	O
their	O
boat	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

The	O
captain	O
was	O
terribly	O
amazed	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
confounded	O
,	O
at	O
this	O
,	O
believing	O
they	O
would	O
go	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
again	O
and	O
set	O
sail	O
,	O
giving	O
their	O
comrades	O
over	O
for	O
lost	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
he	O
should	O
still	O
lose	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
in	O
hopes	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
recovered	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
quickly	O
as	O
much	O
frightened	O
the	O
other	O
way	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
long	O
put	O
off	O
with	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
perceived	O
them	O
all	O
coming	O
on	O
shore	O
again	O
;	O
but	O
with	O
this	O
new	O
measure	O
in	O
their	O
conduct	O
,	O
which	O
it	O
seems	O
they	O
consulted	O
together	O
upon	O
,	O
viz.	O
to	O
leave	O
three	O
men	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
rest	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
go	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
their	O
fellows	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
disappointment	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
for	O
now	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
a	O
loss	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
as	O
our	O
seizing	O
those	O
seven	O
men	O
on	O
shore	O
would	O
be	O
no	O
advantage	O
to	O
us	O
if	O
we	O
let	O
the	O
boat	O
escape	O
;	O
because	O
they	O
would	O
row	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
them	O
would	O
be	O
sure	O
to	O
weigh	O
and	O
set	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
our	O
recovering	O
the	O
ship	O
would	O
be	O
lost	O
.	O

However	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
remedy	O
but	O
to	O
wait	O
and	O
see	O
what	O
the	O
issue	O
of	O
things	O
might	O
present	O
.	O

The	O
seven	O
men	O
came	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
three	O
who	O
remained	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
put	O
her	O
off	O
to	O
a	O
good	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
them	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
come	O
at	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
.	O

Those	O
that	O
came	O
on	O
shore	O
kept	O
close	O
together	O
,	O
marching	O
towards	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
little	O
hill	O
under	O
which	O
my	O
habitation	O
lay	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
them	O
plainly	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
perceive	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
glad	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
come	O
nearer	O
us	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
fired	O
at	O
them	O
,	O
or	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
gone	O
farther	O
off	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
come	O
abroad	O
.	O

But	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
brow	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
where	O
they	O
could	O
see	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
into	O
the	O
valleys	O
and	O
woods	O
,	O
which	O
lay	O
towards	O
the	O
north-east	O
part	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
the	O
island	O
lay	O
lowest	O
,	O
they	O
shouted	O
and	O
hallooed	O
till	O
they	O
were	O
weary	O
;	O
and	O
not	O
caring	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
to	O
venture	O
far	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
nor	O
far	O
from	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
they	O
sat	O
down	O
together	O
under	O
a	O
tree	O
to	O
consider	O
it	O
.	O

Had	O
they	O
thought	O
fit	O
to	O
have	O
gone	O
to	O
sleep	O
there	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
other	O
part	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
done	O
the	O
job	O
for	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
too	O
full	O
of	O
apprehensions	O
of	O
danger	O
to	O
venture	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
sleep	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
what	O
the	O
danger	O
was	O
they	O
had	O
to	O
fear	O
.	O

The	O
captain	O
made	O
a	O
very	O
just	O
proposal	O
to	O
me	O
upon	O
this	O
consultation	O
of	O
theirs	O
,	O
viz.	O
that	O
perhaps	O
they	O
would	O
all	O
fire	O
a	O
volley	O
again	O
,	O
to	O
endeavour	O
to	O
make	O
their	O
fellows	O
hear	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
all	O
sally	O
upon	O
them	O
just	O
at	O
the	O
juncture	O
when	O
their	O
pieces	O
were	O
all	O
discharged	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
would	O
certainly	O
yield	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
them	O
without	O
bloodshed	O
.	O

I	O
liked	O
this	O
proposal	O
,	O
provided	O
it	O
was	O
done	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
near	O
enough	O
to	O
come	O
up	O
to	O
them	O
before	O
they	O
could	O
load	O
their	O
pieces	O
again	O
.	O

But	O
this	O
event	O
did	O
not	O
happen	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
lay	O
still	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
,	O
very	O
irresolute	O
what	O
course	O
to	O
take	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
nothing	O
done	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
,	O
till	O
night	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
return	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
perhaps	O
we	O
might	O
find	O
a	O
way	O
to	O
get	O
between	O
them	O
and	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
might	O
use	O
some	O
stratagem	O
with	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
to	O
get	O
them	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

We	O
waited	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
,	O
though	O
very	O
impatient	O
for	O
their	O
removing	O
;	O
and	O
were	O
very	O
uneasy	O
when	O
,	O
after	O
long	O
consultation	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
them	O
all	O
start	O
up	O
and	O
march	O
down	O
towards	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
it	O
seems	O
they	O
had	O
such	O
dreadful	O
apprehensions	O
of	O
the	O
danger	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
that	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
again	O
,	O
give	O
their	O
companions	O
over	O
for	O
lost	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
go	O
on	O
with	O
their	O
intended	O
voyage	O
with	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
perceived	O
them	O
go	O
towards	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
I	O
imagined	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
as	O
it	O
really	O
was	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
given	O
over	O
their	O
search	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
going	O
back	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
my	O
thoughts	O
,	O
was	O
ready	O
to	O
sink	O
at	O
the	O
apprehensions	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
presently	O
thought	O
of	O
a	O
stratagem	O
to	O
fetch	O
them	O
back	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
answered	O
my	O
end	O
to	O
a	O
tittle	O
.	O

I	O
ordered	O
Friday	O
and	O
the	O
captain	O
's	O
mate	O
to	O
go	O
over	O
the	O
little	O
creek	O
westward	O
,	O
towards	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
the	O
savages	O
came	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
when	O
Friday	O
was	O
rescued	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
little	O
rising	O
round	O
,	O
at	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
distant	O
,	O
I	O
bid	O
them	O
halloo	O
out	O
,	O
as	O
loud	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
,	O
and	O
wait	O
till	O
they	O
found	O
the	O
seamen	O
heard	O
them	O
;	O
that	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
ever	O
they	O
heard	O
the	O
seamen	O
answer	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
should	O
return	O
it	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
keeping	O
out	O
of	O
sight	O
,	O
take	O
a	O
round	O
,	O
always	O
answering	O
when	O
the	O
others	O
hallooed	O
,	O
to	O
draw	O
them	O
as	O
far	O
into	O
the	O
island	O
and	O
among	O
the	O
woods	O
as	O
possible	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
wheel	O
about	O
again	O
to	O
me	O
by	O
such	O
ways	O
as	O
I	O
directed	O
them	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
just	O
going	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
when	O
Friday	O
and	O
the	O
mate	O
hallooed	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
presently	O
heard	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
answering	O
,	O
ran	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
westward	O
,	O
towards	O
the	O
voice	O
they	O
heard	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
stopped	O
by	O
the	O
creek	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
water	O
being	O
up	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
called	O
for	O
the	O
boat	O
to	O
come	O
up	O
and	O
set	O
them	O
over	O
;	O
as	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
I	O
expected	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
had	O
set	O
themselves	O
over	O
,	O
I	O
observed	O
that	O
the	O
boat	O
being	O
gone	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
into	O
the	O
creek	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
harbour	O
within	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
they	O
took	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
men	O
out	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
to	O
go	O
along	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
only	O
two	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
having	O
fastened	O
her	O
to	O
the	O
stump	O
of	O
a	O
little	O
tree	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
what	O
I	O
wished	O
for	O
;	O
and	O
immediately	O
leaving	O
Friday	O
and	O
the	O
captain	O
's	O
mate	O
to	O
their	O
business	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
the	O
rest	O
with	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
crossing	O
the	O
creek	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
sight	O
,	O
we	O
surprised	O
the	O
two	O
men	O
before	O
they	O
were	O
aware	O
--	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
lying	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
being	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
.	O

The	O
fellow	O
on	O
shore	O
was	O
between	O
sleeping	O
and	O
waking	O
,	O
and	O
going	O
to	O
start	O
up	O
;	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
foremost	O
,	O
ran	O
in	O
upon	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
knocked	O
him	O
down	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
called	O
out	O
to	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
to	O
yield	O
,	O
or	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
dead	O
man	O
.	O

They	O
needed	O
very	O
few	O
arguments	O
to	O
persuade	O
a	O
single	O
man	O
to	O
yield	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
saw	O
five	O
men	O
upon	O
him	O
and	O
his	O
comrade	O
knocked	O
down	O
:	O
besides	O
,	O
this	O
was	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
who	O
were	O
not	O
so	O
hearty	O
in	O
the	O
mutiny	O
as	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
crew	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
was	O
easily	O
persuaded	O
not	O
only	O
to	O
yield	O
,	O
but	O
afterwards	O
to	O
join	O
very	O
sincerely	O
with	O
us	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
meantime	O
,	O
Friday	O
and	O
the	O
captain	O
's	O
mate	O
so	O
well	O
managed	O
their	O
business	O
with	O
the	O
rest	O
that	O
they	O
drew	O
them	O
,	O
by	O
hallooing	O
and	O
answering	O
,	O
from	O
one	O
hill	O
to	O
another	O
,	O
and	O
from	O
one	O
wood	O
to	O
another	O
,	O
till	O
they	O
not	O
only	O
heartily	O
tired	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
left	O
them	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
very	O
sure	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
reach	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
before	O
it	O
was	O
dark	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
heartily	O
tired	O
themselves	O
also	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
time	O
they	O
came	O
back	O
to	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
nothing	O
now	O
to	O
do	O
but	O
to	O
watch	O
for	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
dark	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
fall	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
work	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
several	O
hours	O
after	O
Friday	O
came	O
back	O
to	O
me	O
before	O
they	O
came	O
back	O
to	O
their	O
boat	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
could	O
hear	O
the	O
foremost	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
long	O
before	O
they	O
came	O
quite	O
up	O
,	O
calling	O
to	O
those	O
behind	O
to	O
come	O
along	O
;	O
and	O
could	O
also	O
hear	O
them	O
answer	O
,	O
and	O
complain	O
how	O
lame	O
and	O
tired	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
come	O
any	O
faster	O
:	O
which	O
was	O
very	O
welcome	O
news	O
to	O
us	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
they	O
came	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
:	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
impossible	O
to	O
express	O
their	O
confusion	O
when	O
they	O
found	O
the	O
boat	O
fast	O
aground	O
in	O
the	O
creek	O
,	O
the	O
tide	O
ebbed	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
two	O
men	O
gone	O
.	O

We	O
could	O
hear	O
them	O
call	O
one	O
to	O
another	O
in	O
a	O
most	O
lamentable	O
manner	O
,	O
telling	O
one	O
another	O
they	O
were	O
got	O
into	O
an	O
enchanted	O
island	O
;	O
that	O
either	O
there	O
were	O
inhabitants	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
should	O
all	O
be	O
murdered	O
,	O
or	O
else	O
there	O
were	O
devils	O
and	O
spirits	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
all	O
carried	O
away	O
and	O
devoured	O
.	O

They	O
hallooed	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
called	O
their	O
two	O
comrades	O
by	O
their	O
names	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
times	O
;	O
but	O
no	O
answer	O
.	O

After	O
some	O
time	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
them	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
little	O
light	O
there	O
was	O
,	O
run	O
about	O
,	O
wringing	O
their	O
hands	O
like	O
men	O
in	O
despair	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
they	O
would	O
go	O
and	O
sit	O
down	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
to	O
rest	O
themselves	O
:	O
then	O
come	O
ashore	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
walk	O
about	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
over	O
again	O
.	O

My	O
men	O
would	O
fain	O
have	O
had	O
me	O
give	O
them	O
leave	O
to	O
fall	O
upon	O
them	O
at	O
once	O
in	O
the	O
dark	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
willing	O
to	O
take	O
them	O
at	O
some	O
advantage	O
,	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
spare	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
kill	O
as	O
few	O
of	O
them	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
;	O
and	O
especially	O
I	O
was	O
unwilling	O
to	O
hazard	O
the	O
killing	O
of	O
any	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
knowing	O
the	O
others	O
were	O
very	O
well	O
armed	O
.	O

I	O
resolved	O
to	O
wait	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
separate	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
drew	O
my	O
ambuscade	O
nearer	O
,	O
and	O
ordered	O
Friday	O
and	O
the	O
captain	O
to	O
creep	O
upon	O
their	O
hands	O
and	O
feet	O
,	O
as	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
ground	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
discovered	O
,	O
and	O
get	O
as	O
near	O
them	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
possibly	O
before	O
they	O
offered	O
to	O
fire	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
long	O
in	O
that	O
posture	O
when	O
the	O
boatswain	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
the	O
principal	O
ringleader	O
of	O
the	O
mutiny	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
now	O
shown	O
himself	O
the	O
most	O
dejected	O
and	O
dispirited	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
came	O
walking	O
towards	O
them	O
,	O
with	O
two	O
more	O
of	O
the	O
crew	O
;	O
the	O
captain	O
was	O
so	O
eager	O
at	O
having	O
this	O
principal	O
rogue	O
so	O
much	O
in	O
his	O
power	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
hardly	O
have	O
patience	O
to	O
let	O
him	O
come	O
so	O
near	O
as	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
only	O
heard	O
his	O
tongue	O
before	O
:	O
but	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
nearer	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
and	O
Friday	O
,	O
starting	O
up	O
on	O
their	O
feet	O
,	O
let	O
fly	O
at	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
boatswain	O
was	O
killed	O
upon	O
the	O
spot	O
:	O
the	O
next	O
man	O
was	O
shot	O
in	O
the	O
body	O
,	O
and	O
fell	O
just	O
by	O
him	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
die	O
till	O
an	O
hour	O
or	O
two	O
after	O

the	O
third	O
ran	O
for	O
it	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
noise	O
of	O
the	O
fire	O
I	O
immediately	O
advanced	O
with	O
my	O
whole	O
army	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
now	O
eight	O
men	O
,	O
viz.	O
myself	O

generalissimo	O
;	O
Friday	O
,	O
my	O
lieutenant-general	O

the	O

his	O
two	O

and	O
the	O
three	O
prisoners	O
of	O
war	O
whom	O
we	O
had	O
trusted	O
with	O
arms	O
.	O

We	O
came	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
dark	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
see	O
our	O
number	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
made	O
the	O
man	O
they	O
had	O
left	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
now	O
one	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
to	O
call	O
them	O
by	O
name	O
,	O
to	O
try	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
bring	O
them	O
to	O
a	O
parley	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
perhaps	O
might	O
reduce	O
them	O
to	O
terms	O
;	O
which	O
fell	O
out	O
just	O
as	O
we	O
desired	O
:	O
for	O
indeed	O
it	O
was	O
easy	O
to	O
think	O
,	O
as	O
their	O
condition	O
then	O
was	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
very	O
willing	O
to	O
capitulate	O

he	O

out	O

``	O

used	O
him	O
barbarously	O
in	O
tying	O
his	O
hands	O
and	O
giving	O
him	O
injurious	O
language	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
told	O
him	O
he	O
must	O
lay	O
down	O
his	O
arms	O
at	O
discretion	O
,	O
and	O
trust	O
to	O
the	O
governor	O
's	O
mercy	O
:	O
by	O
which	O
he	O
meant	O
me	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
all	O
called	O
me	O
governor	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
they	O
all	O
laid	O
down	O
their	O
arms	O
and	O
begged	O
their	O
lives	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
sent	O
the	O
man	O
that	O
had	O
parleyed	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
more	O
,	O
who	O
bound	O
them	O
all	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
my	O
great	O
army	O
of	O
fifty	O
men	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
with	O
those	O
three	O
,	O
were	O
in	O
all	O
but	O
eight	O
,	O
came	O
up	O
and	O
seized	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
upon	O
their	O
boat	O
;	O
only	O
that	O
I	O
kept	O
myself	O
and	O
one	O
more	O
out	O
of	O
sight	O
for	O
reasons	O
of	O
state	O
.	O

Our	O
next	O
work	O
was	O
to	O
repair	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
think	O
of	O
seizing	O
the	O
ship	O
:	O
and	O
as	O
for	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
now	O
he	O
had	O
leisure	O
to	O
parley	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
he	O
expostulated	O
with	O
them	O
upon	O
the	O
villainy	O
of	O
their	O
practices	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
upon	O
the	O
further	O
wickedness	O
of	O
their	O
design	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
certainly	O
it	O
must	O
bring	O
them	O
to	O
misery	O
and	O
distress	O
in	O
the	O
end	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
to	O
the	O
gallows	O
.	O

They	O
all	O
appeared	O
very	O
penitent	O
,	O
and	O
begged	O
hard	O
for	O
their	O
lives	O
.	O

As	O
for	O
that	O
,	O
he	O
told	O
them	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
his	O
prisoners	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
commander	O
's	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
thought	O
they	O
had	O
set	O
him	O
on	O
shore	O
in	O
a	O
barren	O
,	O
uninhabited	O
island	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
had	O
pleased	O
God	O
so	O
to	O
direct	O
them	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
inhabited	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
governor	O
was	O
an	O
Englishman	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
hang	O
them	O
all	O
there	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
pleased	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
given	O
them	O
all	O
quarter	O
,	O
he	O
supposed	O
he	O
would	O
send	O
them	O
to	O
England	PNM
,	O
to	O
be	O
dealt	O
with	O
there	O
as	O
justice	O
required	O
,	O
except	O
Atkins	O
,	O
whom	O
he	O
was	O
commanded	O
by	O
the	O
governor	O
to	O
advise	O
to	O
prepare	O
for	O
death	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
be	O
hanged	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
.	O

Though	O
this	O
was	O
all	O
but	O
a	O
fiction	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
had	O
its	O
desired	O
effect	O
;	O
Atkins	O
fell	O
upon	O
his	O
knees	O
to	O
beg	O
the	O
captain	O
to	O
intercede	O
with	O
the	O
governor	O
for	O
his	O
life	O
;	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
begged	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
for	O
God	O
's	O
sake	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
sent	O
to	O
England	PNM
.	O

It	O
now	O
occurred	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
our	O
deliverance	O
was	O
come	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
most	O
easy	O
thing	O
to	O
bring	O
these	O
fellows	O
in	O
to	O
be	O
hearty	O
in	O
getting	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
retired	O
in	O
the	O
dark	O
from	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
not	O
see	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
governor	O
they	O
had	O
,	O
and	O
called	O
the	O
captain	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
when	O
I	O
called	O
,	O
at	O
a	O
good	O
distance	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
was	O
ordered	O
to	O
speak	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
say	O
to	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
``	O
Captain	O
,	O
the	O
commander	O
calls	O
for	O
you	O
;	O
''	O
and	O
presently	O
the	O
captain	O
replied	O
,	O
``	O
Tell	O
his	O
excellency	O
I	O
am	O
just	O
coming	O
.	O
''	O

This	O
more	O
perfectly	O
amazed	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
all	O
believed	O
that	O
the	O
commander	O
was	O
just	O
by	O
,	O
with	O
his	O
fifty	O
men	O
.	O

Upon	O
the	O
captain	O
coming	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
my	O
project	O
for	O
seizing	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
liked	O
wonderfully	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
to	O
put	O
it	O
in	O
execution	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
execute	O
it	O
with	O
more	O
art	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
be	O
secure	O
of	O
success	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
we	O
must	O
divide	O
the	O
prisoners	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
go	O
and	O
take	O
Atkins	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
more	O
of	O
the	O
worst	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
send	O
them	O
pinioned	O
to	O
the	O
cave	O
where	O
the	O
others	O
lay	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
committed	O
to	O
Friday	O
and	O
the	O
two	O
men	O
who	O
came	O
on	O
shore	O
with	O
the	O
captain	O
.	O

They	O
conveyed	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
cave	O
as	O
to	O
a	O
prison	O
:	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
a	O
dismal	O
place	O
,	O
especially	O
to	O
men	O
in	O
their	O
condition	O
.	O

The	O
others	O
I	O
ordered	O
to	O
my	O
bower	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
called	O
it	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
have	O
given	O
a	O
full	O
description	O
:	O
and	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
fenced	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
pinioned	O
,	O
the	O
place	O
was	O
secure	O
enough	O
,	O
considering	O
they	O
were	O
upon	O
their	O
behaviour	O
.	O

To	O
these	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
I	O
sent	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
to	O
enter	O
into	O
a	O
parley	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
to	O
try	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
tell	O
me	O
whether	O
he	O
thought	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
trusted	O
or	O
not	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
board	O
and	O
surprise	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

He	O
talked	O
to	O
them	O
of	O
the	O
injury	O
done	O
him	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
condition	O
they	O
were	O
brought	O
to	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
though	O
the	O
governor	O
had	O
given	O
them	O
quarter	O
for	O
their	O
lives	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
present	O
action	O
,	O
yet	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
sent	O
to	O
England	PNM
they	O
would	O
all	O
be	O
hanged	O
in	O
chains	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
join	O
in	O
so	O
just	O
an	O
attempt	O
as	O
to	O
recover	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
the	O
governor	O
's	O
engagement	O
for	O
their	O
pardon	O
.	O

Any	O
one	O
may	O
guess	O
how	O
readily	O
such	O
a	O
proposal	O
would	O
be	O
accepted	O
by	O
men	O
in	O
their	O
condition	O
;	O
they	O
fell	O
down	O
on	O
their	O
knees	O
to	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
and	O
promised	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
deepest	O
imprecations	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
faithful	O
to	O
him	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
drop	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
owe	O
their	O
lives	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
go	O
with	O
him	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
world	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
own	O
him	O
as	O
a	O
father	O
to	O
them	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
they	O
lived	O
.	O

``	O
Well	O
,	O
''	O
says	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
``	O
I	O
must	O
go	O
and	O
tell	O
the	O
governor	O
what	O
you	O
say	O
,	O
and	O

what	O
I	O
can	O
do	O
to	O
bring	O
him	O
to	O
consent	O
to	O
it	O
.	O
''	O

So	O
he	O
brought	O
me	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
temper	O
he	O
found	O
them	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
verily	O
believed	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
faithful	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
be	O
very	O
secure	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
he	O
should	O
go	O
back	O
again	O
and	O
choose	O
out	O
those	O
five	O
,	O
and	O
tell	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
see	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
want	O
men	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
take	O
out	O
those	O
five	O
to	O
be	O
his	O
assistants	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
governor	O
would	O
keep	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
three	O
that	O
were	O
sent	O
prisoners	O
to	O
the	O
castle	O
-LRB-	O
my	O
cave	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
as	O
hostages	O
for	O
the	O
fidelity	O
of	O
those	O
five	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
proved	O
unfaithful	O
in	O
the	O
execution	O
,	O
the	O
five	O
hostages	O
should	O
be	O
hanged	O
in	O
chains	O
alive	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

This	O
looked	O
severe	O
,	O
and	O
convinced	O
them	O
that	O
the	O
governor	O
was	O
in	O
earnest	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
way	O
left	O
them	O
but	O
to	O
accept	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
now	O
the	O
business	O
of	O
the	O
prisoners	O
,	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
of	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
to	O
persuade	O
the	O
other	O
five	O
to	O
do	O
their	O
duty	O

Our	O
strength	O
was	O
now	O
thus	O
ordered	O
for	O
the	O
expedition	O

first	O

the	O

his	O

the	O

gang	O
,	O
to	O
whom	O
,	O
having	O
their	O
character	O
from	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
given	O
their	O
liberty	O

and	O
trusted	O
them	O
with	O
arms	O
;	O
third	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
kept	O

now	O
in	O
my	O
bower	O
,	O
pinioned	O

but	O
on	O
the	O
captain	O

motion	O
had	O
now	O
released	O
;	O
fourth	O
,	O
these	O
five	O
released	O
at	O
last	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
twelve	O
in	O
all	O
,	O
besides	O
five	O
we	O
kept	O
prisoners	O
in	O
the	O
cave	O
for	O
hostages	O

I	O
asked	O
the	O
captain	O
if	O
he	O
was	O
willing	O
to	O
venture	O
with	O
these	O
hands	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
for	O
me	O
and	O
my	O
man	O
Friday	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
proper	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
stir	O
,	O
having	O
seven	O
men	O
left	O
behind	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
employment	O
enough	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
asunder	O
,	O
and	O
supply	O
them	O
with	O
victuals	O

As	O
to	O
the	O
five	O
in	O
the	O
cave	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
fast	O

but	O
Friday	O
went	O
in	O
twice	O
a	O
day	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
supply	O
them	O
with	O
necessaries	O

and	O
I	O
made	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
carry	O
provisions	O
to	O
a	O
certain	O
distance	O
,	O
where	O
Friday	O
was	O
to	O
take	O
them	O

When	O
I	O
showed	O
myself	O
to	O
the	O
two	O
hostages	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
with	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
who	O
told	O
them	O
I	O
was	O
the	O
person	O
the	O
governor	O
had	O
ordered	O
to	O
look	O
after	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
governor	O
's	O
pleasure	O
they	O
should	O
not	O
stir	O
anywhere	O
but	O
by	O
my	O
direction	O
;	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
did	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
fetched	O
into	O
the	O
castle	O

and	O
be	O
laid	O
in	O
irons	O
:	O
so	O
that	O
as	O
we	O
never	O
suffered	O
them	O
to	O

me	O
as	O
governor	O

I	O
now	O
appeared	O
as	O
another	O

spoke	O
of	O
the	O

the	O
garrison	O

the	O

,	O
and	O
the	O
like	O

The	O
captain	O
now	O
had	O
no	O

him	O

to	O
furnish	O
his	O
two	O

of	O

they	O
contrived	O
their	O
business	O
very	O
well	O

for	O

came	O
up	O

As	O

and	O
all	O

the	O

you	O
may	O

I	O
was	O
very	O

Having	O

I	O
slept	O

with	O
the	O

presently	O
I	O

when	O
,	O
climbing	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
top	O

there	O
he	O
stood	O

pointing	O

embraced	O
me	O
in	O

``	O

I	O
cast	O
my	O

to	O
the	O

there	O
she	O
rode	O

within	O
little	O
more	O

half	O
a	O

of	O
the	O

the	O

the	O
little	O

the	O
tide	O

up	O

so	O
landed	O
just	O
at	O
my	O

I	O
was	O
at	O
first	O
ready	O
to	O
sink	O
down	O
with	O
the	O
surprise	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
saw	O
my	O
deliverance	O

indeed	O

visibly	O
put	O
into	O
my	O

all	O

and	O
a	O
large	O
ship	O
just	O
ready	O
to	O
carry	O
me	O
away	O
whither	O
I	O
pleased	O
to	O
go	O

At	O
first	O
,	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
answer	O
him	O
one	O
word	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
taken	O
me	O
in	O
his	O
arms	O
I	O
held	O
fast	O
by	O
him	O
,	O
or	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
fallen	O
to	O
the	O
ground	O

He	O
perceived	O
the	O
surprise	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
pulled	O
a	O
bottle	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
pocket	O
and	O
gave	O
me	O
a	O
dram	O
of	O
cordial	O

which	O
he	O
had	O
brought	O
on	O
purpose	O
for	O
me	O

After	O
I	O
had	O
drunk	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
sat	O
down	O
upon	O
the	O

;	O
and	O
though	O
it	O
brought	O
me	O

it	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
while	O
before	O
I	O
could	O
speak	O
a	O
word	O
to	O
him	O
.	O

All	O
this	O
time	O
the	O
poor	O

was	O
in	O
as	O
great	O
an	O

as	O
I	O

only	O
not	O
under	O
any	O

as	O
I	O
was	O

such	O
was	O
the	O
flood	O
of	O
joy	O
in	O
my	O
breast	O

that	O
it	O
put	O
all	O
my	O
spirits	O
into	O
confusion	O
:	O
at	O
last	O
it	O
broke	O
out	O
into	O
tears	O

and	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
while	O
after	O
I	O
recovered	O
my	O
speech	O
;	O
I	O
then	O
took	O
my	O
turn	O

and	O
embraced	O
him	O
as	O
my	O
deliverer	O

and	O
we	O
rejoiced	O
together	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
I	O

upon	O
him	O
as	O

that	O

and	O
send	O

to	O
the	O
miserable	O
whenever	O
He	O
pleased	O

I	O
forgot	O
not	O
to	O
lift	O
up	O
my	O
heart	O
in	O
thankfulness	O
to	O
Heaven	O

and	O

Him	O

who	O

in	O

from	O
whom	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
talked	O
a	O
while	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
had	O
brought	O
me	O
some	O
little	O
refreshment	O

such	O
as	O
the	O

his	O

Upon	O
this	O

he	O
called	O
aloud	O
to	O
the	O

bade	O
his	O

the	O
things	O
ashore	O
that	O
were	O
for	O
the	O

and	O
,	O
indeed	O

it	O
was	O
a	O
present	O

one	O
that	O
was	O
not	O
to	O

very	O

in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
he	O
clothed	O
me	O
from	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
kind	O

as	O
any	O
one	O
may	O
imagine	O

never	O

as	O
it	O
was	O
to	O

to	O
wear	O
such	O

at	O

After	O
these	O

were	O
past	O

after	O
all	O
his	O
good	O
things	O
were	O
brought	O
into	O
my	O
little	O
apartment	O
,	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
consult	O
what	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
with	O
the	O
prisoners	O
we	O
had	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
worth	O
considering	O
whether	O
we	O
might	O
venture	O
to	O
take	O
them	O
with	O
us	O
or	O
no	O
,	O
especially	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
whom	O
he	O
knew	O
to	O
be	O
incorrigible	O
and	O
refractory	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
degree	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
captain	O
said	O
he	O
knew	O
they	O
were	O
such	O
rogues	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
obliging	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
carry	O
them	O
away	O
,	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
in	O
irons	O
,	O
as	O
malefactors	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
delivered	O
over	O
to	O
justice	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
English	O
colony	O
he	O
could	O
come	O
to	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
captain	O
himself	O
was	O
very	O
anxious	O
about	O
it	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
desired	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
undertake	O
to	O
bring	O
the	O
two	O
men	O
he	O
spoke	O
of	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
their	O
own	O
request	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
leave	O
them	O
upon	O
the	O
island	O

``	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
very	O
glad	O
of	O
that	O

''	O
says	O
the	O

``	O

``	O
Well	O

``	O

So	O
I	O
caused	O
Friday	O

the	O
two	O
hostages	O

for	O

were	O
now	O
discharged	O
,	O
their	O
comrades	O
having	O
performed	O
their	O
promise	O
;	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
I	O
caused	O
them	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
cave	O

and	O
bring	O
up	O
the	O
five	O
men	O

pinioned	O

they	O
were	O

to	O

them	O
there	O

now	O
I	O
was	O
called	O

again	O

Being	O
all	O
met	O

and	O
the	O
captain	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
caused	O
the	O
men	O
to	O
be	O

before	O
me	O

I	O
told	O
them	O

,	O
and	O
how	O
they	O
had	O
run	O
away	O
with	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
preparing	O
to	O
commit	O
further	O
robberies	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
Providence	O
had	O
ensnared	O
them	O
in	O
their	O
own	O
ways	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
fallen	O
into	O
the	O
pit	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
dug	O
for	O
others	O
.	O

I	O
let	O
them	O
know	O
that	O
by	O
my	O
direction	O
the	O
ship	O
had	O
been	O
seized	O
;	O
that	O
she	O
lay	O
now	O
in	O
the	O
road	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
might	O
see	O
by-and-by	O
that	O
their	O
new	O
captain	O
had	O
received	O
the	O
reward	O
of	O
his	O
villainy	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
see	O
him	O
hanging	O
at	O
the	O
yard-arm	O
;	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
they	O
had	O
to	O
say	O
why	O
I	O
should	O
not	O
execute	O
them	O
as	O
pirates	O
taken	O
in	O
the	O
fact	O
,	O
as	O
by	O
my	O
commission	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
doubt	O
but	O
I	O
had	O
authority	O
so	O
to	O
do	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
them	O
answered	O
in	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
say	O
but	O
this	O
,	O
that	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
taken	O
the	O
captain	O
promised	O
them	O
their	O
lives	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
humbly	O
implored	O
my	O
mercy	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
mercy	O
to	O
show	O
them	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
for	O
myself	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
resolved	O
to	O
quit	O
the	O
island	O
with	O
all	O
my	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
taken	O
passage	O
with	O
the	O
captain	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
England	PNM
;	O
and	O
as	O
for	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
carry	O
them	O
to	O
England	PNM
other	O
than	O
as	O
prisoners	O
in	O
irons	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
tried	O
for	O
mutiny	O
and	O
running	O
away	O
with	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
the	O
consequence	O
of	O
which	O
,	O
they	O
must	O
needs	O
know	O
,	O
would	O
be	O
the	O
gallows	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
what	O
was	O
best	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
unless	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
mind	O
to	O
take	O
their	O
fate	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

If	O
they	O
desired	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
liberty	O
to	O
leave	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
some	O
inclination	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
their	O
lives	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
thought	O
they	O
could	O
shift	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

They	O
seemed	O
very	O
thankful	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
they	O
would	O
much	O
rather	O
venture	O
to	O
stay	O
there	O
than	O
be	O
carried	O
to	O
England	PNM
to	O
be	O
hanged	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
left	O
it	O
on	O
that	O
issue	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
seemed	O
to	O
make	O
some	O
difficulty	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
durst	O
not	O
leave	O
them	O
there	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
I	O
seemed	O
a	O
little	O
angry	O
with	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
my	O
prisoners	O
,	O
not	O
his	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
seeing	O
I	O
had	O
offered	O
them	O
so	O
much	O
favour	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
my	O
word	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
fit	O
to	O
consent	O
to	O
it	O
I	O
would	O
set	O
them	O
at	O
liberty	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
found	O
them	O
:	O
and	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
like	O
it	O
he	O
might	O
take	O
them	O
again	O
if	O
he	O
could	O
catch	O
them	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
they	O
appeared	O
very	O
thankful	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
accordingly	O
set	O
them	O
at	O
liberty	O
,	O
and	O
bade	O
them	O
retire	O
into	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
whence	O
they	O
came	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
leave	O
them	O
some	O
firearms	O
,	O
some	O
ammunition	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
directions	O
how	O
they	O
should	O
live	O
very	O
well	O
if	O
they	O
thought	O
fit	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
I	O
prepared	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
but	O
told	O
the	O
captain	O
I	O
would	O
stay	O
that	O
night	O
to	O
prepare	O
my	O
things	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
him	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
board	O
in	O
the	O
meantime	O
,	O
and	O
keep	O
all	O
right	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
send	O
the	O
boat	O
on	O
shore	O
next	O
day	O
for	O
me	O
;	O
ordering	O
him	O
,	O
at	O
all	O
events	O
,	O
to	O
cause	O
the	O
new	O
captain	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
killed	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
hanged	O
at	O
the	O
yard-arm	O
,	O
that	O
these	O
men	O
might	O
see	O
him	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
captain	O
was	O
gone	O
I	O
sent	O
for	O
the	O
men	O
up	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
my	O
apartment	O
,	O
and	O
entered	O
seriously	O
into	O
discourse	O
with	O
them	O
on	O
their	O
circumstances	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
them	O
I	O
thought	O
they	O
had	O
made	O
a	O
right	O
choice	O
;	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
captain	O
had	O
carried	O
them	O
away	O
they	O
would	O
certainly	O
be	O
hanged	O
.	O

I	O
showed	O
them	O
the	O
new	O
captain	O
hanging	O
at	O
the	O
yard-arm	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
them	O
they	O
had	O
nothing	O
less	O
to	O
expect	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
had	O
all	O
declared	O
their	O
willingness	O
to	O
stay	O
,	O
I	O
then	O
told	O
them	O
I	O
would	O
let	O
them	O
into	O
the	O
story	O
of	O
my	O
living	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
them	O
into	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
making	O
it	O
easy	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
them	O
the	O
whole	O
history	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
my	O
coming	O
to	O
it	O
;	O
showed	O
them	O
my	O
fortifications	O
,	O
the	O
way	O
I	O
made	O
my	O
bread	O
,	O
planted	O
my	O
corn	O
,	O
cured	O
my	O
grapes	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
all	O
that	O
was	O
necessary	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
easy	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
them	O
the	O
story	O
also	O
of	O
the	O
seventeen	O
Spaniards	O
that	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
expected	O
,	O
for	O
whom	O
I	O
left	O
a	O
letter	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
them	O
promise	O
to	O
treat	O
them	O
in	O
common	O
with	O
themselves	O
.	O

Here	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
noted	O
that	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
ink	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
was	O
greatly	O
surprised	O
that	O
I	O
never	O
hit	O
upon	O
a	O
way	O
of	O
making	O
ink	O
of	O
charcoal	O
and	O
water	O
,	O
or	O
of	O
something	O
else	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
things	O
much	O
more	O
difficult	O
.	O

I	O
left	O
them	O
my	O
firearms	O
--	O
viz.	O
five	O
muskets	O
,	O
three	O
fowling-pieces	O
,	O
and	O
three	O
swords	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
above	O
a	O
barrel	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
of	O
powder	O
left	O
;	O
for	O
after	O
the	O
first	O
year	O
or	O
two	O
I	O
used	O
but	O
little	O
,	O
and	O
wasted	O
none	O
.	O

I	O
gave	O
them	O
a	O
description	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
I	O
managed	O
the	O
goats	O
,	O
and	O
directions	O
to	O
milk	O
and	O
fatten	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
make	O
both	O
butter	O
and	O
cheese	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
them	O
every	O
part	O
of	O
my	O
own	O
story	O
;	O
and	O
told	O
them	O
I	O
should	O
prevail	O
with	O
the	O
captain	O
to	O
leave	O
them	O
two	O
barrels	O
of	O
gunpowder	O
more	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
garden-seeds	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
glad	O
of	O
.	O

Also	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
them	O
the	O
bag	O
of	O
peas	O
which	O
the	O
captain	O
had	O
brought	O
me	O
to	O
eat	O
,	O
and	O
bade	O
them	O
be	O
sure	O
to	O
sow	O
and	O
increase	O
them	O

CHAPTER	O
XIX	O
--	O
RETURN	O
TO	O
ENGLAND	O
Having	O
done	O
all	O
this	O
I	O
left	O
them	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

We	O
prepared	O
immediately	O
to	O
sail	O
,	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
weigh	O
that	O
night	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
early	O
,	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
five	O
men	O
came	O
swimming	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
making	O
the	O
most	O
lamentable	O
complaint	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
three	O
,	O
begged	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
into	O
the	O
ship	O
for	O
God	O
's	O
sake	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
murdered	O
,	O
and	O
begged	O
the	O
captain	O
to	O
take	O
them	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
hanged	O
them	O
immediately	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
the	O
captain	O
pretended	O
to	O
have	O
no	O
power	O
without	O
me	O
;	O
but	O
after	O
some	O
difficulty	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
their	O
solemn	O
promises	O
of	O
amendment	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
taken	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
,	O
some	O
time	O
after	O
,	O
soundly	O
whipped	O
and	O
pickled	O
;	O
after	O
which	O
they	O
proved	O
very	O
honest	O
and	O
quiet	O
fellows	O
.	O

Some	O
time	O
after	O
this	O
,	O
the	O
boat	O
was	O
ordered	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
the	O
tide	O
being	O
up	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
things	O
promised	O
to	O
the	O
men	O
;	O
to	O
which	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
at	O
my	O
intercession	O
,	O
caused	O
their	O
chests	O
and	O
clothes	O
to	O
be	O
added	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
took	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
very	O
thankful	O
for	O
.	O

I	O
also	O
encouraged	O
them	O
,	O
by	O
telling	O
them	O
that	O
if	O
it	O
lay	O
in	O
my	O
power	O
to	O
send	O
any	O
vessel	O
to	O
take	O
them	O
in	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
forget	O
them	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
took	O
leave	O
of	O
this	O
island	O
,	O
I	O
carried	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
for	O
relics	O
,	O
the	O
great	O
goat-skin	O
cap	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
,	O
my	O
umbrella	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
parrots	O
;	O
also	O
,	O
I	O
forgot	O
not	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
money	O
I	O
formerly	O
mentioned	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
lain	O
by	O
me	O
so	O
long	O
useless	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
grown	O
rusty	O
or	O
tarnished	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
hardly	O
pass	O
for	O
silver	O
till	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
little	O
rubbed	O
and	O
handled	O
,	O
as	O
also	O
the	O
money	O
I	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
wreck	O
of	O
the	O
Spanish	O
ship	O
.	O

And	O
thus	O
I	O
left	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
the	O
19th	O
of	O
December	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
found	O
by	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
account	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
year	O
1686	O
,	O
after	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
upon	O
it	O
eight-and-twenty	O
years	O
,	O
two	O
months	O
,	O
and	O
nineteen	O
days	O
;	O
being	O
delivered	O
from	O
this	O
second	O
captivity	O
the	O
same	O
day	O
of	O
the	O
month	O
that	O
I	O
first	O
made	O
my	O
escape	O
in	O
the	O
long-boat	O
from	O
among	O
the	O
Moors	O
of	O
Sallee	PNM
.	O

In	O
this	O
vessel	O
,	O
after	O
a	O
long	O
voyage	O
,	O
I	O
arrived	O
in	O
England	PNM
the	O
11th	O
of	O
June	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
year	O
1687	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
thirty-five	O
years	O
absent	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
England	PNM
I	O
was	O
as	O
perfect	O
a	O
stranger	O
to	O
all	O
the	O
world	O
as	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
never	O
been	O
known	O
there	O

My	O
benefactor	O

steward	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
had	O
left	O
my	O
money	O
in	O
trust	O
with	O

was	O
alive	O
,	O
but	O
had	O
had	O
great	O
misfortunes	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
;	O
was	O
become	O
a	O
widow	O
the	O
second	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
low	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

I	O
made	O
her	O
very	O
easy	O
as	O
to	O
what	O
she	O
owed	O
me	O
,	O
assuring	O
her	O
I	O
would	O
give	O
her	O
no	O
trouble	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
contrary	O
,	O
in	O
gratitude	O
for	O
her	O
former	O
care	O
and	O
faithfulness	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
relieved	O
her	O
as	O
my	O
little	O
stock	O
would	O
afford	O
;	O
which	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
would	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
allow	O
me	O
to	O
do	O
but	O
little	O
for	O
her	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
assured	O
her	O
I	O
would	O
never	O
forget	O
her	O
former	O
kindness	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
nor	O
did	O
I	O

her	O
when	O
I	O
had	O
sufficient	O
to	O

her	O

as	O
shall	O
be	O

in	O
its	O

I	O
went	O
down	O

into	O
Yorkshire	O

my	O

found	O
nothing	O

that	O
the	O

for	O

I	O
met	O
with	O
one	O
piece	O
of	O
gratitude	O
indeed	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
expect	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
was	O

that	O
the	O
master	O
of	O
the	O

whom	O
I	O
had	O
so	O
happily	O
delivered	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
the	O

saved	O
the	O
ship	O

having	O
given	O
a	O
very	O
handsome	O
account	O
to	O
the	O
owners	O
of	O
the	O

I	O
had	O
saved	O
the	O
lives	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
and	O
the	O
ship	O

they	O
invited	O
me	O
to	O
meet	O
them	O

some	O
other	O
merchants	O
concerned	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
together	O
made	O
me	O
a	O
very	O
handsome	O
compliment	O
upon	O
the	O

and	O
a	O
present	O
of	O
almost	O

But	O
after	O
making	O
several	O
reflections	O
upon	O
the	O
circumstances	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
little	O
way	O
this	O
would	O
go	O
towards	O
settling	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Lisbon	PNM
,	O
and	O
see	O
if	O
I	O
might	O
not	O
come	O
at	O
some	O
information	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
of	O
my	O
plantation	O
in	O
the	O
Brazils	PNM

and	O
of	O
what	O
was	O

of	O
my	O

,	O
who	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
suppose	O
,	O
had	O
some	O
years	O
past	O
given	O
me	O
over	O
for	O
dead	O
.	O

With	O
this	O
view	O
I	O
took	O
shipping	O
for	O
Lisbon	PNM
,	O
where	O
I	O
arrived	O
in	O
April	O
following	O
,	O
my	O
man	O
Friday	O
accompanying	O
me	O
very	O
honestly	O
in	O
all	O
these	O
ramblings	O
,	O
and	O
proving	O
a	O
most	O
faithful	O
servant	O
upon	O
all	O
occasions	O

When	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
Lisbon	PNM
,	O
I	O
found	O
out	O
,	O
by	O
inquiry	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
my	O
particular	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
my	O
old	O
friend	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
who	O
first	O
took	O
me	O
up	O
at	O

off	O
the	O

of	O
Africa	PNM

He	O
was	O
now	O
grown	O

had	O
left	O
off	O
going	O
to	O

,	O
having	O
put	O
his	O
son	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
far	O
from	O
a	O
young	O
man	O
,	O
into	O
his	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
still	O
used	O
the	O
Brazil	O
trade	O
.	O

The	O
old	O
man	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
I	O
hardly	O
knew	O
him	O

But	O
I	O
soon	O
brought	O
him	O
to	O
my	O
remembrance	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
soon	O
brought	O
myself	O
to	O
his	O
remembrance	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
who	O
I	O
was	O

After	O
some	O
passionate	O
expressions	O
of	O
the	O
old	O
acquaintance	O
between	O
us	O
,	O
I	O
inquired	O

you	O
may	O
be	O
sure	O

after	O
my	O
plantation	O
and	O
my	O
partner	O

The	O

for	O
about	O
nine	O

that	O

to	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
if	O
he	O
knew	O
to	O
what	O
height	O
of	O
improvement	O
he	O
had	O
brought	O
the	O

could	O
not	O
tell	O
exactly	O
to	O
what	O

the	O
plantation	O
was	O
improved	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
he	O
knew	O

that	O
my	O

upon	O
the	O

his	O

that	O

to	O

at	O

it	O

My	O
old	O
patron	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
was	O
honest	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
refuge	O
I	O
had	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
next	O
place	O
,	O
my	O
interest	O
in	O
the	O
Brazils	PNM
seemed	O
to	O
summon	O
me	O
thither	O
;	O
but	O
now	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
how	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
going	O
thither	O
till	O
I	O
had	O
settled	O
my	O
affairs	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
my	O
effects	O
in	O
some	O
safe	O
hands	O
behind	O
me	O
.	O

At	O
first	O
I	O
thought	O
of	O
my	O
old	O
friend	O
the	O
widow	O
,	O
who	O
I	O
knew	O
was	O
honest	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
be	O
just	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
but	O
then	O
she	O
was	O
in	O
years	O
,	O
and	O
but	O
poor	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
for	O
aught	O
I	O
knew	O
,	O
might	O
be	O
in	O
debt	O
:	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
way	O
but	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
England	PNM
myself	O
and	O
take	O
my	O
effects	O
with	O
me	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
some	O
months	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
before	O
I	O
resolved	O
upon	O
this	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
rewarded	O
the	O
old	O
captain	O
fully	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
his	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
my	O
former	O
benefactor	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
the	O
poor	O
widow	O
,	O
whose	O
husband	O
had	O
been	O
my	O
first	O
benefactor	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
,	O
while	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
her	O
power	O
,	O
my	O
faithful	O
steward	O
and	O
instructor	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
I	O
did	O
,	O
I	O
got	O
a	O
merchant	O
in	O
Lisbon	PNM
to	O
write	O
to	O
his	O
correspondent	O
in	O
London	PNM
,	O
not	O
only	O
to	O
pay	O
a	O
bill	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
go	O
find	O
her	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
carry	O
her	O
,	O
in	O
money	O
,	O
a	O
hundred	O
pounds	O
from	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
talk	O
with	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
comfort	O
her	O
in	O
her	O
poverty	O
,	O
by	O
telling	O
her	O
she	O
should	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
lived	O
,	O
have	O
a	O
further	O
supply	O
:	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
I	O
sent	O
my	O
two	O
sisters	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
a	O
hundred	O
pounds	O
each	O
,	O
they	O
being	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
in	O
want	O
,	O
yet	O
not	O
in	O
very	O
good	O
circumstances	O
;	O
one	O
having	O
been	O
married	O
and	O
left	O
a	O
widow	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
having	O
a	O
husband	O
not	O
so	O
kind	O
to	O
her	O
as	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
.	O

But	O
among	O
all	O
my	O
relations	O
or	O
acquaintances	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
yet	O
pitch	O
upon	O
one	O
to	O
whom	O
I	O
durst	O
commit	O
the	O
gross	O
of	O
my	O
stock	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
go	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
Brazils	PNM
,	O
and	O
leave	O
things	O
safe	O
behind	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
greatly	O
perplexed	O
me	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
once	O
a	O
mind	O
to	O
have	O
gone	O
to	O
the	O
Brazils	PNM
and	O
have	O
settled	O
myself	O
there	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
naturalised	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
had	O
some	O
little	O
scruple	O
in	O
my	O
mind	O
about	O
religion	O
,	O
which	O
insensibly	O
drew	O
me	O
back	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
religion	O
that	O
kept	O
me	O
from	O
going	O
there	O
for	O
the	O
present	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
no	O
scruple	O
of	O
being	O
openly	O
of	O
the	O
religion	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
all	O
the	O
while	O
I	O
was	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
so	O
neither	O
did	O
I	O
yet	O
;	O
only	O
that	O
,	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
having	O
of	O
late	O
thought	O
more	O
of	O
it	O
than	O
formerly	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
living	O
and	O
dying	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
regret	O
having	O
professed	O
myself	O
a	O
Papist	O
,	O
and	O
thought	O
it	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
the	O
best	O
religion	O
to	O
die	O
with	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
main	O
thing	O
that	O
kept	O
me	O
from	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
Brazils	PNM
,	O
but	O
that	O
really	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
with	O
whom	O
to	O
leave	O
my	O
effects	O
behind	O
me	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
resolved	O
at	O
last	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
England	PNM
,	O
where	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
arrived	O
,	O
I	O
concluded	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
make	O
some	O
acquaintance	O
,	O
or	O
find	O
some	O
relations	O
,	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
faithful	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
accordingly	O
,	O
I	O
prepared	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
England	PNM
with	O
all	O
my	O
wealth	O
.	O

In	O
order	O
to	O
prepare	O
things	O
for	O
my	O
going	O
home	O
,	O
I	O
first	O
-LRB-	O
the	O
Brazil	O
fleet	O
being	O
just	O
going	O
away	O
-RRB-	O
resolved	O
to	O
give	O
answers	O
suitable	O
to	O
the	O
just	O
and	O
faithful	O
account	O
of	O
things	O
I	O
had	O
from	O
thence	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
Prior	O
of	O
St.	PNM
Augustine	PNM
I	O
wrote	O
a	O
letter	O
full	O
of	O
thanks	O
for	O
his	O
just	O
dealings	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
offer	O
of	O
the	O
eight	O
hundred	O
and	O
seventy-two	O
moidores	O
which	O
were	O
undisposed	O
of	O

which	O
I	O
desired	O

five	O

three	O

I	O
wrote	O
next	O
a	O
letter	O
of	O
thanks	O
to	O
my	O
two	O
trustees	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
acknowledgment	O
that	O
so	O
much	O
justice	O
and	O
honesty	O
called	O
for	O
:	O
as	O
for	O
sending	O
them	O
any	O
present	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
far	O
above	O
having	O
any	O
occasion	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

Lastly	O
,	O
I	O
wrote	O
to	O
my	O
partner	O
,	O
acknowledging	O
his	O
industry	O
in	O
the	O
improving	O
the	O
plantation	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
integrity	O
in	O
increasing	O
the	O
stock	O
of	O
the	O
works	O
;	O
giving	O
him	O
instructions	O
for	O
his	O
future	O
government	O
of	O
my	O
part	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
powers	O
I	O
had	O
left	O
with	O
my	O
old	O
patron	O
,	O
to	O
whom	O
I	O
desired	O
him	O
to	O
send	O
whatever	O
became	O
due	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
till	O
he	O
should	O
hear	O
from	O
me	O
more	O
particularly	O
;	O
assuring	O
him	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
my	O
intention	O
not	O
only	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
settle	O
myself	O
there	O
for	O
the	O
remainder	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
.	O

To	O
this	O
I	O
added	O
a	O
very	O
handsome	O
present	O
of	O
some	O
Italian	O
silks	O
for	O
his	O
wife	O
and	O
two	O
daughters	O
,	O
for	O
such	O
the	O
captain	O
's	O
son	O
informed	O
me	O
he	O
had	O
;	O
with	O
two	O
pieces	O
of	O
fine	O
English	O
broadcloth	O
,	O
the	O
best	O
I	O
could	O
get	O
in	O
Lisbon	O
,	O
five	O
pieces	O
of	O
black	O
baize	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
Flanders	O
lace	O
of	O
a	O
good	O
value	O
.	O

Having	O
thus	O
settled	O
my	O
affairs	O
,	O
sold	O
my	O
cargo	O
,	O
and	O
turned	O
all	O
my	O
effects	O
into	O
good	O
bills	O
of	O
exchange	O
,	O
my	O
next	O
difficulty	O
was	O
which	O
way	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
England	PNM
:	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
accustomed	O
enough	O
to	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
strange	O
aversion	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
England	PNM
by	O
the	O
sea	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
I	O
could	O
give	O
no	O
reason	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
difficulty	O
increased	O
upon	O
me	O
so	O
much	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
I	O
had	O
once	O
shipped	O
my	O
baggage	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
go	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
altered	O
my	O
mind	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
not	O
once	O
but	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
times	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
true	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
very	O
unfortunate	O
by	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
might	O
be	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
reasons	O
;	O
but	O
let	O
no	O
man	O
slight	O
the	O
strong	O
impulses	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
thoughts	O
in	O
cases	O
of	O
such	O
moment	O
:	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
ships	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
singled	O
out	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
,	O
I	O
mean	O
more	O
particularly	O
singled	O
out	O
than	O
any	O
other	O
,	O
having	O
put	O
my	O
things	O
on	O
board	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
other	O
having	O
agreed	O
with	O
the	O
captain	O
;	O
I	O
say	O
two	O
of	O
these	O
ships	O
miscarried	O
.	O

One	O
was	O
taken	O
by	O
the	O
Algerines	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
was	O
lost	O
on	O
the	O
Start	O
,	O
near	O
Torbay	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
people	O
drowned	O
except	O
three	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
in	O
either	O
of	O
those	O
vessels	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
made	O
miserable	O
.	O

Having	O
been	O
thus	O
harassed	O
in	O
my	O
thoughts	O
,	O
my	O
old	O
pilot	O
,	O
to	O
whom	O
I	O
communicated	O
everything	O
,	O
pressed	O
me	O
earnestly	O
not	O
to	O
go	O
by	O
sea	O
,	O
but	O
either	O
to	O
go	O
by	O
land	O
to	O
the	O
Groyne	O
,	O
and	O
cross	O
over	O
the	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM
Biscay	PNM
to	O
Rochelle	PNM
,	O
from	O
whence	O
it	O
was	O
but	O
an	O
easy	O
and	O
safe	O
journey	O
by	O
land	O
to	O
Paris	PNM
,	O
and	O
so	O
to	O
Calais	PNM
and	O
Dover	O
;	O
or	O
to	O
go	O
up	O
to	O
Madrid	PNM
,	O
and	O
so	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
by	O
land	O
through	O
France	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
so	O
prepossessed	O
against	O
my	O
going	O
by	O
sea	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
except	O
from	O
Calais	PNM
to	O
Dover	PNM
,	O
that	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
travel	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
by	O
land	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
in	O
haste	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
value	O
the	O
charge	O
,	O
was	O
by	O
much	O
the	O
pleasanter	O
way	O
:	O
and	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
more	O
so	O
,	O
my	O
old	O
captain	O
brought	O
an	O
English	O
gentleman	O
,	O
the	O
son	O
of	O
a	O
merchant	O
in	O
Lisbon	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
willing	O
to	O
travel	O
with	O
me	O
;	O
after	O
which	O
we	O
picked	O
up	O
two	O
more	O
English	O
merchants	O
also	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
young	O
Portuguese	O
gentlemen	O
,	O
the	O
last	O
going	O
to	O
Paris	PNM
only	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
in	O
all	O
there	O
were	O
six	O
of	O
us	O
and	O
five	O
servants	O
;	O
the	O
two	O
merchants	O
and	O
the	O
two	O
Portuguese	O
,	O
contenting	O
themselves	O
with	O
one	O
servant	O
between	O
two	O
,	O
to	O
save	O
the	O
charge	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
got	O
an	O
English	O
sailor	O
to	O
travel	O
with	O
me	O
as	O
a	O
servant	O
,	O
besides	O
my	O
man	O
Friday	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
too	O
much	O
a	O
stranger	O
to	O
be	O
capable	O
of	O
supplying	O
the	O
place	O
of	O
a	O
servant	O
on	O
the	O
road	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
manner	O
I	O
set	O
out	O
from	O
Lisbon	PNM
;	O
and	O
our	O
company	O
being	O
very	O
well	O
mounted	O
and	O
armed	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
a	O
little	O
troop	O
,	O
whereof	O
they	O
did	O
me	O
the	O
honour	O
to	O
call	O
me	O
captain	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
because	O
I	O
was	O
the	O
oldest	O
man	O
,	O
as	O
because	O
I	O
had	O
two	O
servants	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
was	O
the	O
origin	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
journey	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
have	O
troubled	O
you	O
with	O
none	O
of	O
my	O
sea	O
journals	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
shall	O
trouble	O
you	O
now	O
with	O
none	O
of	O
my	O
land	O
journals	O
;	O
but	O
some	O
adventures	O
that	O
happened	O
to	O
us	O
in	O
this	O
tedious	O
and	O
difficult	O
journey	O
I	O
must	O
not	O
omit	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
Madrid	PNM
,	O
we	O
,	O
being	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
strangers	O
to	O
Spain	PNM
,	O
were	O
willing	O
to	O
stay	O
some	O
time	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
court	O
of	O
Spain	PNM
,	O
and	O
what	O
was	O
worth	O
observing	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
being	O
the	O
latter	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
summer	O
,	O
we	O
hastened	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
out	O
from	O
Madrid	PNM
about	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
October	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
edge	O
of	O
Navarre	PNM
,	O
we	O
were	O
alarmed	O
,	O
at	O
several	O
towns	O
on	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
with	O
an	O
account	O
that	O
so	O
much	O
snow	O
was	O
falling	O
on	O
the	O
French	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
mountains	O
,	O
that	O
several	O
travellers	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
come	O
back	O
to	O
Pampeluna	PNM
,	O
after	O
having	O
attempted	O
at	O
an	O
extreme	O
hazard	O
to	O
pass	O
on	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
Pampeluna	PNM
itself	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
so	O
indeed	O
;	O
and	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
always	O
used	O
to	O
a	O
hot	O
climate	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
countries	O
where	O
I	O
could	O
scarce	O
bear	O
any	O
clothes	O
on	O
,	O
the	O
cold	O
was	O
insufferable	O
;	O
nor	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
was	O
it	O
more	O
painful	O
than	O
surprising	O
to	O
come	O
but	O
ten	O
days	O
before	O
out	O
of	O
Old	PNM
Castile	PNM
,	O
where	O
the	O
weather	O
was	O
not	O
only	O
warm	O
but	O
very	O
hot	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
to	O
feel	O
a	O
wind	O
from	O
the	O
Pyrenean	O
Mountains	O
so	O
very	O
keen	O
,	O
so	O
severely	O
cold	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
be	O
intolerable	O
and	O
to	O
endanger	O
benumbing	O
and	O
perishing	O
of	O
our	O
fingers	O
and	O
toes	O
.	O

Poor	O
Friday	O
was	O
really	O
frightened	O
when	O
he	O
saw	O
the	O
mountains	O
all	O
covered	O
with	O
snow	O
,	O
and	O
felt	O
cold	O
weather	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
or	O
felt	O
before	O
in	O
his	O
life	O
.	O

To	O
mend	O
the	O
matter	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
Pampeluna	PNM
it	O
continued	O
snowing	O
with	O
so	O
much	O
violence	O
and	O
so	O
long	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
said	O
winter	O
was	O
come	O
before	O
its	O
time	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
roads	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
difficult	O
before	O
,	O
were	O
now	O
quite	O
impassable	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
the	O
snow	O
lay	O
in	O
some	O
places	O
too	O
thick	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
travel	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
not	O
hard	O
frozen	O
,	O
as	O
is	O
the	O
case	O
in	O
the	O
northern	O
countries	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
going	O
without	O
being	O
in	O
danger	O
of	O
being	O
buried	O
alive	O
every	O
step	O
.	O

We	O
stayed	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
twenty	O
days	O
at	O
Pampeluna	PNM
;	O
when	O
-LRB-	O
seeing	O
the	O
winter	O
coming	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
no	O
likelihood	O
of	O
its	O
being	O
better	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
severest	O
winter	O
all	O
over	O
Europe	PNM
that	O
had	O
been	O
known	O
in	O
the	O
memory	O
of	O
man	O
-RRB-	O
I	O
proposed	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
go	O
away	O
to	O
Fontarabia	PNM
,	O
and	O
there	O
take	O
shipping	O
for	O
Bordeaux	PNM
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
little	O
voyage	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
while	O
I	O
was	O
considering	O
this	O
,	O
there	O
came	O
in	O
four	O
French	O
gentlemen	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
stopped	O
on	O
the	O
French	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
passes	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
on	O
the	O
Spanish	O
,	O
had	O
found	O
out	O
a	O
guide	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
traversing	O
the	O
country	O
near	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
Languedoc	O
,	O
had	O
brought	O
them	O
over	O
the	O
mountains	O
by	O
such	O
ways	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
much	O
incommoded	O
with	O
the	O
snow	O
;	O
for	O
where	O
they	O
met	O
with	O
snow	O
in	O
any	O
quantity	O
,	O
they	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
frozen	O
hard	O
enough	O
to	O
bear	O
them	O
and	O
their	O
horses	O
.	O

We	O
sent	O
for	O
this	O
guide	O
,	O
who	O
told	O
us	O
he	O
would	O
undertake	O
to	O
carry	O
us	O
the	O
same	O
way	O
,	O
with	O
no	O
hazard	O
from	O
the	O
snow	O
,	O
provided	O
we	O
were	O
armed	O
sufficiently	O
to	O
protect	O
ourselves	O
from	O
wild	O
beasts	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
in	O
these	O
great	O
snows	O
it	O
was	O
frequent	O
for	O
some	O
wolves	O
to	O
show	O
themselves	O
at	O
the	O
foot	O
of	O
the	O
mountains	O
,	O
being	O
made	O
ravenous	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
food	O
,	O
the	O
ground	O
being	O
covered	O
with	O
snow	O
.	O

We	O
told	O
him	O
we	O
were	O
well	O
enough	O
prepared	O
for	O
such	O
creatures	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
insure	O
us	O
from	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
two-legged	O
wolves	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
told	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
most	O
danger	O
from	O
,	O
especially	O
on	O
the	O
French	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
mountains	O
.	O

He	O
satisfied	O
us	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
danger	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
go	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
readily	O
agreed	O
to	O
follow	O
him	O
,	O
as	O
did	O
also	O
twelve	O
other	O
gentlemen	O
with	O
their	O
servants	O
,	O
some	O
French	O
,	O
some	O
Spanish	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
had	O
attempted	O
to	O
go	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
come	O
back	O
again	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
we	O
set	O
out	O
from	O
Pampeluna	PNM
with	O
our	O
guide	O
on	O
the	O
15th	O
of	O
November	O
;	O
and	O
indeed	O
I	O
was	O
surprised	O
when	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
going	O
forward	O
,	O
he	O
came	O
directly	O
back	O
with	O
us	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
road	O
that	O
we	O
came	O
from	O
Madrid	PNM
,	O
about	O
twenty	O
miles	O
;	O
when	O
,	O
having	O
passed	O
two	O
rivers	O
,	O
and	O
come	O
into	O
the	O
plain	O
country	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
ourselves	O
in	O
a	O
warm	O
climate	O
again	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
country	O
was	O
pleasant	O
,	O
and	O
no	O
snow	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
,	O
turning	O
to	O
his	O
left	O
,	O
he	O
approached	O
the	O
mountains	O
another	O
way	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
it	O
is	O
true	O
the	O
hills	O
and	O
precipices	O
looked	O
dreadful	O
,	O
yet	O
he	O
made	O
so	O
many	O
tours	O
,	O
such	O
meanders	O
,	O
and	O
led	O
us	O
by	O
such	O
winding	O
ways	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
insensibly	O
passed	O
the	O
height	O
of	O
the	O
mountains	O
without	O
being	O
much	O
encumbered	O
with	O
the	O
snow	O
;	O
and	O
all	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
he	O
showed	O
us	O
the	O
pleasant	O
and	O
fruitful	O
provinces	O
of	O
Languedoc	PNM
and	O
Gascony	O
,	O
all	O
green	O
and	O
flourishing	O
,	O
though	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
some	O
rough	O
way	O
to	O
pass	O
still	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
a	O
little	O
uneasy	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
snowed	O
one	O
whole	O
day	O
and	O
a	O
night	O
so	O
fast	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
travel	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
bid	O
us	O
be	O
easy	O
;	O
we	O
should	O
soon	O
be	O
past	O
it	O
all	O
:	O
we	O
found	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
descend	O
every	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
come	O
more	O
north	O
than	O
before	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
,	O
depending	O
upon	O
our	O
guide	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
about	O
two	O
hours	O
before	O
night	O
when	O
,	O
our	O
guide	O
being	O
something	O
before	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
just	O
in	O
sight	O
,	O
out	O
rushed	O
three	O
monstrous	O
wolves	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
them	O
a	O
bear	O
,	O
from	O
a	O
hollow	O
way	O
adjoining	O
to	O
a	O
thick	O
wood	O
;	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
wolves	O
made	O
at	O
the	O
guide	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
he	O
been	O
far	O
before	O
us	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
devoured	O
before	O
we	O
could	O
have	O
helped	O
him	O
;	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
fastened	O
upon	O
his	O
horse	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
attacked	O
the	O
man	O
with	O
such	O
violence	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
time	O
,	O
or	O
presence	O
of	O
mind	O
enough	O
,	O
to	O
draw	O
his	O
pistol	O
,	O
but	O
hallooed	O
and	O
cried	O
out	O
to	O
us	O
most	O
lustily	O
.	O

My	O
man	O
Friday	O
being	O
next	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
bade	O
him	O
ride	O
up	O
and	O
see	O
what	O
was	O
the	O
matter	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
Friday	O
came	O
in	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
man	O
,	O
he	O
hallooed	O
out	O
as	O
loud	O
as	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
``	O
O	O
master	O
!	O

O	O
master	O
!	O
''	O

but	O
like	O
a	O
bold	O
fellow	O
,	O
rode	O
directly	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
poor	O
man	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
his	O
pistol	O
shot	O
the	O
wolf	O
in	O
the	O
head	O
that	O
attacked	O
him	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
happy	O
for	O
the	O
poor	O
man	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
my	O
man	O
Friday	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
used	O
to	O
such	O
creatures	O
in	O
his	O
country	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
fear	O
upon	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
went	O
close	O
up	O
to	O
him	O
and	O
shot	O
him	O
;	O
whereas	O
,	O
any	O
other	O
of	O
us	O
would	O
have	O
fired	O
at	O
a	O
farther	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
have	O
perhaps	O
either	O
missed	O
the	O
wolf	O
or	O
endangered	O
shooting	O
the	O
man	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
was	O
enough	O
to	O
have	O
terrified	O
a	O
bolder	O
man	O
than	O
I	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
it	O
alarmed	O
all	O
our	O
company	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
noise	O
of	O
Friday	O
's	O
pistol	O
,	O
we	O
heard	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
the	O
most	O
dismal	O
howling	O
of	O
wolves	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
noise	O
,	O
redoubled	O
by	O
the	O
echo	O
of	O
the	O
mountains	O
,	O
appeared	O
to	O
us	O
as	O
if	O
there	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
prodigious	O
number	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
perhaps	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
such	O
a	O
few	O
as	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
cause	O
of	O
apprehension	O
:	O
however	O
,	O
as	O
Friday	O
had	O
killed	O
this	O
wolf	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
that	O
had	O
fastened	O
upon	O
the	O
horse	O
left	O
him	O
immediately	O
,	O
and	O
fled	O
,	O
without	O
doing	O
him	O
any	O
damage	O
,	O
having	O
happily	O
fastened	O
upon	O
his	O
head	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
bosses	O
of	O
the	O
bridle	O
had	O
stuck	O
in	O
his	O
teeth	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
man	O
was	O
most	O
hurt	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
raging	O
creature	O
had	O
bit	O
him	O
twice	O
,	O
once	O
in	O
the	O
arm	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
time	O
a	O
little	O
above	O
his	O
knee	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
he	O
had	O
made	O
some	O
defence	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
just	O
tumbling	O
down	O
by	O
the	O
disorder	O
of	O
his	O
horse	O
,	O
when	O
Friday	O
came	O
up	O
and	O
shot	O
the	O
wolf	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
easy	O
to	O
suppose	O
that	O
at	O
the	O
noise	O
of	O
Friday	O
's	O
pistol	O
we	O
all	O
mended	O
our	O
pace	O
,	O
and	O
rode	O
up	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
very	O
difficult	O
,	O
would	O
give	O
us	O
leave	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
was	O
the	O
matter	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
came	O
clear	O
of	O
the	O
trees	O
,	O
which	O
blinded	O
us	O
before	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
clearly	O
what	O
had	O
been	O
the	O
case	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
Friday	O
had	O
disengaged	O
the	O
poor	O
guide	O

though	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
presently	O
discern	O
what	O

it	O

FIGHT	O
BETWEEN	O
FRIDAY	O
AND	O
A	O
BEAR	O
But	O
never	O
was	O
a	O
fight	O
managed	O
so	O
hardily	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
surprising	O
manner	O
as	O
that	O
which	O
followed	O
between	O
Friday	O
and	O
the	O
bear	O
,	O
which	O
gave	O
us	O
all	O

though	O
at	O
first	O
we	O
were	O
surprised	O

afraid	O
for	O
him	O

the	O
greatest	O

As	O
the	O
bear	O
is	O
a	O
heavy	O

clumsy	O
creature	O
,	O
and	O
does	O
not	O
gallop	O
as	O
the	O
wolf	O
does	O
,	O
who	O
is	O
swift	O
and	O
light	O
,	O
so	O
he	O
has	O
two	O
particular	O
qualities	O
,	O
which	O
generally	O
are	O
the	O
rule	O
of	O
his	O
actions	O
;	O

as	O
to	O
men	O

when	O

saw	O
him	O

down	O

off	O

on	O

down	O
on	O
the	O

we	O
were	O
entered	O

the	O

had	O

as	O
we	O

the	O
heels	O
of	O
the	O

came	O
up	O
with	O
him	O
quickly	O

took	O
up	O
a	O

threw	O
it	O
at	O
him	O

hit	O
him	O

on	O

did	O
him	O

more	O

against	O

it	O
answered	O
Friday	O

end	O

for	O
the	O
rogue	O
was	O
so	O
void	O

that	O

it	O

to	O

the	O

we	O

at	O

upon	O
the	O

deliver	O

was	O
angry	O
at	O
him	O
for	O
bringing	O
the	O

back	O
upon	O

when	O
he	O
was	O
going	O
about	O
his	O

another	O
way	O

especially	O
I	O
was	O

that	O

the	O

then	O
ran	O
away	O

one	O

turned	O
on	O
a	O

on	O

a	O
great	O

fit	O
for	O

he	O
beckoned	O
to	O
us	O

doubling	O
his	O
pace	O

he	O

up	O

down	O

at	O

six	O

the	O

at	O

at	O
it	O

but	O
let	O
it	O
lie	O

and	O
up	O
he	O
scrambles	O
into	O
the	O
tree	O

climbing	O
like	O
a	O
cat	O

though	O
so	O
monstrous	O
heavy	O

I	O
was	O
amazed	O
at	O
the	O
folly	O

as	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O

of	O
my	O
man	O

could	O
not	O
for	O
my	O
life	O
see	O
anything	O

laugh	O
at	O

till	O
seeing	O
the	O
bear	O
get	O
up	O

we	O
all	O
rode	O

When	O
we	O
came	O

was	O

out	O
to	O
the	O
small	O

of	O
a	O
large	O
branch	O

and	O
the	O
bear	O
got	O
about	O
half-way	O
to	O
him	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
bear	O
got	O
out	O
to	O
that	O
part	O
where	O
the	O
limb	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
was	O
weaker	O

``	O

now	O

he	O
began	O
jumping	O

shaking	O
the	O
bough	O

at	O
which	O
the	O
bear	O
began	O
to	O
totter	O

stood	O
still	O

began	O
to	O
look	O
behind	O

how	O
he	O

back	O

then	O

indeed	O

we	O
did	O

Friday	O
had	O
not	O
done	O
with	O
him	O
by	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O

when	O
seeing	O
him	O
stand	O
still	O

he	O
called	O
out	O
to	O
him	O
again	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
supposed	O
the	O
bear	O
could	O
speak	O

the	O

just	O

what	O
he	O

a	O

he	O
began	O
jumping	O
again	O

the	O

stopped	O
again	O

thought	O
now	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
time	O
to	O
knock	O
him	O
in	O
the	O

called	O
to	O
Friday	O
to	O
stand	O

we	O
should	O

to	O
shorten	O
the	O
story	O
,	O
Friday	O
danced	O
so	O
much	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
bear	O
stood	O
so	O
ticklish	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
laughing	O
enough	O

still	O
could	O
not	O
imagine	O
what	O
the	O
fellow	O
would	O
do	O

for	O
first	O
we	O
thought	O
he	O
depended	O
upon	O
shaking	O
the	O
bear	O
off	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
bear	O
was	O
too	O
cunning	O
for	O
that	O
too	O
;	O
for	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
go	O
out	O
far	O
enough	O
to	O
be	O
thrown	O
down	O

clung	O
fast	O
with	O
his	O
great	O

that	O
we	O

put	O

out	O

,	O
very	O
leisurely	O
.	O

At	O
this	O
juncture	O
,	O
and	O
just	O
before	O
he	O
could	O
set	O
his	O
hind	O
foot	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
Friday	O
stepped	O
up	O
close	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
clapped	O
the	O
muzzle	O
of	O
his	O
piece	O
into	O
his	O
ear	O
,	O
and	O
shot	O
him	O
dead	O
.	O

Then	O
the	O
rogue	O
turned	O
about	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
laugh	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
he	O
saw	O
we	O
were	O
pleased	O
by	O
our	O
looks	O
,	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
laugh	O
very	O
loud	O
.	O

``	O
So	O
we	O
kill	O
bear	O
in	O
my	O
country	O
,	O
''	O
says	O
Friday	O

``	O
So	O
you	O
kill	O
them	O
?	O
''	O

says	O
I	O
;	O
``	O
why	O

you	O
have	O
no	O

--	O
``	O
No	O

says	O
he	O

``	O
no	O

but	O

''	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
diversion	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
were	O
still	O
in	O
a	O
wild	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
guide	O
very	O
much	O
hurt	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
we	O
hardly	O
knew	O
;	O
the	O
howling	O
of	O
wolves	O
ran	O
much	O
in	O
my	O
head	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
except	O
the	O
noise	O
I	O
once	O
heard	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
of	O
Africa	PNM
,	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
something	O
already	O
,	O
I	O
never	O
heard	O
anything	O
that	O
filled	O
me	O
with	O
so	O
much	O
horror	O
.	O

These	O
things	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
approach	O
of	O
night	O
,	O
called	O
us	O
off	O
,	O
or	O
else	O
,	O
as	O
Friday	O
would	O
have	O
had	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
certainly	O
have	O
taken	O
the	O
skin	O
of	O
this	O
monstrous	O
creature	O
off	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
worth	O
saving	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
had	O
near	O
three	O
leagues	O
to	O
go	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
guide	O
hastened	O
us	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
left	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
forward	O
on	O
our	O
journey	O
.	O

The	O
ground	O
was	O
still	O
covered	O
with	O
snow	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
so	O
deep	O
and	O
dangerous	O
as	O
on	O
the	O
mountains	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
ravenous	O
creatures	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
heard	O
afterwards	O
,	O
were	O
come	O
down	O
into	O
the	O
forest	O
and	O
plain	O
country	O
,	O
pressed	O
by	O
hunger	O
,	O
to	O
seek	O
for	O
food	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
done	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
mischief	O
in	O
the	O
villages	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
surprised	O
the	O
country	O
people	O
,	O
killed	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
of	O
their	O
sheep	O
and	O
horses	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
people	O
too	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
one	O
dangerous	O
place	O
to	O
pass	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
guide	O
told	O
us	O
if	O
there	O
were	O
more	O
wolves	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
we	O
should	O
find	O
them	O
there	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
small	O
plain	O
,	O
surrounded	O
with	O
woods	O
on	O
every	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
long	O
,	O
narrow	O
defile	O
,	O
or	O
lane	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
pass	O
to	O
get	O
through	O
the	O
wood	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
should	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
village	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
lodge	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
within	O
half-an-hour	O
of	O
sunset	O
when	O
we	O
entered	O
the	O
wood	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
after	O
sunset	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
plain	O
:	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
nothing	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
wood	O
,	O
except	O
that	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
plain	O
within	O
the	O
wood	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
not	O
above	O
two	O
furlongs	O
over	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
five	O
great	O
wolves	O
cross	O
the	O
road	O
,	O
full	O
speed	O
,	O
one	O
after	O
another	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
chase	O
of	O
some	O
prey	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
it	O
in	O
view	O
;	O
they	O
took	O
no	O
notice	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
gone	O
out	O
of	O
sight	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
moments	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
,	O
our	O
guide	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
was	O
but	O
a	O
fainthearted	O
fellow	O
,	O
bid	O
us	O
keep	O
in	O
a	O
ready	O
posture	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
believed	O
there	O
were	O
more	O
wolves	O
a-coming	O
.	O

We	O
kept	O
our	O
arms	O
ready	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
eyes	O
about	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
saw	O
no	O
more	O
wolves	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
through	O
that	O
wood	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
near	O
half	O
a	O
league	O
,	O
and	O
entered	O
the	O
plain	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
plain	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
occasion	O
enough	O
to	O
look	O
about	O
us	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
object	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
was	O
a	O
dead	O
horse	O
;	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
a	O
poor	O
horse	O
which	O
the	O
wolves	O
had	O
killed	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
least	O
a	O
dozen	O
of	O
them	O
at	O
work	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
say	O
eating	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
picking	O
his	O
bones	O
rather	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
eaten	O
up	O
all	O
the	O
flesh	O
before	O
.	O

We	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
fit	O
to	O
disturb	O
them	O
at	O
their	O
feast	O
,	O
neither	O
did	O
they	O
take	O
much	O
notice	O
of	O
us	O
.	O

Friday	O
would	O
have	O
let	O
fly	O
at	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
suffer	O
him	O
by	O
any	O
means	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
found	O
we	O
were	O
like	O
to	O
have	O
more	O
business	O
upon	O
our	O
hands	O
than	O
we	O
were	O
aware	O
of	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
not	O
gone	O
half	O
over	O
the	O
plain	O
when	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
hear	O
the	O
wolves	O
howl	O
in	O
the	O
wood	O
on	O
our	O
left	O
in	O
a	O
frightful	O
manner	O
,	O
and	O
presently	O
after	O
we	O
saw	O
about	O
a	O
hundred	O
coming	O
on	O
directly	O
towards	O
us	O
,	O
all	O
in	O
a	O
body	O
,	O
and	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
line	O
,	O
as	O
regularly	O
as	O
an	O
army	O
drawn	O
up	O
by	O
experienced	O
officers	O
.	O

I	O
scarce	O
knew	O
in	O
what	O
manner	O
to	O
receive	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
found	O
to	O
draw	O
ourselves	O
in	O
a	O
close	O
line	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
way	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
formed	O
in	O
a	O
moment	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
not	O
have	O
too	O
much	O
interval	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
that	O
only	O
every	O
other	O
man	O
should	O
fire	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
others	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
not	O
fired	O
,	O
should	O
stand	O
ready	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
a	O
second	O
volley	O
immediately	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
continued	O
to	O
advance	O
upon	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
that	O
those	O
that	O
had	O
fired	O
at	O
first	O
should	O
not	O
pretend	O
to	O
load	O
their	O
fusees	O
again	O
,	O
but	O
stand	O
ready	O
,	O
every	O
one	O
with	O
a	O
pistol	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
armed	O
with	O
a	O
fusee	O
and	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
pistols	O
each	O
man	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
by	O
this	O
method	O
,	O
able	O
to	O
fire	O
six	O
volleys	O
,	O
half	O
of	O
us	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
at	O
present	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
necessity	O
;	O
for	O
upon	O
firing	O
the	O
first	O
volley	O
,	O
the	O
enemy	O
made	O
a	O
full	O
stop	O
,	O
being	O
terrified	O
as	O
well	O
with	O
the	O
noise	O
as	O
with	O
the	O
fire	O
.	O

Four	O
of	O
them	O
being	O
shot	O
in	O
the	O
head	O
,	O
dropped	O
;	O
several	O
others	O
were	O
wounded	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
bleeding	O
off	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
by	O
the	O
snow	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
they	O
stopped	O
,	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
immediately	O
retreat	O
;	O
whereupon	O
,	O
remembering	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
told	O
that	O
the	O
fiercest	O
creatures	O
were	O
terrified	O
at	O
the	O
voice	O
of	O
a	O
man	O
,	O
I	O
caused	O
all	O
the	O
company	O
to	O
halloo	O
as	O
loud	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
found	O
the	O
notion	O
not	O
altogether	O
mistaken	O
;	O
for	O
upon	O
our	O
shout	O
they	O
began	O
to	O
retire	O
and	O
turn	O
about	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
ordered	O
a	O
second	O
volley	O
to	O
be	O
fired	O
in	O
their	O
rear	O
,	O
which	O
put	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
gallop	O
,	O
and	O
away	O
they	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
woods	O
.	O

This	O
gave	O
us	O
leisure	O
to	O
charge	O
our	O
pieces	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
lose	O
no	O
time	O
,	O
we	O
kept	O
going	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
had	O
but	O
little	O
more	O
than	O
loaded	O
our	O
fusees	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
ourselves	O
in	O
readiness	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
heard	O
a	O
terrible	O
noise	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
wood	O
on	O
our	O
left	O
,	O
only	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
farther	O
onward	O
,	O
the	O
same	O
way	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
go	O
.	O

The	O
night	O
was	O
coming	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
light	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
dusky	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
it	O
worse	O
on	O
our	O
side	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
noise	O
increasing	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
easily	O
perceive	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
howling	O
and	O
yelling	O
of	O
those	O
hellish	O
creatures	O
;	O
and	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
we	O
perceived	O
three	O
troops	O
of	O
wolves	O
,	O
one	O
on	O
our	O
left	O
,	O
one	O
behind	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
in	O
our	O
front	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
surrounded	O
with	O
them	O
:	O
however	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
fall	O
upon	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
kept	O
our	O
way	O
forward	O
,	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
make	O
our	O
horses	O
go	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
the	O
way	O
being	O
very	O
rough	O
,	O
was	O
only	O
a	O
good	O
hard	O
trot	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
manner	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
in	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
entrance	O
of	O
a	O
wood	O
,	O
through	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
pass	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
farther	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
plain	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
were	O
greatly	O
surprised	O
,	O
when	O
coming	O
nearer	O
the	O
lane	O
or	O
pass	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
confused	O
number	O
of	O
wolves	O
standing	O
just	O
at	O
the	O
entrance	O
.	O

On	O
a	O
sudden	O
,	O
at	O
another	O
opening	O
of	O
the	O
wood	O
,	O
we	O
heard	O
the	O
noise	O
of	O
a	O
gun	O
,	O
and	O
looking	O
that	O
way	O
,	O
out	O
rushed	O
a	O
horse	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
saddle	O
and	O
a	O
bridle	O
on	O
him	O
,	O
flying	O
like	O
the	O
wind	O
,	O
and	O
sixteen	O
or	O
seventeen	O
wolves	O
after	O
him	O
,	O
full	O
speed	O
:	O
the	O
horse	O
had	O
the	O
advantage	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
we	O
supposed	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
hold	O
it	O
at	O
that	O
rate	O
,	O
we	O
doubted	O
not	O
but	O
they	O
would	O
get	O
up	O
with	O
him	O
at	O
last	O
:	O
no	O
question	O
but	O
they	O
did	O
.	O

But	O
here	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
most	O
horrible	O
sight	O
;	O
for	O
riding	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
entrance	O
where	O
the	O
horse	O
came	O
out	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
carcasses	O
of	O
another	O
horse	O
and	O
of	O
two	O
men	O
,	O
devoured	O
by	O
the	O
ravenous	O
creatures	O
;	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
was	O
no	O
doubt	O
the	O
same	O
whom	O
we	O
heard	O
fire	O
the	O
gun	O
,	O
for	O
there	O
lay	O
a	O
gun	O
just	O
by	O
him	O
fired	O
off	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
man	O
,	O
his	O
head	O
and	O
the	O
upper	O
part	O
of	O
his	O
body	O
was	O
eaten	O
up	O
.	O

This	O
filled	O
us	O
with	O
horror	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
course	O
to	O
take	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
creatures	O
resolved	O
us	O
soon	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
gathered	O
about	O
us	O
presently	O
,	O
in	O
hopes	O
of	O
prey	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
verily	O
believe	O
there	O
were	O
three	O
hundred	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

It	O
happened	O
,	O
very	O
much	O
to	O
our	O
advantage	O
,	O
that	O
at	O
the	O
entrance	O
into	O
the	O
wood	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
from	O
it	O
,	O
there	O
lay	O
some	O
large	O
timber-trees	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
cut	O
down	O
the	O
summer	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
suppose	O
lay	O
there	O
for	O
carriage	O
.	O

I	O
drew	O
my	O
little	O
troop	O
in	O
among	O
those	O
trees	O
,	O
and	O
placing	O
ourselves	O
in	O
a	O
line	O
behind	O
one	O
long	O
tree	O
,	O
I	O
advised	O
them	O
all	O
to	O
alight	O
,	O
and	O
keeping	O
that	O
tree	O
before	O
us	O
for	O
a	O
breastwork	O
,	O
to	O
stand	O
in	O
a	O
triangle	O
,	O
or	O
three	O
fronts	O
,	O
enclosing	O
our	O
horses	O
in	O
the	O
centre	O
.	O

We	O
did	O
so	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
well	O
we	O
did	O
;	O
for	O
never	O
was	O
a	O
more	O
furious	O
charge	O
than	O
the	O
creatures	O
made	O
upon	O
us	O
in	O
this	O
place	O
.	O

They	O
came	O
on	O
with	O
a	O
growling	O
kind	O
of	O
noise	O
,	O
and	O
mounted	O
the	O
piece	O
of	O
timber	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
was	O
our	O
breastwork	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
only	O
rushing	O
upon	O
their	O
prey	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
fury	O
of	O
theirs	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
was	O
principally	O
occasioned	O
by	O
their	O
seeing	O
our	O
horses	O
behind	O
us	O
.	O

I	O
ordered	O
our	O
men	O
to	O
fire	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
every	O
other	O
man	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
took	O
their	O
aim	O
so	O
sure	O
that	O
they	O
killed	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
wolves	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
volley	O
;	O
but	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
necessity	O
to	O
keep	O
a	O
continual	O
firing	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
came	O
on	O
like	O
devils	O
,	O
those	O
behind	O
pushing	O
on	O
those	O
before	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
fired	O
a	O
second	O
volley	O
of	O
our	O
fusees	O
,	O
we	O
thought	O
they	O
stopped	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
hoped	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
gone	O
off	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
but	O
a	O
moment	O
,	O
for	O
others	O
came	O
forward	O
again	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
fired	O
two	O
volleys	O
of	O
our	O
pistols	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
believe	O
in	O
these	O
four	O
firings	O
we	O
had	O
killed	O
seventeen	O
or	O
eighteen	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
lamed	O
twice	O
as	O
many	O
,	O
yet	O
they	O
came	O
on	O
again	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
loth	O
to	O
spend	O
our	O
shot	O
too	O
hastily	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
called	O
my	O
servant	O
,	O
not	O
my	O
man	O
Friday	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
was	O
better	O
employed	O
,	O
for	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
greatest	O
dexterity	O
imaginable	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
charged	O
my	O
fusee	O
and	O
his	O
own	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
engaged	O
--	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
I	O
called	O
my	O
other	O
man	O
,	O
and	O
giving	O
him	O
a	O
horn	O
of	O
powder	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
him	O
lay	O
a	O
train	O
all	O
along	O
the	O
piece	O
of	O
timber	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
it	O
be	O
a	O
large	O
train	O
.	O

He	O
did	O
so	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
but	O
just	O
time	O
to	O
get	O
away	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
wolves	O
came	O
up	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
got	O
upon	O
it	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
,	O
snapping	O
an	O
unchanged	O
pistol	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
powder	O
,	O
set	O
it	O
on	O
fire	O
;	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
upon	O
the	O
timber	O
were	O
scorched	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
of	O
them	O
fell	O
;	O
or	O
rather	O
jumped	O
in	O
among	O
us	O
with	O
the	O
force	O
and	O
fright	O
of	O
the	O
fire	O
;	O
we	O
despatched	O
these	O
in	O
an	O
instant	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
rest	O
were	O
so	O
frightened	O
with	O
the	O
light	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
night	O
--	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
now	O
very	O
near	O
dark	O
--	O
made	O
more	O
terrible	O
that	O
they	O
drew	O
back	O
a	O
little	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
I	O
ordered	O
our	O
last	O
pistols	O
to	O
be	O
fired	O
off	O
in	O
one	O
volley	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
that	O
we	O
gave	O
a	O
shout	O
;	O
upon	O
this	O
the	O
wolves	O
turned	O
tail	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
sallied	O
immediately	O
upon	O
near	O
twenty	O
lame	O
ones	O
that	O
we	O
found	O
struggling	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
fell	O
to	O
cutting	O
them	O
with	O
our	O
swords	O
,	O
which	O
answered	O
our	O
expectation	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
crying	O
and	O
howling	O
they	O
made	O
was	O
better	O
understood	O
by	O
their	O
fellows	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
all	O
fled	O
and	O
left	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
,	O
first	O
and	O
last	O
,	O
killed	O
about	O
threescore	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
it	O
been	O
daylight	O
we	O
had	O
killed	O
many	O
more	O
.	O

The	O
field	O
of	O
battle	O
being	O
thus	O
cleared	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
forward	O
again	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
still	O
near	O
a	O
league	O
to	O
go	O
.	O

We	O
heard	O
the	O
ravenous	O
creatures	O
howl	O
and	O
yell	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
as	O
we	O
went	O
several	O
times	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
we	O
fancied	O
we	O
saw	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
snow	O
dazzling	O
our	O
eyes	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
certain	O
.	O

In	O
about	O
an	O
hour	O
more	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
town	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
lodge	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
in	O
a	O
terrible	O
fright	O
and	O
all	O
in	O
arms	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
the	O
night	O
before	O
the	O
wolves	O
and	O
some	O
bears	O
had	O
broken	O
into	O
the	O
village	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
them	O
in	O
such	O
terror	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
keep	O
guard	O
night	O
and	O
day	O
,	O
but	O
especially	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
to	O
preserve	O
their	O
cattle	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
their	O
people	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
our	O
guide	O
was	O
so	O
ill	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
limbs	O
swelled	O
so	O
much	O
with	O
the	O
rankling	O
of	O
his	O
two	O
wounds	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
go	O
no	O
farther	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
new	O
guide	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
go	O
to	O
Toulouse	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
warm	O
climate	O
,	O
a	O
fruitful	O
,	O
pleasant	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
no	O
snow	O
,	O
no	O
wolves	O
,	O
nor	O
anything	O
like	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
we	O
told	O
our	O
story	O
at	O
Toulouse	O
,	O
they	O
told	O
us	O
it	O
was	O
nothing	O
but	O
what	O
was	O
ordinary	O
in	O
the	O
great	O
forest	O
at	O
the	O
foot	O
of	O
the	O
mountains	O
,	O
especially	O
when	O
the	O
snow	O
lay	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
inquired	O
much	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
guide	O
we	O
had	O
got	O
who	O
would	O
venture	O
to	O
bring	O
us	O
that	O
way	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
severe	O
season	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
us	O
it	O
was	O
surprising	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
all	O
devoured	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
told	O
them	O
how	O
we	O
placed	O
ourselves	O
and	O
the	O
horses	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
,	O
they	O
blamed	O
us	O
exceedingly	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
us	O
it	O
was	O
fifty	O
to	O
one	O
but	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
all	O
destroyed	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
horses	O
which	O
made	O
the	O
wolves	O
so	O
furious	O
,	O
seeing	O
their	O
prey	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
at	O
other	O
times	O
they	O
are	O
really	O
afraid	O
of	O
a	O
gun	O
;	O
but	O
being	O
excessively	O
hungry	O
,	O
and	O
raging	O
on	O
that	O
account	O
,	O
the	O
eagerness	O
to	O
come	O
at	O
the	O
horses	O
had	O
made	O
them	O
senseless	O
of	O
danger	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
by	O
the	O
continual	O
fire	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
by	O
the	O
stratagem	O
of	O
the	O
train	O
of	O
powder	O
,	O
mastered	O
them	O
,	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
great	O
odds	O
but	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
torn	O
to	O
pieces	O
;	O
whereas	O
,	O
had	O
we	O
been	O
content	O
to	O
have	O
sat	O
still	O
on	O
horseback	O
,	O
and	O
fired	O
as	O
horsemen	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
taken	O
the	O
horses	O
so	O
much	O
for	O
their	O
own	O
,	O
when	O
men	O
were	O
on	O
their	O
backs	O
,	O
as	O
otherwise	O
;	O
and	O
withal	O
,	O
they	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
stood	O
altogether	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
our	O
horses	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
so	O
eager	O
to	O
have	O
devoured	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
come	O
off	O
safe	O
,	O
especially	O
having	O
our	O
firearms	O
in	O
our	O
hands	O
,	O
being	O
so	O
many	O
in	O
number	O

For	O
my	O
part	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
never	O
so	O
sensible	O
of	O
danger	O
in	O
my	O
life	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
seeing	O
above	O
three	O
hundred	O
devils	O
come	O
roaring	O
and	O
open-mouthed	O
to	O
devour	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
nothing	O
to	O
shelter	O
us	O
or	O
retreat	O
to	O

I	O
gave	O
myself	O
over	O
for	O

;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O

I	O
believe	O
I	O
shall	O
never	O
care	O
to	O
cross	O
those	O

again	O

I	O
think	O
I	O
would	O
much	O

go	O
a	O
thousand	O
leagues	O
by	O

though	O
I	O
was	O
sure	O
to	O
meet	O
with	O
a	O

I	O
have	O
nothing	O

to	O
take	O
notice	O
of	O
in	O
my	O
passage	O
through	O
France	O
--	O
nothing	O

what	O

given	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
with	O
much	O
more	O
advantage	O
than	O

I	O
travelled	O
from	O
Toulouse	PNM
to	O
Paris	PNM
,	O
and	O
without	O
any	O
considerable	O
stay	O
came	O
to	O
Calais	PNM

and	O
landed	O
safe	O
at	O
Dover	PNM
the	O
14th	O
of	O
January	O
,	O
after	O
having	O
had	O
a	O
severe	O
cold	O
season	O
to	O
travel	O
in	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
now	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
centre	O
of	O
my	O
travels	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
time	O
all	O
my	O
new-discovered	O
estate	O
safe	O
about	O
me	O
,	O
the	O
bills	O
of	O

which	O
I	O

with	O

My	O
principal	O
guide	O
and	O
privy-counsellor	O
was	O
my	O
good	O
ancient	O
widow	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
in	O
gratitude	O
for	O
the	O
money	O
I	O
had	O
sent	O
her	O
,	O
thought	O
no	O
pains	O
too	O
much	O
nor	O
care	O
too	O
great	O
to	O
employ	O
for	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
trusted	O
her	O
so	O
entirely	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
perfectly	O
easy	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
security	O
of	O
my	O
effects	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
happy	O
from	O
the	O
beginning	O
,	O
and	O
now	O
to	O
the	O
end	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
unspotted	O
integrity	O
of	O
this	O
good	O
gentlewoman	O

And	O
now	O
,	O
having	O
resolved	O
to	O
dispose	O
of	O
my	O
plantation	O
in	O
the	O
Brazils	PNM
,	O
I	O
wrote	O
to	O
my	O
old	O
friend	O
at	O
Lisbon	PNM
,	O
who	O
,	O
having	O
offered	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
two	O
merchants	O
,	O
the	O
survivors	O
of	O
my	O
trustees	O
,	O
who	O
lived	O
in	O
the	O
Brazils	PNM
,	O
they	O
accepted	O
the	O
offer	O
,	O
and	O
remitted	O
thirty-three	O
thousand	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
to	O
a	O
correspondent	O
of	O
theirs	O
at	O
Lisbon	PNM
to	O
pay	O
for	O
it	O
.	O

In	O
return	O
,	O
I	O
signed	O
the	O
instrument	O
of	O
sale	O
in	O
the	O
form	O
which	O
they	O
sent	O
from	O
Lisbon	PNM
,	O
and	O
sent	O
it	O
to	O
my	O
old	O
man	O
,	O
who	O
sent	O
me	O
the	O
bills	O
of	O
exchange	O
for	O
thirty-two	O
thousand	O
eight	O
hundred	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
for	O
the	O
estate	O

reserving	O
the	O

of	O
one	O
hundred	O
moidores	O
a	O

to	O
him	O
-LRB-	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
-RRB-	O
during	O
his	O

and	O
fifty	O
moidores	O
afterwards	O
to	O
his	O

for	O
his	O
life	O

which	O
I	O
had	O

and	O
which	O
the	O
plantation	O
was	O
to	O
make	O
good	O
as	O
a	O

And	O
thus	O
I	O
have	O
given	O
the	O
first	O
part	O
of	O
a	O
life	O
of	O
fortune	O

--	O
a	O
life	O
of	O

of	O
a	O
