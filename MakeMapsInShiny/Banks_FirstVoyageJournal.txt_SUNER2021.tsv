It	O
is	O
now	O

that	O
I	O

This	O

we	O
were	O
abreast	O
of	O
the	O
land	O
which	O
proved	O
as	O
we	O
thought	O

the	O

About	O

we	O

which	O
is	O
just	O
by	O

This	O

we	O

the	O

could	O
not	O
tonight	O

it	O

so	O

we	O
had	O
seen	O
for	O
some	O

a	O
small	O
vessel	O
under	O
the	O

which	O
seemd	O
to	O

The	O

the	O

about	O

were	O
immensely	O
high	O

that	O
some	O
of	O

compared	O
them	O
with	O
the	O
Pike	O

tho	O
I	O

not	O
myself	O

about	O

it	O
being	O
quite	O

we	O
made	O
our	O

very	O
slowly	O

The	O
sea	O
was	O
inconceveably	O
full	O
of	O

so	O
that	O
neither	O

were	O
there	O
any	O

which	O
made	O

than	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
before	O

The	O
air	O
was	O
here	O
very	O
cold	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
frequent	O
snow	O

I	O
had	O
now	O
intirely	O

With	O

we	O

the	O

of	O
the	O

when	O
they	O
both	O
gave	O

that	O

the	O
Dr	O
on	O

that	O
he	O

sleep	O
a	O

before	O

and	O
actualy	O
did	O
full	O
a	O

of	O
an	O

at	O

it	O
;	O
finding	O
it	O
impossible	O
to	O

Richmond	O
stir	O
left	O

with	O
him	O
who	O

With	O

I	O

the	O

to	O
it	O
and	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
two	O

were	O
sufficiently	O

sent	O
them	O
out	O
in	O
hopes	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
bring	O
Richmond	O
and	O
the	O
rest	O
;	O
after	O
staying	O
about	O
half	O
an	O

but	O
could	O
not	O

We	O
now	O
guess	O
'd	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
the	O
mischeif	O

a	O
bottle	O
of	O

the	O
whole	O
of	O
our	O
stock	O
was	O
missing	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
soon	O
concluded	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
Knapsacks	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
two	O
who	O
were	O

had	O
drank	O
immoderately	O

the	O

For	O
two	O
hours	O
now	O
it	O
had	O
snowd	O
almost	O
incessantly	O
so	O
we	O
had	O
little	O
hopes	O
of	O
seeing	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
alive	O
:	O
about	O
12	O
however	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
Joy	O
we	O
heard	O
a	O
shouting	O
,	O
on	O
which	O
myself	O
and	O
4	O
more	O
went	O
out	O
immediately	O
and	O
found	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
Seaman	O
who	O
had	O
wakd	O
almost	O
starvd	O
to	O
death	O
and	O
come	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
from	O
where	O
he	O
lay	O
.	O

Him	O
I	O
sent	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
fire	O
and	O
proceeded	O
by	O
his	O
direction	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
,	O
Richmond	O
was	O
upon	O
his	O
leggs	O
but	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
walk	O
the	O
other	O
lay	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
as	O
insensible	O
as	O
a	O

We	O
immediately	O
calld	O
all	O
hands	O
from	O
the	O
fire	O
and	O
attempted	O
by	O
all	O
the	O
means	O
we	O
could	O
contrive	O
to	O
bring	O
them	O
down	O
but	O
finding	O
it	O
absolutely	O
impossible	O
,	O
the	O
road	O
was	O
so	O
bad	O
and	O
the	O
night	O
so	O
dark	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
scarcely	O
ourselves	O
get	O
on	O
nor	O
did	O
we	O
without	O
many	O
Falls	O

We	O
would	O
then	O
have	O
lit	O
a	O
fire	O
upon	O
the	O
spot	O
but	O
the	O
snow	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
that	O
which	O
continualy	O
fell	O
renderd	O
that	O
as	O
impracticable	O
as	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
bring	O
fire	O
from	O
the	O
other	O
place	O
was	O
also	O
impossible	O
from	O
the	O
quantity	O
of	O
snow	O
which	O
fell	O
every	O
moment	O
from	O
the	O
branches	O
of	O
the	O

so	O
we	O
were	O
forc	O
'd	O
to	O
content	O
ourselves	O
with	O
laying	O
out	O
our	O
unfortunate	O
companions	O
upon	O
a	O
bed	O
of	O
boughs	O
and	O
covering	O
them	O
over	O
with	O
boughs	O
also	O
as	O
thick	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
able	O
,	O
and	O
thus	O
we	O
left	O
them	O
hopeless	O
of	O
ever	O
seeing	O
them	O
again	O
alive	O
which	O
indeed	O
we	O
never	O

In	O

an	O

a	O

this	O

that	O

Mr	O
Green	O
and	O
myself	O
went	O
today	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
upon	O
the	O
hills	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
see	O
how	O
the	O
roads	O
were	O
.	O

Lycurgus	O
went	O
with	O
us	O
but	O
complaind	O
much	O
in	O
the	O
ascent	O
saying	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
kill	O
him	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
we	O
went	O
,	O
possibly	O
3	O
miles	O
,	O
exceeding	O
good	O
paths	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
farthest	O

walk	O
boys	O
bringing	O
wood	O
from	O
the	O
mountans	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
look	O
upon	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
sure	O
proof	O
that	O
journey	O
will	O
be	O
easy	O
whenever	O
we	O
atempt	O
to	O
go	O
higher	O
.	O

In	O
our	O
return	O
I	O
visited	O
the	O
Tomb	O
or	O
Bier	O
in	O
which	O
was	O
deposited	O
the	O
body	O
of	O
the	O
man	O
who	O
was	O
shot	O

I	O
lifted	O
up	O
the	O
cloth	O
and	O
saw	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
body	O
already	O
dropping	O
to	O
peices	O
with	O
putrefaction	O
about	O
him	O
and	O
indeed	O
within	O
all	O

abundance	O

Such	O
an	O
advance	O
of	O
putrefaction	O
in	O
8	O
days	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
no	O
more	O
since	O
he	O
was	O
shot	O
is	O
almost	O
past	O
credit	O

what	O
will	O
not	O

hot	O
climate	O
and	O
plenty	O
of	O

do	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
this	O
evening	O
some	O
conversation	O
about	O
an	O
ax	O
which	O
was	O
brought	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
by	O
Hercules	O
,	O
it	O
wanting	O
grinding	O

Its	O
make	O
was	O
very	O
different	O
from	O
that	O
of	O
our	O
English	O
ones	O

were	O
of	O
opinion	O

opinion	O
that	O

The	O
difficulty	O

to	O

at	O

easily	O
solvd	O
by	O

Dr	O

went	O
along	O

to	O

in	O

For	O
about	O

that	O

This	O

continued	O
for	O
about	O
3	O

when	O
we	O

to	O

out	O

100	O

About	O

that	O

no	O

a	O

going	O
at	O

All	O

nothing	O

Within	O

the	O

The	O
general	O

was	O
given	O
as	O
I	O
before	O

the	O
particular	O
one	O
soon	O
followd	O
it	O
by	O
which	O
any	O

singled	O
out	O

it	O
was	O

different	O
I	O
was	O
sure	O
from	O
any	O
thing	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
carried	O
out	O
or	O
made	O
either	O
by	O
the	O
Dolphin	O
or	O
this	O
ship	O
.	O

This	O
excited	O
my	O
curiosity	O
,	O
much	O
the	O
more	O
so	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
told	O
that	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
come	O
out	O
of	O
either	O
of	O
those	O
ships	O
but	O
from	O
two	O
others	O
which	O
came	O
here	O
together	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
discovery	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
neglected	O
.	O

With	O
much	O
dificulty	O
and	O
labour	O
I	O
at	O
last	O
got	O
the	O
following	O
account	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
viz	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
their	O
month	O
of	O
Pepére	O
which	O
answers	O
to	O
our	O

came	O
here	O
commanded	O
by	O
a	O
man	O
whoom	O
they	O
calld	O
To	PNM
Otterah	PNM
;	O
that	O
they	O
lay	O
8	O
days	O
in	O
a	O
bay	O
calld	O
Hidea	O
,	O
some	O
leagues	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
of	O
Matavie	PNM
where	O
the	O
ship	O
now	O
lies	O
;	O
that	O
during	O
their	O
stay	O
they	O
sent	O
tents	O
ashore	O
and	O
some	O
slept	O
in	O
them	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
cheifly	O
connected	O
with	O
a	O
cheif	O
whose	O
name	O
was	O
Orétte	O
,	O
whose	O
younger	O
brother	O
they	O
carried	O
away	O
with	O
them	O
promising	O
to	O
return	O
in	O
nine	O
months	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
on	O
board	O
their	O

a	O
woman	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
on	O
their	O
departure	O
they	O
stood	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
seen	O
from	O

I	O
was	O
very	O
particular	O
in	O
these	O
inquiries	O
as	O
the	O
Knowledge	O
got	O
by	O
them	O
may	O
be	O
of	O
some	O

The	O
methods	O
I	O
took	O
to	O
gain	O
this	O
account	O
would	O
be	O
much	O
too	O
tedious	O
to	O
mention	O
:	O
one	O
of	O
my	O

dificulties	O
was	O
to	O
determine	O
of	O

were	O

I	O
pointed	O
to	O

whether	O
the	O

had	O
such	O
or	O
not	O

No	O

proceeded	O
to	O

In	O
about	O

at	O

were	O

at	O

In	O
all	O

nothing	O

the	O

of	O
the	O

was	O
greener	O
than	O
on	O
our	O

of	O
the	O

At	O

some	O

promisd	O
more	O
than	O
I	O

Supper	O

As	O

We	O
were	O

began	O
to	O

myself	O

that	O
there	O
was	O
not	O

We	O
laid	O

Mathiabo	O
did	O
not	O

I	O
imagin	O
'd	O
that	O

I	O
was	O

an	O

who	O
was	O

me	O
that	O

I	O
did	O
not	O

Tuahow	O
our	O
Indian	O
then	O
came	O
and	O
confirmd	O
the	O
report	O
;	O
I	O
then	O
found	O
it	O
was	O
high	O
time	O
to	O

so	O
I	O
leapd	O
up	O
and	O

They	O
took	O

I	O
seizd	O

the	O

out	O
where	O
Mathiabo	O
was	O
I	O
would	O

in	O
about	O
ten	O

met	O
a	O

our	O

by	O

a	O

When	O

from	O

we	O
quickly	O

an	O

at	O
her	O

which	O
was	O
about	O

that	O
on	O

he	O
lookd	O
out	O
again	O
and	O
could	O

nothing	O

We	O
started	O
up	O
and	O
made	O
all	O
possible	O
haste	O
to	O
the	O
waterside	O
,	O
the	O
morn	O
was	O
fine	O
and	O

no	O

Our	O
situation	O
was	O
now	O
sufficiently	O
disagreable	O
:	O
the	O
Indians	O
had	O
probably	O
attackd	O
her	O
first	O
and	O
finding	O
the	O
people	O
asleep	O
easily	O
carried	O
her	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
case	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
fail	O
to	O
attack	O
us	O
very	O
soon	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
4	O
in	O

armd	O
with	O
one	O

powder	O
for	O
them	O
.	O

In	O
about	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
however	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
satisfaction	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
boat	O
return	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
drove	O
from	O
her	O

by	O
some	O

probably	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
perfectly	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
boat	O
returnd	O
we	O
got	O
our	O
breakfast	O
and	O
set	O
out	O

The	O
first	O
district	O
on	O
which	O
we	O
landed	O
was	O
the	O
last	O
in	O
Tiarreboo	PNM
,	O
it	O
was	O
governd	O
by	O
Omóe	O

He	O
was	O
employd	O
in	O
building	O
a	O
house	O
for	O
which	O
purpose	O
he	O
wanted	O
a	O
hatchet	O
very	O
much	O
and	O
was	O
inclind	O
to	O
offer	O
any	O
price	O
for	O
it	O
but	O
our	O
stock	O
was	O
quite	O
spent	O
;	O
after	O
some	O
conversation	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
deal	O
for	O
nails	O
and	O
put	O
off	O
the	O
boat	O
.	O

He	O
and	O
his	O
wife	O
Whannoouda	O
followd	O
in	O
a	O
canoe	O
;	O
we	O
took	O
them	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
and	O
after	O
rowing	O
about	O
a	O
league	O
they	O
desird	O
we	O
would	O
put	O
ashore	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
and	O
found	O
his	O
people	O
who	O
had	O
brought	O
a	O
very	O
large	O
hog	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
much	O
chafering	O
about	O
the	O
price	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
worth	O
any	O
ax	O
we	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
but	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
ax	O
at	O
all	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
.	O

We	O
therefore	O
told	O
Omoe	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
come	O
to	O
Matavie	PNM
with	O
his	O
hog	O
he	O
should	O
have	O
a	O
large	O
ax	O
and	O
a	O
nail	O
into	O
the	O
bargain	O
for	O
his	O
trouble	O
;	O
which	O
he	O
after	O
having	O
consulted	O
his	O
wife	O
readily	O
agreed	O
to	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
us	O
a	O
large	O
peice	O
of	O
cloth	O
as	O
a	O
pledge	O
of	O
his	O
intention	O
to	O
perform	O
this	O
agreement	O
.	O

At	O
this	O
place	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
singular	O
curiosity	O
,	O
a	O
figure	O
of	O
a	O
man	O
made	O
of	O
Basket	O
work	O
,	O
roughly	O
but	O
not	O
ill	O
designd	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
7	O
feet	O
high	O
and	O
two	O
bulky	O
in	O
proportion	O
to	O
its	O
hight	O
;	O
the	O
whole	O
was	O
neatly	O
coverd	O
with	O
feathers	O
,	O
white	O
to	O
represent	O
skin	O
and	O
black	O
to	O
represent	O
hair	O
and	O
tattow	O
;	O
on	O
the	O
head	O
were	O
three	O
protuberances	O
which	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
calld	O
horns	O
but	O
the	O
Indians	O
calld	O
them	O
tata	O
ete	O
,	O
little	O
men	O
.	O

The	O
image	O
was	O
calld	O
by	O
them	O
Maúwe	O
;	O
they	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
kind	O
in	O
Otahite	PNM
and	O
readily	O
atempted	O
to	O
explain	O
its	O
use	O
,	O
but	O
their	O
language	O
was	O
totaly	O
unintelligible	O
and	O
seemed	O
to	O
referr	O
to	O
some	O
customs	O
to	O
which	O
we	O
are	O
perfect	O
strangers	O
.	O

-	O
After	O
this	O
we	O
got	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
and	O
rowd	O
several	O
miles	O
before	O
we	O
went	O
ashore	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
did	O
we	O
saw	O
nothing	O
remarkable	O
but	O
a	O
burying	O
ground	O
whose	O
pavement	O
was	O
unusualy	O
neat	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
ornamented	O
by	O
a	O
pyramid	O
about	O
5	O
feet	O
high	O
coverd	O
intirely	O
with	O
the	O

of	O
Pandanus	PNM

In	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
all	O
near	O
the	O
Pyramid	O
was	O
a	O
small	O
image	O
of	O
stone	O
very	O
roughly	O
workd	O
,	O
the	O
first	O
instance	O
of	O
carving	O
in	O
stone	O
I	O
have	O
seen	O
among	O
these	O
people	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
they	O
seemd	O
to	O
value	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
coverd	O
from	O
the	O
weather	O
with	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
shed	O
built	O
purposely	O
over	O
it	O
;	O
near	O
it	O
were	O
three	O
sculls	O
of	O
men	O
laid	O
in	O
order	O
,	O
very	O
white	O
and	O
clean	O
and	O
quite	O
perfect	O
.	O

From	O
hence	O
we	O
proceeded	O
to	O
Pap	O
'	O
rra	O
,	O
the	O
district	O
of	O
our	O
freinds	O
Oama	PNM
and	O
Oborea	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
proposd	O
to	O
sleep	O
tonight	O
;	O
we	O
came	O
there	O
an	O
hour	O
before	O
night	O
and	O
found	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
both	O
from	O
home	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
gone	O
to	O
Matavie	PNM
to	O
see	O
us	O
.	O

This	O
did	O
not	O
alter	O
our	O
resolution	O
of	O
sleeping	O
here	O
and	O
we	O
chose	O
for	O
that	O
purpose	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
Oborea	PNM
,	O
which	O
tho	O
small	O
was	O
very	O
neat	O
and	O
had	O
nobody	O
in	O
it	O
but	O
her	O
father	O
who	O
was	O
very	O
civil	O
to	O
us	O
.	O

After	O
having	O
setled	O
our	O
matters	O
we	O
took	O
a	O
walk	O
towards	O
a	O

on	O

we	O
had	O

observd	O

We	O

This	O

hoisted	O
out	O

sent	O
ashore	O
on	O
the	O
Island	PNM
of	PNM
Otahah	PNM
in	O
which	O
Dr	O

took	O

We	O
went	O
through	O
a	O
large	O
breach	O
in	O
the	O
reef	O
situate	O
between	O
two	O
Islands	O
calld	O
Toahattu	O
and	O
Whennuaia	O
within	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
very	O
spatious	O
harbours	O
,	O
particularly	O
in	O
one	O
bay	O
which	O
was	O
at	O

3	O
miles	O

The	O
inhabitants	O
as	O
usual	O
so	O
that	O
long	O
before	O
night	O
we	O
had	O
purchasd	O
3	O
hoggs	O

21	O
fowls	O
and	O
as	O
many	O

Indeed	O
of	O
these	O
last	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
had	O
any	O
quantity	O
and	O
a	O
more	O

refreshment	O
they	O
are	O
to	O
us	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
even	O

the	O
pork	O
;	O
they	O
have	O
been	O
for	O
this	O

boild	O

every	O

of	O
them	O

with	O
us	O
in	O
the	O

they	O
agree	O
much	O
better	O
than	O
the	O
Bread	O

which	O
sometimes	O

But	O
what	O
makes	O
any	O
refreshments	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
the	O
more	O
acceptable	O
is	O
that	O
our	O

is	O
at	O

One	O

the	O

The	O

notwisthstanding	O
it	O
was	O

We	O

ashore	O
where	O

out	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
shrill	O
voice	O
,	O
which	O
we	O

was	O
a	O

We	O
rowd	O
along	O

we	O

it	O

impracticable	O
to	O

and	O
as	O
for	O
the	O

we	O

we	O
therefore	O
resolvd	O
to	O

if	O
it	O
would	O

the	O

did	O

hoping	O
that	O
if	O

would	O
at	O

As	O
we	O
rowd	O
gently	O
along	O

our	O

was	O

by	O

These	O

were	O

The	O
three	O
then	O
went	O
peaceably	O
along	O
shore	O
till	O
the	O
boat	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
shoal	O
upon	O
which	O
a	O

were	O

;	O
they	O
talkd	O
together	O
and	O
soon	O

began	O
to	O

very	O
loud	O
to	O
which	O
Tupia	O
made	O
his	O

continued	O
to	O
tell	O
us	O
that	O

We	O
after	O
this	O
enterd	O
into	O
a	O
parley	O
with	O

telling	O
them	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
lay	O
by	O
their	O
arms	O
which	O
were	O

for	O
whatever	O
they	O
would	O

;	O
they	O
agreed	O

upon	O

that	O
we	O
should	O
lay	O
down	O
our	O

an	O

we	O

our	O

dropt	O
for	O
the	O

at	O

After	O
a	O
little	O
time	O
however	O
they	O
took	O
courage	O
and	O
came	O
nearer	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O

near	O
enough	O
to	O
begin	O
to	O
trade	O
which	O
they	O
did	O
very	O

for	O
a	O

quantity	O
of	O

some	O
of	O
their	O

unless	O
we	O
would	O

After	O

the	O

desird	O

at	O
the	O

They	O

they	O

they	O

into	O

the	O

We	O
observd	O
from	O

go	O
over	O

they	O
sat	O

They	O
rose	O

About	O

What	O
their	O

for	O
so	O

is	O
we	O
can	O
only	O
guess	O

possibly	O
they	O
may	O
think	O
that	O
their	O

In	O

can	O

Here	O
we	O

a	O

not	O
more	O

The	O

all	O

in	O
a	O

of	O

seems	O
confind	O
to	O
the	O
making	O
of	O

in	O

The	O

The	O

The	O

provd	O

He	O

struck	O

him	O
a	O

that	O

from	O

appeard	O
the	O

that	O

in	O

in	O

of	O
a	O

By	O

Under	O

were	O
four	O

in	O

of	O
these	O
was	O
one	O

who	O
held	O
in	O
his	O

a	O
long	O
pole	O
with	O
which	O
he	O

fish	O
,	O
venturing	O
with	O
his	O

almost	O
into	O

These	O

yet	O
they	O

I	O
was	O

neither	O

At	O
1	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
abreast	O
of	O
a	O
small	O
village	O
consisting	O
of	O
about	O
6	O

Soon	O

an	O

out	O

to	O

at	O
the	O

where	O
we	O

hoping	O

with	O
a	O

about	O
10	O

a	O

which	O

They	O
calld	O

They	O

A	O

so	O
another	O
was	O

at	O
him	O

on	O

up	O

In	O
the	O

we	O
had	O

on	O

He	O
immediately	O
threw	O
a	O

at	O
us	O
and	O
the	O

another	O
which	O
fell	O
among	O

2	O

ran	O
away	O

We	O
went	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
houses	O

in	O
one	O
of	O

we	O
found	O
the	O

a	O
peice	O
of	O

in	O
one	O

We	O
were	O

from	O

the	O

when	O
we	O
fird	O
that	O

We	O
however	O
thought	O
it	O
no	O
improper	O
measure	O
to	O
take	O
away	O
with	O
us	O
all	O
the	O

at	O

The	O

were	O

On	O

I	O
found	O
some	O

the	O

;	O
on	O

the	O

here	O
in	O
their	O

sure	O

that	O
some	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
must	O
have	O
very	O
setled	O
fine	O

;	O
we	O
saw	O
7	O

8	O

and	O
vast	O
piles	O
of	O

The	O
officer	O
who	O
went	O
in	O
the	O
Boat	O
returnd	O
with	O
an	O
account	O
that	O
the	O
sea	O
broke	O
vastly	O
high	O
upon	O
the	O

and	O
the	O

was	O
so	O

that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O

This	O
was	O
sufficient	O
to	O
assure	O
us	O
of	O
a	O
safe	O
passage	O
out	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
got	O
into	O
the	O

to	O
return	O
to	O
the	O

in	O

at	O

open	O
for	O

In	O
our	O
return	O
we	O
went	O
ashore	O
upon	O
a	O

Island	O
where	O
we	O
shot	O
many	O
birds	O
;	O
on	O

could	O

200	O

on	O
account	O
of	O
the	O

we	O

out	O

The	O
nature	O

it	O

for	O

to	O
be	O
very	O
much	O
upon	O
our	O
guard	O
:	O
the	O
close	O

came	O
down	O

within	O
less	O

100	O
yards	O
of	O

and	O
therefore	O
so	O
near	O
might	O
the	O

come	O
without	O
our	O

them	O

and	O
should	O
they	O
by	O
numbers	O
overpower	O
us	O
a	O
retreat	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
was	O
impossible	O
as	O
she	O
was	O
so	O
far	O
from	O
the	O

We	O
proceeded	O

with	O
much	O
caution	O

looking	O
carefully	O
about	O
us	O

myself	O

the	O

In	O
about	O
200	O
yards	O
from	O
our	O
landing	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
grove	O
of	O
Cocoa	PNM
nut	O
trees	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
small	O
growth	O
but	O
well	O
hung	O
with	O

standing	O
upon	O
the	O
banks	O
of	O
a	O
small	O
brook	O
of	O
brackish	O
water	O

Near	O
them	O
was	O
a	O

hardly	O
half	O
coverd	O
with	O

in	O

about	O
which	O
were	O
infinite	O

some	O
quite	O
fresh	O

We	O
stayd	O
under	O
these	O
trees	O
some	O
time	O
admiring	O
and	O
wishing	O
for	O
the	O
fruit	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
none	O
of	O
us	O
could	O
climb	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O
get	O
even	O
one	O
so	O
we	O
even	O
left	O
them	O
and	O
proceeded	O
in	O
search	O
of	O
any	O
thing	O
else	O
which	O
might	O
occur	O
.	O

We	O
soon	O
found	O
Plantains	O
and	O
a	O
single	O
Bread	O
fruit	O
tree	O
but	O
neither	O
of	O
these	O
had	O
any	O
fruit	O
on	O
them	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
proceeded	O
and	O
had	O
got	O
about	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
boat	O
when	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
3	O
Indians	O
rushd	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
woods	O
with	O
a	O
hideous	O
shout	O
,	O
about	O
100	O
yards	O
beyond	O
us	O
and	O
running	O
towards	O
us	O
.	O

The	O
formost	O
threw	O
something	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
hand	O
which	O
flew	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
of	O
him	O
and	O
burnd	O
exactly	O
like	O
gunpowder	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
immediately	O
threw	O
two	O
darts	O
at	O
us	O
on	O
which	O
we	O
fird	O
.	O

The	O
most	O
of	O
our	O
guns	O
were	O
loaded	O
with	O
small	O
shot	O
which	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
they	O
were	O
from	O
us	O
I	O
suppose	O
they	O
hardly	O
felt	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
movd	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
but	O
immediately	O
threw	O
a	O
third	O
dart	O
on	O
which	O
we	O
loaded	O
and	O
fird	O
again	O

Our	O
Balls	O
I	O
suppose	O
this	O
time	O
fell	O
near	O
them	O
but	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
materialy	O
hurt	O
as	O
they	O
ran	O
away	O
with	O
great	O
alacrity	O
.	O

From	O
this	O
specimen	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
we	O
immediately	O
concluded	O
that	O
nothing	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
got	O
here	O
but	O
by	O
force	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
of	O
course	O
be	O
attended	O
with	O
destruction	O
of	O
many	O
of	O
these	O
poor	O
people	O
,	O
whose	O
territories	O
we	O
had	O
certainly	O
no	O
right	O
to	O
invade	O
either	O
as	O
discoverers	O
or	O
people	O
in	O
real	O
want	O
of	O
provisions	O
;	O
we	O
therefore	O
resolvd	O
to	O
go	O
into	O
our	O
boat	O
and	O
leave	O
intirely	O
this	O
coast	O
to	O
some	O
aftercomer	O
who	O
might	O
have	O
either	O
more	O

or	O

to	O

the	O

of	O
its	O

Before	O
we	O
had	O
got	O
abreast	O
of	O
her	O
however	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
two	O
people	O
in	O
her	O
make	O
signals	O
to	O
us	O
that	O
more	O
Indians	O
were	O
coming	O
along	O
shore	O

and	O
before	O
we	O
had	O
got	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
we	O
saw	O
them	O
come	O
round	O
a	O
point	O
about	O
500	O
yards	O
from	O
us	O

They	O
had	O
met	O
probably	O
the	O
three	O
who	O
first	O
attackd	O
us	O
for	O

they	O
continued	O
however	O
with	O
their	O
fire	O
to	O

us	O
and	O
shouted	O
very	O
loud	O

When	O
we	O
were	O
embarked	O

afloat	O
we	O
rowd	O
towards	O
them	O
and	O
fird	O
some	O

askd	O
him	O

the	O

totaly	O
ignorant	O

The	O
Radja	O
however	O
now	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
Mr	O

at	O
such	O

,	O
a	O
hint	O
to	O

gone	O
but	O
which	O
was	O
not	O
taken	O

,	O
for	O
the	O
Dr	O
wanted	O
nothing	O
so	O

Mr	O

and	O
consequently	O
went	O
directly	O

Mr	O
Lange	O
returnd	O
to	O
the	O
Radjas	O
with	O
him	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
the	O

almost	O
in	O
rebellion	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
Radjas	O
permitting	O
us	O
to	O
trade	O
with	O
goods	O
instead	O
of	O

,	O
and	O
that	O
this	O

was	O
positively	O
the	O
last	O
on	O
which	O
we	O
could	O
be	O
allowd	O

that	O
he	O

at	O
the	O

who	O
had	O

These	O

were	O
too	O

therefore	O
he	O
still	O
stayd	O
