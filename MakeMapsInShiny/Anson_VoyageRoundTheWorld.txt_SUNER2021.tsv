;	O
when	O
I	O
consider	O
how	O

it	O
will	O
facilitate	O
their	O

assist	O

their	O

wonder	O
that	O
any	O

with	O
a	O

of	O

And	O
to	O
enforce	O
this	O
argument	O
still	O
further	O
,	O
I	O
must	O
add	O
that	O
besides	O
the	O

there	O
is	O
one	O
which	O
,	O
tho	O

not	O

is	O
yet	O
perhaps	O
of	O
more	O
consequence	O
than	O

that	O
has	O
been	O

;	O

the	O
strength	O

power	O
it	O
adds	O
to	O
some	O
of	O
our	O

This	O
appears	O
from	O

,	O
that	O
those	O
who	O
are	O
used	O
to	O
draw	O

more	O

Mr.	O

the	O

It	O
may	O
be	O
conceived	O
that	O
Mr.	O

was	O
extremely	O
chagrined	O
at	O
the	O

in	O
this	O

which	O
he	O

prove	O
a	O
very	O
long	O
one	O

However	O
,	O
Sir	O

,	O
to	O
render	O
his	O
disappointment	O
in	O
some	O

more	O

,	O
informed	O
him	O
that	O
the	O
expedition	O
to	O

And	O
on	O
the	O
10th	O
of	O

he	O
received	O
his	O

On	O

the	O

-RCB-	O
on	O
his	O
arrival	O
at	O

he	O
found	O
himself	O

Sir	O

This	O
occasioned	O
an	O
inevitable	O
and	O
a	O
very	O
considerable	O
delay	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
end	O
of	O

before	O
this	O

was	O
by	O
any	O

all	O
that	O
was	O
then	O

was	O
extremely	O

of	O

For	O
Admiral	O
Balchen	O
,	O
who	O
succeeded	O
to	O
the	O
command	O
at	O
Spithead	PNM
,	O
after	O
Sir	O

had	O
sailed	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
three	O

which	O
Mr.	O

wanted	O
of	O

ordered	O
on	O

the	O

a	O
hundred	O

seventy	O

ninety-eight	O

and	O
these	O
were	O
all	O
that	O
were	O
ever	O
granted	O
to	O
make	O
up	O
the	O

But	O
the	O
commodore	O
's	O
mortification	O
did	O
not	O
end	O
here	O

It	O
has	O
been	O
already	O
observed	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
at	O

that	O
Colonel	O

regiment	O
,	O
and	O
three	O
independent	O

of	O
a	O

each	O
,	O
should	O
embark	O
as	O
land-forces	O
on	O

the	O
squadron	O

But	O
this	O
disposition	O
was	O
now	O
changed	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
land-forces	O
that	O
were	O
to	O

allowed	O
were	O
five	O

invalids	O
to	O
be	O
collected	O
from	O
the	O
out-pensioners	O
of	O
Chelsea	PNM

As	O
these	O

from	O

are	O
incapable	O
of	O

in	O

,	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
was	O
greatly	O
chagrined	O
at	O
having	O
such	O
a	O
decrepid	O
detachment	O
allotted	O
him	O
;	O
for	O
he	O
was	O
fully	O
persuaded	O
that	O
the	O
greatest	O
part	O
of	O
them	O
would	O
perish	O
long	O
before	O
they	O
arrived	O
at	O
the	O
scene	O
of	O
action	O
,	O
since	O
the	O
delays	O
he	O
had	O
already	O
encountered	O
necessarily	O
confined	O
his	O

round	O

to	O
the	O
most	O
rigorous	O
season	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
.	O

Sir	O
Charles	O
Wager	O
too	O
joined	O
in	O
opinion	O
with	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
that	O
invalids	O
were	O
no	O
ways	O
proper	O
for	O
this	O
service	O
,	O
and	O
sollicited	O
strenuously	O
to	O
have	O
them	O
exchanged	O
:	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
told	O
that	O
persons	O
who	O
were	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
better	O
judges	O
of	O
soldiers	O
than	O
he	O
or	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
,	O
thought	O
them	O
the	O
properest	O
men	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
employed	O
on	O
this	O
occasion	O
.	O

And	O
upon	O
this	O
determination	O
they	O
were	O
ordered	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
squadron	O
on	O
the	O
5th	O
of	O
August	O
;	O
but	O
instead	O
of	O
five	O
hundred	O
,	O
there	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
two	O
hundred	O
and	O
fifty-nine	O
;	O
for	O
all	O
those	O
who	O
had	O
limbs	O
and	O
strength	O
to	O
walk	O
out	O
of	O
Portsmouth	PNM
deserted	O
,	O
leaving	O
behind	O
-LCB-	O
16	O
-RCB-	O
them	O
only	O
such	O
as	O
were	O
literally	O
invalids	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
being	O
sixty	O
years	O
of	O
age	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
upwards	O
of	O
seventy	O
.	O

Indeed	O
it	O
is	O
difficult	O
to	O
conceive	O
a	O
more	O
moving	O
scene	O
than	O
the	O
embarkation	O
of	O
these	O
unhappy	O
veterans	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
themselves	O
extremely	O
averse	O
to	O
the	O

they	O
were	O
engaged	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
fully	O
apprised	O
of	O
all	O
the	O

they	O
were	O
afterwards	O
exposed	O
to	O
;	O
the	O
apprehensions	O
of	O
which	O
were	O
strongly	O
marked	O
by	O
the	O
concern	O
that	O
appeared	O
in	O
their	O
countenances	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
mixed	O
with	O
no	O
small	O
degree	O
of	O
indignation	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
thus	O
hurried	O
from	O
their	O
repose	O
into	O
a	O
fatiguing	O
employ	O
,	O
to	O
which	O
neither	O
the	O

in	O

I	O
can	O
not	O
but	O
observe	O
,	O
on	O
this	O
melancholy	O
incident	O
,	O
how	O
extremely	O
unfortunate	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
both	O
to	O
this	O

and	O
to	O
the	O

in	O

that	O
amongst	O
all	O
the	O
out-pensioners	O
of	O

which	O
were	O

to	O
amount	O
to	O
two	O

men	O

the	O
most	O

should	O
be	O
culled	O
out	O
for	O
so	O
laborious	O
and	O
perilous	O
an	O

For	O
it	O
was	O
well	O
known	O
that	O
however	O
unfit	O
invalids	O
in	O
general	O
might	O
be	O
for	O
this	O
service	O
,	O
yet	O
by	O
a	O
prudent	O
choice	O
there	O
might	O
have	O
been	O

amongst	O
them	O
five	O

who	O
had	O
some	O
remains	O
of	O

left	O
:	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
fully	O
expected	O
that	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
them	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
allotted	O
him	O
;	O
whereas	O
the	O
whole	O
detachment	O
that	O
was	O
sent	O
to	O
him	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
up	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
decrepid	O
and	O
miserable	O
objects	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
collected	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O

by	O
the	O

these	O
were	O
a	O

cleared	O
of	O
that	O
little	O
health	O
and	O
strength	O
which	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
amongst	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
was	O
to	O
take	O
up	O
with	O
such	O
as	O
were	O
much	O
fitter	O
for	O
an	O
infirmary	O
than	O
for	O
any	O
military	O
duty	O

And	O
here	O
it	O
is	O
necessary	O
to	O
mention	O
another	O
material	O
particular	O
in	O
the	O
equipment	O
of	O
this	O

It	O
was	O
proposed	O
to	O
Mr.	O

,	O
after	O
it	O
was	O
resolved	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
be	O

to	O
the	O

to	O
take	O
with	O

under	O
the	O

Those	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
supposed	O
that	O
by	O
their	O
knowledge	O
and	O
intelligence	O
on	O
that	O
coast	O
they	O
might	O
often	O
procure	O
provisions	O

the	O
value	O
of	O
L15	O
,000	O
in	O

for	O
they	O

that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
much	O
easier	O
for	O

to	O

Whatever	O

were	O

to	O
this	O

it	O
was	O
difficult	O
to	O
persuade	O
the	O

that	O
it	O
was	O

Mr.	O

from	O
the	O

objected	O

them	O
to	O

on	O

for	O

that	O
in	O
those	O

where	O
the	O

on	O

that	O

All	O
that	O

thought	O

the	O

with	O
;	O
since	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
such	O

in	O
these	O
places	O
it	O
was	O
sufficiently	O
evident	O
a	O

the	O

when	O

he	O
considered	O

ten	O

;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O

that	O

But	O
this	O

not	O

the	O

soon	O

its	O

us	O
to	O

on	O

we	O
were	O

from	O
the	O

of	O
so	O
large	O
a	O

as	O

It	O
is	O

our	O

were	O
even	O
now	O
somewhat	O
damped	O
by	O
a	O

order	O
which	O
Mr.	O

received	O
on	O
the	O
12th	O
of	O
September	O
;	O
for	O
by	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
required	O
to	O
take	O
under	O
his	O
convoy	O
the	O
_	O
St.	PNM

them	O
to	O
sea	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
their	O
way	O
and	O
ours	O
lay	O
together	O

This	O
incumbrance	O
of	O
a	O
convoy	O
gave	O
us	O
some	O
uneasiness	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
feared	O
it	O
might	O
prove	O
the	O
means	O
of	O
lengthening	O
our	O

However	O
,	O
Mr.	O

now	O
having	O
the	O
command	O
himself	O

resolved	O
to	O

determination	O

and	O
to	O
tide	O
it	O
down	O
the	O
Channel	O
with	O
the	O
first	O
moderate	O
weather	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
junction	O
of	O
his	O
convoy	O
might	O
occasion	O
as	O
little	O
loss	O
of	O
time	O
as	O
possible	O
,	O
he	O
immediately	O
sent	O
directions	O

the	O

there	O

And	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
18th	O
of	O
September	O
,	O
he	O
weighed	O
from	O
St.	PNM

;	O
and	O
though	O
the	O
wind	O
was	O
at	O
first	O

had	O
the	O
good	O
fortune	O
to	O
get	O
clear	O

in	O
four	O
days	O

Having	O
thus	O

the	O

steps	O
taken	O
in	O
the	O

of	O
this	O
squadron	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
sufficiently	O
obvious	O
how	O
different	O
an	O
aspect	O
this	O
expedition	O
bore	O
at	O
its	O
first	O
appointment	O
in	O
the	O
beginning	O

its	O

For	O
instead	O

which	O
the	O

and	O
having	O
our	O
numbers	O
compleated	O
to	O
their	O

we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
retain	O
our	O

which	O
were	O
very	O
indifferent	O
;	O
and	O
a	O
deficiency	O

And	O
in	O
the	O

the	O
change	O
was	O
still	O
more	O
disadvantageous	O
;	O
for	O
there	O

instead	O
of	O
three	O

But	O
the	O

a	O
delay	O

the	O
next	O

Being	O

the	O
25th	O
,	O
when	O
the	O

After	O
which	O

we	O
kept	O
on	O

for	O
the	O

But	O
the	O
winds	O
were	O
so	O
contrary	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
mortification	O
to	O
be	O
forty	O

in	O
our	O
passage	O

to	O

This	O
delay	O
was	O
a	O
most	O
unpleasing	O
circumstance	O
,	O
productive	O
of	O
much	O
discontent	O
and	O
ill-humour	O
amongst	O

which	O
those	O

For	O
besides	O
the	O
peevishness	O

despondency	O
which	O
foul	O

contrary	O
winds	O
and	O
a	O
lingering	O
voyage	O
never	O
fail	O
to	O
create	O
on	O
all	O

very	O

Since	O

much	O
later	O
than	O

before	O
I	O
go	O
on	O
with	O
the	O
narration	O
of	O
our	O
own	O
transactions	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
necessary	O
to	O
give	O
some	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
proceedings	O
of	O
the	O
enemy	O

and	O
of	O
the	O
measures	O
they	O
had	O
taken	O
to	O
render	O
all	O
our	O
designs	O
abortive	O

When	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
visited	O
the	O
governor	O
of	O
Madera	PNM
,	O
he	O
received	O
information	O
from	O
him	O
that	O
for	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
days	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
latter	O
end	O
of	O
October	O
,	O
there	O
had	O
appeared	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
of	O
that	O
island	O
,	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
ships	O
of	O
the	O
line	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
patache	O
,	O
which	O
last	O
was	O
sent	O
every	O
day	O
close	O
in	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
land	O
.	O

The	O
governor	O
assured	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
upon	O
his	O
honour	O
,	O
that	O
none	O
upon	O
the	O
island	O
had	O
either	O
given	O
them	O
intelligence	O
,	O
or	O
had	O
in	O
any	O
sort	O
communicated	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
he	O
believed	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
either	O
French	O
or	O
Spanish	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
rather	O
inclined	O
to	O
think	O
them	O
Spanish	O
.	O

On	O
this	O
intelligence	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
sent	O
an	O
officer	O
in	O
a	O
clean	O
sloop	O
,	O
eight	O
leagues	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
,	O
to	O
reconnoitre	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
to	O
discover	O
what	O
they	O
were	O
:	O
but	O
the	O
officer	O
returned	O
without	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
sight	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
still	O
remained	O
in	O
uncertainty	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
but	O
conjecture	O
that	O
this	O
fleet	O
was	O
intended	O
to	O
put	O
a	O
stop	O
to	O
our	O
expedition	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
had	O
they	O
cruised	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
instead	O
of	O
the	O
westward	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
but	O
have	O
executed	O
with	O
great	O
facility	O
.	O

For	O
as	O
,	O
in	O
that	O
case	O
,	O
they	O
must	O
have	O
certainly	O
-LCB-	O
26	O
-RCB-	O
fallen	O
in	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
obliged	O
to	O
throw	O
overboard	O
vast	O
quantities	O
of	O
provision	O
to	O
clear	O
our	O
ships	O
for	O
an	O
engagement	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
alone	O
,	O
without	O
any	O
regard	O
to	O
the	O
event	O
of	O
the	O
action	O
,	O
would	O
have	O
effectually	O
prevented	O
our	O
progress	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
so	O
obvious	O
a	O
measure	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
help	O
imagining	O
reasons	O
which	O
might	O
have	O
prevented	O
them	O
from	O
pursuing	O
it	O
.	O

And	O
we	O
therefore	O
supposed	O
that	O
this	O
French	O
or	O
Spanish	O
squadron	O
was	O
sent	O
out	O
,	O
upon	O
advice	O
of	O
our	O
sailing	O
in	O
company	O
with	O
Admiral	O
Balchen	O
and	O
Lord	O
Cathcart	O
's	O
expedition	O
:	O
and	O
thence	O
,	O
from	O
an	O
apprehension	O
of	O
being	O
overmatched	O
,	O
they	O
might	O
not	O
think	O
it	O
adviseable	O
to	O
meet	O
with	O
us	O
till	O
we	O
had	O
parted	O
company	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
might	O
judge	O
would	O
not	O
happen	O
before	O
our	O
arrival	O
at	O
this	O
island	O
.	O

These	O
were	O
our	O
speculations	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
from	O
hence	O
we	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
suppose	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
still	O
fall	O
in	O
with	O
them	O
in	O
our	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
de	PNM
Verd	PNM
Islands	PNM
.	O

We	O
afterwards	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
our	O
expedition	O
,	O
were	O
persuaded	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
Spanish	O
squadron	O
,	O
commanded	O
by	O
Don	O
Joseph	O
Pizarro	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
sent	O
out	O
purposely	O
to	O
traverse	O
the	O
views	O
and	O
enterprizes	O
of	O
our	O
squadron	O
,	O
to	O
which	O
in	O
strength	O
they	O
were	O
greatly	O
superior	O
.	O

As	O
this	O
Spanish	O
armament	O
then	O
was	O
so	O
nearly	O
connected	O
with	O
our	O
expedition	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
the	O
catastrophe	O
it	O
underwent	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
effected	O
by	O
our	O
force	O
,	O
was	O
yet	O
a	O
considerable	O
advantage	O
to	O
this	O
nation	O

produced	O
in	O

of	O
our	O

The	O

As	O
this	O

was	O
sent	O
out	O

against	O

I	O
can	O
not	O

imagine	O
that	O
the	O

the	O

it	O
met	O
with	O

as	O

a	O
very	O
essential	O

of	O
the	O

work	O

For	O
hence	O
it	O
will	O
appear	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
the	O
occasion	O
that	O
a	O
considerable	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
naval	O
power	O
of	O

of	O
that	O

in	O
Europe	PNM

And	O
whatever	O
men	O

were	O

by	O
the	O

no	O

the	O

For	O
one	O
of	O

This	O

made	O
him	O
eager	O

On	O
this	O

This	O

Many	O
of	O

in	O
the	O

pushed	O
into	O
the	O

where	O
they	O
put	O
out	O

who	O
had	O
avoided	O
the	O

fury	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
some	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
escape	O
along	O
the	O

into	O
the	O
forecastle	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
placed	O
on	O
purpose	O
,	O
stabbed	O
the	O
greatest	O
part	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
attempted	O
to	O
pass	O

forced	O

off	O

some	O
threw	O
themselves	O
voluntarily	O
over	O
the	O

into	O
the	O
waste	O
,	O
and	O
thought	O
themselves	O
fortunate	O
to	O
lie	O
concealed	O
amongst	O
the	O

But	O
the	O
greatest	O

escaped	O
up	O
the	O

and	O
sheltered	O
themselves	O
either	O
in	O

And	O
though	O
the	O
Indians	O
attacked	O
only	O

yet	O
the	O

who	O

not	O

on	O

when	O

himself	O

on	O
a	O

as	O
to	O
a	O
place	O
of	O
the	O

Here	O
he	O
took	O
it	O
for	O

he	O

find	O

in	O

But	O
on	O
opening	O
the	O

there	O
appeared	O
nothing	O

which	O

There	O

by	O
this	O

On	O

Pizarro	O

before	O
any	O

the	O

With	O
this	O
view	O
Pizarro	O
got	O
together	O
what	O
arms	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
cabbin	O

and	O
distributed	O
them	O
to	O

there	O

neither	O

However	O
,	O
having	O
now	O
settled	O
a	O
correspondence	O
with	O
the	O

they	O
lowered	O
down	O
a	O

out	O

the	O

out	O

put	O
a	O

When	O
they	O
had	O
thus	O
procured	O
ammunition	O

had	O
loaded	O
their	O

they	O
set	O
the	O

and	O
fired	O
several	O

though	O
at	O

But	O
at	O
last	O
Mindinuetta	O
,	O
whom	O
we	O
have	O
often	O

had	O
the	O

we	O

and	O
about	O

a	O

at	O

not	O

that	O
the	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
but	O
one	O
we	O
again	O
discovered	O
a	O
sail	O

which	O
on	O
a	O
nearer	O
approach	O
we	O
judged	O
to	O
be	O
the	O

We	O
chased	O
her	O
the	O
whole	O

and	O
though	O
we	O
rather	O
gained	O
upon	O
her	O

yet	O

came	O
on	O
before	O
we	O

We	O
were	O
much	O
chagrined	O
at	O
the	O
escape	O
of	O
this	O
vessel	O

as	O
we	O

apprehended	O
her	O

we	O
have	O

The	O
next	O

but	O
one	O
we	O
spoke	O
with	O
a	O
Portuguese	O
brigantine	O
from	O
Rio	O

,	O
bound	O
to	O

who	O
informed	O

that	O

thirty-four	O

bore	O
from	O
us	O
W.S.W.	O
By	O
our	O
accounts	O
we	O
were	O
near	O
eighty	O

from	O
Cape	PNM
Frio	PNM
;	O
and	O
though	O
on	O
the	O
information	O
of	O
this	O
brigantine	O
we	O
altered	O
our	O
course	O
and	O
stood	O
more	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
,	O
yet	O
by	O
our	O
coming	O
in	O
with	O
the	O
land	O
afterwards	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
fully	O
convinced	O
that	O
our	O
reckoning	O
was	O
much	O
correcter	O
than	O
our	O
Portuguese	O
intelligence	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
a	O
considerable	O
current	O
setting	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
passed	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
16	O
deg	O
.	O

S.	O
And	O
the	O
same	O
took	O
place	O
all	O
along	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Brazil	PNM
,	O
and	O
even	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
of	O
Plate	PNM
,	O
it	O
amounting	O
sometimes	O
to	O
thirty	O
miles	O
in	O
twenty-four	O
hours	O
,	O
and	O
once	O
to	O
above	O
forty	O
miles	O
.	O

If	O
this	O
current	O
is	O
occasioned	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
most	O
probable	O
-RRB-	O
by	O
the	O
running	O
off	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
accumulated	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Brazil	PNM
by	O
the	O
constant	O
sweeping	O
of	O
the	O
eastern	O
trade-wind	O
over	O
the	O
Ethiopic	PNM
Ocean	PNM
,	O
then	O
it	O
is	O
most	O
natural	O
to	O
suppose	O
that	O
its	O
general	O
course	O
is	O
determined	O
by	O
the	O
bearings	O
of	O
the	O
adjacent	O
shore	O

Perhaps	O
too	O
,	O
in	O
almost	O
every	O
other	O
instance	O
of	O
currents	O
,	O
the	O
same	O
may	O
hold	O
true	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
believe	O
no	O
examples	O
occur	O
of	O
considerable	O
currents	O
being	O
observed	O
at	O
any	O
great	O
distance	O
from	O
land	O

If	O
this	O
then	O
could	O
be	O
laid	O
down	O
for	O
a	O
general	O
principle	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
always	O
easy	O
to	O
correct	O
the	O
reckoning	O
by	O
the	O
observed	O
latitude	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
were	O
much	O
to	O
be	O
wished	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
general	O
interests	O
of	O
navigation	O

that	O
the	O
actual	O

of	O

which	O
are	O
known	O
to	O
take	O
place	O
in	O

parts	O

more	O
frequently	O

accurately	O
than	O
hitherto	O
appears	O
to	O

been	O

We	O
now	O
began	O
to	O
grow	O

for	O
a	O

both	O
for	O
the	O

it	O
was	O
about	O
seventeen	O

At	O

about	O
ten	O

the	O

We	O
could	O
from	O

observe	O
two	O
fortifications	O
at	O
a	O
considerable	O

we	O
could	O

perceive	O
that	O

The	O

returned	O

On	O
the	O

we	O
weighed	O

In	O

A	O
DESCRIPTION	O
OF	O
THE	O
PLACE	O
,	O
WITH	O
A	O
SHORT	O
ACCOUNT	O
OF	O
BRAZIL	O
Our	O
first	O
care	O
,	O
after	O
having	O
moored	O
our	O
ships	O
,	O
was	O
to	O
get	O
our	O
sick	O
men	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
preparatory	O
to	O
which	O
,	O
each	O
ship	O
was	O
ordered	O
by	O
the	O
commodore	O
to	O
erect	O
two	O
tents	O
:	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
for	O
the	O
reception	O
of	O
the	O
diseased	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
for	O
the	O
accommodation	O
of	O
the	O
surgeon	O
and	O
his	O
assistants	O
.	O

We	O
sent	O
about	O
eighty	O
sick	O
from	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
ships	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
,	O
sent	O
nearly	O
as	O
many	O
,	O
in	O
proportion	O
to	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
their	O
hands	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
performed	O
this	O
necessary	O
duty	O
,	O
we	O
scraped	O
our	O
decks	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
our	O
ship	O
a	O
thorough	O
cleansing	O
:	O
then	O
smoked	O
it	O
between	O
decks	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
all	O
washed	O
every	O
part	O
well	O
with	O
vinegar	O
.	O

These	O
operations	O
were	O
extremely	O
necessary	O
for	O
correcting	O
the	O
noisome	O
stench	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
destroying	O
the	O
vermin	O
;	O
for	O
from	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
heat	O
of	O
the	O
climate	O
,	O
both	O
these	O
nusances	O
had	O
increased	O
upon	O
us	O
to	O
a	O
very	O
loathsome	O
degree	O
;	O
and	O
besides	O
being	O
most	O
intolerably	O
offensive	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
doubtless	O
in	O
some	O
sort	O
productive	O
of	O
the	O
sickness	O
we	O
had	O
laboured	O
under	O
for	O
a	O
considerable	O
time	O
before	O
our	O
arrival	O
at	O
this	O
island	O
.	O

Our	O
next	O
employment	O
was	O
wooding	O
and	O
watering	O
our	O
squadron	O
,	O
caulking	O
our	O
ships	O
'	O
sides	O
and	O
decks	O
,	O
overhauling	O
our	O
rigging	O
,	O
and	O
securing	O
our	O
masts	O
against	O
the	O
tempestuous	O
weather	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
in	O
all	O
probability	O
,	O
to	O
meet	O
with	O
in	O
our	O
passage	O
round	O
Cape	PNM

in	O
so	O
advanced	O

before	O
I	O
engage	O
in	O
the	O
particulars	O
of	O
these	O
transactions	O
,	O
it	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
improper	O

be	O

Frezier	O
has	O
given	O
a	O
draught	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
St.	PNM

,	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
neighbouring	O
coast	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
minuter	O
isles	O
adjacent	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
has	O
,	O
by	O
mistake	O
,	O
called	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Alvoredo	PNM
the	O
Isle	PNM
de	PNM
Gal	O
,	O
whereas	O
the	O
true	O
Isle	O
de	O
Gal	O
lies	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
miles	O
to	O
the	O
north-westward	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
is	O
much	O
smaller	O
.	O

He	O
has	O
also	O
called	O
an	O
island	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
of	O
St.	PNM
Catherine	PNM
's	PNM
Alvoredo	PNM
,	O
and	O
has	O
omitted	O
the	O
island	O
Masaqura	PNM
;	O
in	O
other	O
respects	O
his	O
plan	O
is	O
sufficiently	O
exact	O
.	O

The	O
north	O
entrance	O
of	O
the	O
harbour	O
is	O
in	O
breadth	O
about	O
five	O
miles	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
distance	O
from	O
thence	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
St.	PNM
Antonio	PNM
is	O
eight	O
miles	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
course	O
from	O
the	O
entrance	O
to	O
St.	PNM
Antonio	PNM
is	O
S.S.W.	O
1/2W	O
.	O

About	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
the	O
harbour	O
is	O
contracted	O
by	O
two	O
points	O
of	O
land	O
to	O
a	O
narrow	O
channel	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
broad	O
;	O
and	O
to	O
defend	O
this	O
passage	O
,	O
a	O
battery	O
was	O
erecting	O
on	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
land	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
side	O
.	O

But	O
this	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
very	O
useless	O
work	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
channel	O
has	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
two	O
fathom	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
is	O
navigable	O
only	O
for	O
barks	O
and	O
boats	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
passage	O
that	O
an	O
enemy	O
could	O
have	O
no	O
inducement	O
to	O
attempt	O
,	O
especially	O
as	O
the	O
common	O
passage	O
at	O
the	O
north	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
is	O
so	O
broad	O
and	O
safe	O
that	O
no	O
squadron	O
can	O
be	O
prevented	O
from	O
coming	O
in	O
by	O
any	O
of	O
their	O

are	O
the	O
advantages	O
of	O
this	O
island	O

;	O
but	O
there	O
are	O
many	O
inconveniencies	O
attending	O
it	O
,	O
partly	O
from	O
its	O
climate	O
,	O
but	O
more	O
from	O
its	O
new	O
regulations	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
late	O
form	O
of	O

established	O
there	O
.	O

With	O
regard	O
to	O
the	O
climate	O
,	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
remembered	O
that	O
the	O
woods	O
and	O
hills	O
which	O
surround	O
the	O
harbour	O
prevent	O
a	O
free	O
circulation	O
of	O
the	O
air	O
.	O

And	O
the	O
vigorous	O
vegetation	O
which	O
constantly	O
takes	O
place	O
there	O
,	O
furnishes	O
such	O
a	O
prodigious	O
quantity	O
of	O
vapour	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
great	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
a	O
thick	O
fog	O
covers	O
the	O
whole	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
continues	O
till	O
either	O
the	O
sun	O
gathers	O
strength	O
to	O
dissipate	O
it	O
,	O
or	O
it	O
is	O
dispersed	O
by	O
a	O
brisk	O
sea-breeze	O
.	O

This	O
renders	O
the	O
place	O
close	O
and	O
humid	O
,	O
and	O
probably	O
occasioned	O
the	O
many	O
fevers	O
and	O
fluxes	O
we	O
were	O
there	O
afflicted	O
with	O
.	O

To	O
these	O
exceptions	O
I	O
must	O
not	O
omit	O
to	O
add	O
,	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
day	O
we	O
were	O
pestered	O
with	O
great	O
numbers	O
of	O
muscatos	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
not	O
much	O
unlike	O
the	O
gnats	O
in	O
England	PNM
,	O
but	O
more	O
venomous	O
in	O
their	O
stings	O
.	O

And	O
at	O
sunset	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
muscatos	O
retired	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
succeeded	O
by	O
an	O
infinity	O
of	O
sand-flies	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
though	O
scarce	O
discernible	O
to	O
the	O
naked	O
eye	O
,	O
make	O
a	O
mighty	O
buzzing	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
wherever	O
they	O
bite	O
,	O
raise	O
a	O
small	O
bump	O
in	O
the	O
flesh	O
which	O
is	O
soon	O
attended	O
with	O
a	O
painful	O
itching	O
,	O
like	O
that	O
arising	O
from	O
the	O

But	O
as	O
the	O
only	O
light	O
in	O
which	O
this	O

our	O

its	O

And	O
to	O
do	O
this	O
more	O
distinctly	O

it	O
will	O
not	O
be	O

the	O
time	O
of	O

this	O

a	O

This	O
gentleman	O
has	O
with	O
him	O
a	O
garrison	O
of	O

and	O
has	O
consequently	O
a	O
more	O
extensive	O

a	O
better	O

power	O
than	O
any	O
of	O

as	O
he	O
wears	O
better	O

lives	O
more	O
splendidly	O

and	O
has	O
besides	O
a	O
much	O
better	O
knowledge	O
of	O
the	O
importance	O
of	O
money	O
than	O
they	O
could	O
ever	O
pretend	O
to	O

so	O
he	O
puts	O
in	O
practice	O
certain	O
methods	O
of	O
procuring	O
it	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
utterly	O
unacquainted	O

But	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
much	O
doubted	O
if	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
consider	O
these	O
methods	O
as	O
tending	O
to	O
promote	O
either	O
their	O
interests	O
or	O
that	O
of	O
their	O
sovereign	O
the	O
King	O
of	O
Portugal	PNM
.	O

This	O
is	O
certain	O
,	O
that	O
his	O
behaviour	O
can	O
not	O
but	O
be	O
extremely	O
embarrassing	O
to	O
such	O
British	O
ships	O
as	O
touch	O
there	O
in	O
their	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
South	PNM

For	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
practices	O
was	O
placing	O
centinels	O
at	O
all	O
the	O
avenues	O
,	O
to	O
prevent	O
the	O
people	O
from	O
selling	O
us	O
any	O
refreshments	O
,	O
except	O
at	O
such	O
exorbitant	O
rates	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
afford	O
to	O
give	O
.	O

His	O
pretence	O
for	O
this	O
extraordinary	O
stretch	O
of	O
power	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
preserve	O
their	O
provisions	O
for	O
upwards	O
of	O
an	O
hundred	O
families	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
daily	O
expected	O
to	O
reinforce	O
their	O
colony	O

Hence	O
he	O
appears	O
to	O
be	O
no	O
novice	O
in	O
his	O
profession	O
,	O
by	O
his	O
readiness	O
at	O
inventing	O
a	O
plausible	O
pretence	O
for	O
his	O
interested	O

this	O

sufficiently	O

was	O

the	O

that	O
the	O

perhaps	O
we	O
may	O
not	O
be	O

of	O
the	O

near	O
two	O
millions	O

about	O
twenty	O

since	O
a	O

it	O
is	O

that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O

it	O
by	O

it	O
proving	O
difficult	O
to	O
persuade	O
the	O

that	O
what	O
they	O
had	O

be	O
of	O
the	O

by	O
this	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
informed	O
that	O
in	O
this	O
interval	O
a	O
governor	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
their	O

procured	O
a	O
good	O
number	O
of	O
these	O

But	O
it	O
was	O
at	O

confirmed	O
by	O
skilful	O
jewellers	O
in	O
Europe	PNM

consulted	O
on	O
this	O
occasion	O

that	O
the	O
stones	O
thus	O
found	O

were	O
truly	O

the	O

to	O

taken	O
place	O
at	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
St.	PNM

For	O
the	O
governor	O
of	O
Rio	PNM
Grande	PNM
,	O
of	O
whom	O
I	O
have	O
already	O
spoken	O
,	O
assured	O
us	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
neighbourhood	O
of	O
this	O
island	O
there	O
were	O
considerable	O
rivers	O
which	O
were	O
found	O
to	O
be	O
extremely	O
rich	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
reason	O
that	O
a	O
garrison	O
,	O
a	O
military	O
governor	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
new	O
colony	O
was	O
settled	O
there	O
.	O

And	O
as	O
the	O
harbour	O
at	O
this	O
island	O
is	O
by	O
much	O
the	O
securest	O
and	O
the	O
most	O
capacious	O
of	O
any	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
improbable	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
riches	O
of	O
the	O
neighbourhood	O
answer	O
their	O
expectation	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
may	O
become	O
in	O
time	O
the	O
principal	O
settlement	O
in	O
Brazil	PNM
,	O
and	O
the	O
most	O
considerable	O
port	O
in	O
all	O
South	PNM
America	PNM
.	O

Thus	O
much	O
I	O
have	O
thought	O
necessary	O
to	O
insert	O
in	O
relation	O
to	O
the	O
present	O
state	O
of	O
Brazil	PNM

and	O
of	O
the	O

For	O
as	O
this	O
last	O
place	O
has	O
been	O
generally	O
recommended	O
as	O
the	O
most	O
eligible	O
port	O
for	O
our	O
cruisers	O
to	O
refresh	O
at	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
bound	O
to	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
,	O
I	O
believed	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
my	O
duty	O
to	O
instruct	O
my	O
countrymen	O
in	O
the	O
hitherto	O
unsuspected	O
inconveniencies	O
which	O
attend	O
that	O
place	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
the	O
Brazilian	O
gold	O
and	O
diamonds	O
are	O
subjects	O
about	O
which	O
,	O
from	O
their	O
novelty	O
,	O
very	O
few	O
particulars	O
have	O
been	O
hitherto	O
published	O

I	O
conceived	O
this	O
account	O

them	O

appear	O

the	O

to	O
be	O
neither	O
a	O

nor	O
a	O

These	O
subjects	O
being	O
thus	O

I	O
shall	O
now	O
return	O
to	O
the	O
series	O

proceedings	O

When	O
we	O
first	O
arrived	O
at	O

were	O

At	O
the	O

Mr.	O

gave	O

that	O
the	O

Mr.	O

was	O
very	O
desirous	O
of	O

this	O

as	O
soon	O

and	O
we	O
were	O
at	O

in	O
hopes	O
that	O
our	O
whole	O

be	O

and	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
in	O
a	O

on	O

no	O

for	O
twice	O
that	O
time	O

For	O
,	O
on	O
a	O
survey	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
main-mast	O
was	O
sprung	O
at	O
the	O
upper	O

,	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
thought	O
capable	O
of	O
being	O
secured	O
by	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O

;	O
but	O
the	O
fore-mast	O
was	O
reported	O
to	O
be	O
unfit	O
for	O
service	O

and	O
thereupon	O
the	O
carpenters	O
were	O
sent	O
into	O

woods	O
to	O
endeavour	O
to	O
find	O
a	O

proper	O
for	O
a	O

But	O
after	O
a	O

of	O

This	O

a	O

about	O
the	O

it	O

On	O
the	O
27th	O
of	O

we	O
discovered	O
a	O

not	O

she	O
might	O

She	O
proved	O
to	O

a	O

and	O
though	O
our	O
officer	O

as	O
it	O
appeared	O
on	O
inquiry	O

had	O
behaved	O
with	O
the	O

to	O
the	O

and	O
had	O
refused	O
to	O
accept	O
a	O

which	O
the	O
master	O
would	O
have	O
forced	O
on	O
him	O
as	O
a	O
present	O

yet	O
the	O
governor	O
took	O
great	O
offence	O
at	O
our	O
sending	O
our	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
talked	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
a	O
high	O

between	O
the	O

We	O
at	O

imputed	O
this	O
ridiculous	O

to	O
no	O
deeper	O
a	O
cause	O
than	O

as	O
we	O

proceeded	O

to	O

with	O
behaving	O
rudely	O

out	O

the	O

by	O

the	O
very	O

which	O
we	O
knew	O
he	O
had	O
refused	O
to	O

as	O
a	O
present	O

a	O
circumstance	O

we	O

the	O
governor	O
was	O
well	O
acquainted	O
-LCB-	O
59	O
-RCB-	O
with	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
thence	O
reason	O
to	O
suspect	O
that	O
he	O
purposely	O
sought	O
this	O
quarrel	O

and	O
had	O
more	O
important	O
motives	O

engaging	O
in	O
it	O
than	O
the	O
mere	O

of	O
his	O

What	O
these	O
motives	O
were	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
easy	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
determine	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
we	O
afterwards	O
found	O
by	O

fell	O
into	O

hands	O
in	O
the	O
South	O

ample	O

intelligence	O
of	O

we	O
thence	O
conjectured	O
that	O
Don	O

had	O
raised	O
this	O
groundless	O
clamour	O
only	O
to	O
prevent	O
our	O
visiting	O
the	O
brigantine	O
when	O
she	O
should	O
put	O
to	O

lest	O
we	O
might	O
there	O
find	O
proofs	O
of	O
his	O
perfidious	O
behaviour	O

and	O
perhaps	O
,	O
at	O
the	O

oftentimes	O
very	O

there	O
the	O

it	O
is	O
little	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
hundred	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
conceive	O
the	O
same	O
Indians	O
who	O
frequent	O
the	O
western	O
coast	O
of	O
Patagonia	PNM
and	O
the	O
Streights	PNM
of	PNM
Magellan	PNM
often	O
ramble	O
to	O
this	O
side	O
.	O

As	O
the	O
Indians	O
near	O
Buenos	PNM
Ayres	PNM
exceed	O
these	O
southern	O
Indians	O
in	O
number	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
greatly	O
surpass	O
them	O
in	O
activity	O
and	O
spirit	O
,	O
and	O
seem	O
in	O
their	O
manners	O
to	O
be	O
nearly	O
allied	O
to	O
those	O
gallant	O
Chilian	O
Indians	O
who	O
have	O
long	O
set	O
the	O
whole	O
Spanish	O
power	O
at	O
defiance	O
,	O
have	O
often	O
ravaged	O
their	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
remain	O
to	O
this	O
hour	O
independent	O
.	O

For	O
the	O
Indians	O
about	O
Buenos	O
Ayres	O
have	O
learnt	O
to	O
be	O
excellent	O
horsemen	O
,	O
and	O
are	O
extremely	O
expert	O
in	O
the	O
management	O
of	O
all	O
cutting	O
weapons	O
,	O
though	O
ignorant	O
of	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
firearms	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
are	O
very	O
solicitous	O
to	O
keep	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
hands	O
.	O

And	O
of	O
the	O
vigour	O
and	O
resolution	O
of	O
these	O
Indians	O
,	O
the	O
behaviour	O
of	O
Orellana	PNM
and	O
his	O
followers	O
,	O
whom	O
we	O
have	O
formerly	O
mentioned	O
,	O
is	O
a	O
memorable	O
instance	O

Indeed	O
were	O
we	O
disposed	O
to	O
aim	O
at	O
the	O
utter	O
subversion	O
of	O
the	O
Spanish	O
power	O
in	O
America	PNM
,	O
no	O
means	O
seem	O
more	O
probable	O
to	O
effect	O
it	O
than	O
due	O
encouragement	O
and	O
assistance	O
given	O
to	O
these	O
Indians	O
and	O
those	O
of	O

Thus	O
much	O
may	O
suffice	O
in	O
relation	O
to	O
the	O
eastern	O
coast	O
of	O
Patagonia	PNM
.	O

The	O
western	O
coast	O
is	O
of	O
less	O
extent	O

and	O
by	O

of	O
the	O

I	O

on	O

can	O
not	O

on	O

we	O

again	O
with	O
a	O

but	O
in	O

for	O
it	O

reduced	O

as	O

to	O

in	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
it	O
one	O
of	O

of	O
the	O

,	O
he	O
swam	O
very	O
strong	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
concern	O
that	O
we	O
found	O
ourselves	O
incapable	O
of	O
assisting	O
him	O
;	O
indeed	O
we	O
were	O
the	O
more	O
grieved	O
at	O
his	O
unhappy	O
fate	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
lost	O
sight	O
of	O
him	O
struggling	O
with	O
the	O
waves	O
,	O
and	O
conceived	O
from	O
the	O
manner	O
in	O
which	O
he	O
swam	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
continue	O
sensible	O
,	O
for	O
a	O
considerable	O
time	O

,	O
of	O
the	O
horror	O
attending	O
his	O
irretrievable	O
situation	O

Before	O
this	O
last-mentioned	O
storm	O
was	O
quite	O
abated	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
two	O
of	O
our	O

one	O

broke	O

all	O
which	O
we	O
knotted	O

and	O
set	O
up	O
immediately	O

From	O
hence	O
we	O
had	O
an	O
interval	O
of	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
days	O
less	O
tempestuous	O
than	O
usual	O
,	O
but	O
accompanied	O
with	O
a	O
thick	O
fog	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
fire	O

almost	O
every	O
half-hour	O
,	O
to	O
keep	O
our	O
squadron	O
together	O

On	O
the	O
31st	O

we	O
were	O
alarmed	O
by	O
a	O
gun	O
fired	O
from	O
the	O

and	O
a	O
signal	O
made	O

immediately	O
bore	O
down	O

her	O

and	O
were	O
prepared	O
to	O
hear	O
of	O
some	O
terrible	O

;	O
but	O
we	O
were	O
apprized	O
of	O
it	O
before	O
we	O
joined	O
her	O

for	O
we	O
saw	O
that	O
her	O

was	O
broke	O
in	O
the	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
grievous	O
misfortune	O
to	O
us	O
all	O
at	O
this	O
juncture	O

as	O
it	O
was	O

it	O
would	O

on	O

there	O
came	O
on	O
a	O
storm	O

In	O

to	O

we	O

for	O
the	O

which	O
was	O
the	O

had	O
another	O
hard	O
gale	O

which	O
obliged	O
us	O

It	O
was	O

that	O

We	O
immediately	O

found	O
this	O

arisen	O
from	O

upon	O

I	O
think	O

never	O
to	O

that	O
is	O

for	O

The	O
reasons	O
for	O
this	O
precept	O
are	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
all	O
probability	O
the	O
violence	O
of	O
the	O
currents	O
will	O
be	O
hereby	O
avoided	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
weather	O
will	O
prove	O
less	O
tempestuous	O
and	O
uncertain	O
.	O

This	O
last	O
circumstance	O
we	O
ourselves	O
experienced	O
most	O
remarkably	O
,	O
for	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
unexpectedly	O
fallen	O
in	O
with	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
as	O
has	O
been	O
mentioned	O
in	O
the	O
preceding	O
chapter	O
,	O
we	O
stood	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
to	O
run	O
clear	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
no	O
sooner	O
advanced	O
into	O
sixty	O
degrees	O
or	O
upwards	O
but	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
much	O
better	O
weather	O
and	O
smoother	O
water	O
than	O
in	O
any	O
other	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
passage	O
.	O

The	O
air	O
indeed	O
was	O
very	O
cold	O
and	O
sharp	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
strong	O
gales	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
steady	O
and	O
uniform	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
sunshine	O
and	O
a	O
clear	O
sky	O
;	O
whereas	O
in	O
the	O
lower	O
latitudes	O
the	O
winds	O
every	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
intermitted	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
to	O
recover	O
new	O
strength	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
returned	O
suddenly	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
violent	O
gusts	O
,	O
threatening	O
at	O
each	O
blast	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
our	O
masts	O
,	O
which	O
must	O
have	O
ended	O
in	O
our	O
certain	O
destruction	O
.	O

And	O
that	O
the	O
currents	O
in	O
this	O
high	O
latitude	O
would	O
be	O
of	O
much	O
less	O
efficacy	O
than	O
nearer	O
the	O
land	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
evinced	O
from	O
these	O
considerations	O
,	O
that	O
all	O
currents	O
run	O
with	O
greater	O
violence	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
than	O
at	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
at	O
great	O
distances	O
from	O
shore	O
they	O
are	O
scarcely	O
perceptible	O
.	O

Indeed	O
the	O
reason	O
of	O
this	O
seems	O
sufficiently	O
obvious	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
consider	O
that	O
constant	O
currents	O
are	O
,	O
in	O
all	O
probability	O
,	O
produced	O
by	O
constant	O
winds	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
driving	O
before	O
it	O
,	O
though	O
with	O
a	O
slow	O
and	O
imperceptible	O
motion	O
,	O
a	O
large	O
body	O
of	O
water	O

to	O
the	O

with	O
the	O

And	O
it	O
is	O
reasonable	O
to	O
suppose	O
that	O
those	O
violent	O
gusts	O
of	O
wind	O
which	O
we	O
experienced	O
near	O

the	O

if	O

the	O
time	O
of	O
our	O

perhaps	O
the	O

it	O
must	O
be	O

are	O
in	O

many	O

apprehended	O
which	O
are	O
almost	O

for	O
the	O
severity	O
of	O
the	O
cold	O
and	O
the	O
shortness	O
of	O
the	O
days	O
would	O
render	O
it	O
impracticable	O
at	O
that	O
season	O
to	O
run	O
so	O
far	O
to	O
the	O

as	O
is	O
here	O

;	O
and	O
the	O

the	O

views	O
in	O

in	O
this	O

were	O
not	O
solely	O
the	O
advantage	O
he	O
might	O
hope	O
to	O

from	O
the	O
alliance	O
of	O
those	O
savages	O
,	O
in	O
restraining	O
and	O
intimidating	O
the	O
crown	O
of	O
Spain	PNM
;	O
but	O
he	O
conceived	O
that	O
,	O
independent	O
of	O
those	O
motives	O
,	O
the	O

with	O
these	O

might	O
prove	O
extremely	O
advantageous	O
to	O
the	O
English	O
nation	O

For	O
it	O
is	O
well	O
known	O
that	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
discovery	O
of	O
Chili	PNM
by	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
it	O
abounded	O
with	O
vast	O
quantities	O
of	O
gold	O
,	O
much	O
beyond	O
what	O
it	O
has	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
produced	O
since	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
in	O
their	O
possession	O

And	O
hence	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
generally	O
believed	O
that	O
the	O
richest	O
mines	O
are	O
carefully	O
concealed	O
by	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
knowing	O
that	O
the	O
discovery	O
of	O
them	O
would	O
only	O
excite	O
in	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
a	O
greater	O
thirst	O
for	O
conquest	O
and	O
tyranny	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
render	O
their	O
own	O
independence	O
more	O
precarious	O
.	O

But	O
with	O
respect	O
to	O
their	O
commerce	O
with	O
the	O
English	O
,	O
these	O
reasons	O
would	O
no	O
longer	O
influence	O
them	O
;	O
since	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
in	O
our	O
power	O
to	O
furnish	O
them	O
with	O
arms	O
and	O
ammunition	O
of	O
all	O
kinds	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
are	O
extremely	O
desirous	O
,	O
together	O
with	O
many	O
other	O
conveniencies	O
which	O
their	O
intercourse	O
with	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
has	O
taught	O
them	O
to	O
relish	O

They	O
would	O
then	O
,	O
in	O
all	O

,	O
open	O
their	O
mines	O

and	O
gladly	O
embrace	O

to	O
both	O

;	O
for	O

their	O
gold	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
proving	O
an	O

whilst	O
with	O
our	O

under	O
our	O
protection	O

they	O
might	O
become	O
a	O

It	O
is	O

Sir	O

did	O
not	O
succeed	O

it	O
was	O

where	O
we	O
hoped	O

cruised	O
for	O

in	O
that	O

several	O

But	O
here	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
only	O
disappointed	O
in	O
our	O
expectations	O
of	O
being	O
joined	O
by	O

were	O

induced	O
to	O
favour	O
the	O
gloomy	O
suggestions	O
of	O
their	O

all	O
perished	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
were	O
likewise	O
perpetually	O
alarmed	O
with	O
the	O
fears	O
of	O
being	O
driven	O
on	O
shore	O
upon	O
this	O
coast	O

which	O
appeared	O
too	O
craggy	O
and	O
irregular	O
to	O
give	O
us	O
the	O

prospect	O
that	O
in	O

of	O

could	O
possibly	O
escape	O
immediate	O
destruction	O

For	O
the	O

had	O
indeed	O
a	O
most	O
tremendous	O
aspect	O
:	O
the	O
most	O
distant	O
part	O

which	O

being	O
the	O

was	O
extremely	O
high	O
and	O
covered	O
with	O

the	O

In	O
some	O

indeed	O
we	O
discerned	O
several	O
deep	O
bays	O
running	O
into	O
the	O
land	O

but	O
the	O
entrance	O
into	O
them	O
was	O
generally	O
blocked	O
up	O
by	O
numbers	O
of	O
little	O
islands	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
not	O

there	O
might	O
be	O

in	O
some	O
of	O
those	O
bays	O

,	O
yet	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
utterly	O
ignorant	O
of	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
had	O
we	O
been	O
driven	O
ashore	O
by	O
the	O
western	O
winds	O
which	O
blew	O
almost	O
constantly	O
there	O

we	O
did	O
not	O
expect	O
to	O

avoided	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
our	O

and	O
of	O
our	O

This	O
continued	O
peril	O
,	O
which	O
lasted	O
for	O
above	O
a	O
fortnight	O
,	O
was	O
greatly	O
aggravated	O
by	O
the	O
difficulties	O
we	O
found	O
in	O
working	O
the	O

,	O
as	O
the	O

by	O
this	O

destroyed	O

a	O

had	O
in	O
some	O

Nor	O
did	O
we	O

as	O
we	O

find	O
the	O
winds	O
less	O
violent	O
as	O
we	O
advanced	O

we	O

lain-to	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
present	O
exigency	O
we	O
were	O
necessitated	O
to	O
carry	O
both	O
our	O
courses	O
and	O
top-sails	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
keep	O
clear	O

In	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
squalls	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
attended	O
by	O
several	O
violent	O
claps	O
of	O
thunder	O
,	O
a	O
sudden	O
flash	O
of	O
fire	O
darted	O
along	O
our	O

which	O

dividing	O

with	O
a	O
report	O

that	O
of	O
several	O

marking	O
them	O
in	O
different	O

of	O

This	O
flame	O
was	O
attended	O
with	O
a	O
strong	O
sulphureous	O
stench	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
doubtless	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
nature	O
with	O
the	O
larger	O
and	O
more	O
violent	O
blasts	O
of	O

which	O
then	O
filled	O
the	O

It	O
were	O
endless	O
to	O
recite	O
minutely	O
the	O
various	O
disasters	O
,	O
fatigues	O
,	O
and	O
terrors	O
which	O
we	O
encountered	O
on	O
this	O
coast	O
;	O
all	O
these	O
went	O
on	O
increasing	O
till	O
the	O
22d	O
of	O
May	O
,	O
at	O
which	O
time	O
the	O
fury	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
storms	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
hitherto	O
encountered	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
combined	O

and	O
to	O
have	O
conspired	O
our	O
destruction	O

In	O
this	O
hurricane	O
almost	O
all	O
our	O
sails	O
were	O
split	O
,	O
and	O
great	O
part	O
of	O
our	O
standing	O
rigging	O
broken	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
about	O
eight	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
a	O
mountainous	O
over-grown	O
sea	O
-LCB-	O
104	O
-RCB-	O
took	O
us	O
upon	O
our	O
starboard-quarter	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
us	O
so	O
prodigious	O
a	O
shock	O
that	O
several	O
of	O
our	O
shrouds	O
broke	O
with	O
the	O
jerk	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
our	O
masts	O
were	O
greatly	O
endangered	O
;	O
our	O
ballast	O
and	O

too	O
were	O
so	O
strangely	O
shifted	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
heeled	O
afterwards	O
two	O
streaks	O
to	O
port	O
.	O

Indeed	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
most	O
tremendous	O
blow	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
thrown	O
into	O
the	O
utmost	O
consternation	O
from	O
the	O
apprehension	O
of	O
instantly	O
foundering	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
the	O
wind	O
abated	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
hours	O
,	O
yet	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
more	O
sails	O
left	O
in	O
a	O
condition	O
to	O
bend	O
to	O
our	O
yards	O

the	O
ship	O
laboured	O
very	O
much	O
in	O
a	O
hollow	O
sea	O

rolling	O

to	O
,	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
sail	O
to	O
steady	O
her	O
:	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
expected	O
our	O
masts	O

which	O
were	O
now	O
very	O
slenderly	O
supported	O
,	O
to	O
come	O
by	O
the	O

every	O
moment	O

However	O

we	O
exerted	O
ourselves	O
the	O
best	O
we	O
could	O
to	O
stirrup	O
our	O

to	O

our	O

;	O
but	O
while	O
these	O
necessary	O
operations	O
were	O
carrying	O
on	O
,	O
we	O
ran	O
great	O
risque	O
of	O
being	O
driven	O
on	O
shore	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Chiloe	PNM
,	O
which	O
was	O
not	O
far	O
distant	O
from	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
midst	O
of	O
our	O
peril	O
the	O
wind	O
happily	O
shifted	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O

and	O
we	O
steered	O
off	O
the	O
land	O
with	O
the	O
main-sail	O
only	O
,	O
the	O
master	O
and	O
myself	O
undertaking	O
the	O
management	O
of	O
the	O
helm	O
,	O
while	O
every	O
one	O
else	O
on	O
board	O
was	O
busied	O
in	O
securing	O
the	O
masts	O
,	O
and	O
bending	O
the	O
sails	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
be	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
last	O
effort	O
of	O
that	O
stormy	O
climate	O
;	O
for	O
in	O
a	O
day	O
or	O
two	O
after	O
we	O
got	O
clear	O

found	O
the	O

a	O
fortnight	O
in	O

For	O
though	O
our	O

appointed	O
off	O

the	O

it	O

On	O
the	O
30th	O
of	O

we	O
had	O
a	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
continent	O

distant	O
about	O
twelve	O

Though	O
by	O
this	O
view	O
of	O
the	O

we	O
ascertained	O
our	O
position	O

Thus	O
we	O

at	O

At	O

with	O

the	O

in	O

and	O
they	O
well	O

that	O
even	O

a	O

as	O
indeed	O
it	O
was	O
all	O
soon	O

eagerly	O
devoured	O

The	O

were	O

were	O
not	O

for	O
what	O

The	O

in	O
this	O

had	O
discovered	O
the	O
bay	O
where	O

we	O

was	O
to	O

and	O
,	O
the	O
next	O

the	O

we	O

to	O

to	O
proceed	O
thither	O
;	O
but	O
though	O
,	O
on	O

we	O
mustered	O
all	O
the	O
strength	O
we	O
could	O

obliging	O
even	O
the	O

who	O
were	O
scarce	O

to	O

yet	O
the	O
capstan	O
was	O
so	O

that	O
it	O
was	O

four	O

after	O
which	O

with	O
our	O
utmost	O
efforts	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
many	O
surges	O
and	O
some	O
purchases	O
we	O
made	O
use	O
of	O
to	O
increase	O
our	O
power	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
ourselves	O
incapable	O
of	O
starting	O
the	O

from	O
the	O

However	O
,	O
at	O
noon	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
fresh	O
gale	O
blew	O
towards	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
induced	O
to	O
set	O
the	O
sails	O
,	O
which	O
fortunately	O
tripped	O
the	O
anchor	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
steered	O
along	O
shore	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
abreast	O
of	O
the	O
point	O
that	O
forms	O
the	O
eastern	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O

On	O
the	O
opening	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
,	O
that	O
had	O
befriended	O
us	O
thus	O
far	O
,	O
shifted	O
and	O
blew	O
from	O
thence	O
in	O
squalls	O
;	O
but	O
by	O
means	O
of	O
the	O
headway	O
we	O
had	O
got	O
we	O
loofed	O
close	O
in	O
,	O
till	O
the	O
anchor	O
brought	O
us	O
up	O
in	O
fifty-six	O
fathom	O
.	O

Soon	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
thus	O
got	O
to	O
our	O
new	O
birth	O
we	O
discovered	O
a	O
sail	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
made	O
no	O
doubt	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
squadron	O
;	O
and	O
on	O
its	O
nearer	O
approach	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
_	O
Tryal	O

sloop	O

We	O
immediately	O
sent	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
hands	O
on	O

her	O

by	O
whose	O
assistance	O
she	O
was	O
brought	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
between	O
us	O
and	O
the	O
land	O
.	O

We	O
soon	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
sloop	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
exempted	O
from	O
the	O
same	O
calamities	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
so	O
severely	O
felt	O
;	O
for	O
-LCB-	O

her	O

Captain	O

waiting	O
on	O
the	O

informed	O
him	O
that	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
small	O
complement	O
he	O
had	O
buried	O
thirty-four	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
;	O
and	O
those	O
that	O
remained	O
were	O
so	O
universally	O
afflicted	O
with	O
the	O
scurvy	O
,	O
that	O
only	O
himself	O
,	O
his	O
lieutenant	O
,	O
and	O
three	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
,	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
stand	O
by	O
the	O
sails	O

The	O
_	O
Tryal	O
_	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
within	O
us	O
on	O
the	O
12th	O
,	O
about	O
noon	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
carried	O
our	O
hawsers	O
on	O
board	O
her	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
moor	O
ourselves	O
nearer	O
in	O

;	O
but	O
the	O
wind	O
coming	O
off	O
the	O
land	O
in	O
violent	O
gusts	O
,	O
prevented	O
our	O
mooring	O
in	O
the	O
birth	O
we	O
intended	O

Indeed	O
our	O
principal	O
attention	O
was	O
employed	O
on	O
business	O
rather	O
of	O
more	O
importance	O
:	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
extremely	O
occupied	O
in	O
sending	O
on	O
shore	O
materials	O
to	O
raise	O
tents	O
for	O
the	O
reception	O
of	O
the	O
sick	O
,	O
who	O
died	O
apace	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
doubtless	O
the	O
distemper	O
was	O
considerably	O
augmented	O
by	O
the	O
stench	O
and	O
filthiness	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
lay	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
the	O
deceased	O
was	O
so	O
great	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
few	O
could	O
be	O
spared	O
from	O
the	O
necessary	O
duty	O
of	O
the	O
sails	O
to	O
look	O
after	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O
avoid	O
a	O
great	O
relaxation	O
in	O
the	O
article	O
of	O
cleanliness	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
rendered	O
the	O
ship	O
extremely	O
loathsome	O
between	O

Notwithstanding	O
our	O
desire	O
of	O
freeing	O
the	O
sick	O
from	O
their	O
hateful	O
situation	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
own	O
extreme	O
impatience	O
to	O
get	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
hands	O
enough	O
to	O
prepare	O
the	O
tents	O
for	O
their	O
reception	O
before	O
the	O
16th	O
;	O
but	O
on	O
that	O
and	O
the	O
two	O
following	O
days	O
we	O
sent	O
them	O
all	O
on	O

amounting	O
to	O
a	O
hundred	O

sixty-seven	O
persons	O

to	O
the	O

The	O
greatest	O
part	O
of	O
our	O
sick	O
were	O
so	O
infirm	O
that	O
we	O
were	O

out	O

the	O

to	O
their	O

over	O
a	O

a	O

I	O
have	O

a	O

wind	O
,	O
to	O
which	O
alone	O
this	O

very	O

during	O
our	O
stay	O
here	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
then	O
winter	O
,	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
supposed	O
,	O
in	O
other	O
seasons	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
less	O
frequent	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
in	O
those	O
few	O
instances	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
that	O
quarter	O
,	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
blow	O
with	O
any	O
great	O
force	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
perhaps	O
might	O
be	O
owing	O
to	O
the	O
highlands	O
on	O
the	O
southward	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
which	O
checked	O
its	O
current	O
,	O
and	O
thereby	O
abated	O
its	O
violence	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
suppose	O
that	O
a	O
few	O
leagues	O
off	O
it	O
blew	O
with	O
considerable	O
strength	O
,	O
since	O
it	O
sometimes	O
drove	O
before	O
it	O
a	O
prodigious	O
sea	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
we	O
rode	O
forecastle	O
in	O

But	O
though	O
the	O
northern	O
winds	O
are	O
never	O
to	O
be	O
apprehended	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
southern	O
winds	O
,	O
which	O
generally	O
prevail	O
here	O
,	O
frequently	O
blow	O
off	O
the	O
land	O
in	O
violent	O
gusts	O

squalls	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
rarely	O
last	O
longer	O
than	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
minutes	O
.	O

This	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
owing	O
to	O
the	O
obstruction	O
of	O
the	O
southern	O
gale	O
by	O
the	O
hills	O
in	O
the	O
neighbourhood	O
of	O

here	O
too	O
the	O
piemento-tree	O

likewise	O
the	O
cabbage-tree	O

though	O
in	O
no	O

And	O
besides	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
plants	O
of	O
various	O
kinds	O

which	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
botanists	O
enough	O
either	O
to	O
describe	O
or	O
attend	O
to	O

we	O
found	O
here	O
almost	O
all	O
the	O

which	O
are	O
usually	O
esteemed	O
to	O
be	O

adapted	O
to	O
the	O

of	O
those	O
scorbutick	O

which	O
are	O
contracted	O
by	O
salt	O
diet	O
and	O
long	O
voyages	O
.	O

For	O
here	O
we	O
had	O
great	O
quantities	O
of	O
water-cresses	O
and	O
purslain	O
,	O
with	O
excellent	O
wild	O
sorrel	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
vast	O
profusion	O
of	O
turnips	O
and	O
Sicilian	O
radishes	O
:	O
these	O
two	O
last	O
,	O
having	O
some	O
resemblance	O
to	O
each	O
other	O
,	O
were	O
confounded	O
by	O
our	O
people	O
under	O
the	O
general	O
name	O
of	O
turnips	O
.	O

We	O
usually	O
preferred	O
the	O
tops	O
of	O
the	O
turnips	O
to	O
the	O
roots	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
often	O
stringy	O
,	O
though	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
free	O
from	O
that	O
exception	O

and	O
remarkably	O
good	O

These	O
vegetables	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
fish	O
and	O
flesh	O
we	O
got	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
I	O
shall	O
more	O
particularly	O
describe	O
hereafter	O
,	O
were	O
not	O
only	O
extremely	O
grateful	O
to	O
our	O
palates	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
long	O
course	O
of	O
salt	O
diet	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
confined	O
to	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
likewise	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
salutary	O
consequence	O
to	O
our	O
sick	O
,	O
in	O
recovering	O
and	O
invigorating	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
no	O

service	O
to	O
us	O
who	O
were	O
well	O
,	O
in	O
destroying	O
the	O
lurking	O
seeds	O
of	O
the	O
scurvy	O
,	O
from	O
which	O
perhaps	O
none	O
of	O
us	O
were	O
totally	O

in	O
refreshing	O

us	O
to	O
our	O

To	O
the	O
vegetables	O
I	O
have	O
already	O
mentioned	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
made	O
perpetual	O
use	O
,	O
I	O
must	O
add	O
that	O
we	O
found	O
many	O
acres	O
of	O
ground	O
covered	O
with	O
oats	O
and	O
clover	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
also	O
some	O
few	O
cabbage-trees	O
upon	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
as	O
was	O
observed	O
before	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
they	O
generally	O
grew	O
on	O
the	O
precipices	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
dangerous	O
situations	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
necessary	O
to	O
cut	O
down	O
a	O
large	O
tree	O
for	O
every	O
single	O
cabbage	O
,	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
dainty	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
able	O
but	O
rarely	O
to	O
indulge	O
in	O
.	O

The	O
excellence	O
of	O
the	O
climate	O
and	O
the	O
looseness	O
of	O
the	O
soil	O
render	O
this	O

as	O
to	O

the	O

of	O
the	O

so	O
extremely	O
singular	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
avoid	O
giving	O
it	O
a	O
particular	O
consideration	O

I	O
have	O

taken	O
notice	O
of	O
the	O
wild	O

air	O
with	O
which	O
it	O

appeared	O
to	O
us	O

the	O
gradual	O
improvement	O
of	O
this	O

as	O
we	O

till	O

And	O
I	O
must	O
now	O
add	O
that	O
we	O
found	O
,	O
during	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
our	O
residence	O
there	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
inland	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O

did	O
no	O
ways	O
fall	O
short	O
of	O
the	O
sanguine	O
prepossessions	O
which	O
we	O
first	O
entertained	O
in	O
their	O

for	O
the	O

covered	O

were	O
free	O
from	O
all	O

and	O
afforded	O
an	O
easy	O
passage	O
through	O
every	O

of	O
them	O

the	O

,	O
in	O
the	O
northern	O
part	O
of	O
the	O

necessarily	O
traced	O
out	O
by	O

a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O

had	O
a	O
stream	O
of	O
the	O

through	O
them	O

that	O
tumbled	O
in	O

from	O

as	O

Some	O

the	O

that	O
the	O

I	O
shall	O
finish	O
this	O
article	O
-LCB-	O

-RCB-	O
with	O
a	O
short	O
account	O
of	O
that	O
spot	O
where	O
the	O
commodore	O
pitched	O
his	O
tent	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
he	O
made	O
choice	O
of	O
for	O
his	O
own	O
residence	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
despair	O
of	O
conveying	O
an	O
adequate	O
idea	O
of	O
its	O
beauty	O
.	O

The	O
piece	O
of	O
ground	O
which	O
he	O
chose	O
was	O
a	O
small	O
lawn	O
that	O
lay	O
on	O
a	O
little	O
ascent	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
sea	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
front	O
of	O
his	O
tent	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
large	O
avenue	O
cut	O
through	O
the	O
woods	O
to	O
the	O
seaside	O
,	O
which	O
sloping	O
to	O
the	O
water	O
with	O
a	O
gentle	O
descent	O
,	O
opened	O
a	O
prospect	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
and	O
the	O
ships	O
at	O
anchor	O
.	O

This	O
lawn	O
was	O
screened	O
behind	O
by	O
a	O
tall	O
wood	O
of	O
myrtle	O
sweeping	O
round	O
it	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
a	O
theatre	O
,	O
the	O
slope	O
on	O
which	O
the	O
wood	O
stood	O
,	O
rising	O
with	O
a	O
much	O
sharper	O
ascent	O
than	O
the	O
lawn	O
itself	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
hills	O
and	O
precipices	O
within	O
land	O
towered	O
up	O
considerably	O
above	O
the	O
tops	O
of	O
the	O
trees	O
,	O
and	O
added	O
to	O
the	O
grandeur	O
of	O
the	O
view	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
,	O
besides	O
,	O
two	O
streams	O
of	O
crystal	O
water	O
,	O
which	O
ran	O
on	O
the	O
right	O
and	O
left	O
of	O
the	O
tent	O
,	O
within	O
an	O
hundred	O
yards	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
shaded	O
by	O
the	O
trees	O
which	O
skirted	O
the	O
lawn	O
on	O
either	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
compleated	O
the	O
symmetry	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
.	O

It	O
remains	O
now	O
only	O
that	O
we	O
speak	O
of	O
the	O
animals	O
and	O
provisions	O
which	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
at	O
this	O
place	O

Former	O
writers	O
have	O
related	O
that	O
this	O
island	O
abounded	O
with	O
vast	O
numbers	O
of	O
goats	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
accounts	O
are	O
not	O
to	O
be	O

,	O
this	O

being	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
buccaneers	O

who	O
formerly	O
frequented	O
those	O

And	O
there	O

Selkirk	O

,	O
after	O
a	O

of	O
between	O
four	O

as	O
may	O
be	O
seen	O
at	O

in	O
the	O
journal	O
of	O
their	O
voyage	O
.	O

His	O
manner	O
of	O
life	O
during	O
his	O
solitude	O
was	O
in	O
most	O
particulars	O
very	O
remarkable	O
;	O
but	O
there	O
is	O
one	O
circumstance	O
he	O
relates	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
so	O
strangely	O
verified	O
by	O
our	O
own	O
observation	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
help	O
reciting	O
it	O
.	O

He	O
tells	O
us	O
,	O
amongst	O
other	O
things	O
,	O
that	O
as	O
he	O
often	O
caught	O
more	O
goats	O
than	O
he	O
wanted	O
,	O
he	O
sometimes	O
marked	O
their	O
ears	O
and	O
let	O
them	O
go	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
about	O
thirty-two	O
years	O
before	O
our	O
arrival	O
at	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

Now	O
it	O
happened	O
that	O
the	O
first	O
goat	O
that	O
was	O
killed	O
by	O
our	O
people	O
at	O
their	O
landing	O
had	O
his	O
ears	O
slit	O
,	O
whence	O
we	O
concluded	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
doubtless	O
been	O
formerly	O
under	O

the	O
power	O
of	O
Selkirk	PNM

This	O
was	O
indeed	O
an	O
animal	O
of	O
a	O
most	O
venerable	O
aspect	O
,	O
dignified	O
with	O
an	O
exceeding	O
majestic	O
beard	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
many	O
other	O
symptoms	O
of	O
antiquity	O
.	O

During	O
our	O
stay	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
others	O
marked	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
manner	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
males	O
being	O
distinguished	O

an	O
exuberance	O
of	O
beard	O
and	O
every	O
other	O
characteristick	O
of	O

But	O
the	O
great	O
numbers	O
of	O
goats	O
,	O
which	O
former	O
writers	O
describe	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
found	O
upon	O
this	O

are	O
at	O

of	O
the	O

the	O

These	O
are	O

By	O
this	O

we	O
found	O
it	O
extremely	O
difficult	O
to	O

and	O
yet	O
we	O
were	O
so	O
desirous	O
of	O
their	O
flesh	O

which	O
we	O
all	O
agreed	O
much	O
resembled	O
venison	O

that	O
we	O
got	O
knowledge	O

I	O
believe	O
,	O
of	O
all	O
their	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
conceived	O

by	O

that	O
they	O
scarcely	O
exceeded	O
two	O

I	O
remember	O
we	O
had	O
once	O
an	O

a	O

;	O
for	O
going	O
in	O
our	O
boat	O
into	O
the	O
eastern	O

,	O
we	O
perceived	O
some	O
dogs	O
running	O
very	O
eagerly	O
upon	O
the	O
foot	O

and	O
being	O
willing	O
to	O
discover	O
what	O
game	O
they	O
were	O
after	O

we	O
lay	O
upon	O
our	O
oars	O
some	O

to	O
view	O
them	O

and	O
at	O

saw	O
them	O
take	O
to	O
a	O
hill	O
,	O
where	O
looking	O
a	O
little	O
further	O
,	O
we	O
observed	O
upon	O
the	O
ridge	O
of	O
it	O
an	O
herd	O
of	O
goats	O
,	O
which	O
seemed	O
drawn	O
up	O
for	O
their	O
reception	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
narrow	O

the	O

it	O
is	O
rare	O
for	O

as	O

an	O

that	O

at	O

This	O

was	O
most	O
plentifully	O
stored	O

with	O

at	O
this	O
island	O
so	O
soon	O
after	O
we	O
came	O
there	O
ourselves	O
gave	O
us	O
great	O
hopes	O
of	O
being	O
speedily	O
joined	O
by	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O

and	O
we	O
were	O
for	O
some	O
days	O
continually	O
looking	O
out	O

in	O
expectation	O
of	O
their	O
coming	O

But	O
near	O
a	O
fortnight	O
being	O
elapsed	O
without	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
having	O
appeared	O
,	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
despair	O
of	O
ever	O
meeting	O
them	O
again	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
knew	O
that	O
if	O
our	O
ship	O
continued	O
so	O
much	O
longer	O
at	O
sea	O
we	O
should	O
every	O
man	O
of	O

have	O
perished	O
,	O
and	O
the	O

have	O

left	O
to	O
the	O

this	O
we	O
had	O

to	O
fear	O

the	O
fate	O
of	O
our	O
consorts	O
,	O
as	O
each	O
hour	O
added	O
to	O
the	O
probability	O
of	O
these	O

.	O

But	O
on	O
the	O
21st	O
of	O
June	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
,	O
from	O
an	O
eminence	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
discerned	O
a	O
ship	O
to	O
leeward	O
,	O
with	O
her	O
courses	O
even	O
with	O
the	O
horizon	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
particularly	O
observed	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
no	O
sail	O
abroad	O
except	O
her	O
courses	O
and	O
her	O
main	O
top-sail	O
.	O

This	O
circumstance	O
made	O
them	O
conclude	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
squadron	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
probably	O
suffered	O
in	O
her	O
sails	O
and	O
rigging	O
as	O
severely	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
done	O
:	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
prevented	O
from	O
forming	O
more	O
definitive	O
conjectures	O
about	O
her	O
,	O
for	O
,	O
after	O
viewing	O
her	O
for	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
,	O
the	O
weather	O
grew	O
thick	O
and	O
hazy	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
lost	O
sight	O
of	O
her	O

On	O
this	O
report	O
,	O
and	O
no	O
ship	O
appearing	O
for	O
some	O
days	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
under	O
the	O
greatest	O
concern	O
,	O
suspecting	O
that	O
her	O
people	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
utmost	O
distress	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
diminished	O
and	O
weakened	O
by	O
sickness	O
as	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
ply	O
up	O
to	O
windward	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
feared	O
that	O

after	O
having	O
been	O
in	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
her	O
whole	O

notwithstanding	O
perish	O
at	O
sea	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
26th	O
,	O
towards	O
noon	O
,	O
we	O
discerned	O
a	O
sail	O
in	O
the	O
north-east	O
quarter	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
conceived	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
very	O
same	O
ship	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
seen	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
conjectures	O
proved	O
true	O
:	O
and	O
about	O
one	O
o'clock	O
she	O
-LCB-	O
123	O
-RCB-	O
approached	O
so	O
near	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
distinguish	O
her	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
_	O
Gloucester	O
_	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
doubt	O
of	O
her	O
being	O
in	O
great	O
distress	O
,	O
the	O
commodore	O
immediately	O
ordered	O
his	O
boat	O
to	O
her	O
assistance	O
,	O
laden	O
with	O
fresh	O
water	O
,	O
fish	O
,	O
and	O
vegetables	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
seasonable	O
relief	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
for	O
our	O
apprehensions	O
of	O
their	O
calamities	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
but	O
too	O
well	O
grounded	O
,	O
as	O
perhaps	O
there	O
never	O
was	O
a	O
crew	O
in	O
a	O
more	O
distressed	O
situation	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
already	O
thrown	O
overboard	O
two-thirds	O
of	O
their	O
complement	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
those	O
which	O
remained	O
alive	O
,	O
scarcely	O
any	O
were	O
capable	O
of	O
doing	O
duty	O
,	O
except	O
the	O
officers	O
and	O
their	O

They	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
considerable	O
time	O
at	O
the	O
small	O
allowance	O
of	O
a	O
pint	O
of	O
fresh	O
water	O
to	O
each	O
man	O
for	O
twenty-four	O
hours	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
they	O
had	O
so	O
little	O
left	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
had	O
it	O
not	O
been	O
for	O
the	O

we	O
sent	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
must	O
soon	O
have	O

The	O
ship	O
plied	O
in	O
within	O
three	O
miles	O
of	O
the	O

;	O
but	O
,	O
the	O

she	O
continued	O
in	O

but	O
as	O
she	O
had	O
no	O

unless	O
the	O

Captain	O
Mitchel	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
_	O
Gloucester	O
_	O
,	O
was	O
under	O
a	O
necessity	O
of	O
detaining	O
both	O
this	O

and	O
that	O
sent	O
the	O
preceding	O
day	O
;	O
for	O
without	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
their	O

he	O
had	O
no	O
longer	O
strength	O
enough	O
to	O
navigate	O
the	O
ship	O

In	O
this	O
tantalizing	O
situation	O
the	O
_	O
Gloucester	O
_	O
continued	O
for	O
near	O
a	O
fortnight	O
,	O
without	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
fetch	O
the	O
road	O

though	O
frequently	O
attempting	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
some	O
times	O
bidding	O
very	O
fair	O
for	O
it	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
9th	O
of	O
July	O
,	O
we	O
observed	O
her	O
stretching	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
at	O
a	O
considerable	O
distance	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
supposed	O
was	O
with	O
a	O
design	O
to	O
get	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
we	O
soon	O
lost	O
sight	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
did	O
not	O
appear	O
for	O
near	O
a	O
week	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
prodigiously	O
concerned	O
,	O
knowing	O
that	O
she	O
must	O
be	O
again	O
in	O
extreme	O
distress	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
water	O
.	O

After	O
great	O
impatience	O
about	O
her	O
,	O
we	O
discovered	O
her	O
again	O
on	O
the	O
16th	O
endeavouring	O
to	O
come	O
round	O
the	O
eastern	O
point	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
wind	O
,	O
still	O
blowing	O
directly	O
from	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
prevented	O
her	O
getting	O
nearer	O
than	O
within	O
four	O
leagues	O
of	O
the	O
land	O
.	O

On	O
this	O
,	O
Captain	O
Mitchel	O
made	O
signals	O
of	O
distress	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
long-boat	O
was	O
sent	O
to	O
him	O
with	O
a	O
store	O
of	O
water	O

and	O
plenty	O
of	O

And	O
the	O
long-boat	O
being	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
spared	O
,	O
the	O

had	O
positive	O
orders	O
from	O
the	O

commodore	O
to	O
return	O
again	O
immediately	O

proving	O
stormy	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
boat	O
not	O
appearing	O
,	O
we	O
much	O
feared	O
she	O
was	O
lost	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
have	O
proved	O
an	O
irretrievable	O
misfortune	O
to	O
us	O
all	O
:	O
however	O
,	O
the	O
third	O
day	O
after	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
relieved	O
from	O
this	O
anxiety	O
by	O
the	O
joyful	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
long-boat	O
's	O
sails	O
upon	O
the	O
water	O
;	O
on	O
which	O
we	O
sent	O
the	O
cutter	O
immediately	O
to	O
her	O
assistance	O
,	O
who	O
towed	O
her	O
alongside	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
hours	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
crew	O
of	O
our	O
long-boat	O
had	O
taken	O
in	O
six	O
of	O
the	O

sick	O
men	O
to	O

of	O

in	O
the	O

We	O
now	O
learnt	O
that	O
the	O

all	O

together	O
for	O

These	O
calamities	O
were	O
the	O
more	O
terrifying	O
as	O
they	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
without	O
remedy	O
:	O
for	O

Gloucester	O
_	O
had	O
already	O
spent	O
a	O
month	O
in	O
her	O
endeavours	O
to	O
fetch	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
was	O
now	O
no	O
farther	O
advanced	O
than	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
moment	O
she	O
made	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
on	O
the	O
contrary	O
,	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
board	O
her	O
had	O
worn	O
out	O
all	O
their	O
hopes	O
of	O
ever	O
succeeding	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
many	O
experiments	O
they	O
had	O
made	O
of	O
its	O
difficulty	O

Indeed	O
,	O
the	O
same	O
day	O
her	O
situation	O
grew	O
more	O
desperate	O
than	O
ever	O
,	O
for	O
after	O
she	O
had	O
received	O
our	O
last	O
supply	O
of	O
refreshments	O
,	O
we	O
again	O
lost	O
sight	O
of	O
her	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
in	O
general	O
despaired	O
of	O
her	O
ever	O
coming	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O

Thus	O
was	O
this	O
unhappy	O
vessel	O
bandied	O
about	O
within	O
a	O
few	O
leagues	O
of	O
her	O
intended	O
harbour	O

whilst	O
the	O
neighbourhood	O
of	O
that	O
place	O
and	O
of	O
those	O
circumstances	O
which	O
could	O
alone	O
put	O
an	O
end	O
to	O
the	O
calamities	O
they	O
laboured	O
under	O
,	O
served	O
only	O
to	O
aggravate	O
their	O
distress	O
by	O
torturing	O
them	O
with	O
a	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
relief	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
in	O
their	O
power	O
to	O
reach	O

But	O
she	O
was	O
at	O
last	O
delivered	O
from	O
this	O
dreadful	O
situation	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
when	O
we	O
least	O
expected	O
it	O
;	O
for	O
after	O
having	O
lost	O
sight	O
of	O
her	O
for	O
several	O
days	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
pleasingly	O
surprized	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
morning	O
of	O
the	O
23d	O
of	O
July	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
her	O
open	O
the	O
N.W.	O
point	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
with	O
a	O
flowing	O
sail	O

when	O
we	O
immediately	O
dispatched	O
what	O

we	O
had	O
to	O
her	O

in	O

she	O

And	O
now	O
we	O
were	O

of	O

buried	O
above	O

of	O
their	O

and	O
a	O
very	O
small	O
proportion	O
of	O
the	O

were	O
capable	O
of	O

in	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

On	O
their	O
coming	O

that	O

the	O

as	O
it	O
is	O
now	O
high	O
time	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
the	O
account	O
of	O
our	O
own	O
transactions	O
on	O

and	O
on	O

during	O
the	O

Our	O
next	O

after	O
sending	O
our	O
sick	O
on	O
shore	O
from	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
,	O
was	O
cleansing	O
our	O
ship	O
and	O
filling	O
our	O
water	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
of	O
these	O
measures	O
was	O
indispensably	O
necessary	O
to	O
our	O
future	O
health	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
numbers	O
of	O
sick	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
unavoidable	O
negligence	O
arising	O
from	O
our	O
deplorable	O
situation	O
at	O
sea	O
,	O
had	O
rendered	O
the	O
decks	O
most	O
intolerably	O
loathsome	O
.	O

And	O
the	O
filling	O
our	O
water	O
was	O
a	O
caution	O
that	O
appeared	O
not	O
less	O
essential	O
to	O
our	O
security	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
apprehend	O
that	O
accidents	O
might	O
intervene	O
which	O
would	O
oblige	O
us	O
to	O
quit	O
the	O
island	O
at	O
a	O
very	O
short	O
warning	O
;	O
for	O
some	O
appearances	O
we	O
had	O
discovered	O
on	O
shore	O
upon	O
our	O
first	O
landing	O
,	O
gave	O
us	O
grounds	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
Spanish	O
cruisers	O
in	O
these	O
seas	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
left	O
the	O
island	O
but	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
before	O
our	O
-LCB-	O
126	O
-RCB-	O
arrival	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
possibly	O
return	O
thither	O
again	O
,	O
either	O
for	O
a	O
recruit	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
or	O
in	O
search	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
since	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
doubt	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
sole	O
business	O
they	O
had	O
at	O
sea	O
was	O
to	O
intercept	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
knew	O
that	O
this	O
island	O
was	O
the	O
likeliest	O
place	O
,	O
in	O
their	O
own	O
opinion	O
,	O
to	O
meet	O
with	O
us	O

The	O
circumstances	O
which	O
gave	O
rise	O
to	O
these	O
reflections	O
-LRB-	O
in	O
part	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
mistaken	O

as	O
shall	O
be	O
observed	O
more	O
at	O
large	O
hereafter	O
-RRB-	O
were	O
our	O
finding	O
on	O
shore	O
several	O
pieces	O
of	O
earthen	O
jars	O

made	O
use	O
of	O
in	O
those	O
seas	O
for	O
water	O
and	O
other	O
liquids	O
,	O
which	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
fresh	O
broken	O
:	O
we	O
saw	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
many	O
heaps	O
of	O
ashes	O

and	O
near	O
them	O
fish-bones	O
and	O
pieces	O
of	O
fish	O
,	O
besides	O
whole	O
fish	O
scattered	O
here	O
and	O
there	O
,	O
which	O
plainly	O
appeared	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
but	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
but	O
just	O
beginning	O
to	O
decay	O

These	O
were	O
certain	O
indications	O
that	O
there	O
had	O
been	O
ships	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
but	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
there	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
all	O
Spanish	O
merchantmen	O
are	O
instructed	O
to	O
avoid	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
its	O
being	O
the	O
common	O
rendezvous	O
of	O
their	O
enemies	O

we	O
concluded	O
those	O
who	O

here	O
to	O
be	O

and	O
not	O

that	O

to	O
Buenos	PNM

and	O
ignorant	O
what	O
strength	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
fitted	O
out	O
at	O
Callao	PNM
,	O
we	O
were	O
under	O
some	O
concern	O
for	O
our	O
safety	O
,	O
being	O
in	O
so	O
wretched	O
and	O
enfeebled	O
a	O
condition	O
,	O
that	O
notwithstanding	O
the	O
rank	O
of	O
our	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sixty	O
guns	O
she	O
carried	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
only	O
have	O
aggravated	O
our	O
dishonour	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
scarcely	O
a	O
privateer	O
sent	O
to	O
sea	O
that	O
was	O
not	O
an	O
over-match	O
for	O
us	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
our	O
fears	O
on	O
this	O
head	O
proved	O
imaginary	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
exposed	O
to	O
the	O
disgrace	O
which	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
expected	O
to	O
have	O
befallen	O

we	O
must	O

to	O

with	O
no	O

Whilst	O
the	O
cleaning	O
our	O
ship	O
and	O
the	O
filling	O
our	O
water	O
went	O
on	O
,	O
we	O
set	O
up	O
a	O
large	O
copper	O
oven	O
on	O
shore	O
near	O
the	O
sick	O
tents	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
we	O
baked	O
bread	O
every	O
day	O
for	O
our	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O
;	O
for	O
being	O
extremely	O
desirous	O
of	O
recovering	O
our	O
sick	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
possible	O

we	O
conceived	O
that	O
new	O
bread	O
,	O
added	O
to	O
their	O
greens	O
and	O
fresh	O
fish	O
,	O
might	O
prove	O
a	O
powerful	O
article	O
in	O
their	O
relief	O

Indeed	O
we	O
had	O
all	O
imaginable	O
reason	O
to	O
endeavour	O
at	O
the	O
augmenting	O
our	O
present	O
strength	O
,	O
as	O
every	O
little	O
accident	O
,	O
which	O
to	O
a	O
full	O
crew	O
would	O
be	O
insignificant	O
,	O
was	O
extremely	O
alarming	O
in	O
our	O
present	O
helpless	O
situation	O
.	O

Of	O
this	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
troublesome	O
instance	O
on	O
the	O
30th	O
of	O
June	O
;	O
for	O
at	O
-LCB-	O
127	O
-RCB-	O
five	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
astonished	O
by	O
a	O
violent	O
gust	O
of	O
wind	O
directly	O
off	O
shore	O
,	O
which	O
instantly	O
parted	O
our	O
small	O
bower	O
cable	O
about	O
ten	O
fathom	O
from	O
the	O
ring	O
of	O
the	O
anchor	O
:	O
the	O
ship	O
at	O
once	O
swung	O
off	O
to	O
the	O
best	O
bower	O
,	O
which	O
happily	O
stood	O
the	O
violence	O
of	O
the	O
jerk	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
us	O
up	O
with	O
two	O
cables	O
in	O
eighty	O
fathom	O
.	O

At	O
this	O
time	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
above	O
a	O
dozen	O
seamen	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
apprehensive	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
squall	O
continued	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
driven	O
to	O
sea	O
in	O
this	O
wretched	O
condition	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
sent	O
the	O
boat	O
on	O
shore	O
to	O
bring	O
off	O
all	O
who	O
were	O
capable	O
of	O
acting	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
wind	O
soon	O
abating	O
of	O
its	O
fury	O
,	O
gave	O
us	O
an	O
opportunity	O
of	O
receiving	O
the	O
boat	O
back	O
again	O
with	O
a	O
reinforcement	O
.	O

With	O
this	O
additional	O
strength	O
we	O
immediately	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
to	O
heave	O
in	O
what	O
remained	O
of	O
the	O
cable	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
suspected	O
had	O
received	O
some	O
damage	O
from	O
the	O
foulness	O
of	O
the	O
ground	O
before	O
it	O
parted	O
;	O
and	O
agreeable	O
to	O
our	O
conjecture	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
seven	O
fathom	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
of	O
the	O
outer	O
end	O
had	O
been	O
rubbed	O
,	O
and	O
rendered	O
unserviceable	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
we	O
bent	O
the	O
cable	O
to	O
the	O
spare	O
anchor	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
it	O
over	O
the	O
ship	O

side	O
;	O
and	O

being	O
favoured	O
with	O
the	O
wind	O
in	O
gentle	O
breezes	O

we	O
warped	O
the	O
ship	O
in	O
again	O

let	O

,	O
we	O
were	O
much	O
concerned	O
for	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
our	O

and	O
swept	O
frequently	O
for	O
it	O

in	O

at	O

we	O
were	O
never	O

And	O
now	O
as	O
we	O
advanced	O
in	O
July	O

some	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
being	O
tolerably	O
recovered	O

the	O

of	O

were	O
put	O
upon	O

into	O

;	O
while	O

the	O

We	O
next	O
sent	O
the	O

employed	O

We	O
began	O

the	O

;	O
but	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
not	O

These	O

with	O

And	O
then	O
Captain	O
Mitchel	O
waiting	O
on	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
informed	O
him	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
forced	O
by	O
the	O
winds	O
,	O
in	O
his	O
last	O
absence	O
,	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
small	O
island	O
called	O
Masa	PNM
Fuero	PNM
,	O
lying	O
about	O
twenty-two	O
leagues	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
of	O
Juan	PNM
Fernandes	PNM
;	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
send	O
his	O
boat	O
on	O
shore	O
there	O
for	O
water	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
he	O
could	O
observe	O
several	O
streams	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
wind	O
blew	O
so	O
strong	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
occasioned	O
such	O
a	O
surf	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
the	O
boat	O
to	O
land	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
attempt	O
was	O
not	O
altogether	O
useless	O
,	O
for	O
his	O
people	O
returned	O
with	O
a	O
boatload	O
of	O
fish	O
.	O

This	O
island	O
had	O
been	O
represented	O
by	O
former	O
navigators	O
as	O
a	O
barren	O
rock	O
;	O
but	O
Captain	O
Mitchel	O
assured	O
the	O
commodore	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
almost	O
everywhere	O
covered	O
with	O
trees	O
and	O
verdure	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
near	O
four	O
miles	O
in	O
length	O
;	O
and	O
added	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
appeared	O
to	O
him	O
far	O
from	O
impossible	O
but	O
some	O
small	O
bay	O
might	O
be	O
found	O
on	O
it	O
which	O
might	O
afford	O
sufficient	O
shelter	O
for	O
any	O
ship	O
desirous	O
of	O
refreshing	O
there	O
.	O

As	O
four	O
ships	O
of	O
our	O
squadron	O
were	O
missing	O
,	O
this	O
description	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Masa	PNM
Fuero	PNM
gave	O
rise	O
to	O
a	O
conjecture	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
might	O
possibly	O
have	O
fallen	O
in	O
with	O
that	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
have	O
mistaken	O
it	O
for	O
the	O
true	O
place	O
of	O
our	O
rendezvous	O
.	O

This	O
suspicion	O
was	O
the	O
more	O
plausible	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
draught	O
of	O
either	O
island	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
relied	O
on	O
:	O
and	O
therefore	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
determined	O
to	O
send	O
the	O
_	O
Tryal	O
_	O
sloop	O
thither	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
she	O
could	O
be	O
fitted	O
for	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
examine	O
all	O
its	O
bays	O
and	O
creeks	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
be	O
satisfied	O
whether	O
any	O
of	O
our	O
missing	O
ships	O
were	O
there	O
or	O
not	O
.	O

For	O
this	O
purpose	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
best	O
hands	O
were	O
sent	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
_	O
Tryal	O
_	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
to	O
overhale	O
and	O
fix	O
her	O
rigging	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
long-boat	O
was	O
employed	O
in	O
compleating	O
her	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
whatever	O
stores	O
and	O
necessaries	O
she	O
wanted	O
were	O
immediately	O
supplied	O
either	O
from	O

But	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
4th	O
of	O

before	O
the	O

very	O
near	O
the	O

Captain	O
Saunders	O
hung	O
out	O
lights	O
and	O
fired	O
several	O
guns	O
to	O
acquaint	O
us	O
with	O
his	O
danger	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
all	O
the	O
boats	O
were	O
sent	O
to	O
his	O
relief	O

who	O
towed	O
the	O

into	O
the	O
bay	O

where	O
she	O
anchored	O
until	O
the	O
next	O

And	O
now	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
_	O
Gloucester	O
's	O
_	O
arrival	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
employed	O
in	O
earnest	O
in	O
examining	O
and	O
repairing	O
our	O
rigging	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
stripping	O
our	O
foremast	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
alarmed	O
by	O
discovering	O
it	O
was	O
sprung	O
just	O
above	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
upper	O

The	O
spring	O
was	O
two	O
inches	O
in	O

and	O
twelve	O
in	O
circumference	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
the	O
carpenters	O
,	O
on	O
inspecting	O
it	O
,	O
gave	O
it	O
as	O
their	O
opinion	O
that	O
fishing	O
it	O
with	O
two	O
leaves	O
of	O
an	O
anchor-stock	O
would	O
render	O
it	O
as	O
secure	O
as	O
ever	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
besides	O
this	O
defect	O
in	O
our	O
mast	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
other	O
difficulties	O
in	O
refitting	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
cordage	O
and	O
canvas	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
taken	O
to	O

much	O
greater	O
quantities	O
of	O
both	O
than	O
had	O
ever	O
been	O
done	O
before	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
continued	O
bad	O
weather	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
had	O
occasioned	O
such	O
a	O
consumption	O
of	O
these	O
stores	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
driven	O
to	O
great	O
straits	O
,	O
as	O
after	O
working	O
up	O
all	O
our	O
junk	O
and	O
old	O
shrouds	O
to	O
make	O
twice-laid	O
cordage	O

we	O
were	O
at	O

obliged	O
to	O
unlay	O
a	O

with	O

Towards	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
August	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
being	O
indifferently	O
recovered	O

they	O
were	O
permitted	O
to	O
quit	O
their	O

and	O
to	O
build	O
separate	O

for	O

as	O
it	O
was	O
imagined	O
that	O
by	O
living	O

they	O
would	O
be	O
much	O
cleanlier	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
likely	O
to	O
recover	O
their	O

sooner	O
;	O
but	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
particular	O
orders	O
were	O
given	O
,	O
that	O
on	O
the	O
firing	O

from	O
the	O

they	O
should	O
instantly	O
repair	O
to	O
the	O
water-side	O

Their	O
employment	O
on	O

was	O
now	O
either	O

from	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

This	O
oil	O
served	O
us	O
for	O
several	O
purposes	O
,	O
as	O
burning	O
in	O

Some	O
of	O
the	O

too	O
were	O
occupied	O
in	O
salting	O
of	O

for	O
a	O

I	O
have	O

a	O

on	O

but	O
it	O
happened	O
that	O
the	O
greatest	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
flour	O
for	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
the	O

was	O
embarked	O
on	O

our	O
victualler	O
the	O
_	O
Anna	PNM
_	O
pink	O
:	O
and	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
mentioned	O
that	O
the	O
_	O
Tryal	O
_	O
sloop	O
,	O
at	O
her	O
arrival	O
,	O
had	O
informed	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
on	O
the	O
9th	O
of	O
May	O
she	O
had	O
fallen	O
in	O
with	O
our	O
victualler	O
not	O
far	O
distant	O
from	O
the	O
continent	O
of	O
Chili	PNM
,	O
and	O
had	O
kept	O
company	O
with	O
her	O
for	O
four	O
days	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
parted	O
in	O
a	O
hard	O
gale	O
of	O
wind	O
.	O

This	O
afforded	O
us	O
some	O
room	O
to	O
hope	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
safe	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
she	O
might	O
join	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
all	O
June	O
and	O
July	O
being	O
past	O
without	O
any	O
news	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
we	O
then	O
gave	O
her	O
over	O
for	O
lost	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
July	O
,	O
the	O
commodore	O
ordered	O
all	O
the	O
ships	O
to	O
a	O
short	O
allowance	O
of	O
bread	O
.	O

Nor	O
was	O
it	O
in	O
our	O
bread	O
only	O
that	O
we	O
feared	O
a	O
deficiency	O
;	O
for	O
since	O
our	O
arrival	O
at	O
this	O
island	O
we	O
discovered	O
that	O
our	O
former	O
purser	O
had	O
neglected	O
to	O
take	O
on	O

large	O
quantities	O
of	O
several	O
kinds	O
of	O
provisions	O
which	O
the	O
commodore	O
had	O
expressly	O
ordered	O
him	O
to	O
receive	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
supposed	O
loss	O
of	O
our	O

was	O
on	O
all	O

a	O
mortifying	O
consideration	O

However	O
,	O
on	O
Sunday	O
,	O
the	O
16th	O
of	O
August	O
,	O
about	O
noon	O

we	O
espied	O
a	O
sail	O
in	O
the	O

and	O
a	O

was	O
immediately	O
fired	O

to	O
call	O
off	O
the	O
people	O
from	O

who	O
readily	O
obeyed	O
the	O
summons	O

repairing	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O

where	O
the	O

waited	O
to	O

of	O
this	O

in	O

whether	O

With	O
all	O
these	O
advantages	O
,	O
this	O
place	O
is	O
so	O
far	O
removed	O
from	O
the	O

and	O
so	O
little	O
known	O

to	O
suppose	O
that	O

a	O

might	O
continue	O
here	O
undiscovered	O
a	O
long	O

It	O
is	O
moreover	O
a	O
post	O
of	O
great	O
defence	O

for	O
by	O
possessing	O
the	O
island	O
that	O
closes	O
up	O
the	O

and	O
which	O
is	O
accessible	O
in	O
very	O

a	O

force	O

secure	O
this	O

could	O
muster	O
in	O
that	O

since	O
this	O
island	O
towards	O
the	O

and	O
has	O
six	O

so	O
that	O
the	O

anchored	O
within	O
forty	O

it	O
is	O

All	O

of	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
the	O

lay	O
for	O
two	O

the	O

here	O
I	O
must	O
observe	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
being	O
only	O
a	O
few	O
in	O
number	O
,	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
dare	O
to	O
detach	O
any	O
of	O
their	O
people	O
on	O
distant	O
searches	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
perpetually	O
terrified	O
with	O
the	O
apprehension	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
attacked	O
either	O
by	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
or	O
the	O
Indians	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
their	O
excursions	O
were	O
generally	O
confined	O
to	O
that	O
tract	O
of	O
land	O
which	O
surrounded	O
the	O
port	O

and	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
never	O
out	O
of	O

of	O
the	O

Though	O
had	O
they	O
at	O
first	O
known	O
how	O
little	O
foundation	O
there	O
was	O
for	O
these	O
fears	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
country	O
in	O
the	O

was	O
so	O
grown	O
up	O
with	O
wood	O

and	O
traversed	O
with	O

that	O

whence	O
no	O

that	O

the	O

on	O
for	O
the	O

this	O

in	O

to	O
get	O

to	O
fall	O
down	O

dislocated	O
his	O

This	O
accident	O
,	O
together	O
with	O
the	O
crazy	O
condition	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
little	O
better	O
than	O
a	O
wreck	O
,	O
prevented	O
her	O
from	O
getting	O
off	O
to	O

entangled	O
her	O
more	O
and	O
more	O

insomuch	O
that	O
the	O
next	O

struck	O

soon	O

bilged	O

between	O
two	O
small	O
islands	O
at	O
about	O
a	O
musket-shot	O
from	O
the	O

In	O
this	O
situation	O
the	O
ship	O
continued	O
entire	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
crew	O
had	O
it	O
in	O
their	O
power	O
to	O
get	O
safe	O
on	O
shore	O
;	O
but	O
a	O
general	O
confusion	O
taking	O
place	O

numbers	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
consulting	O
their	O
safety	O
,	O
or	O
reflecting	O
on	O
their	O
calamitous	O
condition	O
,	O
fell	O
to	O
pillaging	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
arming	O
themselves	O
with	O
the	O
first	O
weapons	O
that	O
came	O
to	O
hand	O

and	O
threatening	O
to	O
murder	O
all	O

This	O
frenzy	O
was	O
greatly	O
heightened	O
by	O
the	O
liquors	O
they	O
found	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
they	O
got	O
so	O
extremely	O
drunk	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
them	O

falling	O
down	O
between	O

as	O
the	O

of	O

up	O

The	O
captain	O

therefore	O

having	O
done	O
his	O
utmost	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
whole	O
crew	O
on	O

was	O
at	O

he	O
did	O
not	O
fail	O
to	O
send	O

which	O
animated	O

infinite	O

was	O
a	O

disposition	O
constantly	O
kept	O
up	O
amongst	O

Besides	O
these	O

there	O
was	O
another	O

in	O
the	O

for	O
the	O

was	O
determined	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O

to	O
fit	O
up	O
the	O
boats	O
in	O
the	O
best	O
manner	O
he	O
could	O

and	O
to	O
proceed	O
with	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O

since	O

having	O
gotten	O
some	O

from	O

he	O
did	O
not	O

master	O
any	O
Spanish	O
vessel	O
they	O
should	O
encounter	O
with	O
in	O
those	O

and	O
he	O
thought	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
fail	O
of	O
meeting	O
with	O
one	O
in	O
the	O
neighbourhood	O
of	O
Chiloe	PNM

Baldivia	PNM

in	O
which	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
had	O
taken	O

he	O
intended	O
to	O
proceed	O
to	O
the	O
rendezvous	O
at	O
Juan	PNM

and	O
he	O
farther	O
insisted	O
that	O
should	O
they	O
light	O
on	O
no	O
prize	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
boats	O
alone	O
would	O
easily	O
carry	O
them	O
thither	O

But	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
scheme	O
that	O
,	O
however	O
prudent	O
,	O
was	O
no	O
ways	O
relished	O
by	O
the	O
generality	O
of	O
his	O
people	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
being	O
quite	O
jaded	O
with	O
the	O
distresses	O
and	O
dangers	O
they	O
had	O
already	O
run	O
through	O

they	O
could	O
not	O
think	O
of	O
prosecuting	O
an	O
enterprise	O
farther	O
which	O
had	O
hitherto	O
proved	O
so	O
disastrous	O
.	O

The	O
common	O
resolution	O
therefore	O
was	O
to	O
lengthen	O
the	O
long-boat	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
that	O
and	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
boats	O
to	O
steer	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O

pass	O
through	O
the	O

-LCB-	O

and	O
to	O
range	O
along	O

side	O
of	O
South	PNM
America	PNM
till	O
they	O
should	O
arrive	O
at	O

where	O
they	O
doubted	O
not	O
to	O

well	O
received	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
procure	O
a	O
passage	O
to	O
Great	PNM

This	O
project	O
was	O
at	O
first	O
sight	O
infinitely	O
more	O
hazardous	O
and	O
tedious	O
than	O
what	O
was	O
proposed	O
by	O
the	O
captain	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
it	O
had	O
the	O
air	O
of	O
returning	O
home	O
,	O
and	O
flattered	O
them	O
with	O
the	O
hopes	O
of	O
bringing	O
them	O
once	O
more	O
to	O
their	O
native	O
country	O
,	O
that	O
circumstance	O
alone	O
rendered	O
them	O
inattentive	O
to	O
all	O
its	O
inconveniences	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
them	O
adhere	O
to	O
it	O
with	O
insurmountable	O
obstinacy	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
captain	O
himself	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
never	O
changed	O
his	O
opinion	O
,	O
was	O
yet	O
obliged	O
to	O
give	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
torrent	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
appearance	O
to	O
acquiesce	O
in	O
this	O
resolution	O
,	O
whilst	O
he	O
endeavoured	O
underhand	O
to	O
give	O
it	O
all	O
the	O
obstruction	O
he	O
could	O
,	O
particularly	O
in	O
the	O
lengthening	O
the	O
long-boat	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
contrived	O
should	O
be	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
size	O

that	O
though	O
it	O
might	O
serve	O
to	O
carry	O
them	O
to	O
Juan	O

would	O
yet	O

he	O
hoped	O

so	O
long	O
a	O
navigation	O
as	O
that	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O

But	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
by	O
his	O
steady	O
opposition	O
at	O
first	O
to	O
this	O
favourite	O
project	O

had	O
much	O
embittered	O
the	O
people	O
against	O
him	O

to	O
which	O
likewise	O
the	O

was	O
a	O

the	O

One	O
would	O
have	O
thought	O
that	O
their	O
distresses	O
had	O
long	O
before	O
this	O
time	O
been	O
incapable	O
of	O
augmentation	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
found	O
,	O
on	O
reflection	O
,	O
that	O
their	O
present	O
situation	O
was	O
much	O
more	O
dismaying	O
than	O
anything	O
they	O
had	O
yet	O
gone	O
through	O
,	O
being	O
left	O
on	O
a	O
desolate	O

without	O
any	O

the	O

were	O
all	O
carried	O
away	O
in	O

But	O
when	O
they	O
had	O
sufficiently	O
revolved	O
in	O
their	O
own	O
minds	O
the	O
various	O
circumstances	O
of	O
this	O

and	O
were	O
persuaded	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
relief	O
to	O

for	O
,	O
they	O
perceived	O
a	O
canoe	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
which	O
proved	O
to	O
be	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
Indian	O
who	O
had	O
undertaken	O
to	O
carry	O
them	O
to	O

,	O
he	O
and	O
all	O
his	O
family	O
being	O
then	O
on	O

it	O

He	O
made	O
no	O
difficulty	O
of	O
coming	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
seems	O
he	O
had	O
left	O

his	O
people	O
a	O
little	O
before	O
to	O
go	O
a-fishing	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
in	O

them	O

of	O

with	O

being	O
at	O

satisfied	O
with	O
the	O

that	O
was	O

him	O

he	O
still	O
undertook	O
to	O
carry	O
them	O
to	O
the	O

Captain	O

were	O

by	O
the	O

with	O
great	O

,	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
some	O

among	O

,	O
Mr.	O

did	O
not	O

and	O
not	O
till	O
by	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O

the	O
company	O
was	O
diminished	O
from	O
twenty	O

no	O
more	O

four	O

and	O
those	O
too	O
brought	O
so	O

a	O
few	O
days	O
longer	O
,	O
in	O
all	O

none	O

For	O
the	O

was	O
with	O

recovered	O
,	O
and	O
the	O

About	O
a	O

of	O

the	O

that	O

round	O

As	O
upon	O
this	O
occasion	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Masa	PNM
Fuero	PNM
was	O
more	O
particularly	O
examined	O
than	O
I	O
dare	O
say	O
it	O
had	O
ever	O
been	O
before	O
,	O
or	O
perhaps	O
ever	O
will	O
be	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
the	O
knowledge	O
of	O
it	O
may	O
,	O
in	O
certain	O
circumstances	O
,	O
be	O
of	O
great	O
consequence	O
hereafter	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
incumbent	O
on	O
me	O
to	O
insert	O
the	O
accounts	O
given	O
of	O
this	O
place	O
by	O
the	O
officers	O
of	O
the	O
_	O
Tryal	O
_	O
sloop	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
have	O
generally	O
mentioned	O
two	O
islands	O
under	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
Juan	PNM
Fernandes	PNM
,	O
styling	O
them	O
the	O
greater	O
and	O
the	O
less	O
:	O
the	O
greater	O
being	O
that	O
island	O
where	O
we	O
anchored	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
less	O
being	O
the	O
island	O
we	O
are	O
now	O
describing	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
more	O
distant	O
from	O
the	O
continent	O
,	O
they	O
have	O
distinguished	O
by	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
Masa	PNM
Fuero	PNM
.	O

The	O
_	O
Tryal	O
_	O
sloop	O
found	O
that	O
it	O
bore	O
from	O
the	O
greater	O
Juan	O
Fernandes	O
W.	O
by	O
S.	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
about	O
twenty-two	O
leagues	O
distant	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
much	O
larger	O
and	O
better	O
spot	O
than	O
has	O
been	O
generally	O
reported	O
;	O
for	O
former	O
writers	O
have	O
represented	O
it	O
as	O
a	O
small	O
barren	O
rock	O
,	O
destitute	O
of	O
wood	O
and	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
altogether	O
inaccessible	O
;	O
whereas	O
our	O
people	O
found	O
it	O
was	O
covered	O
with	O
trees	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
several	O
fine	O
falls	O
of	O
water	O
pouring	O
down	O
its	O
sides	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
.	O

They	O
found	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
place	O
where	O
a	O
ship	O
might	O
come	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
though	O
indeed	O
the	O
anchorage	O
is	O
inconvenient	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
bank	O
extends	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
,	O
is	O
steep	O
too	O
,	O
and	O
has	O
very	O
deep	O
water	O
upon	O
it	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
you	O
must	O
come	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
very	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
lie	O
exposed	O
to	O
all	O
the	O
winds	O
but	O
a	O
southerly	O
one	O
.	O

And	O
besides	O
the	O
inconvenience	O
of	O
the	O
anchorage	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
also	O
a	O
reef	O
of	O
rocks	O
running	O
off	O
the	O
eastern	O
point	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
about	O
two	O
miles	O
in	O
length	O
,	O
though	O
there	O
is	O
little	O
danger	O
to	O
be	O
-LCB-	O
149	O
-RCB-	O
feared	O
from	O
them	O
,	O
because	O
they	O
are	O
always	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
by	O
the	O
seas	O
breaking	O
over	O
them	O
.	O

This	O
place	O
has	O
at	O
present	O
one	O
advantage	O
beyond	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Juan	PNM
Fernandes	PNM
;	O
for	O
it	O
abounds	O
with	O
goats	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
not	O
being	O
accustomed	O
to	O
be	O
disturbed	O
,	O
were	O
no	O

shy	O
or	O
apprehensive	O
of	O
danger	O
till	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
frequently	O

The	O

This	O
was	O

that	O

that	O

with	O

he	O

In	O

with	O
this	O

Mr.	O

the	O
next	O

made	O
their	O

that	O

now	O
the	O

his	O

confirmed	O
by	O
the	O
opinion	O

Hereupon	O
the	O

which	O
were	O
at	O

by	O

of	O
the	O

he	O
-LCB-	O

agreed	O
with	O
Mr.	O

The	O

thus	O
broken	O
up	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Gerard	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
hands	O
belonging	O

the	O

were	O
sent	O
on	O

the	O
_	O

_	O
,	O
as	O
that	O

had	O
buried	O
the	O

number	O

in	O

to	O
her	O
complement	O

But	O
afterwards	O

one	O

two	O
of	O

were	O
received	O
on	O

the	O

on	O
their	O
own	O
petition	O

they	O
being	O

averse	O
to	O
sailing	O
in	O
the	O

with	O
their	O

on	O

of	O
some	O

This	O
transaction	O
brought	O
us	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
September	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
people	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
were	O
so	O
far	O
recovered	O
of	O
the	O
scurvy	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
little	O
danger	O
of	O
burying	O
any	O
more	O
at	O
present	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
I	O
shall	O
now	O
sum	O
up	O
the	O
total	O
of	O
our	O
loss	O
since	O
our	O
departure	O
from	O
England	PNM
,	O
the	O
better	O
to	O
convey	O
some	O
idea	O
of	O
our	O
past	O
sufferings	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
our	O
present	O
strength	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
buried	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
_	O

_	O
,	O
since	O
our	O
leaving	O
St.	O

two	O

ninety-two	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
now	O
remaining	O
on	O

two	O
hundred	O
and	O
fourteen	O
.	O

This	O
will	O
doubtless	O
appear	O
a	O
most	O
extraordinary	O
mortality	O
:	O
but	O
yet	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
_	O
Gloucester	O
_	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
much	O
greater	O
,	O
for	O
out	O
of	O
a	O
much	O
smaller	O
crew	O
than	O
ours	O
they	O
had	O
lost	O
the	O
same	O
number	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
only	O
eighty-two	O
remaining	O
alive	O

It	O
might	O
be	O
expected	O
that	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
_	O
Tryal	O
_	O
the	O
slaughter	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
the	O
most	O
terrible	O
,	O
as	O
her	O
decks	O
were	O
almost	O
constantly	O
knee-deep	O
in	O
water	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
happened	O
otherwise	O
,	O
for	O
she	O
escaped	O
more	O
favourably	O
than	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
since	O
she	O
only	O
buried	O
forty-two	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
now	O
thirty-nine	O
remaining	O
alive	O
.	O

The	O
havock	O
of	O
this	O
disease	O
had	O
fallen	O
still	O
severer	O
on	O
the	O
invalids	O
and	O

than	O
on	O
the	O
sailors	O
;	O
for	O
on	O

the	O

_	O
,	O
out	O
of	O
fifty	O

there	O
remained	O
only	O
four	O
invalids	O

eleven	O

and	O
on	O

every	O

and	O
out	O
of	O
forty-eight	O

From	O
this	O
account	O
it	O
appears	O
that	O
the	O
three	O
ships	O
together	O
departed	O
from	O
England	PNM
with	O
nine	O
hundred	O
and	O
sixty-one	O
men	O
on	O

,	O
of	O
whom	O
six	O
hundred	O
and	O
twenty-six	O
were	O
dead	O
before	O
this	O
time	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
whole	O
of	O
our	O
remaining	O
crews	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
now	O
to	O
be	O
distributed	O
amongst	O
three	O
ships	O
,	O
amounted	O
to	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
three	O
hundred	O
and	O
thirty-five	O
men	O
and	O
boys	O
:	O
a	O
number	O
greatly	O
insufficient	O
for	O
the	O

the	O

with	O
the	O

This	O
prodigious	O
-LCB-	O

reduction	O
of	O
our	O

was	O
still	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

of	O

had	O
reason	O
to	O

some	O

it	O
at	O

had	O
got	O
round	O

Indeed	O

we	O
were	O
satisfied	O
from	O
our	O

that	O
they	O
must	O
have	O
suffered	O
greatly	O
in	O
their	O
passage	O
;	O

then	O
every	O
port	O
in	O
the	O
South	PNM

open	O
to	O
them	O

and	O
the	O

would	O
doubtless	O
be	O
united	O
in	O

them	O

and	O
recruiting	O
the	O

we	O
should	O
be	O
necessitated	O
to	O
content	O
ourselves	O
with	O
what	O
few	O
prizes	O
we	O
could	O
pick	O
up	O
at	O
sea	O
before	O
we	O
were	O
discovered	O
;	O
after	O
which	O
we	O
should	O
in	O
all	O
probability	O
be	O
obliged	O
to	O
depart	O
with	O
precipitation	O
,	O
and	O
esteem	O
ourselves	O
fortunate	O
to	O
regain	O
our	O
native	O
country	O
,	O
leaving	O
our	O
enemies	O
to	O
triumph	O
on	O
the	O
inconsiderable	O
mischief	O
they	O
had	O
received	O
from	O
a	O
squadron	O
whose	O
equipment	O
had	O
filled	O
them	O
with	O
such	O
dreadful	O
apprehensions	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
subject	O
on	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
imagine	O
the	O
Spanish	O
ostentation	O
would	O
remarkably	O
exert	O
itself	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
causes	O
of	O
our	O
disappointment	O
and	O
their	O
security	O
were	O
neither	O
to	O
be	O
sought	O
for	O
in	O
their	O
valour	O
nor	O
our	O
misconduct	O
.	O

Such	O
were	O
the	O
desponding	O
reflections	O
which	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
arose	O
on	O
the	O
review	O
and	O
comparison	O
of	O
our	O
remaining	O
strength	O
with	O
our	O
original	O
numbers	O

Indeed	O
,	O
our	O
fears	O
were	O
far	O
from	O
being	O
groundless	O
,	O
or	O
disproportioned	O
to	O
our	O
feeble	O
and	O
almost	O
desperate	O
situation	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
the	O
final	O
event	O
proved	O
more	O
honourable	O
than	O
we	O
had	O
foreboded	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
intermediate	O
calamities	O
did	O
likewise	O
greatly	O
surpass	O
our	O
most	O
gloomy	O
apprehensions	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
they	O
have	O
been	O
predicted	O
to	O
us	O
at	O
this	O
island	O
of	O

they	O
would	O

In	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
September	O
,	O
as	O
has	O
been	O
already	O
mentioned	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
were	O
tolerably	O
well	O
recovered	O
;	O
and	O
now	O
,	O
the	O
season	O
for	O
navigation	O
in	O
this	O
climate	O
drawing	O
near	O
,	O
we	O
exerted	O
ourselves	O
in	O
getting	O
our	O
ships	O
in	O
readiness	O
for	O
the	O
sea	O
.	O

We	O
converted	O
the	O
fore-mast	O
of	O
the	O
victualler	O
into	O
a	O
main-mast	O
for	O
the	O
_	O
Tryal	PNM
_	O
sloop	O
;	O
and	O
still	O
flattering	O
ourselves	O
with	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O
the	O
arrival	O
of	O
some	O
other	O
ships	O
of	O
our	O
squadron	O
,	O
we	O
intended	O
to	O
leave	O
the	O
main-mast	O
of	O
the	O
victualler	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
mizen-mast	O
for	O
the	O

Thus	O
all	O
hands	O
being	O
employed	O
in	O
forwarding	O
our	O
departure	O
,	O
we	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
8th	O
,	O
about	O
eleven	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
espied	O
a	O
sail	O
to	O
the	O
N.E.	O
which	O
continued	O
to	O
approach	O
us	O
till	O
her	O
courses	O
appeared	O
even	O
with	O
the	O
horizon	O
.	O

Whilst	O
she	O
advanced	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
great	O
hopes	O
she	O
might	O
prove	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
own	O
squadron	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
at	O
length	O
she	O
steered	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
without	O
haling	O
in	O
for	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
we	O
thence	O
concluded	O
she	O
must	O
be	O
a	O
Spaniard	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
great	O
disputes	O
were	O
set	O
on	O
foot	O
about	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O
her	O
having	O
discovered	O
our	O
tents	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
us	O
strongly	O
insisting	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
doubtless	O
been	O
near	O
enough	O
to	O
have	O
perceived	O
something	O
that	O
had	O
given	O
her	O
a	O
jealousy	O
of	O
an	O
enemy	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
occasioned	O
her	O
standing	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
without	O
haling	O
in	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
leaving	O
these	O
contests	O
to	O
be	O
settled	O
afterwards	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
resolved	O
to	O
pursue	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
being	O
in	O
the	O
greatest	O
forwardness	O
,	O
we	O
immediately	O
got	O
all	O
our	O
hands	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
set	O
up	O
our	O
rigging	O
,	O
bent	O
our	O
sails	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
five	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
got	O
under	O
sail	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
very	O
little	O
wind	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
boats	O
were	O
employed	O
to	O
tow	O
us	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
;	O
and	O
even	O
what	O
wind	O
there	O
was	O
,	O
lasted	O
only	O
long	O
enough	O
to	O
give	O
us	O
an	O
offing	O
of	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
leagues	O
,	O
when	O
it	O
flatted	O
to	O
a	O
calm	O
.	O

The	O
night	O
coming	O
on	O
,	O
we	O
lost	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
chace	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
extremely	O
impatient	O
for	O
the	O
return	O
of	O
daylight	O
,	O
in	O
hopes	O
to	O
find	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
becalmed	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
we	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
must	O
confess	O
that	O
her	O
greater	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
land	O
was	O
a	O
reasonable	O
ground	O
for	O
suspecting	O
the	O
contrary	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
indeed	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
mortification	O
,	O
for	O
though	O
the	O
weather	O
continued	O
perfectly	O
clear	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
from	O
the	O
mast-head	O
.	O

But	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
satisfied	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
an	O
enemy	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
first	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
in	O
these	O
seas	O
,	O
we	O
resolved	O
not	O
to	O
give	O
over	O
the	O
search	O
lightly	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
a	O
small	O
breeze	O
springing	O
up	O
from	O
the	O
W.N.W.	O
,	O
we	O
got	O
up	O
our	O
top-gallant	O
masts	O
and	O
yards	O
,	O
set	O
all	O
the	O
sails	O
,	O
and	O
steered	O
to	O
the	O
S.E.	O
in	O
hopes	O
of	O
retrieving	O
our	O
chace	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
imagined	O
to	O
-LCB-	O
154	O
-RCB-	O
be	O
bound	O
to	O
Valparaiso	PNM
.	O

We	O
continued	O
on	O
this	O
course	O
all	O
that	O
day	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
not	O
getting	O
sight	O
of	O
our	O
chace	O
,	O
we	O
gave	O
over	O
the	O
pursuit	O
,	O
conceiving	O
that	O
by	O
that	O
time	O
she	O
must	O
,	O
in	O
all	O
probability	O
,	O
have	O
reached	O
her	O
port	O
.	O

Being	O
therefore	O
determined	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
Juan	O
Fernandes	O
,	O
we	O
haled	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
S.W.	O
with	O
that	O
view	O
,	O
having	O
but	O
very	O
little	O
wind	O
till	O
the	O
12th	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
at	O
three	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
there	O
sprung	O
up	O
a	O
fresh	O
gale	O
from	O
the	O
W.S.W.	O
which	O
obliged	O
us	O
to	O
tack	O
and	O
stand	O
to	O
the	O
N.W.	O
.	O

At	O
daybreak	O
we	O
were	O
agreeably	O
surprized	O
with	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
a	O
sail	O
on	O
our	O
weather-bow	O
,	O
between	O
four	O
and	O
five	O
leagues	O
distant	O
.	O

We	O
immediately	O
crouded	O
all	O
the	O
sail	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
after	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
perceived	O
it	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
same	O
ship	O
we	O
originally	O
gave	O
chace	O
to	O
.	O

She	O
at	O
first	O
bore	O
down	O
upon	O
us	O
,	O
shewing	O
Spanish	O
colours	O
,	O
and	O
making	O
a	O
signal	O
as	O
to	O
her	O
consort	O
;	O
but	O
observing	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
answer	O
her	O
signal	O
,	O
she	O
instantly	O
loofed	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
wind	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
.	O

Our	O
people	O
were	O
now	O
all	O
in	O
spirits	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
the	O
ship	O
about	O
with	O
great	O
briskness	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
the	O
chace	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
large	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
mistaken	O
us	O
for	O
her	O
consort	O
,	O
we	O
conceived	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
a	O
man-of-war	O
,	O
and	O
probably	O
one	O
of	O
Pizarro	O
's	O
squadron	O
.	O

This	O
induced	O
the	O
commodore	O
to	O
order	O
all	O
the	O
officers	O
'	O
cabins	O
to	O
be	O
knocked	O
down	O
and	O
thrown	O
overboard	O
,	O
with	O
several	O
casks	O
of	O
water	O
and	O
provisions	O
which	O
stood	O
between	O
the	O
guns	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
soon	O
a	O
clear	O
ship	O
,	O
ready	O
for	O
an	O
engagement	O
.	O

About	O
nine	O
o'clock	O
we	O
had	O
thick	O
hazy	O
weather	O
and	O
a	O
shower	O
of	O
rain	O
,	O
during	O
which	O
we	O
lost	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
chace	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
apprehensive	O
,	O
if	O
this	O
dark	O
weather	O
should	O
continue	O
,	O
that	O
by	O
going	O
upon	O
the	O
other	O
tack	O
,	O
or	O
by	O
some	O
other	O
artifice	O
,	O
she	O
might	O
escape	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
clearing	O
up	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
both	O
weathered	O
and	O
fore-reached	O
upon	O
her	O
considerably	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
then	O
near	O
enough	O
to	O
discover	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
only	O
a	O
merchantman	O
,	O
without	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
a	O
single	O
tier	O
of	O

About	O
half	O
an	O

after	O
twelve	O
,	O
being	O
got	O
within	O
a	O
reasonable	O
distance	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
we	O
fired	O
four	O
shot	O
amongst	O
her	O
rigging	O
;	O
on	O
which	O
they	O
lowered	O
their	O
top-sails	O

and	O
bore	O
down	O
to	O
us	O

but	O
in	O
very	O
great	O
confusion	O

their	O
top-gallant	O
sails	O
and	O
stay-sails	O
all	O
fluttering	O
in	O
the	O
winds	O
:	O
this	O
was	O
owing	O
to	O
their	O
having	O
let	O
run	O
their	O
sheets	O
and	O
halyards	O
just	O
as	O
we	O
fired	O
at	O
them	O

after	O
which	O
not	O
a	O

had	O
courage	O
enough	O
to	O
venture	O
aloft	O

the	O

ordered	O
them	O

with	O
great	O

The	O

informed	O
us	O
that	O
they	O
left	O
Callao	PNM
in	O
company	O
with	O
two	O
other	O
ships	O
,	O
whom	O
they	O
had	O
parted	O
with	O
some	O
days	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
at	O
first	O
they	O
conceived	O
us	O
to	O
be	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
company	O
;	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
description	O
we	O
gave	O
them	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
we	O
had	O
chased	O
from	O
Juan	PNM
Fernandes	PNM
,	O
they	O
assured	O
us	O
she	O
was	O
of	O
their	O
number	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
coming	O
in	O
sight	O
of	O
that	O
island	O
was	O
directly	O
repugnant	O
to	O
the	O
merchants	O
'	O
instructions	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
expressly	O
forbid	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
knowing	O
that	O
if	O
any	O
English	O
squadron	O
was	O
in	O
those	O
seas	O
,	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Fernandes	O
was	O
most	O
probably	O
the	O
place	O
of	O
their	O
rendezvous	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
short	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
and	O
her	O
cargoe	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
necessary	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
relate	O
the	O
important	O
intelligence	O
which	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
on	O
board	O
her	O
,	O
partly	O
from	O
the	O
information	O
of	O
the	O
prisoners	O
,	O
and	O
partly	O
from	O
the	O
letters	O
and	O
papers	O
which	O
fell	O
into	O
our	O
hands	O
.	O

We	O
here	O
first	O
learnt	O
with	O
certainty	O
the	O
force	O
and	O
destination	O
of	O
that	O
squadron	O
which	O
cruized	O
off	O
the	O
Maderas	O
at	O
our	O
arrival	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
afterwards	O
chased	O
the	O
_	O
Pearl	PNM
_	O
in	O
our	O
passage	O
to	O
Port	PNM
St.	PNM
Julian	PNM
.	O

This	O
we	O
now	O
knew	O
was	O
a	O
squadron	O
composed	O
of	O
five	O
large	O
Spanish	O
ships	O
,	O
commanded	O
by	O
Admiral	O
Pizarro	O
,	O
and	O
purposely	O
fitted	O
out	O
to	O
traverse	O
our	O
designs	O
,	O
as	O
hath	O
been	O
already	O
more	O
amply	O
related	O
in	O
the	O
third	O
chapter	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
book	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
the	O
satisfaction	O
to	O
find	O
that	O
Pizarro	O
,	O
after	O
his	O
utmost	O
endeavours	O
to	O
gain	O
his	O
passage	O
into	O
these	O
seas	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
forced	O
back	O
again	O
into	O
the	O
river	PNM
of	PNM
Plate	PNM
,	O
with	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
two	O
of	O
his	O
largest	O
ships	O
.	O

And	O
besides	O
this	O
disappointment	O
of	O
Pizarro	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
considering	O
our	O
great	O
debility	O
,	O
was	O
no	O
unacceptable	O
intelligence	O
,	O
we	O
farther	O
learnt	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
an	O
embargo	O
had	O
been	O
laid	O
upon	O
all	O
shipping	O
in	O
these	O
seas	O
by	O
the	O
Viceroy	O
of	O
Peru	PNM
,	O
in	O
the	O
month	O
of	O
May	O
preceding	O
,	O
on	O
a	O
supposition	O
that	O
about	O
that	O
time	O
we	O
might	O
arrive	O
upon	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
now	O
no	O
longer	O
subsisted	O
:	O
for	O
on	O
the	O
account	O
sent	O
overland	O
by	O
Pizarro	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
distresses	O
,	O
part	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
knew	O
we	O
must	O
have	O
encountered	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
sea	O
during	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
on	O
their	O
having	O
no	O

of	O
us	O
in	O
eight	O

after	O
we	O
were	O
known	O
to	O
set	O
sail	O
from	O
St.	PNM

,	O
they	O
were	O
fully	O
satisfied	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
either	O
shipwrecked	O
,	O
or	O
had	O
perished	O
at	O
sea	O
,	O
or	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
obliged	O
to	O
put	O
back	O
again	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
conceived	O
impossible	O
for	O
any	O
ships	O
to	O
-LCB-	O

-RCB-	O
continue	O
at	O
sea	O
during	O
so	O
long	O
an	O
interval	O
:	O
and	O
therefore	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
application	O
of	O
the	O
merchants	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
firm	O
persuasion	O
of	O
our	O
having	O
miscarried	O
,	O
the	O
embargo	O
had	O
been	O
lately	O
taken	O
off	O
.	O

This	O
last	O
article	O
made	O
us	O
flatter	O
ourselves	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
enemy	O
was	O
still	O
a	O
stranger	O
to	O
our	O
having	O
got	O
round	O
Cape	PNM
Horn	PNM
,	O
and	O
the	O
navigation	O
of	O
these	O
seas	O
was	O
restored	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
meet	O
with	O
some	O
valuable	O
captures	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
thereby	O
indemnify	O
ourselves	O
for	O
the	O
incapacity	O
we	O
were	O
under	O
of	O
attempting	O
any	O
of	O
their	O
considerable	O
settlements	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

And	O
thus	O
much	O
we	O
were	O
certain	O
of	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
information	O
of	O
our	O
prisoners	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
whatever	O
our	O
success	O
might	O
be	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
the	O

we	O
might	O
light	O
on	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
fear	O
,	O
weak	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
Spanish	O
force	O
in	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
discovered	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
most	O
imminent	O
peril	O
from	O
the	O
enemy	O
when	O
we	O
least	O
apprehended	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
our	O
other	O
distresses	O
were	O
at	O
the	O
greatest	O
height	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
learnt	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
letters	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
that	O
Pizarro	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
express	O
he	O
dispatched	O
to	O
the	O
Viceroy	O
of	O
Peru	PNM
,	O
after	O
his	O
return	O
to	O
the	O
river	O
of	O
Plate	PNM
,	O
had	O
intimated	O
to	O
him	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
possible	O
some	O
part	O
at	O
least	O
of	O
the	O
English	O
squadron	O
might	O
get	O
round	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
certain	O
from	O
his	O
own	O
experience	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
did	O
arrive	O
in	O
those	O
seas	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
weak	O
and	O
defenceless	O
condition	O
,	O
he	O
advised	O
the	O
viceroy	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
be	O
secure	O
at	O
all	O
events	O
,	O
to	O
send	O
what	O
ships	O
of	O
war	O
he	O
had	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
in	O
all	O
probability	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
intercept	O
us	O
singly	O
,	O
before	O
we	O
had	O
an	O
opportunity	O
of	O
touching	O
at	O
any	O
port	O
for	O
refreshment	O
;	O
in	O
which	O
case	O
he	O
doubted	O
not	O
but	O
we	O
should	O
prove	O
an	O
easy	O
conquest	O
.	O

The	O
Viceroy	O
of	O
Peru	PNM
approved	O
of	O
this	O
advice	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
already	O
fitted	O
out	O
four	O
ships	O

one	O
of	O

which	O
were	O
intended	O
to	O
join	O

when	O
he	O
arrived	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O

--	O
the	O
viceroy	O
now	O
stationed	O

off	O
the	O

of	PNM
Conception	PNM
,	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
at	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Fernandes	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
continued	O
cruizing	O
for	O
us	O
till	O
the	O
6th	O
of	O
June	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
not	O
seeing	O
anything	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
conceiving	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
impossible	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
have	O
kept	O
the	O
seas	O
so	O
long	O
,	O
they	O
quitted	O
their	O
cruise	O
and	O
returned	O
to	O
Callao	PNM
,	O
fully	O
persuaded	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
either	O
perished	O
,	O
or	O
at	O

had	O
been	O
driven	O
back	O

Now	O

as	O
the	O
time	O
of	O

a	O
few	O
days	O
before	O
our	O
arrival	O
at	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Fernandes	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
evident	O
that	O
had	O
we	O
made	O
that	O
island	O
on	O
our	O
first	O
search	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
without	O
haling	O
in	O
for	O
the	O
main	O
to	O

our	O
easting	O
-LRB-	O
a	O
circumstance	O
which	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
we	O
considered	O
-LCB-	O
158	O
-RCB-	O
as	O
very	O
unfortunate	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
numbers	O
which	O
we	O
lost	O
by	O
our	O
longer	O
continuance	O
at	O
sea	O
-RRB-	O
--	O
had	O
we	O
,	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
made	O
the	O
island	O
on	O
the	O
28th	O
of	O
May	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
first	O
expected	O
to	O
see	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
in	O
reality	O
very	O
near	O
it	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
doubtless	O
fallen	O
in	O
with	O
some	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
Spanish	O
squadron	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
distressed	O
condition	O
we	O
were	O
then	O
in	O
,	O
the	O
meeting	O
with	O
a	O
healthy	O
,	O
well-provided	O
enemy	O
was	O
an	O
incident	O
that	O
could	O
not	O
but	O
have	O
been	O
perplexing	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
perhaps	O
have	O
proved	O
fatal	O
,	O
not	O
only	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
the	O
_	O
Tryal	O
_	O
,	O
the	O
_	O
Gloucester	O
_	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
_	O
Anna	O
_	O
pink	O
,	O
who	O
separately	O
joined	O
us	O

and	O
who	O
were	O
each	O
of	O
them	O
less	O
capable	O
than	O
we	O
were	O
of	O
making	O
any	O
considerable	O
resistance	O
.	O

I	O
shall	O
only	O
add	O
,	O
that	O
these	O
Spanish	O
ships	O
sent	O
out	O
to	O
intercept	O
us	O
had	O
been	O
greatly	O
shattered	O
by	O
a	O
storm	O
during	O
their	O
cruise	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
after	O
their	O
arrival	O
at	O
Callao	PNM
,	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
laid	O
up	O
.	O

And	O
our	O
prisoners	O
assured	O
us	O
that	O
whenever	O
intelligence	O
was	O
received	O
at	O
Lima	PNM
of	O
our	O
being	O
in	O
these	O
seas	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
at	O
least	O
two	O
months	O
before	O
this	O
armament	O
could	O
be	O
again	O
fitted	O
out	O
.	O

The	O
whole	O
of	O
this	O
intelligence	O
was	O
as	O
favourable	O
as	O
we	O
,	O
in	O
our	O
reduced	O
circumstances	O
,	O
could	O
wish	O
for	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
we	O
were	O
no	O
longer	O
at	O
a	O
loss	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
broken	O
jars	O
,	O
ashes	O
,	O
and	O
fishbones	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
observed	O
at	O
our	O
first	O
landing	O
at	O
Juan	PNM
Fernandes	PNM
,	O
these	O
things	O
being	O
doubtless	O
the	O
relicts	O
of	O
the	O
cruisers	O
stationed	O
off	O
that	O
port	O
.	O

Having	O
thus	O
satisfied	O
ourselves	O
in	O
the	O
material	O
articles	O
of	O
our	O
inquiry	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
gotten	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
prisoners	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
silver	O
,	O
we	O
,	O
at	O
eight	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
evening	O
,	O
made	O
sail	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
,	O
in	O
company	O
with	O
our	O
prize	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
six	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
discovered	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Fernandes	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
the	O
following	O
day	O
,	O
both	O
we	O
and	O
our	O
prize	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
.	O

And	O
here	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
omit	O
one	O
remarkable	O
incident	O
which	O
occurred	O
when	O
the	O
prize	O
and	O
her	O
crew	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
bay	O
where	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
squadron	O
lay	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
in	O
the	O
_	O
Carmelo	PNM
_	O
had	O
been	O
sufficiently	O
informed	O
of	O
the	O
distresses	O
we	O
had	O
gone	O
through	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
greatly	O
surprized	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
ever	O
surmounted	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
they	O
saw	O
the	O
_	O
Tryal	O
_	O
sloop	O
at	O
anchor	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
still	O
more	O
astonished	O
that	O
after	O
all	O

The	O

we	O

our	O

we	O

the	O

on	O
which	O
our	O

stood	O
directly	O

with	O

towards	O
the	O
two	O

We	O
soon	O
perceived	O
that	O
one	O

By	O
seven	O

were	O

that	O

upon	O

he	O
began	O
to	O
despair	O
of	O

her	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
though	O
alarmed	O
at	O
first	O
with	O
seeing	O
nothing	O
but	O
a	O
cloud	O
of	O
sail	O
in	O
pursuit	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
the	O

so	O
low	O

no	O

yet	O
knowing	O
the	O

of	O
their	O

and	O
finding	O
how	O
little	O
the	O
_	O
Tryal	O

neared	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
at	O
length	O
laid	O
aside	O
their	O
fears	O
,	O
and	O
recommending	O
themselves	O
to	O
the	O
blessed	O
Virgin	O
for	O
protection	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
think	O
themselves	O
secure	O
.	O

Indeed	O
their	O
success	O
was	O
very	O
near	O
doing	O
honour	O
to	O
their	O
Ave	O
Marias	O
,	O
for	O
,	O
altering	O
their	O
course	O
in	O
the	O
night	O

and	O
shutting	O
up	O
their	O
windows	O
to	O
prevent	O
any	O
of	O
their	O
lights	O
from	O
being	O
seen	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
some	O
chance	O
of	O
escaping	O
;	O
but	O
a	O
small	O
crevice	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
shutters	O
rendered	O
all	O
their	O

for	O
through	O
this	O
crevice	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
_	O
Tryal	O
_	O
perceived	O
a	O
light	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
chased	O
till	O
they	O
arrived	O
within	O
gunshot	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
Captain	O
Saunders	O
alarmed	O
them	O
unexpectedly	O
with	O
a	O
broadside	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
flattered	O
themselves	O
they	O
were	O
got	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
reach	O

However	O
,	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
after	O
they	O
still	O
kept	O
the	O
same	O
sail	O
abroad	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
observed	O
that	O
this	O
first	O
salute	O
had	O
made	O
any	O
impression	O
on	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
just	O
as	O
the	O
_	O
Tryal	O
_	O
was	O
preparing	O
to	O
repeat	O
her	O
broadside	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
crept	O
from	O
their	O
holes	O
,	O
lowered	O
their	O
sails	O
,	O
and	O
submitted	O
without	O
any	O
opposition	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
largest	O
merchantmen	O
employed	O
in	O
those	O
seas	O
,	O
being	O
about	O
six	O
hundred	O
tuns	O
burthen	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
called	O
the	O
_	O
Arranzazu	PNM
_	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
bound	O
from	O
Callao	PNM
to	O
Valparaiso	PNM
,	O
and	O
had	O
much	O
the	O
same	O
cargo	O
with	O
the	O
_	O
Carmelo	O
_	O
we	O
had	O
taken	O
before	O
,	O
except	O
that	O
her	O
silver	O
amounted	O
only	O
to	O
about	O
L5000	O
sterling	O
.	O

But	O
to	O
balance	O
this	O
success	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
misfortune	O
to	O
find	O
that	O
the	O
_	O
Tryal	O
_	O
had	O
sprung	O
her	O
main-mast	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
her	O
main	O
top-mast	O
had	O
come	O
by	O
the	O
board	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
standing	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
fresh	O
gale	O
at	O
south	O
,	O
she	O
had	O
the	O
additional	O
ill-luck	O
to	O
spring	O
her	O
fore-mast	O
:	O
so	O
that	O
now	O
she	O
had	O
not	O
a	O
mast	O
left	O
on	O
which	O
she	O
could	O
carry	O
sail	O

These	O
unhappy	O
incidents	O
were	O
still	O
aggravated	O
by	O
the	O
impossibility	O

were	O
just	O
then	O
under	O
of	O
assisting	O
her	O
;	O
for	O
the	O

that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
venture	O
to	O

out	O
our	O

,	O
and	O
consequently	O
could	O
have	O
no	O
communication	O
with	O
her	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
lie	O
to	O
for	O
the	O
greatest	O
part	O
of	O
-LCB-	O
162	O

forty-eight	O
hours	O
to	O
attend	O
her	O

as	O
we	O
could	O
have	O
no	O
thought	O
of	O
leaving	O
her	O
to	O
herself	O
in	O
her	O
present	O
unhappy	O
situation	O

It	O
was	O
no	O
small	O
accumulation	O
to	O
these	O

that	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
the	O
while	O

at	O
the	O
very	O
time	O
too	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
by	O
our	O
intelligence	O

we	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
expect	O
several	O
of	O

The	O

was	O
so	O
very	O

in	O

that	O
even	O
in	O

weather	O
it	O
was	O
necessary	O
to	O
ply	O
the	O

constantly	O

and	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
then	O
scarcely	O
sufficient	O
to	O
keep	O
her	O

so	O
that	O
in	O
the	O

though	O

engaged	O
at	O

if	O

they	O

the	O

was	O
an	O
undertaking	O
that	O
in	O
the	O

conjuncture	O
greatly	O
exceeded	O
our	O
power	O

we	O
had	O
no	O

was	O
under	O

When	O

Mr.	O

The	O

And	O
now	O
by	O
this	O
distribution	O
of	O
our	O

we	O
flattered	O
ourselves	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
taken	O
all	O
the	O
advantages	O
of	O
the	O
enemy	O
that	O
we	O
possibly	O
could	O
with	O
our	O

since	O
our	O
disposition	O
was	O
doubtless	O
the	O
most	O
prudent	O
that	O
could	O

For	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
might	O
suppose	O
the	O
_	O

by	O
this	O
time	O
to	O

betwixt	O

since	O
the	O
principal	O

would	O

in	O
all	O
probability	O

meet	O
with	O
them	O

as	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
constant	O
practice	O
of	O
those	O

to	O
fall	O
in	O
with	O
the	O
coast	O
to	O
the	O

The	O

in	O

be	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
of	O

to	O

the	O

she	O
was	O
stationed	O
is	O
constantly	O
made	O
by	O
every	O

And	O
whilst	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
and	O
_	O
Gloucester	O
_	O
were	O
thus	O
situated	O
for	O

the	O
_	O
Tryal	O

_	O
prize	O
and	O
_	O

were	O

for	O
preventing	O
all	O

by	O
intercepting	O
all	O

for	O
it	O

on	O

it	O

But	O
the	O
most	O
prudent	O
dispositions	O
carry	O
with	O
them	O
only	O
a	O
probability	O
of	O
success	O
,	O
and	O
can	O
never	O
ensure	O
its	O

since	O
those	O

which	O
it	O

in	O

are	O
sometimes	O
of	O
most	O

in	O

Thus	O
in	O
the	O
present	O
case	O
,	O
the	O
distress	O
of	O
the	O

_	O

and	O
our	O
quitting	O

no	O
degree	O
of	O
prudence	O
could	O
either	O
foresee	O

obviate	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
gave	O
an	O
opportunity	O
to	O
all	O
the	O

Valparaiso	PNM
to	O
reach	O
that	O

So	O
that	O

were	O
very	O

we	O

the	O
29th	O
at	O
noon	O

yet	O
in	O
plying	O
on	O
and	O
off	O
till	O
the	O
6th	O
of	O
October	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
the	O

by	O
a	O
longer	O
stay	O

we	O

though	O
we	O
continued	O
there	O
four	O

We	O
supposed	O
that	O
some	O
chace	O
had	O
occasioned	O
their	O
leaving	O
their	O
station	O

and	O
therefore	O
we	O
proceeded	O
down	O
the	O

to	O
the	O

which	O
was	O
the	O

where	O
Captain	O

was	O

to	O

Here	O
we	O
got	O
on	O
the	O
21st	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
in	O
great	O
expectation	O
of	O
falling	O
in	O
with	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
enemy	O

as	O
both	O
the	O
accounts	O
of	O
former	O
voyages	O
and	O
the	O
information	O
of	O
our	O
prisoners	O
assured	O
us	O
that	O
all	O
ships	O
bound	O
to	O
Callao	PNM
constantly	O
make	O
this	O
land	O
,	O
to	O
prevent	O
the	O
danger	O
of	O

to	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
port	O

But	O
notwithstanding	O
the	O
advantages	O
of	O
this	O
station	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
no	O
sail	O
till	O
the	O
2d	O
of	O
November	O
,	O
when	O
two	O
ships	O
appeared	O
in	O
sight	O

;	O
we	O

As	O

the	O

we	O
brought	O

up	O

when	O
Captain	O

came	O
on	O

acquainted	O
the	O

that	O
he	O
had	O
cleared	O
the	O

pursuant	O
to	O
his	O

having	O
scuttled	O

remained	O
by	O
her	O

that	O

the	O
4th	O

neither	O

her	O

rolled	O

that	O
it	O

The	O
little	O
success	O
we	O
all	O
had	O

and	O
our	O
certainty	O
that	O
had	O
any	O

been	O
stirring	O
in	O
these	O

for	O
some	O
time	O
past	O
we	O
must	O

made	O
us	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O
enemy	O
at	O
Valparaiso	PNM
,	O
on	O
the	O
missing	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
ships	O

had	O
taken	O

had	O
suspected	O
us	O
to	O

in	O

consequently	O
laid	O
an	O
embargo	O
on	O
all	O
the	O

in	O
the	O

We	O
likewise	O
apprehended	O

by	O

for	O

from	O

fifty	O

taken	O
our	O

These	O
apprehensions	O
of	O
an	O
embargo	O
along	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
equipment	O
of	O
the	O

at	O

the	O

to	O

,	O
and	O

a	O

if	O

With	O
this	O

the	O

under	O
the	O

we	O

an	O

we	O
had	O
the	O
satisfaction	O
so	O
long	O
wished	O
for	O

of	O
seeing	O
a	O
sail	O

She	O
first	O
appeared	O
to	O

and	O
we	O
all	O
immediately	O
gave	O
her	O
chace	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
so	O
much	O
outsailed	O
the	O
two	O

that	O
we	O
soon	O
ran	O
them	O
out	O
of	O

and	O
gained	O
considerably	O
on	O
the	O
chace	O

However	O
,	O
night	O
coming	O
on	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
up	O
with	O
her	O
,	O
we	O
,	O
about	O
seven	O
o'clock	O
,	O
lost	O
sight	O
of	O
her	O

and	O
were	O
in	O
some	O
perplexity	O
what	O
course	O
to	O
steer	O
;	O
but	O
at	O
last	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
resolved	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
then	O
before	O
the	O
wind	O
,	O
to	O
keep	O
all	O
his	O
sails	O
set	O

and	O
not	O
to	O
change	O
his	O
course	O
:	O
for	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
doubt	O
but	O
the	O
chace	O
would	O
alter	O
her	O
course	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
yet	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
uncertain	O
what	O
tack	O
she	O
would	O
go	O
upon	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
thought	O
prudent	O
to	O
keep	O
on	O
our	O
course	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
must	O
by	O
this	O
means	O
unavoidably	O
come	O
near	O
her	O
,	O
rather	O
than	O
to	O
change	O
it	O
on	O
conjecture	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
should	O
mistake	O
,	O
we	O
must	O
infallibly	O
lose	O
her	O

Thus	O
then	O
we	O
continued	O
the	O
chace	O
about	O
an	O

at	O

Mr.	O

stood	O
for	O

and	O
in	O

She	O
was	O

The	O

It	O
is	O
true	O
her	O
cargoe	O
was	O
of	O
great	O
value	O
,	O
could	O
we	O
have	O
disposed	O
of	O
it	O
:	O
but	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
having	O
strict	O
orders	O
never	O
to	O
ransom	O
their	O

all	O
the	O

were	O
of	O

to	O

Indeed	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
could	O
make	O
no	O
profit	O
thereby	O
ourselves	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
some	O
satisfaction	O
to	O
us	O
to	O
consider	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
much	O
really	O
lost	O
to	O
the	O
enemy	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
despoiling	O
them	O
was	O
no	O
contemptible	O
branch	O
of	O
that	O
service	O
in	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
employed	O
by	O
our	O
country	O

Besides	O
our	O
prize	O

which	O
amounted	O
to	O
forty-five	O

there	O
were	O
on	O

ten	O
passengers	O

consisting	O
of	O

who	O
were	O
natives	O

together	O
with	O
three	O

about	O
twenty-one	O

the	O

about	O
fourteen	O

It	O
is	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
wondered	O
at	O
that	O
women	O
of	O
these	O
years	O
should	O
be	O
excessively	O
alarmed	O
at	O
the	O
falling	O
into	O
the	O

from	O
the	O
former	O
outrages	O
of	O
the	O
buccaneers	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
artful	O
insinuations	O
of	O
their	O
priests	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
taught	O
to	O
consider	O
as	O
the	O
most	O
terrible	O
and	O
brutal	O
of	O
all	O
mankind	O
.	O

These	O
apprehensions	O
too	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
present	O
instance	O
exaggerated	O
by	O
the	O
singular	O
beauty	O
of	O
the	O
youngest	O
of	O
the	O
women	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
riotous	O
disposition	O
which	O
they	O
might	O
well	O
expect	O
to	O
find	O
in	O
a	O
set	O
of	O
sailors	O
who	O
had	O
not	O
seen	O
a	O

near	O
a	O
twelvemonth	O

Full	O
of	O
these	O
terrors	O

the	O

all	O
hid	O
themselves	O
upon	O
our	O

coming	O
on	O

and	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
found	O
out	O

it	O
was	O
with	O
great	O
difficulty	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
persuade	O
them	O
to	O
approach	O
the	O
light	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
he	O
soon	O
satisfied	O
them	O

by	O
the	O

As	O
we	O
stood	O
from	O

nothing	O

it	O

any	O

could	O
escape	O
us	O

In	O
our	O
run	O
along	O
this	O
coast	O
we	O
generally	O
observed	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O

which	O
set	O

And	O
now	O
,	O
being	O
in	O
about	O
eight	O

we	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
attended	O
with	O
vast	O
numbers	O
of	O
flying	O

which	O
were	O
the	O
first	O
we	O
saw	O
after	O
our	O
departure	O
from	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Brazil	PNM

But	O
it	O
is	O
remarkable	O
that	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
of	O
South	PNM
America	PNM
they	O
extended	O
to	O
a	O
much	O
higher	O

than	O
they	O
do	O
on	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
lose	O
them	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Brazil	PNM
till	O
we	O
approached	O
the	O
southern	O
tropic	O
.	O

The	O
reason	O
for	O
this	O
diversity	O
is	O
doubtless	O
the	O
different	O
degrees	O
of	O
heat	O
obtaining	O
in	O
the	O

latitude	O
on	O
different	O
sides	O
of	O

continent	O

And	O
on	O
this	O
occasion	O
,	O
I	O
must	O
beg	O
leave	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
short	O
digression	O
on	O
the	O
heat	O
and	O
cold	O
of	O
different	O
climates	O

on	O
the	O

occur	O
in	O
the	O

The	O
ancients	O
conceived	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
five	O
zones	O
into	O
which	O
they	O
divided	O
the	O
surface	O
of	O
the	O
globe	O

two	O
only	O
were	O
habitable	O

supposing	O
that	O
the	O

between	O
the	O

and	O
the	O
cold	O
within	O
the	O
polar	O

,	O
were	O
too	O
intense	O
to	O
be	O
supported	O
by	O
mankind	O

The	O
falsehood	O
of	O
this	O
reasoning	O
has	O
been	O
long	O
evinced	O
;	O

the	O
particular	O
comparisons	O
of	O
the	O

of	O
these	O

has	O
as	O

However	O
,	O
enough	O
is	O
known	O
safely	O
to	O
determine	O
this	O
position	O

that	O
all	O

far	O
from	O

as	O
many	O
of	O
those	O

are	O
far	O
from	O
enduring	O
that	O
extreme	O
degree	O
of	O
cold	O
to	O
which	O
their	O
situation	O
should	O
seem	O
to	O
subject	O
them	O
:	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
temperature	O
of	O

depends	O
much	O
more	O
upon	O

or	O
its	O

to	O
the	O

This	O
proposition	O

to	O
the	O
general	O
temperature	O
of	O
places	O
,	O
taking	O
the	O
whole	O

in	O
this	O

it	O

that	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
London	PNM

for	O

enjoys	O
much	O
warmer	O

but	O
where	O
the	O
severity	O
of	O
the	O

so	O

that	O

as	O

for	O

,	O
betwixt	O

the	O

will	O

;	O

the	O

The	O

I	O
am	O
now	O
only	O
solicitous	O
to	O
establish	O
the	O
truth	O
of	O
this	O
assertion	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
a	O
place	O
alone	O
is	O
no	O
rule	O
whereby	O
to	O
judge	O
of	O
the	O
degree	O
of	O
heat	O
and	O
cold	O
which	O
obtains	O
there	O
.	O

Perhaps	O
this	O
position	O
might	O
be	O
more	O
briefly	O
confirmed	O
by	O
observing	O

that	O
on	O

the	O

a	O
criterion	O

what	O

place	O
in	O
many	O
parts	O

I	O
have	O
hitherto	O
considered	O
the	O
temperature	O
of	O
the	O

all	O
the	O

the	O

yet	O
with	O
respect	O
to	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
most	O
considerable	O
capture	O
we	O
made	O
in	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O

for	O
it	O
amounted	O
to	O
upwards	O

400,000	O

This	O
ship	O
was	O
bound	O
to	O
Callao	PNM

and	O
had	O
stopped	O
at	O
Paita	PNM
in	O
her	O
passage	O

I	O
have	O
mentioned	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Brett	O
had	O
received	O
some	O
important	O
intelligence	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
let	O
the	O

know	O
immediately	O

The	O
first	O
person	O
he	O
learnt	O
it	O
from	O
-LRB-	O
though	O
upon	O
further	O
examination	O
it	O
was	O
confirmed	O
by	O
the	O
other	O
prisoners	O
-RRB-	O
was	O
one	O
John	O
Williams	O
,	O
an	O
Irishman	O
,	O
whom	O
he	O
found	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
Spanish	O
vessel	O
.	O

Williams	O
was	O
a	O
Papist	O
,	O
who	O
worked	O
his	O
passage	O
from	O
Cadiz	PNM
,	O
and	O
had	O
travelled	O
over	O
all	O
the	O
kingdom	O
of	O
Mexico	PNM
as	O
a	O
pedlar	O
.	O

He	O
pretended	O
that	O
by	O
this	O
business	O
he	O
had	O
once	O
got	O
4000	O
or	O
5000	O
dollars	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
embarrassed	O
by	O
the	O
priests	O
,	O
who	O
knew	O
he	O
had	O
money	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
at	O

stript	O
of	O
everything	O
he	O
had	O

He	O
was	O
indeed	O
at	O

all	O
in	O
rags	O

being	O
but	O
just	O
got	O
out	O
of	O
Paita	PNM
gaol	O
,	O
where	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
confined	O
for	O
some	O

;	O
he	O
expressed	O
great	O
joy	O
upon	O
seeing	O
his	O
countrymen	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
,	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
before	O
,	O
a	O
vessel	O
came	O
into	O
Paita	PNM
,	O
where	O
the	O
master	O
of	O
her	O
informed	O
the	O
governor	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
chased	O
in	O
the	O
offing	O
by	O
a	O
very	O
large	O

which	O
,	O
from	O
her	O
size	O
and	O
the	O

,	O
he	O
was	O
persuaded	O
must	O
be	O

The	O
governor	O
,	O
upon	O
examining	O
the	O
master	O
,	O
was	O
fully	O
satisfied	O
of	O
his	O
relation	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
sent	O
away	O
an	O

to	O
Lima	PNM
to	O
acquaint	O
the	O
viceroy	O
therewith	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
royal	O
officer	O
residing	O
at	O
Paita	PNM
,	O
apprehensive	O
of	O
a	O
visit	O
from	O
the	O
English	O

had	O
,	O
from	O
his	O
first	O

of	O
this	O

We	O
further	O
learnt	O
from	O
our	O
prisoners	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
considerable	O
sum	O
of	O
money	O
belonging	O
to	O
some	O
merchants	O
of	O
Lima	PNM
that	O
was	O
now	O
lodged	O
in	O
the	O
custom-house	O
-LCB-	O

-RCB-	O
at	O
Paita	PNM
,	O
and	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
intended	O
to	O
be	O
shipped	O
on	O
board	O
a	O
vessel	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
then	O
in	O
the	O
port	O
of	O
Paita	PNM
,	O
and	O
was	O
preparing	O
to	O
sail	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
expedition	O
,	O
being	O
bound	O
for	O
the	O
bay	PNM
of	PNM
Sonsonnate	PNM
,	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Mexico	PNM

in	O

to	O
purchase	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
Manila	PNM

As	O
the	O
vessel	O
on	O
which	O
the	O
money	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
shipped	O
was	O
esteemed	O
a	O
prime	O
sailor	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
just	O
received	O
a	O
new	O
coat	O
of	O
tallow	O
on	O
her	O
bottom	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
opinion	O
of	O
the	O
prisoners	O
,	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
sail	O
the	O
succeeding	O
morning	O
,	O
the	O
character	O
they	O
gave	O
of	O
her	O
left	O
us	O
little	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
our	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
the	O
water	O
near	O
two	O
years	O
,	O
could	O
have	O
any	O
chance	O
of	O
coming	O
up	O
with	O
her	O
if	O
we	O
once	O
suffered	O
her	O
to	O
escape	O
out	O
of	O
the	O

Therefore	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
discovered	O

be	O

It	O
appears	O
that	O
the	O

so	O
that	O
its	O
sole	O
protection	O

is	O

It	O
was	O
of	O
consequence	O
to	O
us	O
to	O
be	O
well	O
informed	O
of	O
the	O
fabrick	O
and	O
strength	O
of	O
this	O
fort	O
;	O
and	O
from	O
the	O
examination	O
of	O
our	O
prisoners	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
eight	O
pieces	O
of	O
cannon	O
mounted	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
it	O
had	O
neither	O
ditch	O
nor	O
outwork	O

being	O
surrounded	O
by	O
a	O

and	O
that	O
the	O
garrison	O
consisted	O
of	O
only	O
one	O
weak	O
company	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
town	O
itself	O
might	O
possibly	O
arm	O
three	O

Mr.	O
Anson	O
having	O
informed	O
himself	O
of	O
the	O
strength	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
resolved	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
hath	O
been	O
said	O
in	O
the	O
preceding	O
chapter	O
-RRB-	O
to	O
attempt	O
it	O
that	O
very	O
night	O

We	O
were	O
then	O
about	O
twelve	O
leagues	O
distant	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
far	O
enough	O
to	O
prevent	O
our	O
being	O
discovered	O
,	O
yet	O
not	O
so	O
far	O
but	O
that	O
by	O
making	O
all	O
the	O
sail	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
arrive	O
in	O
the	O
bay	O
with	O
our	O
ships	O
long	O
before	O
daybreak	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
commodore	O
prudently	O
considered	O
that	O
this	O
would	O
be	O
an	O
improper	O
method	O
of	O
proceeding	O
,	O
as	O
our	O
ships	O
,	O
being	O
such	O
large	O
bodies	O
,	O
might	O
be	O
easily	O
seen	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
even	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
thereby	O
alarm	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
and	O
give	O
them	O
an	O
opportunity	O
of	O
removing	O
their	O
valuable	O
effects	O
.	O

He	O
therefore	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
strength	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
did	O
not	O
require	O
our	O
whole	O
force	O

it	O

our	O

behaviour	O
on	O
this	O
occasion	O
,	O
the	O
commodore	O
took	O
care	O
to	O
assure	O
our	O

that	O
they	O
should	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
be	O
released	O

set	O
on	O

at	O
this	O

provided	O
the	O

acted	O
faithfully	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
case	O
of	O
any	O
misconduct	O
or	O

,	O
he	O
threatened	O
that	O

that	O

would	O

the	O

who	O
were	O
on	O

So	O
that	O
the	O
prisoners	O
themselves	O
were	O
interested	O
in	O
our	O
success	O

and	O
therefore	O
we	O

On	O
this	O
occasion	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
but	O
remark	O
a	O
singular	O
circumstance	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
pilots	O
employed	O
by	O
us	O
in	O
this	O
business	O
.	O

It	O
seems	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
we	O
afterwards	O
learnt	O
-RRB-	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
taken	O
by	O
Captain	O
Clipperton	O
above	O
twenty	O
years	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
been	O
obliged	O
to	O
lead	O
Clipperton	O
and	O
his	O
people	O
to	O
the	O
surprize	O
of	O
Truxillo	PNM
,	O
a	O
town	O
within	O
land	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
of	O
Paita	PNM
,	O
where	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
he	O
contrived	O
to	O
alarm	O
his	O
countrymen	O
and	O
to	O
save	O
them	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
place	O
was	O
carried	O
and	O
pillaged	O

Now	O
that	O
the	O
only	O
two	O
attempts	O
on	O

which	O
were	O
made	O
at	O
so	O
long	O
an	O
interval	O
from	O

be	O

he	O
too	O

,	O
and	O
forced	O
upon	O
the	O
employ	O
contrary	O
to	O
his	O
inclination	O
,	O
is	O
an	O
incident	O
so	O
very	O
extraordinary	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
help	O
mentioning	O
it	O

But	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
the	O
matter	O
in	O

During	O
our	O
preparations	O
,	O
the	O

themselves	O
stood	O
towards	O
the	O

with	O
all	O
the	O

But	O
about	O

some	O

Lieutenant	O

,	O
on	O
this	O

encouraged	O
his	O

to	O
pull	O

up	O

that	O

the	O

reach	O
the	O

the	O

in	O

and	O
pointed	O
them	O
towards	O
the	O

and	O
though	O
in	O
the	O

it	O
might	O
be	O

,	O
whistling	O
just	O
over	O
the	O

This	O
made	O
our	O

redouble	O
their	O
efforts	O

so	O
that	O
they	O

contrary	O

without	O

Lieutenant	O

when	O

thus	O

and	O
another	O
at	O
the	O
governor	O

appointed	O
centinels	O
at	O
all	O
the	O

of	O

both	O
to	O
prevent	O
any	O

and	O
to	O
secure	O
the	O

in	O
the	O
place	O
from	O
being	O
embezzled	O
.	O

This	O
being	O
done	O
,	O
his	O
next	O
care	O
was	O
to	O
seize	O
on	O
the	O
custom-house	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
treasure	O
lay	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
examine	O
if	O
any	O
of	O
the	O

remained	O
in	O
the	O
town	O

that	O
he	O
might	O
know	O
what	O
further	O
precautions	O
it	O
was	O
necessary	O
to	O
take	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
soon	O
found	O
that	O
the	O

were	O
no	O
ways	O
formidable	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
greatest	O
part	O
of	O
them	O
-LRB-	O
being	O
in	O
bed	O
when	O
the	O
place	O
was	O
surprized	O

had	O
run	O
away	O
with	O
so	O

that	O
they	O
had	O
not	O
given	O
themselves	O

to	O

on	O
their	O

In	O
this	O
general	O
rout	O
the	O
governor	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
last	O
to	O
secure	O
himself	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
fled	O
betimes	O
half	O
naked	O
,	O
leaving	O
his	O
wife	O

a	O
young	O
lady	O
of	O
about	O
seventeen	O
years	O
of	O
age	O

to	O
whom	O
he	O
had	O
been	O

but	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
days	O
,	O
behind	O
him	O
,	O
though	O
she	O
too	O
was	O
afterwards	O
carried	O
off	O
in	O
her	O
shift	O
by	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
centinels	O

just	O
as	O
the	O

ordered	O
to	O
invest	O
the	O

arrived	O
before	O
it	O

This	O
escape	O
of	O
the	O
governor	O
was	O
an	O
unpleasing	O
circumstance	O
,	O
as	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
had	O
particularly	O
recommended	O
it	O
to	O
Lieutenant	O
Brett	O
to	O
secure	O
his	O
person	O
if	O
possible	O

in	O
hopes	O
that	O
by	O
that	O

we	O
might	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
treat	O
for	O
the	O
ransom	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
:	O
but	O
it	O
seems	O
his	O
alertness	O
rendered	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
these	O
orders	O
impracticable	O
.	O

The	O
few	O
inhabitants	O
who	O
remained	O
were	O
confined	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
the	O

under	O
a	O
guard	O
,	O
except	O
some	O
stout	O

in	O
the	O
town	O
;	O
these	O

were	O
employed	O
the	O
remaining	O

the	O

to	O

the	O

that	O

The	O
transporting	O
the	O

the	O
principal	O

were	O
thus	O
busied	O
,	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
prevented	O
from	O
entering	O
the	O
houses	O
which	O
lay	O
near	O
them	O
in	O
search	O
of	O
private	O
pillage	O
:	O
where	O
the	O
first	O
things	O
which	O
occurred	O
to	O
them	O
being	O
the	O
cloaths	O
that	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
in	O
their	O
flight	O
had	O
left	O
behind	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
custom	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
were	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
either	O
embroidered	O
or	O
laced	O
,	O
our	O
people	O
eagerly	O
seized	O
these	O
glittering	O
habits	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
them	O
on	O
over	O
their	O
own	O
dirty	O
trowsers	O
and	O
jackets	O
,	O
not	O
forgetting	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
the	O
tye	O
or	O
bag-wig	O
and	O
laced	O
hat	O
which	O
were	O
generally	O
found	O
with	O
the	O
cloaths	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
this	O
practice	O
was	O
once	O
begun	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
preventing	O
the	O
whole	O
detachment	O
from	O
imitating	O
it	O
:	O
but	O
those	O
who	O
came	O
latest	O
into	O
the	O
fashion	O
not	O
finding	O
men	O
's	O
cloaths	O
sufficient	O
to	O
equip	O
themselves	O
,	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
take	O
up	O
with	O
women	O
's	O
gowns	O
and	O
petticoats	O
,	O
which	O
-LRB-	O
provided	O
there	O
was	O
finery	O
enough	O
-RRB-	O
they	O
made	O
no	O
scruple	O
of	O
putting	O
on	O
and	O
blending	O
with	O
their	O
own	O
greasy	O
dress	O
.	O

So	O
that	O
when	O
a	O
party	O
of	O
them	O
thus	O
ridiculously	O
metamorphosed	O
first	O
appeared	O
before	O
Mr.	O
Brett	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
extremely	O
surprized	O
at	O
the	O
grotesque	O
sight	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
not	O
immediately	O
be	O
satisfied	O
they	O
were	O
his	O
own	O
people	O
.	O

These	O
were	O
the	O
transactions	O
of	O
our	O
detachment	O
on	O
shore	O
at	O
Paita	PNM
the	O
first	O
night	O
:	O
but	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
what	O
was	O
done	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
in	O
that	O
interval	O
.	O

I	O
must	O
observe	O
that	O
after	O
the	O
boats	O
were	O
gone	O
off	O
,	O
we	O
lay	O
by	O
till	O
one	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
supposing	O
our	O
detachment	O
to	O
be	O
near	O
landing	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
an	O
easy	O
sail	O
for	O
the	O
bay	O
.	O

About	O
seven	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
open	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
after	O
had	O
a	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
town	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
reason	O
to	O
doubt	O
of	O
the	O
success	O
of	O
the	O
enterprize	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
was	O
with	O
great	O
joy	O
that	O
we	O
first	O
discovered	O
an	O
infallible	O
signal	O
of	O
the	O
certainty	O
of	O
our	O
hopes	O
;	O
this	O
was	O
by	O
means	O
of	O
our	O
perspectives	O
,	O
for	O
through	O
them	O
we	O
saw	O
an	O
English	O
flag	O
hoisted	O
on	O
the	O
flagstaff	O
of	O
the	O
fort	O
,	O
which	O
to	O
us	O
was	O
an	O
incontestable	O
proof	O
that	O
our	O
people	O
were	O
in	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
.	O

We	O
plied	O
into	O
the	O
bay	O
with	O
as	O
much	O
expedition	O
as	O
the	O
wind	O
,	O
which	O
then	O
blew	O
off	O
shore	O
,	O
would	O
permit	O
us	O
:	O
and	O
at	O
eleven	O
the	O
_	O
Tryal	O
's	O
_	O
boat	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
us	O
,	O
loaden	O
with	O
dollars	O
and	O
church-plate	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
officer	O
who	O
commanded	O
her	O
informed	O
us	O
of	O
the	O
preceding	O
night	O
's	O
transactions	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
we	O
have	O
already	O
related	O
them	O
.	O

About	O
two	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
we	O
anchored	O
in	O
ten	O
fathom	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
,	O
at	O
a	O
mile	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
distance	O
from	O
-LCB-	O
183	O
-RCB-	O
the	O
town	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
consequently	O
near	O
enough	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
more	O
immediate	O
intercourse	O
with	O
those	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Brett	O
had	O
hitherto	O
gone	O
on	O
in	O
collecting	O
and	O
removing	O
the	O
treasure	O
without	O
interruption	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
enemy	O
had	O
rendezvouzed	O
from	O
all	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
on	O
a	O
hill	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
back	O
of	O
the	O
town	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
made	O
no	O
inconsiderable	O
appearance	O
:	O
for	O
amongst	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
their	O
force	O
there	O
were	O
two	O
hundred	O
horse	O
,	O
seemingly	O
very	O
well	O
armed	O
and	O
mounted	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
conceived	O
,	O
properly	O
trained	O
and	O
regimented	O
,	O
being	O
furnished	O
with	O
trumpets	O
,	O
drums	O
,	O
and	O
standards	O
.	O

These	O
troops	O
paraded	O
about	O
the	O
hill	O
with	O
great	O
ostentation	O
,	O
sounding	O
their	O
military	O
musick	O
,	O
and	O
practising	O
every	O
art	O
to	O
intimidate	O
us	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
our	O
numbers	O
on	O
shore	O
were	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
not	O
unknown	O
to	O
them	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
in	O
hopes	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
be	O
induced	O
by	O
our	O
fears	O
to	O
abandon	O
the	O
place	O
before	O
the	O
pillage	O
was	O
compleated	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
so	O
ignorant	O
as	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
this	O
body	O
of	O
horse	O
,	O
which	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
what	O
the	O
enemy	O
principally	O
depended	O
on	O
,	O
would	O
dare	O
to	O
venture	O
in	O
streets	O
and	O
amongst	O
houses	O
,	O
even	O
had	O
their	O
numbers	O
been	O
three	O
times	O
as	O
large	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
their	O
menaces	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
calmly	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
the	O
daylight	O
lasted	O
,	O
in	O
sending	O
off	O
the	O
treasure	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
employing	O
the	O
boats	O
to	O
carry	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
refreshments	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
hogs	O
,	O
fowls	O
,	O
etc.	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
here	O
in	O
great	O
abundance	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
at	O
night	O
,	O
to	O
prevent	O
any	O
surprize	O
,	O
the	O
commodore	O
sent	O
on	O
shore	O
a	O
reinforcement	O
,	O
who	O
posted	O
themselves	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
passages	O
leading	O
to	O
the	O
parade	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
for	O
their	O
further	O
security	O
,	O
traversed	O
the	O
streets	O
with	O
barricadoes	O
six	O
feet	O
high	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
enemy	O
continuing	O
quiet	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
we	O
,	O
at	O
daybreak	O
,	O
returned	O
again	O
to	O
our	O
labour	O
of	O
loading	O
the	O
boats	O
,	O
and	O
sending	O
them	O
off	O
.	O

By	O
this	O
time	O
we	O
were	O
convinced	O
of	O
what	O
consequence	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
to	O
us	O
had	O
fortune	O
seconded	O
the	O
prudent	O
views	O
of	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
by	O
permitting	O
us	O
to	O
have	O
secured	O
the	O
governor	O
.	O

For	O
as	O
we	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
place	O
many	O
storehouses	O
full	O
of	O
valuable	O
effects	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
useless	O
to	O
us	O
at	O
present	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
find	O
room	O
for	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
had	O
the	O
governor	O
been	O
in	O
our	O
power	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
in	O
all	O
probability	O
have	O
treated	O
for	O
the	O
ransom	O
of	O
this	O
merchandise	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
extremely	O
advantageous	O
both	O
to	O
him	O
and	O
us	O
;	O
whereas	O
,	O
he	O
being	O
now	O
at	O
liberty	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
collected	O
all	O
the	O
force	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
for	O
many	O
leagues	O
round	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
even	O
got	O
a	O
body	O
of	O
militia	O
from	O
Piura	PNM
,	O
which	O
was	O
-LCB-	O
184	O
-RCB-	O
fourteen	O
leagues	O
distant	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
so	O
elated	O
with	O
his	O
numbers	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
fond	O
of	O
his	O
new	O
military	O
command	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
seemed	O
not	O
to	O
trouble	O
himself	O
about	O
the	O
fate	O
of	O
his	O
government	O
.	O

So	O
that	O
though	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
sent	O
several	O
messages	O
to	O
him	O
by	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
whom	O
he	O
had	O
taken	O
prisoners	O
,	O
offering	O
to	O
enter	O
into	O
a	O
treaty	O
for	O
the	O
ransom	O
of	O
the	O
town	O
and	O
goods	O
,	O
giving	O
him	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
an	O
intimation	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
far	O
from	O
insisting	O
on	O
a	O
rigorous	O
equivalent	O
,	O
but	O
perhaps	O
might	O
be	O
satisfied	O
with	O
some	O
live	O
cattle	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
few	O
necessaries	O
for	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
the	O
squadron	O
,	O
threatening	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
condescend	O
at	O
least	O
to	O
treat	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
set	O
fire	O
to	O
the	O
town	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
warehouses	O
.	O

Yet	O
the	O
governor	O
was	O
so	O
imprudent	O
and	O
arrogant	O
that	O
he	O
despised	O
all	O
these	O
reiterated	O
overtures	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
deign	O
even	O
to	O
return	O
the	O
least	O
answer	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
second	O
day	O
of	O
our	O
being	O
in	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
several	O
negro	O
slaves	O
deserted	O
from	O
the	O
enemy	O
on	O
the	O
hill	O
,	O
and	O
coming	O
into	O
the	O
town	O
,	O
voluntarily	O
engaged	O
in	O
our	O
service	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
these	O
was	O
well	O
known	O
to	O
a	O
gentleman	O
on	O
board	O
who	O
remembered	O
him	O
formerly	O
at	O
Panama	PNM
.	O

We	O
now	O
learnt	O
that	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
without	O
the	O
town	O
were	O
in	O
extreme	O
want	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
for	O
many	O
of	O
their	O
slaves	O
crept	O
into	O
the	O
place	O
by	O
stealth	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
away	O
several	O
jars	O
of	O
water	O
to	O
their	O
masters	O
on	O
the	O
hill	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
seized	O
by	O
our	O
men	O
in	O
the	O
attempt	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
thirst	O
among	O
the	O
enemy	O
was	O
so	O
pressing	O
that	O
they	O
continued	O
this	O
practice	O
till	O
we	O
left	O
the	O
place	O
.	O

On	O
this	O
second	O
day	O
we	O
were	O
assured	O
,	O
both	O
by	O
the	O
deserters	O
and	O
by	O
these	O
prisoners	O
we	O
took	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
on	O
the	O
hill	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
encreased	O
to	O
a	O

that	O

we	O

we	O
might	O

on	O
the	O

with	O
no	O

and	O
we	O
were	O
not	O

-RRB-	O
-LCB-	O

-RCB-	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
mere	O
ostentation	O

For	O

Mr.	O

When	O

at	O
their	O

were	O
ready	O
to	O

on	O

they	O
were	O
for	O
some	O

retarded	O
by	O
missing	O
one	O

and	O
being	O

on	O
their	O

amongst	O

to	O

he	O

resolved	O
to	O

to	O

But	O
when	O
the	O

was	O
actually	O
embarked	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
boats	O
were	O
just	O
putting	O
off	O

they	O
heard	O
him	O
calling	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
take	O
him	O
in	O

The	O
place	O
was	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
so	O
thoroughly	O
on	O
fire	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
smoke	O
covered	O
the	O
beach	O
so	O
effectually	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
scarcely	O
discern	O
him	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
heard	O
his	O
voice	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
lieutenant	O
instantly	O
ordered	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
boats	O
to	O
his	O
relief	O
,	O
who	O
found	O
him	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
chin	O
in	O
water	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
had	O
waded	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
he	O
durst	O
,	O
being	O
extremely	O
frightened	O
with	O
the	O
apprehensions	O
of	O
falling	O
into	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
an	O
enemy	O
,	O
enraged	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
doubtless	O
were	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
pillage	O
and	O
destruction	O
of	O
their	O
town	O

On	O
enquiring	O
into	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
his	O
staying	O
behind	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
found	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
taken	O
that	O
morning	O
too	O
large	O
a	O
dose	O
of	O
brandy	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
thrown	O
him	O
into	O
so	O
sound	O
a	O
sleep	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
awake	O
till	O
the	O
fire	O
came	O
near	O
enough	O
to	O
scorch	O
him	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
strangely	O
amazed	O
at	O
first	O
opening	O
his	O
eyes	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
houses	O
all	O
in	O
a	O
blaze	O
on	O
one	O
side	O

and	O
several	O
Spaniards	O
and	O
Indians	O
not	O
far	O
from	O
him	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
.	O

The	O
greatness	O
and	O
suddenness	O
of	O
his	O
fright	O
instantly	O
reduced	O
him	O
to	O
a	O
state	O
of	O
sobriety	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
him	O
sufficient	O
presence	O
of	O
mind	O
to	O
push	O
through	O
the	O
thickest	O
of	O
the	O
smoke	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
likeliest	O
means	O
to	O
escape	O
the	O

,	O
and	O
making	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
his	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
he	O
ran	O
as	O
far	O
into	O

I	O

observe	O
here	O

to	O
the	O
honour	O
of	O
our	O
people	O

that	O
though	O
there	O
were	O
great	O
quantities	O
of	O

in	O

their	O

from	O

and	O
though	O
part	O
of	O
this	O

must	O
doubtless	O
be	O
imputed	O
to	O
the	O
diligence	O
of	O
their	O

and	O
to	O
the	O
excellent	O

to	O
which	O

had	O
been	O
constantly	O
inured	O
on	O

yet	O
it	O
was	O
doubtless	O
no	O
small	O
reputation	O
to	O
the	O

that	O
they	O
should	O
generally	O
refrain	O
from	O

themselves	O
in	O
those	O

There	O
was	O
an	O

in	O

was	O
employed	O
by	O
them	O
at	O
the	O
port	O
of	O

it	O
being	O
well	O

amongst	O
the	O

who	O
were	O
retired	O

With	O
this	O

he	O
came	O
down	O

to	O
a	O

of	O

Our	O

had	O
a	O

but	O
being	O
deceived	O
by	O
the	O

he	O
was	O
so	O
imprudent	O
as	O
to	O

him	O

much	O
nearer	O

he	O
ought	O

so	O
that	O
the	O

watching	O
his	O

rushed	O
on	O
the	O

seizing	O
his	O

it	O
out	O

Mr.	O

But	O
notwithstanding	O
this	O
precaution	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
generally	O
observed	O
that	O
the	O
first	O

they	O
did	O
not	O
quit	O
their	O

so	O
that	O
it	O
was	O

CHAPTER	O
VII	O
FROM	O
OUR	O
DEPARTURE	O
FROM	O
PAITA	O
TO	O
OUR	O
ARRIVAL	O
AT	O
QUIBO	O
When	O
we	O
got	O
under	O
sail	O
from	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Paita	PNM
-LRB-	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
already	O
observed	O
,	O
was	O
about	O
midnight	O
on	O
the	O
16th	O
of	O
November	O
-RRB-	O
we	O
stood	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
the	O
commodore	O
gave	O
orders	O
that	O
the	O
whole	O
squadron	O
should	O
spread	O
themselves	O
to	O
look	O
out	O
for	O
the	O
_	O
Gloucester	O
_	O
.	O

For	O
we	O
then	O
drew	O
near	O
the	O
station	O
where	O
Captain	O
Mitchel	O
had	O
been	O
directed	O
to	O
cruise	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
hourly	O
expected	O
to	O
get	O
sight	O
of	O
him	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
whole	O
day	O
passed	O
without	O
seeing	O
him	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
a	O
jealousy	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
taken	O
its	O
rise	O
at	O
Paita	PNM
,	O
between	O
those	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
commanded	O
on	O
shore	O
for	O
the	O
attack	O
,	O
and	O
those	O
who	O
had	O
continued	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
grew	O
to	O
such	O
a	O
height	O
that	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
being	O
made	O
acquainted	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
thought	O
it	O
necessary	O
to	O
interpose	O
his	O
authority	O
to	O
appease	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
ground	O
of	O
this	O
animosity	O
was	O
the	O
plunder	O
gotten	O
at	O
Paita	PNM
,	O
which	O
those	O
who	O
had	O
acted	O
on	O
shore	O
had	O
appropriated	O
to	O
themselves	O
,	O
considering	O
it	O
as	O
a	O
reward	O
for	O
the	O
risques	O
they	O
had	O
run	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
resolution	O
they	O
had	O
shown	O
in	O
that	O
service	O
.	O

But	O
those	O
who	O
had	O
remained	O
on	O
board	O
looked	O
on	O
this	O
as	O
a	O
very	O
partial	O
and	O
unjust	O
procedure	O
,	O
urging	O
that	O
had	O
it	O
been	O
left	O
to	O
their	O
choice	O
,	O
they	O
should	O
have	O
preferred	O
the	O
action	O
on	O
shore	O
to	O
the	O
continuing	O
on	O
board	O
;	O
that	O
their	O
duty	O
,	O
while	O
their	O
comrades	O
were	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
was	O
extremely	O
fatiguing	O
;	O
for	O
besides	O
the	O
labour	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
constantly	O
under	O
arms	O
all	O
night	O
to	O
secure	O
the	O
prisoners	O
,	O
whose	O
numbers	O
exceeded	O
their	O
own	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
whom	O
it	O
was	O
then	O
necessary	O
to	O
be	O
extremely	O
watchful	O
,	O
to	O
prevent	O
any	O
attempts	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
formed	O
in	O
that	O
critical	O
conjuncture	O
:	O
that	O
upon	O
the	O
whole	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
denied	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
presence	O
of	O
a	O
sufficient	O
force	O
on	O
board	O
was	O
as	O
necessary	O
to	O
the	O
success	O
of	O
the	O
enterprize	O
as	O
the	O
action	O
of	O
the	O
others	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
those	O
who	O
had	O
continued	O
on	O
board	O
maintained	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
deprived	O
of	O
their	O
share	O
of	O
the	O
plunder	O
without	O
manifest	O
injustice	O
.	O

These	O
were	O
the	O
contests	O
amongst	O
our	O
-LCB-	O
194	O
-RCB-	O
men	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
carried	O
on	O
with	O
great	O
heat	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
:	O
and	O
though	O
the	O
plunder	O
in	O
question	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
trifle	O
in	O
comparison	O
of	O
the	O
treasure	O
taken	O
in	O
the	O
place	O
-LRB-	O
in	O
which	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
doubt	O
but	O
those	O
on	O
board	O
had	O
an	O
equal	O
right	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
yet	O
as	O
the	O
obstinacy	O
of	O
sailors	O
is	O
not	O
always	O
regulated	O
by	O
the	O
importance	O
of	O
the	O
matter	O
in	O
dispute	O
,	O
the	O
commodore	O
thought	O
it	O
necessary	O
to	O
put	O
a	O
stop	O
to	O
this	O
ferment	O
betimes	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
the	O
morning	O
after	O
our	O
leaving	O
Paita	O
,	O
he	O
ordered	O
all	O
hands	O
upon	O
the	O
quarter-deck	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
addressing	O
himself	O
to	O
those	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
detached	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
he	O
commended	O
their	O
behaviour	O
,	O
and	O
thanked	O
them	O
for	O
their	O
services	O
on	O
that	O
occasion	O
:	O
but	O
then	O
representing	O
to	O
them	O
the	O
reasons	O
urged	O
by	O
those	O
who	O
had	O
continued	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
for	O
an	O
equal	O
distribution	O
of	O
the	O
plunder	O
,	O
he	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
he	O
thought	O
these	O
reasons	O
very	O
conclusive	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
expectations	O
of	O
their	O
comrades	O
were	O
justly	O
founded	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
he	O
insisted	O
,	O
that	O
not	O
only	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
but	O
all	O
the	O
officers	O
likewise	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
employed	O
in	O
taking	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
should	O
produce	O
the	O
whole	O
of	O
their	O
plunder	O
immediately	O
upon	O
the	O
quarter-deck	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
impartially	O
divided	O
among	O
the	O
whole	O
crew	O
,	O
in	O
proportion	O
to	O
each	O
man	O
's	O
rank	O
and	O
commission	O
:	O
and	O
to	O
prevent	O
those	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
plunder	O
from	O
murmuring	O
at	O
this	O
diminution	O
of	O
their	O
share	O
,	O
the	O
commodore	O
added	O
,	O
that	O
as	O
an	O
encouragement	O
to	O
others	O
who	O
might	O
be	O
hereafter	O
employed	O
on	O
like	O
services	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
give	O
his	O
entire	O
share	O
to	O

amongst	O
those	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
detached	O
for	O
the	O

of	O

Thus	O
this	O
troublesome	O
affair	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
if	O
permitted	O
to	O
have	O
gone	O
on	O
,	O
might	O
perhaps	O
have	O
been	O
attended	O
with	O
mischievous	O
consequences	O
,	O
was	O
by	O
the	O
commodore	O
's	O
prudence	O
soon	O
appeased	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
general	O
satisfaction	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O

company	O
:	O
not	O
but	O
there	O
were	O
some	O
few	O
whose	O
selfish	O
dispositions	O
were	O
uninfluenced	O
by	O
the	O
justice	O
of	O
this	O
procedure	O

and	O
who	O
were	O
incapable	O
of	O
discerning	O
the	O
force	O
of	O

however	O
glaring	O
,	O
when	O
it	O
tended	O
to	O

of	O
any	O
part	O
of	O
what	O
they	O
had	O
once	O
got	O
into	O
their	O

This	O
important	O
business	O
employed	O
the	O
best	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
after	O
we	O
came	O
from	O
Paita	PNM

And	O
now	O
,	O
at	O
night	O
,	O
having	O
no	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
_	O
Gloucester	O
_	O
,	O
the	O
commodore	O
ordered	O
the	O

to	O
bring	O
to	O

that	O
we	O
might	O
not	O
pass	O
her	O
in	O
the	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
we	O
again	O
looked	O
out	O
for	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
ten	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O

which	O
we	O
gave	O

;	O
and	O
at	O
two	O
in	O
the	O

afternoon	O
we	O
came	O
near	O

with	O
a	O

About	O
an	O
hour	O
after	O
we	O
were	O
joined	O
by	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
learnt	O
that	O
Captain	O
Mitchel	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
whole	O
time	O
of	O
his	O
cruise	O
,	O
had	O
only	O
taken	O
two	O
prizes	O
;	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
being	O
a	O
small	O
snow	O
,	O
whose	O
cargoe	O
consisted	O
chiefly	O
of	O
wine	O
,	O
brandy	O
,	O
and	O
olives	O
in	O
jars	O
,	O
with	O
about	O
L7000	O
in	O
specie	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
a	O
large	O
boat	O
or	O
launch	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
_	O
Gloucester	O
's	O
_	O
barge	O
came	O
up	O
with	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

The	O
prisoners	O
on	O
board	O
this	O
last	O
vessel	O
alledged	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
poor	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
their	O
loading	O
consisted	O
only	O
of	O
cotton	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
circumstances	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
barge	O
surprized	O
them	O
seemed	O
to	O
insinuate	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
more	O
opulent	O
than	O
they	O
pretended	O
to	O
be	O
,	O
for	O
the	O

Gloucester	O

them	O
at	O

upon	O

However	O
,	O
the	O

the	O

opened	O
several	O
of	O

to	O
satisfy	O
his	O
curiosity	O

and	O
finding	O
nothing	O
in	O
them	O

cotton	O

he	O
was	O
inclined	O
to	O
believe	O
the	O
account	O
the	O
prisoners	O
gave	O
him	O
:	O
but	O
the	O
cargoe	O
being	O
taken	O
into	O
the	O
_	O
Gloucester	O
_	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
examined	O
more	O
strictly	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
agreeably	O
surprized	O
to	O
find	O
that	O
the	O
whole	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
extraordinary	O
piece	O
of	O
false	O
package	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
concealed	O
among	O
the	O
cotton	O

in	O
every	O

a	O
considerable	O
quantity	O
of	O

to	O
the	O

on	O
the	O

This	O

to	O
the	O

were	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
greatest	O
part	O
of	O
the	O

we	O
had	O
taken	O
there	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
had	O
this	O

escaped	O
the	O
_	O
Gloucester	O
_	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
probable	O
her	O
cargoe	O
would	O
have	O
fallen	O
into	O
our	O

Besides	O
these	O

prizes	O
which	O
we	O
have	O
mentioned	O

the	O
_	O
Gloucester	O

them	O

one	O

had	O
reason	O
to	O

from	O
some	O

was	O
of	O
immense	O

Being	O
now	O
joined	O
by	O
the	O

Gloucester	O
_	O
and	O
her	O
prize	O

it	O
was	O
resolved	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
stand	O

Indeed	O
the	O
commodore	O

when	O
at	O

For	O
when	O

this	O

by	O

a	O
prudent	O
plan	O
of	O
operations	O
with	O
our	O
commanders	O
in	O
the	O
West	O

,	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
taken	O
even	O
Panama	PNM
itself	O

which	O
would	O
have	O
given	O
to	O
the	O
British	O
nation	O
the	O
possession	O
of	O
that	O
isthmus	O

whereby	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
in	O
effect	O
masters	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
treasures	O
of	O
Peru	PNM

and	O
should	O
have	O
had	O
in	O
our	O
hands	O
an	O
equivalent	O
for	O
any	O

however	O
extraordinary	O

which	O
we	O
might	O

made	O
on	O
either	O
of	O
the	O
branches	O
of	O
the	O
House	O
of	O

Such	O
were	O
the	O
projects	O
which	O
the	O
commodore	O
revolved	O
in	O
his	O
thoughts	O
at	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Juan	PNM

,	O
notwithstanding	O
the	O
feeble	O
condition	O
to	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
then	O
reduced	O

And	O
indeed	O
,	O
had	O
the	O
success	O
of	O
our	O
force	O
in	O
the	O
West	O

been	O
answerable	O
to	O
the	O
general	O
expectation	O
,	O
it	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
denied	O
but	O
these	O
views	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
the	O
most	O
prudent	O
that	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
thought	O
of	O

But	O
in	O
examining	O
the	O
papers	O
which	O
were	O
found	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
_	O
Carmelo	PNM

learnt	O

though	O

omitted	O

mention	O
it	O
-RRB-	O
that	O
our	O
attempt	O
against	O

had	O
failed	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
probability	O
that	O
our	O

any	O

that	O

at	O

Mr.	O
Anson	O
therefore	O
gave	O
over	O
all	O
hopes	O
of	O
being	O
reinforced	O
across	O
the	O
isthmus	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
had	O
no	O
inducement	O
at	O
present	O
to	O
proceed	O
to	O
Panama	PNM
,	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
incapable	O
of	O
attacking	O
the	O
place	O
;	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
great	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
general	O
embargo	O
on	O
all	O
the	O
coast	O

The	O
only	O
feasible	O
measure	O
then	O
which	O
was	O
left	O
us	O
was	O
to	O
steer	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
possible	O
to	O
the	O
southern	O
parts	O
of	O
California	PNM

-LCB-	O

-RCB-	O
or	O
to	O
the	O
adjacent	O
coast	O
of	O
Mexico	PNM
,	O
there	O
to	O
cruise	O
for	O
the	O
Manila	PNM

which	O
we	O
knew	O
was	O
now	O
at	O
sea	O
,	O
bound	O
to	O
the	O
port	O
of	O
Acapulco	PNM

And	O
we	O
doubted	O
not	O
to	O
get	O
on	O
that	O
station	O
time	O
enough	O
to	O
intercept	O
her	O
;	O
for	O
this	O
ship	O
does	O
not	O
usually	O
arrive	O
at	O
Acapulco	PNM
till	O
towards	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
January	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
November	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
conceive	O
that	O
our	O
passage	O
thither	O
would	O
cost	O
us	O
above	O
a	O
month	O
or	O
five	O
weeks	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
imagined	O
we	O
had	O
near	O
twice	O
as	O
much	O
time	O
as	O
was	O
necessary	O
for	O
our	O
purpose	O
.	O

Indeed	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
business	O
which	O
we	O
foresaw	O
would	O
occasion	O
some	O
delay	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
flattered	O
ourselves	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
dispatched	O
in	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
days	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
could	O
not	O
interrupt	O
our	O
project	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
recruiting	O
of	O
our	O
water	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
prisoners	O
we	O
had	O
entertained	O
on	O
board	O
since	O
our	O
leaving	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Fernandes	O
had	O
so	O
far	O
exhausted	O
our	O
stock	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
venturing	O
upon	O
this	O
passage	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Mexico	PNM
till	O
we	O
had	O
procured	O
a	O
fresh	O
supply	O
,	O
especially	O
as	O
at	O
Paita	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
had	O
some	O
hopes	O
of	O
getting	O
a	O
quantity	O
,	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
find	O
enough	O
for	O
our	O
consumption	O
during	O
our	O
stay	O
there	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
deliberation	O
where	O
we	O
should	O
take	O
in	O
this	O
necessary	O
article	O
;	O
but	O
by	O
consulting	O
the	O
accounts	O
of	O
former	O
navigators	O
,	O
and	O
examining	O
our	O
prisoners	O
,	O
we	O
at	O
last	O
resolved	O
for	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Quibo	PNM
,	O
situated	O
at	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
bay	PNM
of	PNM
Panama	PNM
:	O
nor	O
was	O
it	O
but	O
on	O
good	O
grounds	O
that	O
the	O
commodore	O
conceived	O
this	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
properest	O
place	O
for	O
watering	O
the	O
squadron	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
small	O
island	O
called	O
Cocos	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
less	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
way	O
than	O
Quibo	O
,	O
where	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
buccaneers	O
have	O
pretended	O
they	O
found	O
water	O
:	O
but	O
none	O
of	O
our	O
prisoners	O
knew	O
anything	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
thought	O
too	O
dangerous	O
to	O
risque	O
the	O
safety	O
of	O
the	O
squadron	O
,	O
by	O
exposing	O
ourselves	O
to	O
the	O
hazard	O
of	O
not	O
meeting	O
with	O
water	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
there	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
mere	O
authority	O
of	O
these	O
legendary	O
writers	O
,	O
of	O
whose	O
misrepresentations	O
and	O
falsities	O
we	O
had	O
almost	O
daily	O
experience	O
.	O

Besides	O
,	O
by	O
going	O
to	O
Quibo	PNM
we	O
were	O
not	O
without	O
hopes	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
enemies	O
ships	O
bound	O
to	O
or	O
from	O
Panama	PNM
might	O
fall	O
into	O
our	O
hands	O
,	O
particularly	O
such	O
of	O
them	O
as	O
were	O
put	O
to	O
sea	O
before	O
they	O
had	O
any	O
intelligence	O
of	O
our	O
squadron	O
.	O

Determined	O
therefore	O
by	O
these	O
reasons	O
for	O
Quibo	PNM
,	O
we	O
directed	O
our	O
course	O
northward	O
,	O
being	O
eight	O
sail	O
in	O
company	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
having	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
-LCB-	O

-RCB-	O
formidable	O
fleet	O
;	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
19th	O
,	O
at	O
daybreak	O
,	O
we	O
discovered	O
Cape	PNM
Blanco	PNM
,	O
bearing	O
S.S.E.	O
1/2E	O
.	O

seven	O
miles	O

This	O

in	O
the	O

always	O
made	O
by	O
ships	O
bound	O
either	O
to	O

or	O
to	O

;	O
so	O
that	O
off	O
this	O
cape	O
is	O
a	O
most	O
excellent	O
station	O
to	O
cruise	O
upon	O
the	O
enemy	O

By	O
this	O

we	O

on	O
the	O

Here	O
one	O

it	O

both	O
to	O

which	O
was	O

which	O
would	O

On	O
the	O
25th	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
of	O

bearing	O
E.S.E.	O
1/2E	O

four	O

from	O

we	O
crossed	O
the	O

of	PNM
Panama	PNM
with	O
a	O
N.W.	O
course	O

hoping	O
that	O

us	O
in	O
a	O

to	O
the	O
island	O

But	O
we	O
afterwards	O
found	O
that	O
we	O
ought	O
to	O
have	O
stood	O
more	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O

for	O
the	O

in	O
a	O

it	O

the	O

After	O
passing	O
the	O
equinoctial	O

we	O
did	O
on	O
the	O

-RRB-	O

we	O
found	O
in	O
very	O

an	O
extraordinary	O
alteration	O
in	O

For	O
instead	O

where	O
neither	O
the	O

now	O
,	O
for	O
several	O
days	O
together	O
,	O
close	O
and	O
sultry	O
weather	O

We	O
had	O
besides	O
frequent	O
calms	O

heavy	O
rains	O

which	O
we	O
at	O
first	O
ascribed	O
to	O
the	O

the	O

where	O
this	O

to	O

at	O

observing	O
that	O
it	O
attended	O
us	O
to	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
seven	O

we	O
were	O
at	O

to	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O

as	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
call	O
it	O

the	O

many	O

positively	O
assert	O
that	O
this	O

is	O
ended	O
in	O
November	O

and	O
our	O

all	O
affirmed	O
the	O

thing	O

But	O
perhaps	O
its	O
end	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
always	O
constant	O

and	O
it	O

On	O

we	O
had	O
a	O

an	O

who	O
,	O
having	O
found	O
it	O

returned	O
before	O

and	O
then	O
we	O
sent	O

and	O
at	O
the	O

At	O

we	O
came	O

with	O

This	O
island	O
of	O
Quibo	PNM
is	O
extremely	O
convenient	O
for	O
wooding	O
and	O
watering	O
,	O
since	O
the	O
trees	O
grow	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
high-water	O
mark	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
large	O
rapid	O
stream	O
of	O
fresh	O
water	O
runs	O
over	O
the	O
sandy	O
beach	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
:	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
little	O
more	O
than	O
two	O
days	O
in	O
laying	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
wood	O
and	O
water	O
we	O
wanted	O
.	O

The	O
whole	O
island	O
is	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
moderate	O
height	O
,	O
excepting	O
one	O
part	O
.	O

It	O
consists	O
of	O
a	O
continued	O
wood	O
spread	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
whole	O
surface	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
which	O
preserves	O
its	O
verdure	O
the	O
year	O
round	O
.	O

Amongst	O
the	O
other	O
wood	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
there	O
abundance	O
of	O
cassia	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
few	O
lime-trees	O
.	O

It	O
appeared	O
singular	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
considering	O
the	O
climate	O
and	O
the	O
shelter	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
see	O
no	O
other	O
birds	O
than	O
parrots	O
,	O
parroquets	O
,	O
and	O
mackaws	O
;	O
indeed	O
,	O
of	O
these	O
last	O
there	O
were	O
prodigious	O
flights	O

Next	O
to	O
these	O
birds	O
,	O
the	O
animals	O
we	O
found	O
in	O
most	O
plenty	O
were	O
monkeys	O
and	O
guanos	O
,	O
and	O
these	O
we	O
frequently	O
killed	O
for	O
food	O
;	O
for	O
notwithstanding	O
there	O
were	O
many	O
herds	O
of	O
deer	O
upon	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
difficulty	O
of	O
penetrating	O
the	O
woods	O
prevented	O
our	O
coming	O
near	O
them	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
though	O
we	O
saw	O
them	O
often	O
,	O
we	O
killed	O
only	O
two	O
during	O
our	O
stay	O
.	O

Our	O
prisoners	O
assured	O
us	O
that	O
this	O
island	O
abounded	O
with	O
tygers	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
did	O
once	O
discover	O
the	O
print	O
of	O
a	O
tyger	O
's	O
paw	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
tygers	O
themselves	O
we	O
never	O
saw	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
too	O
informed	O
us	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
frequently	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
a	O
most	O
mischievous	O
serpent	O
,	O
called	O
the	O
flying	O
snake	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
-LCB-	O

they	O
said	O

darted	O
itself	O
from	O
the	O
boughs	O
of	O
trees	O
on	O
either	O
man	O
or	O
beast	O
that	O
came	O
within	O
its	O
reach	O
,	O
and	O
whose	O
sting	O
they	O
believed	O
to	O
be	O
inevitable	O
death	O
.	O

Besides	O
these	O
dangerous	O
land	O
animals	O
,	O
the	O
sea	O
hereabouts	O
is	O
infested	O
with	O
great	O
numbers	O
of	O
alligators	O
of	O
an	O
extraordinary	O
size	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
often	O
observed	O
a	O
large	O
kind	O
of	O
flat	O
fish	O
jumping	O
a	O
considerable	O
height	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
fish	O
that	O
is	O
said	O
frequently	O
to	O
destroy	O
the	O
pearl	O
divers	O
by	O
clasping	O
them	O
in	O
its	O
fins	O
as	O
they	O
rise	O
from	O
the	O
bottom	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
told	O
that	O
the	O
divers	O
,	O
for	O
their	O
security	O
,	O
are	O
now	O
always	O
armed	O
with	O
a	O
sharp	O
knife	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
are	O
entangled	O
,	O
they	O
stick	O
into	O
the	O
belly	O
of	O
the	O
fish	O
,	O
and	O
thereby	O
disengage	O
themselves	O
from	O
its	O

,	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
attended	O
by	O
some	O
of	O
his	O

went	O
in	O
a	O
boat	O
to	O
examine	O
a	O
bay	O
which	O
lay	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
afterwards	O
ranged	O
all	O
along	O
the	O
eastern	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O

And	O
in	O
the	O

where	O
they	O
put	O
on	O
shore	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
this	O
expedition	O
,	O
they	O
generally	O
found	O
the	O

to	O
be	O
extremely	O
rich	O

and	O
met	O
with	O
great	O
plenty	O
of	O

water	O
.	O

In	O
particular	O
,	O
near	O
the	O
N.E.	O
point	O
of	O
the	O

they	O
discovered	O
a	O

By	O

we	O
not	O

secured	O
a	O

for	O
the	O

on	O

we	O
carried	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
them	O
with	O
us	O
to	O

we	O
met	O
with	O
a	O

where	O
in	O

Upon	O

them	O

we	O
usually	O
sent	O
out	O
our	O

with	O
a	O

in	O
the	O

who	O
was	O
a	O

came	O
within	O
a	O

the	O

plunged	O
into	O

to	O

close	O
upon	O

the	O

pressing	O
down	O
the	O

the	O

was	O
thereby	O
awakened	O

began	O

which	O
motion	O
supported	O
both	O
it	O

the	O

came	O
up	O

it	O
appears	O

a	O
species	O
of	O

so	O
very	O
palatable	O
and	O
salubrious	O
as	O

and	O
there	O

Perhaps	O
the	O
strange	O
appearance	O
of	O
this	O

may	O
have	O
been	O
the	O
foundation	O
of	O

I	O
have	O

These	O
orders	O
being	O
distributed	O
to	O
all	O

we	O
had	O
little	O
doubt	O
of	O
arriving	O

upon	O
our	O

as	O
we	O
expected	O

But	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
extreme	O
vexation	O

we	O
were	O
baffled	O
for	O
near	O
a	O
month	O

either	O
by	O
tempestuous	O
weather	O
from	O
the	O

a	O
sultry	O
air	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
25th	O
of	O
December	O
before	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Cocos	O
,	O
which	O
according	O
to	O
our	O
reckoning	O
was	O
only	O
a	O
hundred	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
continent	O
;	O
and	O
even	O
then	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
mortification	O
to	O
make	O
so	O
little	O
way	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
lose	O
sight	O
of	O
it	O
again	O
in	O
five	O

From	O
the	O
island	O

we	O
stood	O
W.	O
by	O

and	O
were	O
till	O
the	O
9th	O
of	O
January	O
in	O
running	O
an	O
hundred	O
leagues	O
more	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
at	O
first	O
flattered	O
ourselves	O
that	O
the	O
uncertain	O
weather	O
and	O
western	O
gales	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
were	O
owing	O
to	O
the	O
neighbourhood	O
of	O
the	O
continent	O
,	O
from	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
got	O
more	O
distant	O
,	O
we	O
expected	O
every	O
day	O
to	O
be	O
relieved	O
,	O
by	O
falling	O
in	O
with	O
the	O
eastern	O
trade-wind	O
.	O

But	O
as	O
our	O
hopes	O
were	O
so	O
long	O
baffled	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
patience	O
quite	O
exhausted	O
,	O
we	O
began	O
at	O
length	O
to	O
despair	O
of	O
succeeding	O
in	O
the	O
great	O
purpose	O
we	O
had	O
in	O
view	O
,	O
that	O
of	O
intercepting	O
the	O
Manila	PNM
galeon	O
.	O

This	O
produced	O
a	O
general	O
dejection	O
amongst	O
us	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
at	O
first	O
considered	O
the	O
project	O
as	O
almost	O
infallible	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
indulged	O
ourselves	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
boundless	O
hopes	O
of	O
the	O
advantages	O
we	O
should	O
thence	O
receive	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
our	O
despondency	O
was	O
at	O
last	O
somewhat	O
alleviated	O
by	O
a	O
favourable	O
change	O
of	O
the	O
wind	O
;	O
for	O
on	O
the	O
9th	O
of	O
January	O
a	O
gale	O
sprung	O
up	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
from	O
the	O
N.E.	O
,	O
and	O
on	O
this	O
we	O
took	O
the	O
_	O
Carmelo	PNM
_	O
in	O
tow	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
_	O
Gloucester	O
_	O
did	O
the	O
_	O
Carmin	O
_	O
,	O
making	O
all	O
the	O
sail	O
we	O
could	O
to	O
improve	O
the	O
advantage	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
still	O
suspected	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
only	O
a	O
temporary	O
gale	O
which	O
would	O
not	O
last	O
long	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
satisfaction	O
to	O
find	O
that	O
the	O
wind	O
did	O
not	O
only	O
continue	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
quarter	O
,	O
but	O
blew	O
with	O
so	O
much	O
briskness	O
and	O
steadiness	O
that	O
we	O
no	O
longer	O
doubted	O
of	O
its	O
being	O
the	O
true	O
trade-wind	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
now	O
advanced	O
apace	O
towards	O
our	O
station	O
,	O
our	O
hopes	O
began	O
again	O
to	O
revive	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
former	O
despair	O
by	O
degrees	O
gave	O
place	O
to	O
more	O
sanguine	O
prejudices	O
;	O
insomuch	O
that	O
though	O
the	O
customary	O
season	O
of	O
the	O
arrival	O
of	O
the	O
galeon	O
at	O
Acapulco	PNM
was	O
already	O
elapsed	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
were	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
unreasonable	O
enough	O
to	O
flatter	O
ourselves	O
that	O
some	O
accidental	O
delay	O
might	O
,	O
for	O
our	O
advantage	O
,	O
lengthen	O
out	O
her	O
passage	O
beyond	O
its	O
usual	O
limits	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
got	O
into	O
the	O
trade-wind	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
no	O
alteration	O
in	O
it	O
till	O
the	O
17th	O
of	O
January	O

when	O
we	O

but	O
on	O
that	O
day	O
it	O
shifted	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
of	O
the	O
north	O

This	O
change	O
we	O
imputed	O
to	O
our	O
having	O
haled	O
up	O
too	O
soon	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
then	O
esteemed	O
ourselves	O
full	O
seventy	O

from	O
the	O
coast	O
;	O
whence	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
our	O
former	O
experience	O

we	O
were	O
fully	O
satisfied	O
that	O
the	O
trade-wind	O
doth	O
not	O
take	O
place	O

at	O
a	O
considerable	O
distance	O

as	O
we	O

we	O
instantly	O

on	O

the	O

we	O
had	O
no	O

therefore	O
we	O
continued	O

should	O
see	O
it	O
by	O
the	O

About	O
ten	O
at	O

As	O
we	O
had	O
none	O

any	O
doubt	O

what	O
we	O
saw	O
was	O
a	O

we	O
were	O
all	O
extremely	O
animated	O
with	O
a	O
firm	O
persuasion	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
Manila	PNM

which	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
long	O
the	O
object	O
of	O

And	O
what	O
added	O
to	O
our	O
alacrity	O
was	O
our	O
expectation	O
of	O
meeting	O
with	O
two	O

for	O
we	O
took	O
it	O
for	O

the	O

they	O
could	O

The	O
commodore	O
himself	O
was	O
so	O
fully	O
persuaded	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
soon	O
alongside	O
of	O
her	O
that	O
he	O
sent	O
for	O
his	O
first	O
lieutenant	O
,	O
who	O
commanded	O
between	O
decks	O
,	O
and	O
directed	O
him	O
to	O
see	O
all	O
the	O
great	O
guns	O
loaded	O
with	O
two	O
round	O
shot	O
for	O
the	O
first	O

one	O

one	O

strictly	O
charging	O
him	O

at	O
the	O

time	O
,	O
not	O
to	O
suffer	O
a	O
gun	O
to	O
be	O
fired	O
till	O
he	O
,	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
should	O
give	O
orders	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
he	O
informed	O
the	O
lieutenant	O
,	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
till	O
we	O
arrived	O
within	O
pistol-shot	O
of	O
the	O
enemy	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
constant	O
and	O
eager	O
attention	O
we	O
continued	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
always	O
presuming	O
that	O
another	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
would	O
bring	O
us	O
up	O
with	O
this	O
Manila	O
ship	O
,	O
whose	O
wealth	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
of	O
her	O
supposed	O
consort	O
,	O
we	O
now	O
estimated	O
by	O
round	O
millions	O
.	O

But	O
when	O
the	O
morning	O
broke	O
,	O
and	O
daylight	O
came	O
on	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
most	O
strangely	O
and	O
vexatiously	O
disappointed	O
,	O
by	O
finding	O
that	O
the	O
light	O
which	O
had	O
occasioned	O
all	O
this	O
bustle	O
and	O
expectancy	O
,	O
was	O
only	O
a	O
fire	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

It	O
must	O
be	O
owned	O
,	O
the	O
circumstances	O
of	O
this	O
deception	O
were	O
so	O
extraordinary	O
as	O
to	O
be	O
scarcely	O
credible	O
,	O
for	O
,	O
by	O
our	O
run	O
during	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
the	O
land	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
doubt	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
but	O
this	O
fire	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
first	O
discovered	O
it	O
,	O
was	O
above	O
twenty-five	O
leagues	O
from	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
yet	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
person	O
on	O
board	O
who	O
doubted	O
of	O
its	O
being	O
a	O
ship	O
's	O
light	O
,	O
or	O
of	O
its	O
being	O
near	O
at	O
hand	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
indeed	O
upon	O
a	O
very	O
high	O
mountain	O
,	O
and	O
continued	O
burning	O
for	O
several	O
days	O
afterwards	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
vulcano	O
,	O
but	O
rather	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
suppose	O
,	O
a	O
tract	O
of	O
stubble	O
or	O
heath	O
,	O
set	O
on	O
fire	O
for	O
some	O
purpose	O
of	O
agriculture	O
.	O

At	O
sun-rising	O
,	O
after	O
this	O
mortifying	O
delusion	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
ourselves	O
about	O
nine	O
leagues	O
off	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
which	O
extended	O
from	O
the	O
N.W.	O
to	O
E.	O
1/2N	O
.	O

On	O
this	O
land	O
we	O
observed	O
two	O
remarkable	O
hummocks	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
are	O
usually	O
called	O
paps	O
,	O
which	O
bore	O
north	O
from	O
us	O
:	O
these	O
a	O
Spanish	O
pilot	O
and	O
two	O
Indians	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
the	O
only	O
persons	O
amongst	O
us	O
that	O
pretended	O
to	O
have	O
traded	O
in	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
affirmed	O
to	O
be	O
over	O
the	O
harbour	O
of	O
Acapulco	PNM
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
we	O
very	O
much	O
doubted	O
their	O
knowledge	O
of	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
found	O
these	O
paps	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
17	O
deg	O
.	O

56	O
'	O
,	O
whereas	O
those	O
over	O
Acapulco	O
are	O
said	O
to	O
be	O
17	O
degrees	O
only	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
afterwards	O
found	O
our	O
suspicions	O
of	O
their	O
skill	O
to	O
be	O
well	O
grounded	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
confident	O
,	O
and	O
assured	O
us	O
that	O
the	O
height	O
of	O
the	O
mountains	O
was	O
itself	O
an	O
infallible	O
mark	O
of	O
the	O
harbour	O
,	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
pretended	O
,	O
though	O
falsly	O
,	O
being	O
generally	O
low	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
and	O
westward	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

Being	O
now	O
in	O
the	O
track	O
of	O
the	O
Manila	PNM
galeon	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
doubt	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
near	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
January	O
,	O
whether	O
she	O
was	O
or	O
was	O
not	O
arrived	O
;	O
but	O
examining	O
our	O
prisoners	O
-LCB-	O
212	O
-RCB-	O
about	O
it	O
,	O
they	O
assured	O
us	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
sometimes	O
known	O
to	O
come	O
in	O
after	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
February	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
persuade	O
us	O
that	O
the	O
fire	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
on	O
shore	O
was	O
a	O
proof	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
yet	O
at	O
sea	O
,	O
it	O
being	O
customary	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
said	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
use	O
of	O
these	O
fires	O
as	O
signals	O
for	O
her	O
direction	O
when	O
she	O
continued	O
longer	O
out	O
than	O
ordinary	O
.	O

On	O
this	O
reasoning	O
of	O
our	O
prisoners	O
,	O
strengthened	O
by	O
our	O
propensity	O
to	O
believe	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
matter	O
which	O
so	O
pleasingly	O
flattered	O
our	O
wishes	O
,	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
cruise	O
for	O
her	O
some	O
days	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
accordingly	O
spread	O
our	O
ships	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
twelve	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
coast	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
manner	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
she	O
should	O
pass	O
us	O
unobserved	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
not	O
seeing	O
her	O
soon	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
intervals	O
inclined	O
to	O
suspect	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
gained	O
her	O
port	O
already	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
now	O
began	O
to	O
want	O
a	O
harbour	O
to	O
refresh	O
our	O
people	O
,	O
the	O
uncertainty	O
of	O
our	O
present	O
situation	O
gave	O
us	O
great	O
uneasiness	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
solicitous	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
positive	O
intelligence	O
,	O
which	O
might	O
either	O
set	O
us	O
at	O
liberty	O
to	O
consult	O
our	O
necessities	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
galeon	O
was	O
arrived	O
,	O
or	O
might	O
animate	O
us	O
to	O
continue	O
our	O
present	O
cruise	O
with	O
chearfulness	O
,	O
if	O
she	O
was	O
not	O
.	O

With	O
this	O
view	O
,	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
after	O
examining	O
our	O
prisoners	O
very	O
particularly	O
,	O
resolved	O
to	O
send	O
a	O
boat	O
,	O
under	O
colour	O
of	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
into	O
the	O
harbour	O
of	O
Acapulco	PNM
,	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
the	O
Manila	O
ship	O
was	O
there	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
being	O
very	O
positive	O
that	O
this	O
might	O
be	O
done	O
without	O
the	O
boat	O
itself	O
being	O
discovered	O
.	O

To	O
execute	O
this	O
enterprize	O
,	O
the	O
barge	O
was	O
dispatched	O
the	O
6th	O
of	O
February	O
,	O
carrying	O
a	O
sufficient	O
crew	O
and	O
two	O
officers	O
,	O
as	O
also	O
a	O
Spanish	O
pilot	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
Indian	O
who	O
had	O
insisted	O
on	O
the	O
facility	O
of	O
this	O
project	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
undertaken	O
to	O
conduct	O
it	O
.	O

Our	O
barge	O
did	O
not	O
return	O
to	O
us	O
again	O
till	O
the	O
11th	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
officers	O
acquainted	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
that	O
,	O
agreeable	O
to	O
our	O
suspicions	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
nothing	O
like	O
a	O
harbour	O
in	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
the	O
Spanish	O
pilots	O
had	O
at	O
first	O
asserted	O
Acapulco	PNM
to	O
lie	O
;	O
that	O
after	O
they	O
had	O
satisfied	O
themselves	O
in	O
this	O
particular	O
,	O
they	O
steered	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
,	O
in	O
hopes	O
of	O
discovering	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
coasted	O
along	O
shore	O
thirty-two	O
leagues	O
;	O
that	O
in	O
this	O
whole	O
range	O
they	O
met	O
chiefly	O
with	O
sandy	O
beaches	O
of	O
a	O
great	O
length	O
,	O
over	O
which	O
the	O
sea	O
broke	O
with	O
so	O
much	O
violence	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
a	O
boat	O
to	O
land	O
;	O
that	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
their	O
run	O
they	O
could	O
just	O
discover	O
two	O
paps	O
at	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
distance	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
,	O
which	O
from	O
their	O
appearance	O
and	O
their	O
latitude	O
they	O
concluded	O
to	O
be	O
those	O
in	O
the	O
neighbourhood	O
of	O
Acapulco	PNM
;	O
but	O
that	O
not	O
having	O
a	O
sufficient	O
-LCB-	O
213	O
-RCB-	O
quantity	O
of	O
fresh	O
water	O
and	O
provision	O
for	O
their	O
passage	O
thither	O
and	O
back	O
again	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
to	O
acquaint	O
him	O
with	O
their	O
disappointment	O
.	O

On	O
this	O
intelligence	O
we	O
all	O
made	O
sail	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
get	O
into	O
the	O
neighbourhood	O
of	O
that	O
port	O
,	O
the	O
commodore	O
being	O
determined	O
to	O
send	O
the	O
barge	O
a	O
second	O
time	O
upon	O
the	O
same	O
enterprize	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
arrived	O
within	O
a	O
moderate	O
distance	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
12th	O
of	O
February	O
,	O
we	O
being	O
by	O
that	O
time	O
considerably	O
advanced	O
,	O
the	O
barge	O
was	O
again	O
dispatched	O
,	O
and	O
particular	O
instructions	O
given	O
to	O
the	O
officers	O
to	O
preserve	O
themselves	O
from	O
being	O
seen	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
13th	O
we	O
espied	O
a	O
high	O
land	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
first	O
imagined	O
to	O
be	O
that	O
over	O
the	O
harbour	O
of	O
Acapulco	PNM
;	O
but	O
we	O
afterwards	O
found	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
high	O
land	O
of	O
Seguateneio	PNM
,	O
where	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
small	O
harbour	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
shall	O
have	O
occasion	O
to	O
make	O
more	O
ample	O
mention	O
hereafter	O
.	O

We	O
waited	O
six	O
days	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
departure	O
of	O
our	O
barge	O
,	O
without	O
any	O
news	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
uneasy	O
for	O
her	O
safety	O
;	O
but	O
on	O
the	O
7th	O
day	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
19th	O
of	O
February	O
,	O
she	O
returned	O
:	O
when	O
the	O
officers	O
informed	O
the	O
commodore	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
discovered	O
the	O
harbour	O
of	O
Acapulco	PNM
,	O
which	O
they	O
esteemed	O
to	O
bear	O
from	O
us	O
E.S.E.	O
at	O
least	O
fifty	O
leagues	O
distant	O
;	O
that	O
on	O
the	O
17th	O
,	O
about	O
two	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
got	O
within	O
the	O
island	O
that	O
lies	O
at	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
harbour	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
neither	O
the	O
Spanish	O
pilot	O
,	O
nor	O
the	O
Indian	O
,	O
could	O
give	O
them	O
any	O
information	O
where	O
they	O
then	O
were	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
while	O
they	O
were	O
lying	O
upon	O
their	O
oars	O
in	O
suspence	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
being	O
ignorant	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
then	O
at	O
the	O
very	O
place	O
they	O
sought	O
for	O
,	O
they	O
discerned	O
a	O
small	O
light	O
near	O
the	O
surface	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
on	O
which	O
they	O
instantly	O
plied	O
their	O
paddles	O
,	O
and	O
moving	O
as	O
silently	O
as	O
possible	O
towards	O
it	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
fishing	O
canoe	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
surprized	O
,	O
with	O
three	O
negroes	O
that	O
belonged	O
to	O
it	O
.	O

It	O
seems	O
the	O
negroes	O
at	O
first	O
attempted	O
to	O
jump	O
overboard	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
so	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
they	O
would	O
easily	O
have	O
swam	O
to	O
land	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
prevented	O
by	O
presenting	O
a	O
piece	O
at	O
them	O
,	O
on	O
which	O
they	O
readily	O
submitted	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
taken	O
into	O
the	O
barge	O
.	O

The	O
officers	O
further	O
added	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
immediately	O
turned	O
the	O
canoe	O
adrift	O
against	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
a	O
rock	O
,	O
where	O
it	O
would	O
inevitably	O
be	O
dashed	O
to	O
pieces	O
by	O
the	O
fury	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
.	O

This	O
they	O
did	O
to	O
deceive	O
those	O
who	O
perhaps	O
might	O
be	O
sent	O
from	O
the	O
town	O
to	O
search	O
after	O
the	O
canoe	O
,	O
for	O
upon	O
seeing	O
several	O
remains	O
of	O

Having	O
now	O
gotten	O
the	O
three	O

in	O

possession	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
not	O
ignorant	O
of	O

we	O
were	O

the	O

which	O
had	O
long	O
kept	O
us	O

On	O
examining	O
them	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
indeed	O
disappointed	O
in	O
our	O
expectation	O
of	O
intercepting	O
the	O
galeon	O
before	O
her	O
arrival	O
at	O

;	O
but	O
we	O
learnt	O
other	O
circumstances	O
which	O
still	O
revived	O
our	O
hopes	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
,	O
we	O
then	O
conceived	O
,	O
would	O
more	O
than	O
balance	O
the	O
opportunity	O
we	O
had	O
already	O
lost	O
,	O
for	O
though	O
our	O
negroe	O

informed	O
us	O
that	O
the	O
galeon	O
arrived	O
at	O
Acapulco	PNM
on	O
our	O
9th	O
of	O
January	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
about	O
twenty	O
days	O
before	O
we	O
fell	O
in	O
with	O
this	O
coast	O
,	O
yet	O
they	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
the	O
galeon	O
had	O
delivered	O
her	O
cargo	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
taking	O
in	O
water	O
and	O
provisions	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
return	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
Viceroy	O
of	O
Mexico	PNM
had	O
by	O
proclamation	O
fixed	O
her	O
departure	O
from	O
Acapulco	PNM
to	O
the	O
14th	O
of	O
March	O

This	O
last	O
news	O
was	O
most	O
joyfully	O
received	O
by	O
us	O
,	O
since	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
doubt	O
but	O
she	O
must	O
certainly	O
fall	O
into	O
our	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
much	O
more	O
eligible	O
to	O
seize	O
her	O
on	O
her	O
return	O
than	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
to	O
have	O
taken	O
her	O
before	O
her	O
arrival	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
species	O
for	O
which	O
she	O
had	O
sold	O
her	O
cargoe	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
she	O
would	O
now	O
have	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
would	O
be	O
prodigiously	O
more	O
to	O
be	O
esteemed	O
by	O
us	O
than	O
the	O
cargoe	O
itself	O
;	O
great	O
part	O
of	O
which	O
would	O
have	O
perished	O
on	O
our	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
none	O
of	O
it	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
disposed	O
of	O
by	O
us	O
at	O
so	O
advantageous	O
a	O
mart	O
as	O
Acapulco	PNM

Thus	O
we	O
were	O
a	O
second	O
time	O
engaged	O
in	O
an	O
eager	O
expectation	O
of	O
meeting	O
with	O
this	O
Manila	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
fame	O
of	O
its	O
wealth	O

we	O
had	O
been	O
taught	O
to	O
consider	O
as	O
the	O
most	O
desirable	O
capture	O
that	O
was	O
to	O
be	O

A	O
communication	O

was	O

in	O

which	O
were	O

being	O

made	O
in	O

the	O
place	O
by	O

grew	O
extremely	O

and	O
its	O

so	O

increased	O
as	O
to	O
engage	O
the	O
attention	O
of	O
the	O

and	O
to	O

frequently	O

In	O
the	O
infancy	O
of	O
this	O
trade	O
it	O
was	O
carried	O
on	O
from	O
the	O
port	O
of	O
Callao	PNM
to	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Manila	PNM
,	O
in	O
which	O
navigation	O
the	O

continually	O
favoured	O
them	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
notwithstanding	O
these	O

were	O
distant	O
between	O
three	O

the	O

two	O

But	O
then	O
the	O

though	O
it	O

that	O
in	O
their	O

they	O
were	O
so	O
imprudent	O

unskilful	O
as	O
to	O

of	O
a	O

the	O

is	O
it	O
uncommon	O

The	O
trade	O
is	O
by	O
the	O
royal	O
edicts	O
limited	O
to	O
a	O
certain	O
value	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
annual	O
cargoe	O
ought	O
not	O
to	O
exceed	O

Some	O
Spanish	O
-LCB-	O
221	O
-RCB-	O
manuscripts	O
I	O
have	O
seen	O
,	O
mention	O
this	O
limitation	O
to	O
be	O
600,000	O
dollars	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
annual	O
cargoe	O
does	O
certainly	O
surpass	O
this	O
sum	O
,	O
and	O
though	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
difficult	O
to	O
fix	O
its	O
exact	O
value	O
,	O
yet	O
from	O
many	O
comparisons	O
I	O
conclude	O
that	O
the	O
return	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
much	O
short	O
of	O
three	O
millions	O
of	O
dollars	O
.	O

As	O
it	O
is	O
sufficiently	O
obvious	O
that	O
the	O
greatest	O
share	O
of	O
the	O
treasure	O
returned	O
from	O
Acapulco	PNM
to	O
Manila	PNM
does	O
not	O
remain	O
in	O
that	O
place	O
,	O
but	O
is	O
again	O
dispersed	O
into	O
different	O
parts	O
of	O
India	PNM
;	O
and	O
as	O
all	O
European	O
nations	O
have	O
generally	O
esteemed	O
it	O
good	O
policy	O
to	O
keep	O
their	O
American	O
settlements	O
in	O
an	O
immediate	O
dependence	O
on	O
the	O
mother	O
country	O
,	O
without	O
permitting	O
them	O
to	O
carry	O
on	O
directly	O
any	O
gainful	O
traffick	O
with	O
other	O
powers	O
;	O
these	O
considerations	O
have	O
occasioned	O
many	O
remonstrances	O
to	O
be	O
presented	O
to	O
the	O
court	O
of	O
Spain	PNM
against	O
this	O
Indian	O
trade	O
allowed	O
to	O
the	O
kingdom	O
of	O
Mexico	PNM
.	O

It	O
has	O
been	O
urged	O
that	O
the	O
silk	O
manufactures	O
of	O
Valencia	PNM
and	O
other	O
parts	O
of	O
Spain	PNM
are	O
hereby	O
greatly	O
prejudiced	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
linens	O
carried	O
from	O
Cadiz	PNM
much	O
injured	O
in	O
their	O
sale	O
:	O
since	O
the	O
Chinese	O
silks	O
coming	O
almost	O
directly	O
to	O
Acapulco	PNM
,	O
can	O
be	O
afforded	O
considerably	O
cheaper	O
there	O
than	O
any	O
European	O
manufactures	O
of	O
equal	O
goodness	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
cotton	O
from	O
the	O
Coromandel	O
coast	O
makes	O
the	O
European	O
linens	O
nearly	O
useless	O
.	O

So	O
that	O
the	O
Manila	O
trade	O
renders	O
both	O
Mexico	O
and	O
Peru	O
less	O
dependant	O
upon	O
Spain	PNM
for	O
a	O
supply	O
of	O
their	O
necessities	O
than	O
they	O
ought	O
to	O

who	O
was	O
formerly	O
prime	O

and	O
an	O
enemy	O
to	O
the	O
Jesuits	O
,	O
that	O
about	O
the	O
year	O
1725	O
he	O
had	O
resolved	O
to	O
abolish	O
this	O

to	O
have	O
permitted	O
no	O

But	O
the	O
powerful	O

of	O
the	O

prevented	O
this	O
regulation	O
from	O
taking	O
place	O

This	O
trade	O
from	O
Manila	PNM
to	O
Acapulco	PNM
and	O

again	O
is	O
usually	O
carried	O
on	O
in	O
one	O
or	O
at	O
most	O
two	O
annual	O
ships	O
,	O
which	O
set	O

that	O

For	O
this	O

It	O
is	O
indeed	O
most	O
remarkable	O
that	O
by	O
the	O
concurrent	O
testimony	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
Spanish	O

there	O

from	O

the	O
time	O
the	O

and	O
very	O

not	O
till	O
she	O

to	O
its	O
southermost	O

As	O
this	O
voyage	O
is	O
rarely	O
of	O
less	O
than	O
six	O
months	O
'	O
continuance	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
ship	O
is	O
deep	O
laden	O
with	O
merchandize	O
and	O
crowded	O
with	O
people	O
,	O
it	O
may	O
appear	O
wonderful	O
how	O
they	O
can	O
be	O
supplied	O
with	O
a	O
stock	O
of	O
fresh	O
water	O
for	O
so	O
long	O
a	O
time	O
.	O

The	O
method	O
of	O
procuring	O
it	O
is	O
indeed	O
extremely	O
singular	O
,	O
and	O
deserves	O
a	O
very	O
particular	O
recital	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
well	O
known	O
to	O
those	O
who	O
are	O
acquainted	O
with	O
the	O
Spanish	O
customs	O
in	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
,	O
that	O
their	O
water	O
is	O
preserved	O
on	O
shipboard	O
,	O
not	O
in	O
casks	O
but	O
in	O
earthen	O
jars	O
,	O
which	O
in	O
some	O
sort	O
resemble	O
the	O
large	O
oil	O
jars	O
we	O
often	O
see	O
in	O
Europe	PNM
.	O

When	O
the	O
Manila	O
ship	O
first	O
puts	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
she	O
takes	O
on	O
board	O
a	O
much	O
greater	O
quantity	O
of	O
water	O
than	O
can	O
be	O
stowed	O
between	O
decks	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
jars	O
which	O
contain	O
it	O
are	O
hung	O
all	O
about	O
the	O
shrouds	O
and	O
stays	O
,	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
exhibit	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
a	O
very	O
odd	O
appearance	O
.	O

Though	O
it	O
is	O
one	O
convenience	O
of	O
their	O
jars	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
much	O
more	O
manageable	O
than	O
casks	O
,	O
and	O
are	O
liable	O
to	O
no	O
leekage	O
,	O
unless	O
they	O
are	O
broken	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
is	O
sufficiently	O
obvious	O
that	O
a	O
six	O
or	O
even	O
a	O
three	O
months	O
'	O
store	O
of	O
water	O
could	O
never	O
be	O
stowed	O
in	O
a	O
ship	O
so	O
loaded	O
by	O
any	O
management	O
whatever	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
without	O
some	O
other	O
supply	O
this	O
navigation	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
performed	O
.	O

A	O
supply	O
indeed	O
they	O
have	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
reliance	O
upon	O
it	O
seems	O
at	O
first	O
sight	O
so	O
extremely	O
precarious	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
wonderful	O
such	O
numbers	O
should	O
risque	O
the	O
perishing	O
by	O
the	O
most	O
dreadful	O
of	O
all	O
deaths	O
on	O
the	O
expectation	O
of	O
so	O
casual	O
a	O
relief	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
their	O
only	O
method	O
of	O
recruiting	O
their	O
water	O
is	O
by	O
the	O
rains	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
meet	O
with	O
between	O
the	O
latitudes	O
of	O
30	O

and	O
40	O
deg	O

north	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
they	O
are	O
always	O
prepared	O
to	O
catch	O
.	O

For	O
this	O
purpose	O
they	O
take	O
to	O
sea	O
with	O
them	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
mats	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
whenever	O
the	O
rain	O
descends	O
,	O
they	O
range	O
slopingly	O
against	O
the	O
gunwale	O
from	O
one	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
their	O
lower	O
edges	O
resting	O
on	O
a	O
large	O
split	O
bamboe	O
;	O
whence	O
all	O
the	O
water	O
which	O
falls	O
on	O
the	O
mats	O
drains	O
into	O
the	O

by	O
this	O

as	O

And	O
this	O
method	O
of	O
furnishing	O
themselves	O
with	O
water	O
,	O
however	O
accidental	O
and	O
extraordinary	O
it	O
may	O
at	O

little	O
longer	O

However	O
,	O
though	O
their	O
distresses	O
for	O
fresh	O

are	O
much	O
short	O
of	O
what	O
might	O

expected	O
in	O
so	O

yet	O
there	O
are	O

upon	O
a	O

at	O

which	O
they	O
are	O

The	O
principal	O
of	O
these	O
is	O
the	O

which	O
sometimes	O

with	O

at	O

of	O
which	O
alone	O

The	O
length	O
of	O
time	O
employed	O
in	O
this	O
passage	O
,	O
so	O
much	O
beyond	O
what	O
usually	O
occurs	O
in	O
any	O
other	O
known	O
navigation	O
,	O
is	O
perhaps	O
in	O
part	O
to	O
be	O
imputed	O
to	O
the	O
indolence	O
and	O
unskilfulness	O
of	O
the	O
Spanish	O
sailors	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
an	O
unnecessary	O
degree	O
of	O
caution	O
,	O
on	O
pretence	O
of	O
the	O
great	O
riches	O
of	O
the	O
vessel	O
:	O
for	O
it	O
is	O
said	O
that	O
they	O
rarely	O
set	O
their	O
main-sail	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
often	O
lie	O
by	O
unnecessarily	O
.	O

Thus	O
much	O
is	O
certain	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
instructions	O
given	O
to	O
their	O
captains	O
-LRB-	O
which	O
I	O
have	O
seen	O
-RRB-	O
seem	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
drawn	O
up	O
by	O
such	O
as	O
were	O
more	O
apprehensive	O
of	O
too	O
strong	O
a	O
gale	O
,	O
though	O
favourable	O
,	O
than	O
of	O
the	O
inconveniences	O
and	O
mortality	O
attending	O
a	O
lingering	O
and	O
tedious	O
voyage	O
.	O

For	O
the	O
captain	O
is	O
particularly	O
ordered	O
to	O
make	O
his	O
passage	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
30	O
degrees	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
be	O
extremely	O
careful	O
to	O
stand	O
no	O
farther	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
than	O
is	O
absolutely	O
necessary	O
for	O
the	O
getting	O
a	O
westerly	O
wind	O
.	O

This	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
our	O
conceptions	O
,	O
appears	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
very	O
absurd	O
restriction	O
,	O
since	O
it	O
can	O
scarcely	O
be	O
doubted	O
but	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
higher	O
latitudes	O
the	O
westerly	O
winds	O
are	O
much	O
steadier	O
and	O
brisker	O
than	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
30	O
degrees	O
.	O

Indeed	O
the	O
whole	O
conduct	O
of	O
this	O
navigation	O
seems	O
liable	O
to	O
very	O
great	O
censure	O
:	O
since	O
,	O
if	O
instead	O
of	O
steering	O
E.N.E.	O
into	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
30	O
degrees	O
,	O
they	O
at	O
first	O
stood	O
N.E.	O
or	O
even	O
still	O
more	O
northerly	O
,	O
into	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
40	O
or	O
45	O
degrees	O
,	O
in	O
part	O
of	O
which	O
coast	O
the	O
trade-winds	O
would	O
greatly	O
assist	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
doubt	O
not	O
but	O
by	O
this	O
management	O
they	O
might	O
considerably	O
contract	O
their	O
voyage	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
perform	O
it	O
in	O
half	O
the	O
time	O
which	O
is	O
now	O
allotted	O
for	O
it	O
.	O

This	O
may	O
in	O
some	O
measure	O
be	O
deduced	O
from	O
their	O
own	O
journals	O
;	O
since	O
in	O
those	O
I	O
have	O
seen	O
,	O
it	O
appears	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
often	O
a	O
month	O
or	O
six	O
weeks	O
after	O
their	O
laying	O
the	O
land	O
before	O
they	O
get	O
into	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
30	O
degrees	O
;	O
whereas	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
more	O
northerly	O
course	O
,	O
it	O
might	O
easily	O
be	O
done	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
a	O
fortnight	O
.	O

Now	O
when	O
they	O
were	O

to	O
the	O
northward	O
,	O
the	O
-LCB-	O

winds	O
would	O
soon	O
blow	O
them	O
over	O
to	O
the	O

and	O
they	O
would	O
be	O

The	O

this	O

The	O

But	O
the	O
town	O
is	O
a	O
most	O
wretched	O
place	O

and	O
extremely	O

for	O
the	O

Acapulco	O

except	O
what	O
is	O
brought	O
from	O
a	O
considerable	O

is	O
in	O
all	O

at	O
the	O

When	O
the	O

this	O
port	O

she	O

now	O
the	O

Having	O
mentioned	O
the	O

I	O
must	O
observe	O
that	O
the	O
principal	O
return	O
is	O
always	O
made	O
in	O
silver	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O

of	O
little	O

;	O
the	O
other	O

besides	O
the	O
silver	O
,	O
being	O
some	O
cochineal	O

a	O

the	O

this	O
difference	O
in	O
the	O
cargoe	O
of	O
the	O

to	O

from	O
Manila	PNM

a	O

in	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O

for	O
these	O
two	O

For	O
the	O

being	O
deep	O
laden	O
with	O

not	O
the	O

Her	O

as	O
is	O
consistent	O
with	O
the	O

that	O

I	O
have	O
already	O

in	O

that	O
the	O
return	O
of	O
our	O
barge	O
from	O
the	O
port	O
of	O
Acapulco	PNM
,	O
where	O
she	O
surprized	O
three	O
negro	O
fishermen	O
,	O
gave	O
us	O
inexpressible	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
learnt	O
from	O
our	O
prisoners	O
that	O
the	O
galeon	O
was	O
then	O
preparing	O
to	O
put	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
her	O
departure	O
was	O
fixed	O
,	O
by	O
an	O
edict	O
of	O
the	O
Viceroy	O
of	O
Mexico	PNM
,	O
to	O
the	O
14th	O
of	O
March	O
,	O
N.S.	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
3d	O
of	O
March	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
our	O
reckoning	O
.	O

What	O
related	O
to	O
this	O
Manila	O
ship	O
being	O
the	O
matter	O
to	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
most	O
attentive	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
necessarily	O
the	O
first	O
article	O
of	O
our	O
examination	O
,	O
but	O
having	O
satisfied	O
ourselves	O
upon	O
this	O
head	O
,	O
we	O
then	O
indulged	O
our	O
curiosity	O
in	O
enquiring	O
after	O
other	O
news	O
;	O
when	O
the	O
prisoners	O
informed	O
us	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
received	O
intelligence	O
at	O
Acapulco	PNM
of	O
our	O
having	O
plundered	O
and	O
burnt	O
the	O
town	O
of	O
Paita	PNM
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
on	O
this	O
occasion	O
,	O
the	O
Governor	O
of	O
Acapulco	PNM
had	O
augmented	O
the	O
fortifications	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
taken	O
several	O
precautions	O
to	O
prevent	O
us	O
from	O
forcing	O
our	O
way	O
into	O
the	O
harbour	O
;	O
that	O
in	O
particular	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
planted	O
a	O
guard	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
which	O
lies	O
at	O
the	O
harbour	O
's	O
mouth	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
this	O
guard	O
had	O
been	O
withdrawn	O
but	O
two	O
nights	O
before	O
the	O
arrival	O
of	O
our	O
barge	O
.	O

So	O
that	O
had	O
the	O
barge	O
succeeded	O
in	O
her	O
first	O
attempt	O
,	O
or	O
had	O
she	O
arrived	O
at	O
the	O
port	O
the	O
second	O
time	O
two	O
days	O
sooner	O
,	O
she	O
could	O
scarcely	O
have	O
avoided	O
being	O
seized	O
on	O
;	O
or	O
if	O
she	O
had	O
escaped	O
,	O
it	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
with	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
the	O
greatest	O
part	O
of	O
her	O
crew	O
,	O
as	O
she	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
under	O
the	O
fire	O
of	O
the	O
guard	O
before	O
she	O
had	O
known	O
her	O
danger	O
.	O

The	O
withdrawing	O
of	O
this	O
guard	O
was	O
a	O
circumstance	O
that	O
gave	O
us	O
much	O
pleasure	O
,	O
since	O
it	O
seemed	O
to	O
demonstrate	O
not	O
only	O
that	O
the	O
enemy	O
had	O
not	O
as	O
yet	O
discovered	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
likewise	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
now	O
no	O
farther	O
apprehensions	O
of	O
our	O
visiting	O
their	O
coast	O
.	O

Indeed	O
the	O
prisoners	O
assured	O
us	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
knowledge	O
of	O
our	O
being	O
in	O
those	O
seas	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
therefore	O
flattered	O
themselves	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
long	O
interval	O
-LCB-	O
231	O
-RCB-	O
from	O
our	O
taking	O
of	O
Paita	PNM
,	O
we	O
had	O
steered	O
another	O
course	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
consider	O
the	O
opinion	O
of	O
these	O
negro	O
prisoners	O
as	O
so	O
authentick	O
a	O
proof	O
of	O
our	O
being	O
hitherto	O
concealed	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
withdrawing	O
of	O
the	O
guard	O
from	O
the	O
harbour	O
's	O
mouth	O
;	O
for	O
this	O
being	O
the	O
action	O
of	O
the	O
governor	O
,	O
was	O
of	O
all	O
arguments	O
the	O
most	O
convincing	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
might	O
be	O
supposed	O
to	O
have	O
intelligence	O
with	O
which	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
were	O
unacquainted	O
.	O

Satisfied	O
therefore	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
undiscovered	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
day	O
was	O
fixed	O
for	O
the	O
departure	O
of	O
the	O
galeon	O
from	O
Acapulco	PNM
,	O
we	O
made	O
all	O
necessary	O
preparations	O
,	O
and	O
waited	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
impatience	O
for	O
the	O
important	O
moment	O
.	O

As	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
19th	O
of	O
February	O
when	O
the	O
barge	O
returned	O
and	O
brought	O
us	O
our	O
intelligence	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
galeon	O
was	O
not	O
to	O
sail	O
till	O
the	O
3d	O
of	O
March	O
,	O
the	O
commodore	O
resolved	O
to	O
continue	O
the	O
greatest	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
intermediate	O
time	O
on	O
his	O
present	O
station	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
of	O
Acapulco	PNM
,	O
conceiving	O
that	O
in	O
this	O
situation	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
less	O
danger	O
of	O
his	O
being	O
seen	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
circumstance	O
that	O
could	O
deprive	O
us	O
of	O
the	O
immense	O
treasure	O
on	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
at	O
present	O
so	O
eagerly	O
fixed	O
our	O
thoughts	O
.	O

During	O
this	O
interval	O
we	O
were	O
employed	O
in	O
scrubbing	O
and	O
cleansing	O
our	O
ships	O
bottoms	O
,	O
in	O
bringing	O
them	O
into	O
their	O
most	O

trim	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
regulating	O
the	O
orders	O

and	O
positions	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
observed	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
should	O
arrive	O
off	O
Acapulco	PNM
,	O
and	O
the	O
time	O
appointed	O
for	O
the	O
departure	O
of	O
the	O
galeon	O
should	O
draw	O
nigh	O

It	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
first	O
of	O

made	O
the	O
high	O

the	O

to	O
make	O
a	O

whether	O

to	O

whilst	O
the	O

was	O
to	O

the	O

at	O

Besides	O
the	O
care	O
we	O
had	O
taken	O
to	O
prevent	O
the	O
galeon	O
from	O
passing	O
by	O
us	O
unobserved	O

we	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
inattentive	O
to	O
the	O
means	O
of	O
engaging	O
her	O
to	O
advantage	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
up	O
with	O
her	O
,	O
for	O
considering	O
the	O
thinness	O
of	O
our	O
crews	O

and	O
the	O

given	O

her	O

this	O
was	O
a	O
consideration	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
neglected	O

As	O
we	O
supposed	O
that	O
none	O
of	O
our	O
ships	O
but	O
the	O

Centurion	O

were	O
capable	O

At	O
the	O

for	O
the	O

of	O

of	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
a	O

promised	O
them	O
that	O
on	O
their	O
good	O
behaviour	O
they	O
should	O
have	O
their	O
freedom	O

As	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
almost	O
every	O

trained	O
to	O
the	O
management	O
of	O
the	O

from	O
their	O

in	O

for	O
the	O
kind	O
usage	O
they	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
amongst	O
us	O

they	O
seemed	O
disposed	O
to	O
exert	O
themselves	O
to	O
the	O
-LCB-	O

-RCB-	O
utmost	O
of	O
their	O
power	O
,	O
whenever	O
we	O
should	O

occasion	O
for	O
them	O

Being	O
thus	O
prepared	O
for	O
the	O
reception	O
of	O
the	O
galeon	O
,	O
we	O
expected	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
impatience	O
,	O
the	O
often	O
mentioned	O
3d	O
of	O
March	O
,	O
the	O
day	O
fixed	O
for	O
her	O
departure	O
.	O

No	O
sooner	O
did	O
that	O
day	O
dawn	O
than	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
most	O
eagerly	O
engaged	O
in	O
looking	O
out	O
towards	O
Acapulco	O
,	O
from	O
whence	O
neither	O
the	O
casual	O
duties	O
on	O
board	O
nor	O
the	O
calls	O
of	O
hunger	O
could	O
easily	O
divert	O
our	O
eyes	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
so	O
strangely	O
prepossessed	O
with	O
the	O
certainty	O
of	O
our	O
intelligence	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
an	O
assurance	O
of	O
her	O
coming	O
out	O
of	O
port	O
,	O
that	O
some	O
or	O
other	O
amongst	O
us	O
were	O
constantly	O
imagining	O
that	O
they	O
discovered	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
cutters	O
returning	O
with	O
a	O
signal	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
extreme	O
vexation	O
,	O
both	O
this	O
day	O
and	O
the	O
succeeding	O
night	O
passed	O
over	O
without	O
any	O
news	O
of	O
the	O
galeon	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
yet	O
despair	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
all	O
heartily	O
disposed	O
to	O
flatter	O
ourselves	O
that	O
some	O
unforeseen	O
accident	O
had	O
intervened	O
,	O
which	O
might	O
have	O
put	O
off	O
her	O
departure	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
;	O
and	O
suggestions	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
occurred	O
in	O
plenty	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
knew	O
that	O
the	O
time	O
fixed	O
by	O
the	O
viceroy	O
for	O
her	O
sailing	O
was	O
often	O
prolonged	O
on	O
the	O
petition	O
of	O
the	O
merchants	O
of	O
Mexico	PNM
.	O

Thus	O
we	O
kept	O
up	O
our	O
hopes	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
abate	O
of	O
our	O
vigilance	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
the	O
7th	O
of	O
March	O
was	O
Sunday	O
,	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
Passion	O
week	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
observed	O
by	O
the	O
Papists	O
with	O
great	O
strictness	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
total	O
cessation	O
from	O
all	O
kinds	O
of	O
labour	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
no	O
ship	O
is	O
permitted	O
to	O
stir	O
out	O
of	O
port	O
during	O
the	O
whole	O
week	O
,	O
this	O
quieted	O
our	O
apprehensions	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
disposed	O
us	O
not	O
to	O
expect	O
the	O
galeon	O
till	O
the	O
week	O
following	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
Friday	O
in	O
this	O
week	O
our	O
cutters	O
returned	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
officers	O
on	O
board	O
them	O
were	O
very	O
confident	O
that	O
the	O
galeon	O
was	O
still	O
in	O
port	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
she	O
could	O
not	O
possibly	O
have	O
come	O
out	O
but	O
they	O
must	O
have	O
seen	O
her	O
.	O

The	O
Monday	O
morning	O
following	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
15th	O
of	O
March	O
,	O
the	O
cutters	O
were	O
again	O
dispatched	O
to	O
their	O
old	O
station	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
hopes	O
were	O
once	O
more	O
indulged	O
in	O
as	O
sanguine	O
prepossessions	O
as	O
before	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
a	O
week	O
's	O
time	O
our	O
eagerness	O
was	O
greatly	O
abated	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
general	O
dejection	O
and	O
despondency	O
took	O
place	O
in	O
its	O
room	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
true	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
some	O
few	O
amongst	O
us	O
who	O
still	O
kept	O
up	O
their	O
spirits	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
very	O
ingenious	O
in	O
finding	O
out	O
reasons	O
to	O
satisfy	O
themselves	O
that	O
the	O
disappointment	O
we	O
had	O
hitherto	O
met	O
with	O
had	O
only	O
been	O
occasioned	O
by	O
a	O
casual	O
delay	O
of	O
the	O
galeon	O
,	O
which	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
would	O
remove	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
by	O
a	O
total	O
suspension	O
of	O
her	O
departure	O
-LCB-	O
234	O
-RCB-	O
for	O
the	O
whole	O
season	O
.	O

But	O
these	O
speculations	O
were	O
not	O
adopted	O
by	O
the	O
generality	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
persuaded	O
that	O
the	O
enemy	O
had	O
,	O
by	O
some	O
accident	O
,	O
discovered	O
our	O
being	O
upon	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
therefore	O
laid	O
an	O
embargo	O
on	O
the	O
galeon	O
till	O
next	O
year	O
.	O

And	O
indeed	O
this	O
persuasion	O
was	O
but	O
too	O
well	O
founded	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
afterwards	O
learnt	O
that	O
our	O
barge	O
,	O
when	O
sent	O
on	O
the	O
discovery	O
of	O
the	O
port	O
of	O
Acapulco	PNM
,	O
had	O
been	O
seen	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
this	O
circumstance	O
-LRB-	O
no	O
embarkations	O
but	O
canoes	O
ever	O
frequenting	O
that	O
coast	O
-RRB-	O
was	O
to	O
them	O
a	O
sufficient	O
proof	O
of	O
the	O
neighbourhood	O
of	O
our	O
squadron	O
;	O
on	O
which	O
they	O
stopped	O
the	O
galeon	O
till	O
the	O
succeeding	O
year	O
.	O

The	O
commodore	O
himself	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
declared	O
not	O
his	O
opinion	O
,	O
was	O
yet	O
in	O
his	O
own	O
thoughts	O
apprehensive	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
discovered	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
departure	O
of	O
the	O
galeon	O
was	O
put	O
off	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
had	O
,	O
in	O
consequence	O
of	O
this	O
opinion	O
,	O
formed	O
a	O
plan	O
for	O
possessing	O
himself	O
of	O
Acapulco	PNM
,	O
because	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
doubt	O
but	O
the	O
treasure	O
as	O
yet	O
remained	O
in	O
the	O
town	O
,	O
even	O
though	O
the	O
orders	O
for	O
dispatching	O
of	O
the	O
galeon	O
were	O
countermanded	O
.	O

Indeed	O
the	O
place	O
was	O
too	O
well	O
defended	O
to	O
be	O
carried	O
by	O
an	O
open	O
attempt	O
,	O
since	O
,	O
besides	O
the	O
garrison	O
and	O
the	O
crew	O
of	O
the	O
galeon	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
in	O
it	O
at	O
least	O
a	O
thousand	O
men	O
well	O
armed	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
marched	O
thither	O
as	O
guards	O
to	O
the	O
treasure	O
,	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
brought	O
down	O
from	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Mexico	PNM
,	O
for	O
the	O
roads	O
thereabouts	O
are	O
so	O
much	O
infested	O
either	O
by	O
independent	O
Indians	O
or	O
fugitives	O
that	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
never	O
trust	O
the	O
silver	O
without	O
an	O
armed	O
force	O
to	O
protect	O
it	O
.	O

Besides	O
,	O
had	O
the	O
strength	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
been	O
less	O
considerable	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
as	O
might	O
not	O
have	O
appeared	O
superior	O
to	O
the	O
efforts	O
of	O
our	O
squadron	O
,	O
yet	O
a	O
declared	O
attack	O
would	O
have	O
prevented	O
us	O
receiving	O
any	O
advantages	O
from	O
its	O
success	O
,	O
for	O
upon	O
the	O
first	O
discovery	O
of	O
our	O
squadron	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
treasure	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
ordered	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
hours	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
reach	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
our	O
conquest	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
only	O
a	O
desolate	O
town	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
found	O
nothing	O
that	O
could	O
in	O
the	O
least	O
have	O
countervailed	O
the	O
fatigue	O
and	O
hazard	O
of	O
the	O
undertaking	O
.	O

For	O
these	O
reasons	O
,	O
the	O
surprisal	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
method	O
that	O
could	O
at	O
all	O
answer	O
our	O
purpose	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
the	O
manner	O
in	O
which	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
proposed	O
to	O
conduct	O
this	O
enterprize	O
was	O
,	O
by	O
setting	O
sail	O
with	O
the	O
squadron	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
time	O
enough	O
to	O
arrive	O
at	O
the	O
port	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
.	O

As	O
there	O
-LCB-	O
235	O
-RCB-	O
is	O
no	O
danger	O
on	O
that	O
coast	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
stood	O
boldly	O
for	O
the	O
harbour	O
's	O
mouth	O
,	O
where	O
he	O
expected	O
to	O
arrive	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
might	O
have	O
entered	O
,	O
before	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
were	O
acquainted	O
with	O
his	O
designs	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
run	O
into	O
the	O
harbour	O
,	O
he	O
intended	O
to	O
have	O
pushed	O
two	O
hundred	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
on	O
shore	O
in	O
his	O
boats	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
immediately	O
to	O
attempt	O
the	O
fort	O
,	O
whilst	O
he	O
,	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
with	O
his	O
ships	O
,	O
was	O
employed	O
in	O
firing	O
upon	O
the	O
town	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
batteries	O
.	O

And	O
these	O
different	O
operations	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
executed	O
with	O
great	O
regularity	O
,	O
could	O
hardly	O
have	O
failed	O
of	O
succeeding	O
against	O
an	O
enemy	O
who	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
prevented	O
by	O
the	O
suddenness	O
of	O
the	O
attack	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
daylight	O
,	O
from	O
concerting	O
any	O
measures	O
for	O
their	O
defence	O
.	O

So	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
extremely	O
probable	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
carried	O
the	O
fort	O
by	O
storm	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
other	O
batteries	O
,	O
being	O
open	O
behind	O
,	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
soon	O
abandoned	O
,	O
after	O
which	O
,	O
the	O
town	O
and	O
its	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
treasure	O
,	O
must	O
necessarily	O
have	O
fallen	O
into	O
our	O
hands	O
.	O

For	O
the	O
place	O
is	O
so	O
cooped	O
up	O
with	O
mountains	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
scarcely	O
possible	O
to	O
escape	O
out	O
of	O
it	O
but	O
by	O
the	O
great	O
road	O
which	O
passes	O
under	O
the	O
fort	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
project	O
which	O
the	O
commodore	O
had	O
thus	O
far	O
settled	O
generally	O
in	O
his	O
thoughts	O
,	O
but	O
when	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
inquire	O
into	O
such	O
circumstances	O
as	O
were	O
necessary	O
to	O
be	O
considered	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
regulate	O
the	O
particulars	O
of	O
its	O
execution	O
,	O
he	O
found	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
difficulty	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
being	O
insuperable	O
,	O
occasioned	O
the	O
enterprize	O
to	O
be	O
laid	O
aside	O
;	O
as	O
on	O
examining	O
the	O
prisoners	O
about	O
the	O
winds	O
which	O
prevail	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
he	O
learnt	O
-LRB-	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
afterwards	O
confirmed	O
by	O
the	O
officers	O
of	O
our	O
cutters	O
-RRB-	O
that	O
nearer	O
in	O
shore	O
there	O
was	O
always	O
a	O
dead	O
calm	O
for	O
the	O
greatest	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
towards	O

,	O
when	O
a	O
gale	O
sprung	O
up	O
,	O
it	O
constantly	O
blew	O
off	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
setting	O
sail	O
from	O
our	O
present	O
station	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
and	O
arriving	O
at	O
Acapulco	PNM
before	O
daylight	O
,	O
was	O
impossible	O
.	O

This	O
scheme	O
,	O
as	O
hath	O
been	O
said	O
,	O
was	O
formed	O
by	O
the	O
commodore	O
upon	O
a	O
supposition	O
that	O
the	O
galeon	O
was	O
detained	O
till	O
the	O
next	O
year	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
opinion	O
only	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
founded	O
on	O
intelligence	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
possibility	O
that	O
she	O
might	O
still	O
put	O
to	O
sea	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
,	O
the	O
commodore	O
thought	O
it	O
prudent	O
to	O
continue	O
cruising	O
on	O
his	O
present	O
station	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
the	O
necessary	O
attention	O
to	O
his	O
stores	O
of	O
wood	O
and	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
convenient	O
season	O
for	O
his	O
future	O
passage	O
to	O
China	PNM
,	O
would	O
give	O
him	O
leave	O
.	O

And	O
therefore	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
cutters	O
had	O
been	O
-LCB-	O
236	O
-RCB-	O
ordered	O
to	O
remain	O
before	O
Acapulco	O
till	O
the	O
23d	O
of	O
March	O
,	O
the	O
squadron	O
did	O
not	O
change	O
its	O
position	O
till	O
that	O
day	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
cutters	O
not	O
appearing	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
some	O
pain	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
apprehending	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
suffered	O
either	O
from	O
the	O
enemy	O
or	O
the	O
weather	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
were	O
relieved	O
from	O
our	O
concern	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
discovered	O
them	O
,	O
though	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
leeward	O
of	O
the	O
squadron	O
.	O

We	O
bore	O
down	O
to	O
them	O
and	O
took	O
them	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
informed	O
by	O
them	O
that	O
,	O
conformable	O
to	O
their	O
orders	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
left	O
their	O
station	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
,	O
without	O
having	O
seen	O
anything	O
of	O
the	O
galeon	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
reason	O
of	O
their	O
being	O
so	O
far	O
to	O
the	O
leeward	O
of	O
us	O
was	O
a	O
strong	O
current	O
which	O
had	O
driven	O
the	O
whole	O
squadron	O
to	O
windward	O
.	O

And	O
here	O
it	O
is	O
necessary	O
to	O
mention	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
by	O
information	O
which	O
was	O
afterwards	O
received	O
,	O
it	O
appeared	O
that	O
this	O
prolongation	O
of	O
our	O
cruise	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
prudent	O
measure	O
,	O
and	O
afforded	O
us	O
no	O
contemptible	O
chance	O
of	O
seizing	O
the	O
treasure	O
on	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
so	O
long	O
fixed	O
our	O
thoughts	O
.	O

For	O
after	O
the	O
embargo	O
was	O
laid	O
on	O
the	O
galeon	O
,	O
as	O
is	O
before	O
mentioned	O
,	O
the	O
persons	O
principally	O
interested	O
in	O
the	O
cargo	O
dispatched	O
several	O
expresses	O
to	O
Mexico	PNM
,	O
to	O
beg	O
that	O
she	O
might	O
still	O
be	O
permitted	O
to	O
depart	O
.	O

It	O
seems	O
they	O
knew	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
accounts	O
sent	O
from	O
Paita	PNM
,	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
more	O
than	O
three	O
hundred	O
men	O
in	O
all	O
,	O
whence	O
they	O
insisted	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
nothing	O
to	O
be	O
feared	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
galeon	O
,	O
carrying	O
above	O
twice	O
as	O
many	O
hands	O
as	O
our	O
whole	O
squadron	O
,	O
would	O
be	O
greatly	O
an	O
overmatch	O
for	O
us	O
.	O

And	O
though	O
the	O
viceroy	O
was	O
inflexible	O
,	O
yet	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
account	O
of	O
their	O
representation	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
kept	O
ready	O
for	O
the	O
sea	O
near	O
three	O
weeks	O
after	O
the	O
first	O
order	O
came	O
to	O
detain	O
her	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
taken	O
up	O
the	O
cutters	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
ships	O
being	O
joined	O
,	O
the	O
commodore	O
made	O
a	O
signal	O
to	O
speak	O
with	O
their	O
commanders	O
;	O
and	O
upon	O
enquiry	O
into	O
the	O
stock	O
of	O
fresh	O
water	O
remaining	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
squadron	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
found	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
very	O
slender	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
under	O
a	O
necessity	O
of	O
quitting	O
our	O
station	O
to	O
procure	O
a	O
fresh	O
supply	O
.	O

Consulting	O
what	O
place	O
was	O
the	O
properest	O
for	O
this	O
purpose	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
agreed	O
that	O
the	O
harbour	O
of	O
Seguataneio	PNM
or	O
Chequetan	O
being	O
the	O
nearest	O
,	O
was	O
,	O
on	O
that	O
account	O
,	O
the	O
most	O
eligible	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
immediately	O
resolved	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
our	O
way	O
thither	O
.	O

But	O
that	O
,	O
even	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
recruiting	O
our	O
water	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
not	O
totally	O
abandon	O
our	O
views	O
upon	O
the	O
galeon	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
from	O
certain	O
intelligence	O
of	O
our	O
being	O
employed	O
at	O
Chequetan	PNM
,	O
-LCB-	O
237	O
-RCB-	O
might	O
venture	O
to	O
slip	O
out	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
our	O
cutter	O
,	O
under	O
the	O
command	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Hughes	O
,	O
the	O
lieutenant	O
of	O
the	O
_	O
Tryal	O
's	O
_	O
prize	O
,	O
was	O
ordered	O
to	O
cruise	O
off	O
the	O
port	O
of	O
Acapulco	PNM
for	O
twenty-four	O
days	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
galeon	O
should	O
set	O
sail	O
in	O
that	O
interval	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
be	O
speedily	O
informed	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

In	O
pursuance	O
of	O
these	O
resolutions	O
we	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
ply	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
to	O
gain	O
our	O
intended	O
port	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
often	O
interrupted	O
in	O
our	O
progress	O
by	O
calms	O
and	O
adverse	O
currents	O
.	O

At	O
these	O
intervals	O
we	O
employed	O
ourselves	O
in	O
taking	O
out	O
the	O
most	O
valuable	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
cargoes	O
of	O
the	O
_	O
Carmelo	PNM

and	O
_	O

_	O
prizes	O
,	O
which	O
two	O
ships	O
we	O
intended	O
to	O
destroy	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
tolerably	O
cleared	O
them	O
.	O

By	O
the	O
1st	O
of	O
April	O
we	O
were	O
so	O
far	O
advanced	O
towards	O
Seguataneio	O
that	O
we	O
thought	O
it	O
expedient	O
to	O
send	O
out	O
two	O
boats	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
range	O
along	O
the	O
coast	O
to	O
discover	O
the	O
watering-place	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
gone	O
some	O
days	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
water	O
being	O
now	O
very	O
short	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
particular	O
felicity	O
to	O
us	O
that	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
daily	O
supplies	O
of	O
turtle	O
,	O
for	O
had	O
we	O
been	O
entirely	O
confined	O
to	O

provisions	O
,	O
we	O
must	O
have	O
suffered	O
extremely	O
in	O
so	O
warm	O
a	O
climate	O
.	O

Indeed	O
our	O
present	O
circumstances	O
were	O
sufficiently	O
alarming	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
the	O
most	O
considerate	O
amongst	O
us	O
as	O
much	O
concern	O
as	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
numerous	O
perils	O
we	O
had	O
hitherto	O
encountered	O
,	O
for	O
our	O
boats	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
conceived	O
by	O
their	O
not	O

had	O
not	O
as	O
yet	O
found	O
a	O
place	O
proper	O
to	O

at	O

and	O
by	O
the	O
leakage	O
of	O
our	O
casks	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
accidents	O

we	O
had	O
not	O
ten	O
days	O
water	O
on	O

the	O

,	O
so	O
that	O
from	O
the	O
known	O
difficulty	O
of	O
procuring	O
water	O
on	O
this	O
coast	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
little	O

we	O
had	O
on	O

were	O

most	O

of	O

But	O
these	O

were	O
at	O

happily	O
ended	O
:	O
for	O

about	O
seven	O
miles	O

The	O

It	O

There	O

a	O
beach	O

which	O
extends	O
eighteen	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
harbour	O
of	O
Acapulco	PNM
to	O
the	O
westward	O
,	O
against	O
which	O
the	O
sea	O
breaks	O
so	O
violently	O
that	O
with	O
our	O
boats	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
impossible	O
to	O
land	O
on	O
any	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
yet	O
the	O
ground	O
is	O
so	O
clean	O
that	O
during	O
the	O
fair	O

ships	O
may	O
anchor	O

great	O
safety	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
or	O
two	O
from	O
the	O

The	O
land	O
adjacent	O
to	O
this	O
beach	O
is	O
generally	O
low	O
,	O
full	O
of	O
villages	O

and	O
planted	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
trees	O

and	O
on	O
the	O
tops	O
of	O
some	O
small	O
eminencies	O
there	O
are	O
several	O

so	O
that	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
the	O

affords	O
a	O
very	O

prospect	O

the	O

part	O

which	O
is	O
the	O
part	O
here	O
described	O

extends	O
some	O
leagues	O
back	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
where	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
bounded	O
by	O
a	O
chain	O
of	O
mountains	O
which	O
stretch	O
to	O
a	O
considerable	O
distance	O
on	O
either	O
side	O
of	O
Acapulco	PNM
.	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
most	O
remarkable	O
particularity	O
that	O
in	O
this	O
whole	O
extent	O
,	O
containing	O
in	O
appearance	O
the	O
most	O
populous	O
and	O
best	O
planted	O
district	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
coast	O

there	O
should	O
be	O
neither	O
canoes	O

embarkations	O
,	O
either	O
for	O
fishing	O
,	O
coasting	O
,	O
or	O
for	O
pleasure	O
.	O

This	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
imputed	O
to	O
the	O
difficulty	O
of	O
landing	O
,	O
because	O
in	O
many	O
parts	O
of	O
Africa	PNM
and	O
Asia	PNM
,	O
where	O
the	O

inconvenience	O

the	O
inhabitants	O
have	O
provided	O
against	O
it	O
by	O
vessels	O
of	O
a	O
peculiar	O
fabric	O
.	O

I	O
therefore	O
conceive	O
that	O
the	O
government	O
,	O
to	O
prevent	O
smuggling	O
,	O
have	O
prohibited	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
all	O

with	O
the	O
loss	O
only	O
of	O
his	O
hat	O
and	O
his	O
pistol	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
dropped	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
.	O

Our	O
people	O
pursued	O
him	O
in	O
hopes	O
of	O
discovering	O
the	O
village	O
or	O
habitation	O
which	O
he	O
would	O
retreat	O
to	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
the	O
advantage	O
of	O
being	O
on	O
horseback	O
,	O
they	O
soon	O
lost	O
sight	O
of	O
him	O
.	O

Notwithstanding	O
his	O
escape	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
unwilling	O
to	O
come	O
back	O
without	O
making	O
some	O
discovery	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
still	O
followed	O
the	O
track	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
,	O
till	O
the	O
heat	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
increasing	O
,	O
and	O
finding	O
no	O
water	O
to	O
quench	O
their	O
thirst	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
first	O
obliged	O
to	O
halt	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
resolved	O
to	O
return	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
they	O
saw	O
no	O
signs	O
of	O
plantations	O
or	O
cultivated	O
land	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
any	O
village	O
or	O
settlement	O
near	O
them	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
to	O
leave	O
no	O
means	O
untried	O
of	O
procuring	O
some	O
intercourse	O
with	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
the	O
officers	O
stuck	O
up	O
several	O
poles	O
in	O
the	O
road	O
,	O
to	O
which	O
were	O
affixed	O
declarations	O
written	O
in	O
Spanish	O
,	O
encouraging	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
to	O
come	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
harbour	O
to	O
traffic	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
giving	O
them	O
the	O
strongest	O
assurances	O
of	O
a	O
kind	O
reception	O
,	O
and	O
faithful	O
payment	O
for	O
any	O
provisions	O
they	O
should	O
bring	O
us	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
doubtless	O
a	O
very	O
prudent	O
measure	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
produced	O
no	O
effect	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
never	O
saw	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
during	O
the	O
whole	O
time	O
of	O
our	O
continuance	O
at	O
this	O
port	O
of	O
Chequetan	PNM
.	O

Indeed	O
it	O
were	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
wished	O
that	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
upon	O
the	O
division	O
of	O
the	O
path	O
,	O
had	O
taken	O
the	O
western	O
road	O
instead	O
of	O
the	O
eastern	O
;	O
for	O
then	O
they	O
would	O
soon	O
have	O
been	O
led	O
to	O
a	O
village	O
or	O
town	O
,	O
which	O
some	O
Spanish	O
manuscripts	O
mention	O
as	O
being	O
in	O
the	O
neighbourhood	O
of	O
this	O
port	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
we	O
afterwards	O
learnt	O
was	O
not	O
above	O
two	O
miles	O
from	O
that	O
turning	O
.	O

And	O
on	O
this	O
occasion	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
avoid	O
mentioning	O
another	O
adventure	O
which	O
happened	O
to	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
bay	PNM
of	PNM
Petaplan	PNM
,	O
as	O
it	O
may	O
greatly	O
assist	O
the	O
reader	O
in	O
forming	O
a	O
just	O
idea	O
of	O
the	O
temper	O
and	O
resolution	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
of	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

Some	O
time	O
after	O
our	O
arrival	O
at	O
Chequetan	PNM
,	O
Lieutenant	O
Brett	O
was	O
sent	O
by	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
-LCB-	O
244	O
-RCB-	O
with	O
two	O
of	O
our	O
boats	O
under	O
his	O
command	O
,	O
to	O
examine	O
the	O
coast	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
,	O
particularly	O
to	O
make	O
observations	O
on	O
the	O
bay	O
and	O
watering-place	O
of	O
Petaplan	PNM
.	O

As	O
Mr.	O
Brett	O
with	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
boats	O
was	O
preparing	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
towards	O
the	O
hill	O
of	O
Petaplan	PNM
,	O
he	O
accidentally	O
looking	O
across	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
perceived	O
on	O
the	O
opposite	O
strand	O
three	O
small	O
squadrons	O
of	O
horse	O
parading	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
and	O
seeming	O
to	O
advance	O
towards	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
he	O
proposed	O
to	O
land	O
.	O

On	O
sight	O
of	O
this	O
he	O
immediately	O
put	O
off	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
had	O
but	O
sixteen	O
men	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
over	O
the	O
bay	O
towards	O
them	O
:	O
and	O
he	O
soon	O
came	O
near	O
enough	O
to	O
perceive	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
mounted	O
on	O
very	O
sightly	O
horses	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
armed	O
with	O
carbines	O
and	O
lances	O
.	O

On	O
seeing	O
him	O
make	O
towards	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
formed	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
and	O
seemed	O
resolved	O
to	O
dispute	O
his	O
landing	O
,	O
firing	O
several	O
distant	O
shot	O
at	O
him	O
as	O
he	O
drew	O
near	O
,	O
till	O
at	O
last	O
the	O
boat	O
being	O
arrived	O
within	O
a	O
reasonable	O
distance	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
advanced	O
squadron	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Brett	O
ordered	O
his	O
people	O
to	O
fire	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
this	O
resolute	O
cavalry	O
instantly	O
ran	O
with	O
great	O
confusion	O
into	O
the	O
wood	O
through	O
a	O
small	O
opening	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
precipitate	O
flight	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
horses	O
fell	O
down	O
and	O
threw	O
his	O
rider	O
;	O
but	O
whether	O
he	O
was	O
wounded	O
or	O
not	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
discern	O
,	O
for	O
both	O
man	O
and	O
horse	O
soon	O
got	O
up	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
followed	O
the	O
rest	O
into	O
the	O
wood	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
meantime	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
squadrons	O
were	O
calm	O
spectators	O
of	O
the	O
rout	O
of	O
their	O
comrades	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
drawn	O
up	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
behind	O
,	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
reach	O
of	O
our	O
shot	O
,	O
having	O
halted	O
on	O
our	O
first	O
approach	O
,	O
and	O
never	O
advancing	O
a	O
step	O
afterwards	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
doubtless	O
fortunate	O
for	O
our	O
people	O
that	O
the	O
enemy	O
acted	O
with	O
so	O
little	O
prudence	O
,	O
and	O
exerted	O
so	O
little	O
spirit	O
,	O
since	O
had	O
they	O
concealed	O
themselves	O
till	O
our	O
men	O
had	O
landed	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
scarcely	O
possible	O
but	O
all	O
the	O
boat	O
's	O
crew	O
must	O
have	O
fallen	O
into	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
were	O
not	O
much	O
short	O
of	O
two	O
hundred	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
whole	O
number	O
with	O
Mr.	O
Brett	O
only	O
amounted	O
to	O
sixteen	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
discovery	O
of	O
so	O
considerable	O
a	O
force	O
collected	O
in	O
this	O
bay	O
of	O
Petaplan	PNM
obliged	O
us	O
constantly	O
to	O
keep	O
a	O
boat	O
or	O
two	O
before	O
it	O
:	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
apprehensive	O
that	O
the	O
cutter	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
left	O
to	O
cruise	O
off	O
Acapulco	PNM
,	O
might	O
on	O
her	O
return	O
be	O
surprized	O
by	O
the	O
enemy	O
,	O
if	O
she	O
did	O
not	O
receive	O
timely	O
information	O
of	O
her	O
danger	O
.	O

But	O
now	O
to	O
proceed	O
with	O
the	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
harbour	O
of	O
Chequetan	PNM
.	O

After	O
our	O
unsuccessful	O
attempt	O
to	O
engage	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
-LCB-	O
245	O
-RCB-	O
the	O
country	O
to	O
furnish	O
us	O
with	O
the	O
necessaries	O
we	O
wanted	O
,	O
we	O
desisted	O
from	O
any	O
more	O
endeavours	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
nature	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
be	O
contented	O
with	O
what	O
we	O
could	O
procure	O
for	O
ourselves	O
in	O
the	O
neighbourhood	O
of	O
the	O
port	O
.	O

We	O
caught	O
fish	O
here	O
in	O
tolerable	O
quantities	O
,	O
especially	O
when	O
the	O
smoothness	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
permitted	O
us	O
to	O
hale	O
the	O
seyne	O
.	O

Amongst	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
we	O
got	O
cavallies	O
,	O
breams	O
,	O
mullets	O
,	O
soles	O
,	O
fiddle-fish	O
,	O
sea-eggs	O
,	O
and	O
lobsters	O
:	O
and	O
we	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
no	O
other	O
place	O
,	O
met	O
with	O
that	O
extraordinary	O
fish	O
called	O
the	O
torpedo	O
,	O
or	O
numbing-fish	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
in	O
shape	O
very	O
like	O
the	O
fiddle-fish	O
,	O
and	O
is	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
known	O
from	O
it	O
but	O
by	O
a	O
brown	O
circular	O
spot	O
about	O
the	O
bigness	O
of	O
a	O
crown	O
piece	O
near	O
the	O
centre	O
of	O
its	O
back	O
.	O

Perhaps	O
its	O
figure	O
will	O
be	O
better	O
understood	O
when	O
I	O
say	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
flat	O
fish	O
much	O
resembling	O
the	O
thorn-back	O
.	O

This	O
fish	O
,	O
the	O
torpedo	O
,	O
is	O
indeed	O
of	O
a	O
most	O
singular	O
nature	O
,	O
productive	O
of	O
the	O
strangest	O
effects	O
on	O
the	O
human	O
body	O
:	O
for	O
whoever	O
handles	O
it	O
,	O
or	O
happens	O
even	O
to	O
set	O
his	O
foot	O
upon	O
it	O
,	O
is	O
presently	O
seized	O
with	O
a	O
numbness	O
all	O
over	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
which	O
is	O
more	O
distinguishable	O
in	O
that	O
limb	O
which	O
was	O
in	O
immediate	O
contact	O
with	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
same	O
effect	O
too	O
will	O
be	O
in	O
some	O
degree	O
produced	O
by	O
touching	O
the	O
fish	O
with	O
anything	O
held	O
in	O
the	O
hand	O
,	O
since	O
I	O
myself	O
had	O
a	O
considerable	O
degree	O
of	O
numbness	O
conveyed	O
to	O
my	O
right	O
arm	O
,	O
through	O
a	O
walking	O
cane	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
rested	O
on	O
the	O
body	O
of	O
the	O
fish	O
for	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
only	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
make	O
no	O
doubt	O
but	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
much	O
more	O
sensibly	O
affected	O
had	O
not	O
the	O
fish	O
been	O
near	O
expiring	O
when	O
I	O
made	O
the	O
experiment	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
observable	O
that	O
this	O
influence	O
acts	O
with	O
most	O
vigour	O
upon	O
the	O
fish	O
's	O
being	O
first	O
taken	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
entirely	O
ceases	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
dead	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
then	O
handled	O
,	O
or	O
even	O
eaten	O
,	O
without	O
any	O
inconvenience	O
.	O

I	O
shall	O
only	O
add	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
numbness	O
of	O
my	O
arm	O
upon	O
this	O
occasion	O
did	O
not	O
go	O
off	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
accounts	O
of	O
some	O
naturalists	O
gave	O
me	O
reason	O
to	O
expect	O
,	O
but	O
diminished	O
gradually	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
some	O
sensation	O
of	O
it	O
remaining	O
till	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
.	O

To	O
the	O
account	O
given	O
of	O
the	O
fish	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
here	O
I	O
must	O
add	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
turtle	O
now	O
grew	O
scarce	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
none	O
in	O
this	O
harbour	O
of	O
Chequetan	O
,	O
yet	O
our	O
boats	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
stationed	O
off	O
Petaplan	O
,	O
often	O
supplied	O
us	O
therewith	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
food	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
long	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
confined	O
to	O
-LRB-	O
since	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
fresh	O
provisions	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
tasted	O
during	O
near	O
six	O
months	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
were	O
far	O
from	O
-LCB-	O
246	O
-RCB-	O
being	O
cloyed	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
or	O
from	O
finding	O
that	O
the	O
relish	O
we	O
had	O
for	O
it	O
at	O
all	O
diminished	O
.	O

The	O
animals	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
on	O
shore	O
were	O
principally	O
guanos	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
the	O
country	O
abounds	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
are	O
by	O
some	O
reckoned	O
delicious	O
food	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
no	O
beast	O
of	O
prey	O
here	O
,	O
except	O
we	O
should	O
esteem	O
that	O
amphibious	O
animal	O
,	O
the	O
alligator	O
,	O
as	O
such	O
,	O
several	O
of	O
which	O
our	O
people	O
discovered	O
,	O
but	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
very	O
large	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
satisfied	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
great	O
numbers	O
of	O
tygers	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
though	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
came	O
in	O
sight	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
every	O
morning	O
found	O
the	O
beach	O
near	O
the	O
watering-place	O
imprinted	O
very	O
thick	O
with	O
their	O
footsteps	O
:	O
but	O
we	O
never	O
apprehended	O
any	O
mischief	O
from	O
them	O
,	O
since	O
they	O
are	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
so	O
fierce	O
as	O
the	O
Asiatic	O
or	O
African	PNM
tyger	O
,	O
and	O
are	O
rarely	O
,	O
if	O
ever	O
,	O
known	O
to	O
attack	O
mankind	O
.	O

Birds	O
were	O
here	O
in	O
sufficient	O
plenty	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
abundance	O
of	O
pheasants	O
of	O
different	O
kinds	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
of	O
an	O
uncommon	O
size	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
very	O
dry	O
and	O
tasteless	O
eating	O
.	O

And	O
besides	O
these	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
smaller	O
birds	O
,	O
particularly	O
parrots	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
often	O
killed	O
for	O
food	O
.	O

The	O
fruits	O

vegetable	O
refreshments	O
at	O
this	O

were	O
neither	O

of	O

There	O

it	O
is	O
true	O

a	O
few	O
bushes	O
scattered	O
about	O

supplied	O
us	O
with	O

we	O

it	O

its	O

with	O
a	O

AND	O
ON	O
THE	O

OUR	O
SETTING	O

FOR	O
ASIA	O
The	O
next	O
morning	O
after	O
our	O
coming	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
in	O
the	O
harbour	O
of	O
Chequetan	PNM
,	O
we	O
sent	O
about	O
ninety	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
well	O
armed	O
on	O
shore	O
;	O
forty	O
of	O
whom	O
were	O
ordered	O
to	O
march	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
as	O
hath	O
been	O
mentioned	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
remaining	O
fifty	O
were	O
employed	O
to	O
cover	O
the	O
watering-place	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
prevent	O
any	O
interruption	O
from	O
the	O
natives	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
compleated	O
the	O
unloading	O
of	O
the	O
_	O
Carmelo	PNM
_	O
and	O
_	O
Carmin	O
_	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
begun	O
at	O
sea	O
;	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
we	O
took	O
out	O
of	O
them	O
the	O
indico	O
,	O
cacao	O
,	O
and	O
cochineal	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
iron	O
for	O
ballast	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
all	O
the	O
goods	O
we	O
intended	O
to	O
preserve	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
amount	O
to	O
a	O
tenth	O
of	O
their	O
cargoes	O
.	O

Here	O
too	O
it	O
was	O
agreed	O
,	O
after	O
a	O
mature	O
consultation	O
,	O
to	O
destroy	O
the	O
_	O
Tryal	O
's	O
_	O
prize	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
_	O
Carmelo	PNM
_	O
and	O
_	O
Carmin	O
_	O
,	O
whose	O
fate	O
had	O
been	O
before	O
resolved	O
on	O
.	O

Indeed	O
the	O
_	O
Tryal	O
's	O
_	O
prize	O
was	O
in	O
good	O
repair	O
,	O
and	O
fit	O
for	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
the	O
whole	O
numbers	O
on	O
board	O
our	O
squadron	O
did	O
not	O
amount	O
to	O
the	O
complement	O
of	O
a	O
fourth-rate	O
man-of-war	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O
divide	O
them	O
into	O
three	O
ships	O
without	O
rendering	O
each	O
of	O
those	O
ships	O
incapable	O
of	O
navigating	O
in	O
safety	O
through	O
the	O
tempestuous	O
weather	O
we	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
expect	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
China	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
supposed	O
we	O
should	O
arrive	O
about	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
the	O
change	O
of	O
the	O
monsoons	O
.	O

These	O
considerations	O
determined	O
the	O
commodore	O
to	O
destroy	O
the	O
_	O
Tryal	O
's	O
_	O
prize	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
reinforce	O
the	O
_	O
Gloucester	O
_	O
with	O
the	O
best	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
crew	O

And	O
in	O
consequence	O
of	O
this	O
resolve	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
stores	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
_	O
Tryal	O
's	O
_	O
prize	O
were	O
removed	O
into	O
the	O
other	O

and	O
the	O
prize	O
herself	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
_	O
Carmelo	PNM
_	O
and	O
_	O
Carmin	O
_	O
,	O
were	O
prepared	O
for	O
scuttling	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
expedition	O
we	O
were	O
masters	O
of	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
great	O
difficulties	O
we	O
were	O
under	O
in	O
providing	O
a	O
store	O
of	O
water	O
-LRB-	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
already	O
touched	O
on	O

together	O
with	O
the	O
necessary	O
repairs	O
of	O
our	O
rigging	O
and	O
other	O
unavoidable	O
occupations	O

took	O
us	O
up	O
so	O
much	O
time	O
,	O
-LCB-	O
249	O
-RCB-	O
and	O
found	O
us	O
such	O
unexpected	O
employment	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
near	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
April	O
before	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
a	O
condition	O
to	O
leave	O
the	O
place	O

During	O
our	O
stay	O
here	O
there	O
happened	O
an	O
incident	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
proved	O
the	O
means	O
of	O
convincing	O
our	O
friends	O
in	O
England	PNM
of	O
our	O
safety	O
,	O
which	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
they	O
had	O
despaired	O
of	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
then	O
in	O
doubt	O
about	O
,	O
I	O
shall	O
beg	O
leave	O
particularly	O
to	O
recite	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
observed	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
preceding	O
chapter	O
,	O
that	O
from	O
this	O
harbour	O
of	O
Chequetan	O
there	O
was	O
but	O
one	O
pathway	O
which	O
led	O
through	O
the	O
woods	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
.	O

This	O
we	O
found	O
much	O
beaten	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
thence	O
convinced	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
well	O
known	O
to	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
.	O

As	O
it	O
passed	O
by	O
the	O
spring-head	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
avenue	O
by	O
which	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
could	O
approach	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
,	O
at	O
some	O
distance	O
beyond	O
the	O
spring-head	O
,	O
felled	O
several	O
large	O
trees	O
,	O
and	O
laid	O
them	O
one	O
upon	O
the	O
other	O
across	O
the	O
path	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
this	O
barricadoe	O
we	O
constantly	O
kept	O
a	O
guard	O
.	O

We	O
besides	O
ordered	O
our	O
men	O
employed	O
in	O
watering	O
to	O
have	O
their	O
arms	O
ready	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
case	O
of	O
any	O
alarm	O
,	O
to	O
march	O
instantly	O
to	O
this	O
post	O
.	O

And	O
though	O
our	O
principal	O
intention	O
herein	O
was	O
to	O
prevent	O
our	O
being	O
disturbed	O
by	O
any	O
sudden	O
attack	O
of	O
the	O
enemy	O
's	O
horse	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
answered	O
another	O
purpose	O
which	O
was	O
not	O
in	O
itself	O
less	O
important	O
:	O
this	O
was	O
to	O
hinder	O
our	O
own	O
people	O
from	O
straggling	O
singly	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
surprized	O
by	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
who	O
would	O
doubtless	O
be	O
extremely	O
solicitous	O
to	O
pick	O
up	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
hopes	O
of	O
getting	O
intelligence	O
of	O
our	O
future	O
designs	O
.	O

To	O
avoid	O
this	O
inconvenience	O
,	O
the	O
strictest	O
orders	O
were	O
given	O
to	O
the	O
centinels	O
to	O
let	O
no	O
person	O
whatever	O
pass	O
beyond	O
their	O
post	O
.	O

But	O
notwithstanding	O
this	O
precaution	O
,	O
we	O
missed	O
one	O
Lewis	O
Leger	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
the	O
commodore	O
's	O
cook	O
.	O

As	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
Frenchman	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
suspected	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
Papist	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
at	O
first	O
imagined	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
deserted	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
view	O
of	O
betraying	O
all	O
that	O
he	O
knew	O
to	O
the	O
enemy	O
;	O
though	O
this	O
appeared	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
event	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
ill-grounded	O
surmise	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
afterwards	O
known	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
taken	O
by	O
some	O
Indians	O
,	O
who	O
carried	O
him	O
prisoner	O
to	O
Acapulco	PNM
,	O
from	O
whence	O
he	O
was	O
transferred	O
to	O
Mexico	PNM
,	O
and	O
then	O
to	O
Vera	PNM
Cruz	PNM
,	O
where	O
he	O
was	O
shipped	O
on	O
board	O
a	O
vessel	O
bound	O
to	O
Old	PNM
Spain	PNM
.	O

But	O
the	O
vessel	O
being	O
obliged	O
by	O
some	O
accident	O
to	O
put	O
into	O
Lisbon	PNM
,	O
Leger	O
escaped	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
by	O
the	O
British	O
consul	O
sent	O
from	O
thence	O
to	O
England	PNM
,	O
where	O
he	O
brought	O
the	O
first	O
authentick	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
safety	O
of	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
his	O
principal	O
transactions	O
-LCB-	O
250	O
-RCB-	O
in	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
.	O

The	O
relation	O
he	O
gave	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
seizure	O
was	O
that	O
he	O
rambled	O
into	O
the	O
woods	O
at	O
some	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
barricadoe	O
,	O
where	O
he	O
had	O
first	O
attempted	O
to	O
pass	O
,	O
but	O
had	O
been	O
stopped	O
and	O
threatened	O
to	O
be	O
punished	O
;	O
that	O
his	O
principal	O
view	O
was	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
quantity	O
of	O
limes	O
for	O
his	O
master	O
's	O
store	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
in	O
this	O
occupation	O
he	O
was	O
surprized	O
unawares	O
by	O
four	O
Indians	O
,	O
who	O
stripped	O
him	O
naked	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
him	O
in	O
that	O
condition	O
to	O
Acapulco	PNM
,	O
exposed	O
to	O
the	O
scorching	O
heat	O
of	O
the	O
sun	O

which	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
shone	O
with	O
its	O
greatest	O
violence	O
;	O
that	O
afterwards	O
at	O
Mexico	PNM
his	O
treatment	O
in	O
prison	O
was	O
sufficiently	O
severe	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
whole	O
course	O
of	O
his	O
captivity	O
was	O
a	O
continued	O
instance	O
of	O
the	O
hatred	O
which	O
the	O

bear	O
to	O
all	O

When	O

Mr.	O

when	O
we	O
ourselves	O

And	O
on	O
this	O
occasion	O
I	O
must	O
mention	O
more	O
particularly	O
than	O
I	O
have	O
yet	O
done	O
the	O
views	O
of	O
the	O
commodore	O
in	O
leaving	O
the	O

When	O
we	O
were	O
necessitated	O
to	O
proceed	O
for	O
Chequetan	O
to	O
recruit	O
our	O
water	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
considered	O
that	O
our	O
arrival	O
in	O
that	O
harbour	O
would	O
soon	O
be	O
known	O
at	O
Acapulco	PNM
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
he	O
hoped	O
that	O
on	O
the	O
intelligence	O
of	O
our	O
being	O
employed	O
in	O
port	O
,	O
the	O
galeon	O
might	O
put	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
especially	O
as	O
Chequetan	PNM
is	O
so	O
very	O
remote	O
from	O
the	O
course	O
generally	O
steered	O
by	O
the	O
galeon	O
.	O

He	O
therefore	O
ordered	O
the	O
cutter	O
to	O
cruise	O
twenty-four	O
days	O
off	O
the	O
port	O
of	O
Acapulco	PNM
,	O
and	O
her	O
commander	O
was	O
directed	O
,	O
on	O
perceiving	O
the	O
galeon	O
under	O

,	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
his	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
commodore	O
at	O
Chequetan	PNM
.	O

As	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
was	O
doubtless	O
a	O
much	O
better	O
sailor	O
than	O
the	O
galeon	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
,	O
in	O
this	O
case	O
,	O
resolved	O
to	O
have	O
got	O
to	O
sea	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
possible	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
have	O
pursued	O
the	O
galeon	O
across	O
the	O
Pacifick	PNM
Ocean	PNM
:	O
where	O
supposing	O
he	O
should	O
not	O
have	O
met	O
with	O
her	O
in	O
his	O
passage	O
-LRB-	O
which	O
,	O
considering	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
kept	O
nearly	O
the	O
same	O
parallel	O
,	O
was	O
very	O
improbable	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
yet	O
he	O
was	O
certain	O
of	O
arriving	O
off	O

,	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
of	O

before	O
her	O
;	O

that	O

the	O
first	O
land	O
she	O
makes	O
on	O
her	O

to	O
the	O

we	O
could	O
not	O

fallen	O
in	O

her	O
by	O
cruising	O
a	O
few	O

in	O
that	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
Viceroy	O
of	O

ruined	O
this	O
project	O
by	O

the	O

in	O
the	O

of	O

all	O

The	O

in	O
the	O

for	O
Mr.	O

the	O

,	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
whose	O

where	O
he	O
would	O

to	O

for	O
him	O
there	O
a	O
certain	O
number	O
of	O
days	O
;	O
after	O
which	O
it	O
was	O
added	O
that	O

to	O
the	O
southward	O
to	O

the	O

This	O

inserted	O
to	O
deceive	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
got	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O

as	O
we	O
afterwards	O
learnt	O
they	O
did	O
;	O
-LCB-	O

but	O
could	O
not	O
impose	O
on	O
Mr.	O
Hughes	O
,	O
who	O
well	O
knew	O
that	O
the	O

had	O
no	O

to	O

,	O
nor	O
any	O
intention	O
of	O

Being	O
now	O
in	O
the	O
offing	O
of	O

across	O
the	O
vast	O
Pacifick	PNM

in	O
our	O
way	O
to	O
China	PNM
,	O
we	O
were	O
impatient	O
to	O
run	O
off	O
the	O
coast	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
possible	O
,	O
since	O
the	O
stormy	O
season	O
was	O

As	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
farther	O
views	O
in	O
the	O
American	O
seas	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
hoped	O
that	O
nothing	O
would	O
have	O
prevented	O
us	O
from	O
steering	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
the	O
moment	O
we	O
got	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
harbour	O
of	O
Chequetan	PNM
:	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
no	O
small	O
mortification	O
to	O
us	O
that	O
our	O
necessary	O
employment	O
there	O
had	O
detained	O
us	O
so	O
much	O
longer	O
than	O
we	O
expected	O
,	O
but	O
now	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
had	O
put	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
farther	O
detained	O
by	O
the	O
absence	O
of	O
the	O
cutter	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
necessity	O
we	O
were	O
under	O
of	O
standing	O
towards	O
Acapulco	PNM
in	O
search	O
of	O
her	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
her	O
cruise	O
had	O
been	O
expired	O
for	O
near	O
a	O
fortnight	O
,	O
we	O
suspected	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
discovered	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
Governor	O
of	O
Acapulco	PNM
had	O
thereupon	O
sent	O
out	O
a	O
force	O
to	O
seize	O
her	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
she	O
carried	O
but	O
six	O
hands	O
,	O
was	O
no	O
very	O
difficult	O
enterprize	O

However	O
,	O
this	O

the	O

as	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
was	O

clear	O
of	O

stood	O
along	O

to	O

a	O

which	O

could	O
not	O

perceive	O
if	O
she	O
kept	O
along	O

Indeed	O

had	O

immediately	O
before	O

,	O
where	O
Mr.	O

proposed	O
to	O

for	O
her	O
some	O
days	O
.	O

By	O
Sunday	O
,	O
the	O
2d	O
of	O
May	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
advanced	O
within	O
three	O
leagues	O
of	O
Acapulco	PNM
,	O
and	O
having	O
seen	O
nothing	O
of	O
our	O

we	O
gave	O
her	O
over	O

which	O

besides	O
the	O
compassionate	O
concern	O
for	O
our	O

,	O
and	O
for	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
apprehended	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
suffered	O
,	O
was	O
in	O
itself	O
a	O
misfortune	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
in	O
our	O
present	O
scarcity	O
of	O
hands	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
greatly	O
interested	O
in	O
:	O
since	O
the	O
crew	O
of	O
the	O
cutter	O
,	O
consisting	O
of	O
six	O
men	O
and	O
the	O
lieutenant	O
,	O
were	O
the	O
very	O
flower	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
,	O
purposely	O
picked	O
out	O
for	O
this	O
service	O

and	O
known	O
to	O

-LCB-	O

as	O
ever	O
trod	O
a	O
deck	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
general	O
belief	O
among	O
us	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
taken	O
and	O
carried	O
into	O
Acapulco	PNM
,	O
the	O
commodore	O
's	O
prudence	O
suggested	O
a	O
project	O
which	O
we	O
hoped	O
would	O
recover	O
them	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
founded	O
on	O
our	O
having	O
many	O
Spanish	O
and	O
Indian	O
prisoners	O
in	O
our	O
possession	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
sick	O

who	O
could	O
be	O
of	O
no	O
service	O
to	O
us	O
in	O
the	O
navigating	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

The	O
commodore	O
therefore	O
wrote	O
a	O
letter	O
the	O
same	O
day	O
to	O
the	O
Governor	O
of	O
Acapulco	PNM
,	O
telling	O
him	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
release	O
them	O
all	O
provided	O
the	O
governor	O
returned	O
the	O
cutter	O

crew	O

This	O
letter	O
was	O
dispatched	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
by	O
a	O
Spanish	O
officer	O
,	O
of	O
whose	O
honour	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
good	O
opinion	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
was	O
furnished	O
with	O
a	O
launch	O
belonging	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
prizes	O
and	O
a	O
crew	O
of	O
six	O
other	O
prisoners	O
,	O
who	O
gave	O
their	O
parole	O
for	O
their	O
return	O
.	O

The	O
Spanish	O
officer	O
too	O
,	O
besides	O
the	O
commodore	O
's	O
letter	O
,	O
carried	O
with	O
him	O
a	O
joint	O
petition	O
,	O
signed	O
by	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O

beseeching	O
the	O
governor	O
to	O
acquiesce	O
in	O
the	O
terms	O
proposed	O
for	O
their	O
liberty	O
.	O

From	O
a	O
consideration	O
of	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
our	O
prisoners	O
and	O
the	O
quality	O
of	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
doubt	O
but	O
the	O
governor	O
would	O
readily	O
comply	O
with	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
's	O
proposal	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
we	O
kept	O
plying	O
on	O
and	O
off	O
the	O
whole	O
night	O
,	O
intending	O
to	O
keep	O
well	O
in	O
with	O
the	O
land	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
receive	O
an	O
answer	O
at	O
the	O
limited	O
time	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
being	O
Monday	O

But	O
both	O
on	O
Monday	O
and	O
Tuesday	O
we	O
were	O
driven	O
so	O
far	O
off	O
shore	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
hope	O
that	O
any	O
answer	O
could	O
reach	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
even	O
on	O
the	O
Wednesday	O
morning	O
we	O
found	O
ourselves	O
fourteen	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
harbour	O
of	O
Acapulco	PNM
;	O
however	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
wind	O
was	O
then	O
favourable	O
,	O
we	O
pressed	O
forwards	O
with	O
all	O
our	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
doubt	O
of	O
getting	O
in	O
with	O
the	O
land	O
that	O
afternoon	O
.	O

Whilst	O
we	O
were	O
thus	O
standing	O
in	O

the	O
centinel	O
called	O
out	O
from	O
the	O

a	O

under	O

at	O
a	O
considerable	O
distance	O
to	O
the	O
south-eastward	O

This	O
we	O

we	O
instantly	O

to	O

joy	O

that	O
it	O

And	O
though	O

while	O
she	O
was	O
still	O
at	O

we	O
imagined	O
that	O

that	O

from	O

the	O

They	O
were	O

into	O

now	O
we	O

this	O

of	O

remarking	O
how	O

I	O
must	O
farther	O
add	O
on	O
this	O
occasion	O
that	O

when	O
we	O

Having	O
thus	O

the	O

object	O
of	O
our	O
coming	O
a	O

the	O

to	O
run	O
off	O

with	O
the	O

expedition	O
,	O
both	O
as	O
the	O

on	O

was	O
now	O
approaching	O

as	O
we	O
were	O
apprehensive	O
of	O

to	O

with	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
upon	O
the	O

:	O
for	O
this	O
reason	O
we	O
no	O

stood	O
towards	O
Acapulco	O
,	O
as	O
at	O

we	O
wanted	O
no	O

from	O
the	O

However	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
resolved	O
not	O
to	O
deprive	O
his	O
prisoners	O
of	O
the	O
liberty	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
promised	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
immediately	O
embarked	O
in	O
two	O
launches	O
which	O
belonged	O
to	O
our	O
prizes	O

those	O
from	O
the	O

in	O
the	O

The	O
launches	O
were	O
well	O

with	O

and	O
oars	O
;	O
and	O
lest	O
the	O

they	O
had	O
a	O
stock	O
of	O
water	O
and	O
provisions	O
put	O
on	O
board	O
them	O
sufficient	O
for	O
fourteen	O

There	O
were	O
discharged	O
thirty-nine	O

from	O

eighteen	O

sick	O

.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
as	O
our	O
crews	O
were	O
very	O
weak	O
,	O
we	O
kept	O
the	O
Mulattoes	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
stoutest	O
of	O
our	O
negroes	O
with	O
a	O

Indians	O
to	O
assist	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
dismissed	O
every	O

prisoner	O

We	O
have	O
since	O
learnt	O
that	O
these	O
two	O
launches	O
arrived	O
safe	O
at	O
Acapulco	PNM
,	O
where	O
the	O
prisoners	O
could	O
not	O
enough	O
extol	O
the	O
humanity	O
with	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
treated	O

It	O

the	O
-LCB-	O

-RCB-	O
governor	O
,	O
before	O
their	O
arrival	O
,	O
had	O
returned	O
a	O
very	O
obliging	O
answer	O
to	O
our	O
letter	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
ordered	O
out	O
two	O
boats	O
laden	O
with	O
the	O
choicest	O

provisions	O
that	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
procured	O
at	O
Acapulco	PNM
,	O
which	O
he	O
intended	O
as	O
a	O

to	O
the	O

:	O
but	O
these	O
boats	O
not	O
having	O
found	O
our	O

were	O
at	O

obliged	O
to	O
put	O
back	O
again	O

after	O
having	O
thrown	O
all	O
their	O

overboard	O
in	O
a	O

which	O
threatened	O
their	O
destruction	O

The	O
sending	O

was	O
our	O

on	O
the	O
American	O
coast	O

proposing	O
to	O

a	O

in	O
a	O

with	O
the	O
regular	O
trade-wind	O

which	O
the	O
accounts	O
of	O
former	O
navigators	O
had	O
represented	O
as	O
much	O
brisker	O

steadier	O
in	O
this	O

than	O
in	O
any	O

:	O
for	O
it	O

to	O
the	O

in	O
two	O

we	O

for	O

it	O
with	O

as	O
it	O
was	O
no	O

This	O
disquisition	O
may	O
be	O
serviceable	O
to	O
those	O
who	O
shall	O
hereafter	O
form	O
projects	O
of	O

nature	O
for	O
that	O

may	O

And	O
therefore	O
I	O
propose	O
,	O
in	O
this	O
chapter	O
,	O
to	O
consider	O
,	O
as	O
succinctly	O
as	O
I	O
can	O
,	O
the	O
numerous	O
advantages	O
which	O
the	O
public	O
might	O
have	O
received	O
from	O
the	O
operations	O
of	O
the	O
squadron	O
had	O
it	O
set	O
sail	O
from	O
England	PNM
a	O
few	O
months	O
sooner	O
than	O
it	O
did	O
.	O

To	O
begin	O
then	O
:	O
I	O
presume	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
granted	O
me	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
summer	O
time	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
got	O
round	O
Cape	PNM
Horn	PNM
with	O
an	O
inconsiderable	O
loss	O
,	O
and	O
without	O
any	O
material	O
damage	O
to	O
our	O
ships	O
or	O
rigging	O
.	O

For	O
the	O
_	O
Duke	O
_	O
and	O
_	O
Duchess	O
of	O
Bristol	PNM
_	O
,	O
who	O
between	O
them	O
had	O
above	O
three	O
hundred	O
men	O
,	O
buried	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
two	O
from	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Brazil	PNM
to	O
Juan	PNM
Fernandez	PNM
;	O
and	O
out	O
of	O
a	O
hundred	O
and	O
eighty-three	O
hands	O
which	O
were	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
_	O
Duke	O
_	O
alone	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
only	O
twenty-one	O
sick	O
of	O
the	O
scurvy	O
when	O
they	O
arrived	O
at	O
that	O
island	O

Whence	O
as	O
men-of-war	O
are	O
much	O
better	O
provided	O
with	O
all	O
conveniences	O
than	O
privateers	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
doubtless	O
have	O
appeared	O
before	O
Baldivia	PNM
in	O
full	O
strength	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
condition	O
of	O
entering	O
immediately	O
on	O
action	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
,	O
as	O
that	O
place	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
defenceless	O
state	O
,	O
its	O
cannon	O
incapable	O
of	O
service	O
,	O
and	O
its	O
garrison	O
in	O
great	O
measure	O
unarmed	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
that	O
it	O
could	O
have	O
opposed	O
our	O
force	O
,	O
or	O
that	O
its	O
half-starved	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
whom	O
-LCB-	O
258	O
-RCB-	O
are	O
convicts	O
banished	O
thither	O
from	O
other	O
parts	O
,	O
could	O
have	O
had	O
any	O
other	O
thoughts	O
than	O
that	O
of	O
submitting	O
.	O

This	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
very	O
important	O
acquisition	O
;	O
since	O
when	O
Baldivia	PNM
,	O
which	O
is	O
an	O
excellent	O
port	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
once	O
in	O
our	O
possession	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
immediately	O
have	O
been	O
terrible	O
to	O
the	O
whole	O
kingdom	O
of	O
Chili	PNM
,	O
and	O
should	O
doubtless	O
have	O
awed	O
the	O
most	O
distant	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
Spanish	PNM
Empire	PNM
in	PNM
America	PNM
.	O

Indeed	O
it	O
is	O
far	O
from	O
improbable	O
that	O
,	O
by	O
a	O
prudent	O
use	O
of	O
this	O
place	O
,	O
aided	O
by	O
our	O
other	O
advantages	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
given	O
a	O
violent	O
shock	O
to	O
the	O
authority	O
of	O
Spain	PNM
on	O
that	O
whole	O
continent	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
have	O
rendered	O
some	O
at	O
least	O
of	O
her	O
provinces	O
independent	O
.	O

This	O
would	O
certainly	O
have	O
turned	O
the	O
whole	O
attention	O
of	O
the	O
Spanish	O
ministry	O
to	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
where	O
the	O
danger	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
so	O
pressing	O
,	O
and	O
thence	O
Great	PNM
Britain	PNM
and	O
her	O
allies	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
rid	O
of	O
the	O
numerous	O
difficulties	O
which	O
the	O
wealth	O
of	O
the	O
Spanish	O
Indies	O
,	O
operating	O
in	O
conjunction	O
with	O
the	O
Gallick	O
intrigues	O
,	O
have	O
constantly	O
thrown	O
in	O
their	O
way	O
.	O

But	O
that	O
I	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
thought	O
to	O
over-rate	O
the	O
force	O
of	O
this	O
squadron	O
by	O
ascribing	O
to	O
it	O
a	O
power	O
of	O
overturning	O
the	O
Spanish	O
Government	O
in	O
America	PNM
,	O
it	O
is	O
necessary	O
to	O
enter	O
into	O
a	O
more	O
particular	O
discussion	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
premise	O
a	O
few	O
observations	O
on	O
the	O
condition	O
of	O
the	O
provinces	O
bordering	O
near	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
,	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
disposition	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
both	O
Spaniards	O
and	O
Indians	O
,	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
.	O

For	O
hence	O
it	O
will	O
appear	O
that	O
the	O
conjuncture	O
was	O
the	O
most	O
favourable	O
we	O
could	O
have	O
desired	O
,	O
since	O
we	O
shall	O
find	O
that	O
the	O
Creolian	O
subjects	O
were	O
disaffected	O
and	O
their	O
governors	O
at	O
variance	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
country	O
was	O
wretchedly	O
provided	O
with	O
arms	O
and	O
stores	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
had	O
fallen	O
into	O
a	O
total	O
neglect	O
of	O
all	O
military	O
regulations	O
in	O
their	O
garrisons	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
Indians	O
on	O
their	O
frontier	O
were	O
universally	O
discontented	O
,	O
and	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
watching	O
with	O
impatience	O
the	O
favourable	O
moment	O
when	O
they	O
might	O
take	O
a	O
severe	O
revenge	O
for	O
the	O
barbarities	O
they	O
had	O
groaned	O
under	O
during	O
more	O
than	O
two	O
ages	O
:	O
so	O
that	O
every	O
circumstance	O
concurred	O
to	O
facilitate	O
the	O
enterprizes	O
of	O
our	O
squadron	O
.	O

Of	O
all	O
these	O
articles	O
we	O
were	O
amply	O
informed	O
by	O
the	O
letters	O
we	O
took	O
on	O
board	O
our	O
prizes	O
;	O
none	O
of	O
these	O
vessels	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
remember	O
,	O
having	O
had	O
the	O
precaution	O
to	O
throw	O
their	O
papers	O
overboard	O
.	O

The	O
ill	O
blood	O
amongst	O
the	O
governors	O
was	O
greatly	O
augmented	O
by	O
their	O
apprehensions	O
of	O
our	O
squadron	O
;	O
for	O
every	O
one	O
being	O
-LCB-	O
259	O
-RCB-	O
willing	O
to	O
have	O
it	O
believed	O
that	O
the	O
bad	O
condition	O
of	O
his	O
government	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
effect	O
of	O
negligence	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
continual	O
demands	O
and	O
remonstrances	O
among	O
them	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
throw	O
the	O
blame	O
upon	O
each	O
other	O
.	O

Thus	O
,	O
for	O
instance	O
,	O
the	O
President	O
of	O
St.	PNM
Jago	PNM
in	O
Chili	PNM
,	O
the	O
President	O
of	O
Panama	PNM
,	O
and	O
many	O
other	O
governors	O
and	O
military	O
officers	O
were	O
perpetually	O
soliciting	O
the	O
Viceroy	O
of	O
Peru	PNM
to	O
furnish	O
them	O
with	O
the	O
necessary	O
sums	O
of	O
money	O
for	O
putting	O
their	O
provinces	O
and	O
places	O
in	O
a	O
proper	O
state	O
of	O
defence	O
to	O
oppose	O
our	O
designs	O
:	O
but	O
the	O
customary	O
answer	O
of	O
the	O
viceroy	O
to	O
these	O
representations	O
was	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
unable	O
to	O
comply	O
with	O
their	O
requests	O
,	O
urging	O
the	O
emptiness	O
of	O
the	O
royal	O
chest	O
at	O
Lima	PNM
,	O
and	O
the	O
difficulties	O
he	O
was	O
under	O
to	O
support	O
the	O
expences	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
government	O
:	O
he	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
letters	O
-LRB-	O
which	O
we	O
intercepted	O
-RRB-	O
mentioning	O
his	O
apprehensions	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
soon	O
be	O
necessitated	O
to	O
stop	O
the	O
pay	O
of	O
the	O
troops	O
and	O
even	O
of	O
the	O
garrison	O
of	O
Callao	PNM
,	O
the	O
key	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
kingdom	O
of	O
Peru	PNM
.	O

Indeed	O
he	O
did	O
at	O
times	O
remit	O
to	O
these	O
governors	O
some	O
part	O
of	O
their	O
demands	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
what	O
he	O
sent	O
them	O
was	O
greatly	O
short	O
of	O
their	O
wants	O
,	O
these	O
partial	O
supplies	O
rather	O
tended	O
to	O
the	O
raising	O
jealousies	O
and	O
heart-burnings	O
among	O
them	O
than	O
contributed	O
to	O
the	O
purposes	O
for	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
at	O
first	O
been	O
desired	O
.	O

Besides	O
these	O
mutual	O
janglings	O
amongst	O
the	O
governors	O
,	O
the	O
whole	O
body	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
were	O
extremely	O
dissatisfied	O
,	O
they	O
being	O
fully	O
persuaded	O
that	O
the	O
affairs	O
of	O
Spain	PNM
for	O
many	O
years	O
before	O
had	O
been	O
managed	O
by	O
the	O
influence	O
of	O
a	O
particular	O
foreign	O
interest	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
altogether	O
detached	O
from	O
the	O
advantages	O
of	O
the	O
Spanish	O
nation	O
:	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
of	O
these	O
distant	O
provinces	O
believed	O
themselves	O
to	O
be	O
sacrificed	O
to	O
an	O
ambition	O
which	O
never	O
considered	O
their	O
convenience	O
or	O
emoluments	O
nor	O
paid	O
any	O
regard	O
to	O
the	O
reputation	O
of	O
their	O
name	O
or	O
the	O
honour	O
of	O
their	O
country	O
.	O

That	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
temper	O
of	O
the	O
Creolian	O
Spaniards	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
might	O
be	O
proved	O
from	O
a	O
hundred	O
instances	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
shall	O
content	O
myself	O
with	O
one	O
which	O
is	O
indeed	O
conclusive	O
:	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
testimony	O
of	O
the	O
French	O
mathematicians	O
sent	O
into	O
America	PNM
to	O
measure	O
the	O
magnitude	O
of	O
an	O
equatorial	O
degree	O
of	O
latitude	O

For	O
in	O

in	O
one	O
of	O

and	O
of	O
the	O

tumult	O
thence	O
occasioned	O

written	O
by	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
astronomers	O
,	O
the	O
author	O
confesses	O
that	O
the	O
multitude	O
during	O
the	O
uproar	O
universally	O
joined	O
in	O
imprecations	O
on	O
their	O
bad	O
government	O
,	O
-LCB-	O

and	O
bestowed	O
the	O
most	O

upon	O
the	O

detesting	O
them	O

in	O

of	O
a	O
nation	O
to	O
whose	O
influence	O
in	O
the	O
Spanish	O
counsels	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
imputed	O
all	O
their	O
misfortunes	O
.	O

And	O
whilst	O
the	O
Creolian	O
Spaniards	O
were	O
thus	O
dissatisfied	O
,	O
it	O
appears	O
by	O
the	O
letters	O
we	O
intercepted	O
that	O
the	O
Indians	O
on	O
almost	O
every	O
frontier	O
were	O
ripe	O
for	O
a	O

and	O
would	O

upon	O
the	O

the	O
Indians	O
in	O
the	O

For	O
it	O
seems	O
in	O
some	O
disputes	O
between	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
and	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
which	O
happened	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
before	O
our	O
arrival	O

the	O
Spaniards	O
had	O
insulted	O
the	O

with	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
the	O

expected	O
from	O
Old	PNM
Spain	PNM
under	O
the	O

of	O

These	O
threats	O
alarmed	O
the	O

made	O
them	O
believe	O
that	O

To	O
this	O
I	O
must	O
add	O
too	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
Spanish	O
governors	O
themselves	O
were	O
so	O
fully	O
informed	O
of	O
the	O
disposition	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
at	O
this	O
conjuncture	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
so	O
apprehensive	O
of	O
a	O
general	O
defection	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
employed	O
all	O
their	O
industry	O
to	O
reconcile	O
the	O
most	O
dangerous	O
tribes	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
prevent	O
them	O
from	O
immediately	O
taking	O
up	O
arms	O
.	O

Among	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
the	O
President	O
of	O
Chili	PNM
in	O
particular	O
made	O
large	O
concessions	O
to	O
the	O
Arraucos	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
Chilian	O
Indians	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
distributing	O
considerable	O
presents	O
to	O
their	O
leading	O
men	O
,	O
he	O
at	O
last	O
got	O
them	O
to	O
consent	O
to	O
a	O
prolongation	O
of	O
the	O
truce	O
between	O
the	O
two	O
nations	O
.	O

But	O
these	O
negociations	O
were	O
not	O
concluded	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
when	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
in	O
the	O
South	PNM

;	O
and	O
had	O
they	O
been	O
compleated	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
hatred	O
of	O
these	O
Indians	O
to	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
was	O
so	O
great	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
impossible	O
for	O
their	O
chiefs	O
,	O
how	O
deeply	O
soever	O
corrupted	O

to	O
have	O
kept	O
them	O

Thus	O
then	O
it	O
appears	O
that	O
on	O
our	O
arrival	O
in	O
the	O
South	PNM

we	O
might	O
have	O
found	O
the	O

destitute	O

for	O

from	O

that	O

that	O

that	O

it	O
is	O
highly	O

that	O

the	O

This	O
last	O
supposition	O
may	O
perhaps	O
appear	O
chimerical	O
to	O
those	O
who	O
measure	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O
all	O

by	O
the	O

of	O

the	O

not	O
to	O
insist	O
on	O
the	O
presumption	O
of	O
a	O

it	O
is	O
sufficient	O
for	O

to	O
conclude	O
that	O
the	O

would	O
scarcely	O
have	O
failed	O
of	O
taking	O

on	O

would	O
so	O

that	O

would	O

the	O

between	O

For	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
observed	O
that	O
the	O
Chilian	O
Indians	O
have	O
been	O
frequently	O
successful	O
against	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
and	O
possess	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
a	O
large	O
tract	O
of	O

which	O
was	O

full	O
of	O

towns	O

were	O

either	O

Now	O

it	O
in	O

be	O
considered	O
what	O
were	O
the	O
events	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
to	O

or	O
what	O
were	O
the	O

which	O

us	O

all	O
the	O

and	O
thereby	O

the	O

By	O

there	O
was	O
no	O

for	O

and	O
from	O

ran	O
no	O

And	O
had	O
we	O
wanted	O
sailors	O
to	O
assist	O
in	O
the	O
navigating	O
of	O
our	O

whilst	O
a	O
considerable	O
proportion	O
of	O
our	O

were	O

we	O

not	O
have	O
failed	O
of	O

whatever	O

For	O
I	O
must	O
observe	O
that	O
the	O
Indians	O

in	O

are	O
extremely	O
docile	O

dexterous	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
they	O
are	O
not	O
fit	O
to	O
struggle	O
with	O
the	O
inclemencies	O
of	O
a	O

yet	O
in	O

they	O
are	O

Thus	O
then	O
it	O
appears	O
what	O
important	O
revolutions	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
brought	O
about	O
by	O
our	O

had	O
it	O

as	O
it	O

from	O
hence	O
it	O
is	O
easy	O
to	O
conclude	O
what	O
immense	O
advantages	O
might	O
have	O
thence	O
accrued	O
to	O
the	O
public	O

For	O
,	O
as	O
on	O
our	O
success	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
impossible	O
that	O
the	O

should	O

it	O
is	O
certain	O
that	O
the	O

being	O
in	O

But	O
though	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
the	O

As	O
the	O
getting	O
into	O
the	O
N.E.	O

was	O
to	O
us	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O

we	O

all	O
our	O
efforts	O
were	O
for	O
a	O

unsuccessful	O

so	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
seven	O

from	O
our	O
leaving	O

before	O
we	O
got	O

This	O
was	O
an	O

For	O

after	O

our	O

the	O

began	O
to	O

amongst	O

and	O
we	O
too	O
well	O
knew	O
the	O
effects	O
of	O
this	O

by	O
our	O
former	O
fatal	O
experience	O

suppose	O
that	O
anything	O

secure	O
the	O

But	O
as	O

after	O
being	O
seven	O

at	O

there	O
did	O
not	O
appear	O
any	O

that	O
could	O

us	O
we	O

when	O
we	O
set	O
out	O

was	O
no	O
ground	O
for	O

to	O
imagine	O
that	O

at	O

three	O
times	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
we	O
at	O

expected	O
;	O
and	O

we	O
had	O
the	O

prospect	O
either	O
of	O

by	O
the	O

Indeed	O

the	O

might	O

in	O
some	O
degree	O

as	O
it	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
unusual	O
to	O
suppose	O
that	O
its	O
particular	O
virulence	O
during	O
that	O

was	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
measure	O
owing	O
to	O
the	O

the	O
ravage	O
of	O
the	O

in	O
our	O

soon	O
convinced	O

a	O

proved	O
extremely	O

that	O

at	O

All	O

To	O
what	O

been	O
already	O
said	O
in	O

to	O
this	O

I	O
shall	O
add	O
that	O
our	O
surgeon	O
-LRB-	O
who	O
during	O
our	O
passage	O
round	O
Cape	PNM
Horn	PNM
had	O
ascribed	O
the	O
mortality	O
we	O
suffered	O
to	O
the	O
severity	O
of	O
the	O
climate	O
-RRB-	O
exerted	O
himself	O
in	O
the	O
present	O
run	O
to	O
the	O
utmost	O
:	O
but	O
he	O
at	O
last	O
declared	O
that	O
all	O
his	O
measures	O
were	O
totally	O
ineffectual	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
in	O
the	O

avail	O
his	O
patients	O
.	O

On	O
this	O
it	O
was	O
resolved	O
by	O
the	O
commodore	O
to	O
try	O
the	O
success	O
of	O
two	O
medicines	O
which	O
,	O
just	O
before	O
his	O
departure	O
from	O
England	PNM

were	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
much	O

I	O

the	O
pill	O

of	O
Mr.	O

For	O
however	O
violent	O
the	O
operations	O
of	O
these	O
medicines	O
are	O
said	O
to	O
have	O
sometimes	O
proved	O

in	O
the	O

instance	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
without	O
some	O
remedy	O

seemed	O
inevitable	O
,	O
the	O
experiment	O
at	O

was	O
thought	O
adviseable	O

and	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
one	O

both	O
of	O
them	O
at	O

were	O
administred	O
to	O

who	O
took	O
them	O

one	O

soon	O

was	O
seized	O
with	O
a	O

bleeding	O
at	O
the	O

He	O
was	O
before	O

over	O
by	O
the	O
surgeon	O
and	O
lay	O
almost	O
at	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
death	PNM

he	O
immediately	O
found	O
himself	O

was	O

The	O
most	O

of	O
these	O

and	O
what	O
was	O
obvious	O
in	O

that	O

that	O
they	O
acted	O
in	O

of	O
the	O

so	O
that	O
those	O

were	O
scarcely	O

produced	O
all	O
the	O

to	O
the	O

I	O

we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
fish	O

that	O

I	O

that	O

the	O
_	O
Gloucester	O

,	O
by	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
her	O

sailed	O
so	O
very	O
heavily	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
seldom	O
any	O
more	O

and	O

were	O
frequently	O

to	O
lie	O

for	O
her	O
:	O
and	O
,	O
I	O
conceive	O
,	O
that	O
on	O
the	O
whole	O
we	O
lost	O
little	O

than	O
a	O
month	O
by	O
our	O

the	O

During	O
all	O
this	O
run	O
it	O
was	O
remarkable	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
rarely	O
many	O
days	O
together	O
without	O
seeing	O
great	O
numbers	O
of	O
birds	O
;	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
proof	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
several	O

at	O

scattered	O
all	O
along	O

at	O
no	O

from	O

:	O
but	O
the	O
frequency	O
of	O
these	O
birds	O
seem	O
to	O
ascertain	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
many	O
more	O
than	O
have	O
been	O
hitherto	O
discovered	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
most	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
birds	O
we	O
observed	O
were	O
such	O
as	O
are	O
known	O
to	O
roost	O
on	O
shore	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
their	O
appearance	O
sufficiently	O
evinced	O
that	O
they	O
came	O
from	O
some	O
distant	O
haunt	O
every	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
returned	O
thither	O
again	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O

since	O
we	O
never	O

them	O
early	O

;	O
and	O
the	O
hour	O
of	O
their	O
arrival	O
and	O
departure	O
gradually	O
varied	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
supposed	O
was	O
occasioned	O
by	O
our	O
running	O
nearer	O
their	O
haunts	O
or	O
getting	O
farther	O
from	O
them	O

The	O

But	O
on	O
the	O
26th	O

as	O
we	O
esteemed	O

about	O
three	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
most	O
dispiriting	O
incident	O

as	O

at	O

as	O
it	O
was	O

the	O

as	O

were	O
of	O
opinion	O
that	O

if	O
the	O

,	O
it	O
was	O
resolved	O
she	O
should	O
be	O
burnt	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
how	O
little	O

we	O
might	O
be	O
at	O
present	O
from	O
the	O
island	O

which	O
was	O

the	O

Captain	O

and	O
came	O
on	O

:	O
and	O
we	O
immediately	O
stood	O
from	O
the	O
wreck	O
,	O
not	O
without	O
some	O
apprehensions	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
only	O
a	O
light	O
breeze	O
-RRB-	O
that	O
if	O
she	O
blew	O
up	O
soon	O
the	O
concussion	O
of	O
the	O
air	O
might	O
damage	O
our	O
rigging	O
;	O
but	O
she	O
fortunately	O
continued	O
burning	O
the	O
whole	O
night	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
though	O
her	O
guns	O
fired	O
successively	O
as	O
the	O
flames	O
reached	O
them	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
was	O
six	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
about	O
four	O

before	O
she	O
blew	O
up	O

The	O
report	O
she	O
made	O
upon	O
this	O
occasion	O
was	O
but	O
small	O
,	O
although	O
the	O
blast	O
produced	O
an	O
exceeding	O
black	O
pillar	O
of	O
smoke	O
,	O
which	O
shot	O
up	O
into	O
the	O

to	O
a	O
very	O

Thus	O
perished	O
his	O

And	O
now	O
it	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
expected	O
that	O
,	O
being	O
freed	O
from	O
the	O
embarrassments	O
which	O
her	O
frequent	O
disasters	O
had	O
involved	O
us	O
in	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
proceeded	O
on	O
our	O
way	O
much	O
brisker	O
than	O
we	O
had	O
hitherto	O
done	O
,	O
especially	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
received	O
some	O
small	O
addition	O
to	O

by	O
the	O
taking	O
on	O

the	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
soon	O
taught	O
that	O
our	O
anxieties	O
were	O
not	O
yet	O
to	O
be	O
relieved	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
all	O
we	O
had	O
already	O
suffered	O
,	O
there	O
remained	O
much	O
greater	O
distresses	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
still	O
to	O
struggle	O
with	O

For	O
the	O
late	O
storm	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
proved	O
so	O
fatal	O
to	O
the	O
_	O
Gloucester	O
_	O
,	O
had	O
driven	O
us	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
of	O
our	O
intended	O
course	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
current	O
setting	O
the	O
same	O
way	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
weather	O
abated	O
,	O
had	O
forced	O
us	O
yet	O
a	O
degree	O
or	O
two	O
farther	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
in	O
17-1/4	O

of	O
north	O
latitude	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O

in	O
13-1/2	O

was	O

to	O
keep	O

to	O

the	O

As	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
perfect	O
calm	O
for	O
some	O
days	O
since	O
the	O
cessation	O
of	O
the	O

and	O
we	O
were	O
ignorant	O
how	O
near	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
Ladrones	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
supposed	O
ourselves	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
far	O
from	O
it	O
,	O
we	O
apprehended	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
be	O
driven	O
to	O
the	O
leeward	O
of	O
them	O
by	O
the	O
current	O
without	O
discovering	O
them	O

On	O
this	O
supposition	O
,	O
the	O
only	O
land	O
we	O
could	O
make	O
would	O
be	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
eastern	O
parts	O
of	O
Asia	PNM
,	O
where	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
arrive	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
find	O
the	O
western	O
monsoon	O
in	O
its	O
full	O
force	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
impossible	O
for	O
the	O
stoutest	O
,	O
best-manned	O
ship	O
to	O
get	O
in	O

Besides	O
,	O
this	O
coast	O
being	O
between	O
four	O
and	O
five	O
hundred	O
leagues	O
distant	O
from	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
,	O
in	O
our	O
languishing	O
circumstances	O
,	O
could	O
expect	O
no	O
other	O
than	O
to	O
be	O
destroyed	O

by	O
the	O

could	O
enable	O
us	O
to	O
compleat	O

a	O

For	O
our	O
deaths	O
were	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
extremely	O
alarming	O
,	O
no	O
day	O
passing	O
in	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
bury	O
eight	O
or	O
ten	O

and	O
sometimes	O
twelve	O

of	O
our	O
men	O

and	O
those	O
who	O
had	O
as	O
yet	O
continued	O
healthy	O
began	O
to	O
fall	O
down	O
apace	O
.	O

Indeed	O
we	O
made	O
the	O
best	O
use	O
we	O
could	O
of	O
our	O
present	O
calm	O
,	O
by	O
employing	O
our	O
carpenters	O
in	O
searching	O
after	O
the	O
leak	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
the	O
little	O
wind	O
we	O
had	O
,	O
was	O
now	O
considerable	O
.	O

The	O
carpenters	O
at	O
length	O
discovered	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
the	O
gunner	O
's	O
fore	O
store-room	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
water	O
rushed	O
in	O
under	O
the	O
breast-hook	O
on	O
each	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
stern	O
:	O
but	O
though	O
they	O
found	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
they	O
agreed	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O
stop	O
it	O
till	O
they	O
could	O
come	O
at	O
it	O
on	O
the	O
outside	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
evidently	O
a	O
matter	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
attempted	O
till	O
we	O
should	O
arrive	O
in	O
port	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
they	O
did	O
the	O
best	O
they	O
could	O
within	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
fortunate	O
enough	O
to	O
reduce	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
considerable	O
relief	O
to	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
hitherto	O
considered	O
the	O
calm	O
which	O
succeeded	O
the	O
storm	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
had	O
now	O
continued	O
for	O
some	O
days	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
misfortune	O
,	O
since	O
the	O
currents	O
were	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
driving	O
us	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
of	O
our	O
parallel	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
thereby	O
risqued	O
the	O
missing	O
of	O
the	O
Ladrones	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
at	O
present	O
conceived	O
ourselves	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
near	O
.	O

But	O
when	O
a	O
gale	O
sprung	O
up	O
our	O
condition	O
was	O
still	O
worse	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
blew	O
from	O
the	O
S.W.	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
was	O
directly	O
opposed	O
to	O
the	O
course	O
we	O
wanted	O
to	O
steer	O
:	O
and	O
though	O
it	O
soon	O
veered	O
to	O
the	O
N.E.	O
,	O
yet	O
this	O
served	O
only	O
to	O
tantalize	O
us	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
returned	O
back	O
again	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
short	O
time	O
to	O
its	O
old	O
quarter	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
22d	O
of	O
August	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
satisfaction	O
to	O
find	O
that	O
the	O
current	O
was	O
shifted	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
set	O
us	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
23d	O
,	O
at	O
daybreak	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
cheered	O
with	O
the	O
discovery	O
of	O
two	O
islands	O
in	O
the	O
western	O
board	O
.	O

This	O
gave	O
us	O
all	O
great	O
joy	O
,	O
and	O
raised	O
our	O
drooping	O
spirits	O
,	O
for	O
till	O
then	O
an	O
universal	O
dejection	O
had	O
seized	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
almost	O
despaired	O
of	O
ever	O
seeing	O
land	O
again	O
.	O

The	O
nearest	O
of	O
these	O
islands	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
learnt	O
afterwards	O
,	O
was	O
Anatacan	O
;	O
this	O
we	O
judged	O
to	O
be	O
full	O
fifteen	O
leagues	O
from	O
us	O
;	O
it	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
high	O
land	O
,	O
though	O
of	O
an	O
indifferent	O
length	O
.	O

The	O
other	O
was	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Serigan	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
rather	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
a	O
rock	O
than	O
of	O
a	O
place	O
we	O
could	O
hope	O
to	O
anchor	O
at	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
extremely	O
impatient	O
to	O
get	O
in	O
with	O
the	O
nearest	O
island	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
expected	O
to	O
find	O
anchoring	O
ground	O
and	O
an	O
opportunity	O
of	O
refreshing	O
our	O
sick	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
wind	O
proved	O
so	O
-LCB-	O

-RCB-	O
variable	O
all	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
so	O
little	O
of	O
it	O
that	O
we	O
advanced	O
towards	O
it	O
but	O
slowly	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
we	O
were	O
got	O
so	O
far	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
sight	O
of	O
a	O
third	O
island	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
that	O
of	O
Paxaros	PNM
,	O
and	O
which	O
is	O
marked	O
in	O
the	O
chart	O
only	O
as	O
a	O

This	O
was	O
very	O
small	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
land	O
low	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
passed	O
within	O
less	O
than	O
a	O
mile	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
without	O
observing	O
it	O

At	O
noon	O
,	O
being	O
then	O
not	O
four	O
miles	O
from	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Anatacan	PNM
,	O
the	O
boat	O
was	O
sent	O
away	O
to	O
examine	O
the	O
anchoring	O
ground	O
and	O
the	O
produce	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
a	O
little	O
solicitous	O
for	O
her	O
return	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
conceived	O
our	O
fate	O
to	O
depend	O
upon	O
the	O
report	O
we	O
should	O
receive	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
islands	O
were	O
obviously	O
enough	O
incapable	O
of	O
furnishing	O
us	O
with	O
any	O
assistance	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
any	O
besides	O
which	O
we	O
could	O
reach	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
the	O
boat	O
came	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
crew	O
informed	O
us	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
road	O
for	O
a	O
ship	O
to	O
anchor	O
in	O
,	O
the	O
bottom	O
being	O
everywhere	O
foul	O
ground	O

and	O
all	O
except	O
one	O
small	O
spot	O
not	O
less	O
than	O
fifty	O

in	O
depth	O

that	O

half	O
a	O

that	O
the	O
bank	O
was	O
steep	O
too	O

and	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
depended	O
on	O

They	O
farther	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
landed	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
not	O
without	O
some	O
difficulty	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
greatness	O
of	O
the	O

;	O
that	O
they	O
found	O
the	O

covered	O
with	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O

but	O
that	O
they	O
met	O
with	O
no	O
water	O

did	O
not	O
believe	O
the	O
place	O
to	O

the	O

was	O
good	O

The	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
impossibility	O
of	O
anchoring	O
at	O
this	O
island	O
occasioned	O
a	O
general	O
melancholy	O
on	O

we	O
considered	O
it	O
as	O
little	O

the	O
prelude	O
to	O
our	O
destruction	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
despondency	O
was	O
increased	O
by	O
a	O
disappointment	O

met	O
with	O
the	O
succeeding	O
night	O

as	O
we	O
were	O
plying	O
under	O

with	O
an	O
intention	O

OUR	O

AN	O

AND	O
OF	O
OUR	O
PROCEEDINGS	O
THERE	O

THE	O
``	O

''	O
DROVE	O
OUT	O
TO	O
SEA	O
It	O
was	O
the	O
26th	O
of	O
August	O
,	O
1742	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
lost	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Anatacan	PNM
,	O
dreading	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
last	O
land	O
we	O
should	O
ever	O
fix	O
our	O
eyes	O
on	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
we	O
discovered	O
three	O
other	O
islands	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
between	O
ten	O
and	O
fourteen	O
leagues	O
distant	O
from	O
us	O
.	O

These	O
were	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
afterwards	O
learnt	O
,	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Saypan	PNM
,	PNM
Tinian	PNM
,	O
and	O
Aguigan	PNM
.	O

We	O
immediately	O
steered	O
towards	O
Tinian	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
middlemost	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
had	O
so	O
much	O
of	O
calms	O
and	O
light	O
airs	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
we	O
were	O
helped	O
forwards	O
by	O
the	O
currents	O
,	O
yet	O
on	O
the	O
morrow	O
,	O
at	O
daybreak	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
advanced	O
nearer	O
than	O
within	O
five	O
leagues	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
kept	O
on	O
our	O
course	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
ten	O
o'clock	O
we	O
perceived	O
a	O
proa	O
under	O
sail	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
between	O
Tinian	PNM
and	O
Aguigan	PNM
.	O

As	O
we	O
imagined	O
from	O
hence	O
that	O
these	O
islands	O
were	O
inhabited	O
,	O
and	O
knew	O
that	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
had	O
always	O
a	O
force	O
at	O
Guam	PNM
,	O
we	O
took	O
the	O
necessary	O
precautions	O
for	O
our	O
own	O
security	O
:	O
and	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
prevent	O
the	O
enemy	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
possible	O
from	O
making	O
an	O
advantage	O
of	O
our	O
present	O
wretched	O
circumstances	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
feared	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
sufficiently	O
informed	O
by	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
our	O
working	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

We	O
therefore	O
mustered	O
all	O
our	O
hands	O
who	O
were	O
capable	O
of	O
standing	O
to	O
their	O
arms	O
,	O
and	O
loaded	O
our	O
upper	O
and	O
quarter-deck	O
guns	O
with	O
grape	O
shot	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
the	O
more	O
readily	O
procure	O
some	O
intelligence	O
of	O
the	O
state	O
of	O
these	O
islands	O
,	O
we	O
showed	O
Spanish	O
colours	O
,	O
and	O
hoisted	O
a	O
red	O
flag	O
at	O
the	O
fore	O
top-mast-head	O
,	O
hoping	O
thereby	O
to	O
give	O
our	O
ship	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
the	O
Manila	PNM
galeon	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
decoy	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
on	O
board	O
us	O
.	O

Thus	O
preparing	O
ourselves	O
,	O
and	O
standing	O
towards	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
near	O
enough	O
,	O
at	O
three	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
to	O
send	O
the	O
cutter	O
on	O
shore	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
a	O
proper	O
birth	O
for	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
soon	O
perceived	O
that	O
-LCB-	O

-RCB-	O
a	O
proa	O
put	O
off	O
from	O
the	O
island	O
to	O
meet	O
the	O
cutter	O
,	O
fully	O
persuaded	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
afterwards	O
found	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
the	O
Manila	PNM
ship	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
cutter	O
returning	O
with	O
the	O
proa	O
in	O
tow	O
,	O
we	O
instantly	O
sent	O
the	O
pinnace	O
to	O
receive	O
the	O
proa	O
and	O
the	O
prisoners	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
bring	O
them	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
cutter	O
might	O
proceed	O
on	O
her	O
errand	O
.	O

The	O
pinnace	O
came	O
back	O
with	O
a	O
Spaniard	O
and	O
four	O
Indians	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
the	O
people	O
taken	O
in	O
the	O
proa	O
:	O
and	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
being	O
immediately	O
examined	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
produce	O
and	O
circumstances	O
of	O
this	O
island	O
of	O
Tinian	PNM
,	O
his	O
account	O
of	O
it	O
surpassed	O
even	O
our	O
most	O
sanguine	O
hopes	O
.	O

For	O
he	O
informed	O
us	O
that	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
uninhabited	O
-LRB-	O
which	O
in	O
itself	O
,	O
considering	O
our	O
present	O
defenceless	O
condition	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
convenience	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
despised	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
wanted	O
but	O
few	O
of	O
the	O
accommodations	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
expected	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
cultivated	O
country	O
.	O

In	O
particular	O
,	O
he	O
assured	O
us	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
plenty	O
of	O
very	O
good	O
water	O
;	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
an	O
incredible	O
number	O
of	O
cattle	O
,	O
hogs	O
,	O
and	O
poultry	O
running	O
wild	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
excellent	O
in	O
their	O
kind	O
;	O
that	O
the	O
woods	O
afforded	O
sweet	O
and	O
sour	O
oranges	O
,	O
limes	O
,	O
lemons	O
,	O
and	O
coconuts	O
in	O
great	O
abundance	O
,	O
besides	O
a	O
fruit	O
peculiar	O
to	O
these	O
islands	O
,	O
which	O
served	O
instead	O
of	O
bread	O
;	O
that	O
from	O
the	O
quantity	O
and	O
goodness	O
of	O
the	O
provisions	O
produced	O
here	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
at	O
Guam	PNM
made	O
use	O
of	O
it	O
as	O
a	O
store	O
for	O
supplying	O
the	O
garrison	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
himself	O
was	O
a	O
serjeant	O
of	O
that	O
garrison	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
sent	O
hither	O
with	O
twenty-two	O
Indians	O
to	O
jerk	O
beef	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
to	O
load	O
for	O
Guam	PNM
on	O
board	O
a	O
small	O
bark	O
of	O
about	O
fifteen	O
tun	O
,	O
which	O
lay	O
at	O
anchor	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

This	O
relation	O
was	O
received	O
by	O
us	O
with	O
inexpressible	O
joy	O
.	O

Part	O
of	O
it	O
we	O
were	O
ourselves	O
able	O
to	O
verify	O
on	O
the	O
spot	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
near	O
enough	O
to	O
discover	O
several	O
numerous	O
herds	O
of	O
cattle	O
feeding	O
in	O
different	O
places	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
any	O
ways	O
doubt	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
his	O
narration	O
,	O
since	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
the	O
shore	O
prejudiced	O
us	O
greatly	O
in	O
its	O
favour	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
us	O
hope	O
that	O
not	O
only	O
our	O
necessities	O
might	O
be	O
there	O
fully	O
relieved	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
diseased	O
recovered	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
,	O
amidst	O
those	O
pleasing	O
scenes	O
which	O
were	O
then	O
in	O
view	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
procure	O
ourselves	O
some	O
amusement	O
and	O
relaxation	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
numerous	O
fatigues	O
we	O
had	O
undergone	O
.	O

For	O
the	O
prospect	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
did	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
resemble	O
that	O
of	O
an	O
uninhabited	O
and	O
uncultivated	O
place	O
;	O
but	O
had	O
much	O
more	O
the	O
air	O
of	O
a	O
magnificent	O
plantation	O
where	O
large	O
lawns	O
and	O
stately	O
woods	O
had	O
been	O
laid	O
out	O
together	O
with	O
great	O
skill	O
,	O
-LCB-	O

-RCB-	O
and	O
where	O
the	O
whole	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
artfully	O
combined	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
judiciously	O
adapted	O
to	O
the	O
slopes	O
of	O
the	O
hills	O

and	O
the	O

of	O

to	O

an	O

at	O

never	O

we	O

The	O

from	O
whom	O
we	O
received	O
the	O
account	O

us	O
that	O
there	O

on	O

under	O
his	O
command	O

employed	O
in	O

that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
bark	O
at	O
anchor	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
desirous	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O

to	O
prevent	O
the	O
Indians	O
from	O
escaping	O
,	O
since	O
they	O
would	O
certainly	O
have	O
given	O
the	O
Governor	O
of	O
Guam	PNM
intelligence	O
of	O
our	O
arrival	O
:	O
we	O
therefore	O
immediately	O
dispatched	O
the	O
pinnace	O
to	O
secure	O
the	O
bark	O
,	O
as	O
the	O

told	O
us	O
that	O
was	O
the	O

embarkation	O
on	O
the	O
place	O

and	O
then	O
about	O

in	O

We	O
found	O
on	O

many	O

we	O

were	O
at	O

ten	O

we	O
had	O
no	O

Our	O

at	O

The	O

were	O
likewise	O
run	O
down	O

Besides	O
the	O

but	O
as	O
they	O

or	O
to	O
hunt	O
them	O
with	O
large	O

but	O
though	O
they	O

the	O
hogs	O
fought	O
with	O
so	O

that	O
they	O
frequently	O

whence	O
we	O
by	O

that	O
our	O

It	O
may	O
now	O
perhaps	O
be	O
wondered	O
at	O
that	O
an	O
island	O
so	O
exquisitely	O
furnished	O
with	O
the	O
conveniencies	O
of	O
life	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
well	O
adapted	O
not	O
only	O
to	O
the	O
subsistence	O
but	O
likewise	O
to	O
the	O
enjoyment	O
of	O
mankind	O
,	O
should	O
be	O
entirely	O
destitute	O
of	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
especially	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
in	O
the	O
neighbourhood	O
of	O
other	O
islands	O
,	O
which	O
in	O
some	O
measure	O
depend	O
upon	O
this	O
for	O
their	O
support	O
.	O

To	O
obviate	O
this	O
difficulty	O
,	O
I	O
must	O
observe	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
fifty	O
years	O
since	O
the	O
island	O
was	O
depopulated	O
.	O

The	O
Indians	O
we	O
had	O
in	O
our	O
custody	O
assured	O
us	O
that	O
formerly	O
the	O
three	O
islands	O
of	O
Tinian	PNM
,	PNM
Rota	PNM
,	O
and	O
Guam	O
were	O
all	O
full	O
of	O
inhabitants	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
Tinian	O
alone	O
contained	O
thirty	O
thousand	O
souls	O
:	O
but	O
a	O
sickness	O
raging	O
amongst	O
these	O
islands	O
which	O
destroyed	O
multitudes	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
to	O
recruit	O
their	O
numbers	O
at	O
Guam	PNM
,	O
which	O
were	O
extremely	O
diminished	O
by	O
the	O
mortality	O
,	O
ordered	O
all	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
of	O
Tinian	PNM
thither	O
;	O
where	O
,	O
languishing	O
for	O
their	O
former	O

and	O
their	O

method	O
of	O
life	O
,	O
the	O
greatest	O
part	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
years	O
died	O
of	O
grief	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
independent	O
of	O
that	O
attachment	O
which	O
all	O
mankind	O
have	O
ever	O
shown	O
to	O
the	O
places	O
of	O
their	O
birth	O
and	O
bringing	O
up	O
,	O
it	O
should	O
seem	O
from	O
what	O
has	O
been	O
already	O
said	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
few	O
countries	O
more	O
worthy	O
to	O
be	O
regretted	O
than	O
this	O
of	O
Tinian	PNM
.	O

These	O
poor	O
Indians	O
might	O
reasonably	O
have	O
expected	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
great	O
distance	O
from	O
Spain	PNM
where	O
they	O
were	O
placed	O
,	O
to	O
have	O
escaped	O
the	O
violence	O
and	O
cruelty	O
of	O
that	O
haughty	O
nation	O
,	O
so	O
fatal	O
to	O
a	O
large	O
proportion	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
human	O
race	O
:	O
but	O
it	O
seems	O
their	O
remote	O
situation	O
could	O
not	O
protect	O
them	O
from	O
sharing	O
in	O
the	O
common	O
destruction	O
of	O
the	O
western	O
world	O
;	O
all	O
the	O
advantage	O
they	O

from	O
their	O
distance	O
being	O
only	O
to	O
perish	O
an	O
age	O
or	O

It	O
may	O
perhaps	O
be	O
doubted	O
if	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
of	O

what	O
we	O

not	O
to	O

the	O

If	O
the	O
account	O
our	O
prisoners	O
gave	O
us	O
of	O
these	O

was	O
true	O
,	O
the	O
island	O
must	O
indeed	O
have	O
been	O
most	O
extraordinary	O
well	O
peopled	O
;	O
since	O

that	O

the	O

Having	O
briefly	O
recounted	O
the	O

this	O
place	O
,	O
the	O
excellency	O
and	O
quantity	O
of	O
its	O

the	O

and	O
the	O
variety	O
and	O
elegance	O
of	O
the	O
views	O
it	O
afforded	O
,	O
I	O
must	O
now	O
observe	O
that	O
all	O
these	O
advantages	O
were	O
greatly	O
enhanced	O
by	O
the	O
healthiness	O
of	O
its	O
climate	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
almost	O
constant	O
breezes	O
which	O
prevail	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
frequent	O
showers	O
which	O
fell	O
there	O
;	O
for	O
these	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
the	O
heavy	O
continued	O
rains	O
which	O
in	O
some	O
countries	O
render	O
great	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
so	O
unpleasing	O
,	O
were	O
usually	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
short	O
and	O
almost	O
momentary	O
duration	O
.	O

Hence	O
they	O
were	O
extremely	O
grateful	O
and	O
refreshing	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
perhaps	O
one	O
cause	O
of	O
the	O
salubrity	O
of	O
the	O
air	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
extraordinary	O
influence	O
it	O
was	O
observed	O
to	O
have	O
upon	O
us	O
in	O
increasing	O
and	O
invigorating	O
our	O
appetites	O
and	O
digestion	O

This	O
effect	O
was	O
indeed	O
remarkable	O

since	O

and	O
temperate	O

who	O
,	O
besides	O
a	O

used	O
to	O
make	O

one	O

transformed	O
into	O

;	O
for	O
instead	O
of	O
one	O
reasonable	O

,	O
they	O
were	O
now	O
scarcely	O
satisfied	O
with	O

a	O

And	O
yet	O
our	O

so	O
well	O
corresponded	O
to	O
the	O

What	O
adds	O
to	O

the	O

Our	O

four	O

One	O
of	O

the	O
most	O

two	O
of	O

one	O
of	O
them	O
unwarily	O
trusting	O
the	O

with	O
his	O

the	O
Indian	O
escaped	O
with	O
them	O
into	O
the	O

His	O
countrymen	O

who	O

were	O
apprehensive	O
of	O
suffering	O
for	O
this	O

of	O
their	O

and	O
therefore	O
begged	O

to	O
send	O
one	O

their	O

the	O
whole	O

us	O

The	O

one	O
of	O

on	O

who	O

brought	O
back	O
the	O

assured	O
us	O
he	O
had	O
found	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
pathway	O
in	O
the	O

This	O
report	O
had	O
so	O
little	O
the	O
air	O
of	O
truth	O
that	O
we	O
suspected	O
there	O
was	O
some	O
treachery	O
carrying	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
to	O
prevent	O
any	O
future	O
communication	O
amongst	O
them	O
,	O
we	O
immediately	O
ordered	O
all	O
the	O
Indians	O
who	O
were	O
in	O
our	O
power	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
permit	O
them	O
to	O
go	O
any	O
more	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

When	O
our	O
sick	O
were	O
well	O
settled	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
we	O
employed	O
all	O
the	O
hands	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
spared	O
from	O
attending	O
them	O
in	O
arming	O
the	O

with	O
a	O
good	O
rounding	O
,	O
several	O
fathom	O
from	O
the	O

them	O
from	O

here	O

This	O
being	O
compleated	O

our	O
next	O
occupation	O
was	O
our	O
leak	O

and	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
raise	O
it	O
out	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
we	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
first	O
of	O
September	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
guns	O
aft	O
to	O
bring	O
the	O

by	O
the	O
stern	O
;	O
and	O
now	O
the	O
carpenters	O
,	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
come	O
at	O
it	O
on	O
the	O
outside	O

they	O
ripped	O
off	O
what	O

of	O
the	O

caulked	O
all	O
the	O

on	O
both	O

leaded	O
them	O
over	O

then	O
new	O
sheathed	O
the	O
bows	O
to	O
the	O
surface	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
.	O

By	O
this	O
means	O
we	O
conceived	O
the	O
defect	O
was	O
sufficiently	O
secured	O
,	O
but	O
upon	O
our	O
beginning	O
to	O
return	O
the	O
guns	O
to	O
their	O
ports	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
mortification	O
to	O
perceive	O
that	O
the	O
water	O
rushed	O
into	O
the	O
ship	O
in	O
the	O
old	O
place	O
with	O
as	O
much	O
violence	O
as	O
ever	O
.	O

Hereupon	O
we	O
were	O
necessitated	O
to	O
begin	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
our	O
second	O
attempt	O
might	O
be	O
more	O
successful	O
,	O
we	O
cleared	O
the	O
fore	O
store-room	O
and	O
sent	O
a	O
hundred	O
and	O
thirty	O
barrels	O
of	O
powder	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
small	O
Spanish	O
bark	O
we	O
had	O
seized	O
here	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
means	O
we	O
raised	O
the	O
ship	O
about	O
three	O
feet	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
forwards	O

The	O
carpenters	O
now	O

off	O
the	O

caulked	O
all	O
the	O

and	O
afterwards	O
laid	O

and	O
then	O
,	O
supposing	O
the	O
leak	O
to	O
be	O
effectually	O
stopped	O

we	O
began	O
to	O
move	O
the	O
guns	O
forwards	O
;	O
but	O
the	O

were	O
scarcely	O

to	O
our	O
amazement	O

it	O
burst	O
out	O

As	O
we	O

not	O
cut	O

a	O

Indeed	O
by	O
this	O
means	O
the	O
leak	O
was	O
stopped	O
for	O
some	O

when	O
our	O

were	O

our	O

hole	O
in	O
the	O
stem	O
where	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
bolts	O
was	O
driven	O

We	O
on	O
this	O
desisted	O
from	O
all	O

efforts	O

being	O
at	O

well	O
assured	O
that	O
the	O

that	O
it	O

the	O

the	O
view	O
of	O
staying	O
a	O

that	O
no	O

The	O

We	O
likewise	O

we	O
to	O

this	O
conjuncture	O
we	O
should	O
have	O

extremely	O
glad	O
that	O
the	O

on	O

all	O

there	O

of	O

to	O
hear	O
the	O

the	O

amongst	O

the	O

immediately	O
concluded	O
that	O

intreated	O
the	O

In	O
either	O
of	O

Mr.	O

could	O
have	O
wished	O

He	O
indeed	O
raised	O
their	O
spirits	O
by	O
showing	O
them	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O
their	O
getting	O
away	O

of	O
which	O

had	O
before	O
despaired	O
;	O
but	O
then	O
from	O
their	O
confidence	O
in	O
this	O
resource	O
they	O
grew	O
less	O
apprehensive	O
of	O
their	O
situation	O
,	O
gave	O
a	O
greater	O
scope	O
to	O
their	O
hopes	O
,	O
and	O
flattered	O
themselves	O
that	O
the	O

would	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
regain	O
the	O

and	O
prevent	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
the	O

which	O
they	O
could	O
easily	O
foresee	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
work	O
of	O
considerable	O
labour	O

Hence	O
it	O
was	O
some	O
days	O
before	O

were	O
all	O
of	O

engaged	O
in	O
the	O

at	O

being	O
convinced	O
of	O
the	O
impossibility	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O

return	O
,	O
they	O
betook	O
themselves	O
zealously	O
to	O
the	O
different	O
tasks	O
allotted	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
as	O

as	O

could	O

punctually	O

And	O
here	O
I	O
must	O
interrupt	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
this	O
transaction	O
to	O
relate	O
an	O
incident	O
which	O
for	O
a	O

gave	O
Mr.	O

more	O
concern	O
than	O
all	O
the	O

A	O
few	O
days	O
after	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
driven	O
off	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
the	O

on	O

cried	O

``	O
A	O

This	O
spread	O
a	O

joy	O

every	O

supposing	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O

presently	O

a	O

The	O

eagerly	O
turned	O

wrought	O
on	O
him	O
so	O
powerfully	O
that	O
to	O
conceal	O
his	O
emotion	O
he	O
was	O
obliged	O
-LRB-	O
without	O

to	O
any	O

-RRB-	O
instantly	O
to	O
retire	O
to	O

where	O
he	O
passed	O
some	O
bitter	O
moments	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
firm	O
belief	O
that	O

However	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
soon	O
relieved	O
from	O

by	O
discovering	O
that	O
the	O

;	O
and	O
perceiving	O
that	O

he	O
directed	O
every	O
appearance	O
that	O
could	O
give	O
them	O
any	O

were	O
on	O

when	O
the	O
ship	O
drove	O
out	O
to	O
sea	O
;	O
the	O
smith	O
too	O
was	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
with	O
him	O
his	O
forge	O
and	O
several	O
of	O
his	O
tools	O
,	O
but	O
unhappily	O
his	O
bellows	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
brought	O
from	O
on	O

,	O
so	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
incapable	O
of	O
working	O

and	O
without	O
his	O
assistance	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
hope	O
to	O
proceed	O
with	O
their	O
design	O

Their	O
first	O
attention	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
was	O
to	O
make	O
him	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
bellows	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
this	O
they	O
were	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
puzzled	O
by	O
their	O
want	O
of	O
leather	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
hides	O
in	O
sufficient	O
plenty	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
had	O
found	O
a	O
hogshead	O
of	O
lime	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
Indians	O
or	O
Spaniards	O
had	O
prepared	O
for	O
their	O
own	O
use	O
,	O
they	O
tanned	O
a	O
few	O
hides	O
with	O
this	O
lime	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
we	O
may	O
suppose	O
the	O
workmanship	O
to	O
be	O
but	O
indifferent	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
leather	O
they	O
thus	O
procured	O
answered	O
the	O
intention	O
tolerably	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
bellows	O
,	O
to	O
which	O
a	O
gun-barrel	O
served	O
for	O
a	O

,	O
had	O
no	O
other	O
inconvenience	O
than	O
that	O
of	O

somewhat	O

from	O
the	O
imperfection	O
of	O
the	O

Whilst	O
the	O

this	O

together	O
with	O
the	O

would	O

to	O

her	O

And	O
as	O
they	O

that	O

they	O
could	O
not	O

her	O
quite	O
forty	O

she	O

have	O

incapable	O
of	O

half	O
the	O

all	O
at	O
the	O

there	O
would	O
be	O
no	O

this	O
was	O
a	O

found	O
upon	O

this	O

to	O

an	O
expedition	O
to	O
the	O

,	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
told	O
that	O
the	O

had	O
large	O
plantations	O
of	O

under	O
the	O

of	O

But	O
as	O
this	O
last	O
measure	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
executed	O
by	O
force	O
,	O
it	O
became	O
necessary	O
to	O
examine	O
what	O
ammunition	O
had	O
been	O
left	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
preserve	O
it	O
carefully	O
;	O
and	O
on	O
this	O
enquiry	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
the	O
mortification	O
to	O
find	O
that	O
their	O
firelocks	O
would	O
be	O
of	O
little	O
service	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
since	O
all	O
the	O
powder	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
collected	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
strictest	O
search	O
,	O
did	O
not	O
amount	O
to	O
more	O
than	O
ninety	O
charges	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
considerably	O
short	O
of	O
one	O
apiece	O
to	O
each	O
of	O
the	O
company	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
indeed	O
a	O
very	O
slender	O
stock	O
of	O
ammunition	O
for	O
such	O
as	O
were	O
to	O
eat	O
no	O
grain	O
or	O
bread	O
during	O
a	O
whole	O
month	O
,	O
except	O
what	O
they	O
were	O
to	O
procure	O
by	O

of	O

But	O
the	O
most	O
alarming	O
circumstance	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
,	O
without	O
the	O
providential	O
interposition	O
of	O
very	O
improbable	O
events	O
,	O
would	O
have	O
rendered	O
all	O
their	O
schemes	O
abortive	O
,	O

to	O
be	O

The	O
general	O
idea	O
of	O
the	O
fabric	O
and	O
equipment	O
of	O
the	O
vessel	O
was	O
settled	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
being	O
done	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
difficult	O
to	O
frame	O
some	O
estimation	O
of	O
the	O
time	O
necessary	O
to	O
compleat	O
her	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
natural	O
to	O
expect	O
that	O
the	O
officers	O
would	O
consider	O
the	O
course	O
they	O
were	O
to	O
steer	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
land	O
they	O
were	O
to	O
make	O
.	O

These	O
reflections	O
led	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
disheartning	O
discovery	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
neither	O
compass	O
nor	O
quadrant	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

Indeed	O
the	O
commodore	O
had	O
brought	O
a	O
pocket-compass	O
on	O
shore	O
for	O
his	O
own	O
use	O
,	O
but	O
Lieutenant	O
Brett	O
had	O
borrowed	O
it	O
to	O
determine	O
the	O
position	O
of	O
the	O
neighbouring	O
islands	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
driven	O
to	O
sea	O
in	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
without	O
returning	O
it	O
.	O

And	O
as	O
to	O
a	O
quadrant	O
,	O
that	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
expected	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
since	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
of	O
no	O
use	O
at	O
land	O
,	O
there	O
could	O
be	O
no	O
reason	O
for	O
bringing	O
it	O
from	O
on	O

the	O

There	O
were	O
now	O
eight	O

elapsed	O
since	O
the	O

and	O
yet	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
in	O
any	O
degree	O
relieved	O
from	O
this	O
terrible	O
perplexity	O

At	O
last	O
,	O
in	O
rumaging	O
a	O
chest	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
Spanish	O
bark	O
,	O
they	O
discovered	O
a	O
small	O
compass	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
though	O
little	O
better	O
than	O
the	O
toys	O
usually	O
made	O
for	O
the	O
amusement	O
of	O

,	O
was	O
to	O
them	O
an	O
invaluable	O
treasure	O

And	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
after	O
,	O
by	O
a	O
similar	O
piece	O
of	O
good	O
fortune	O
,	O
they	O
met	O
with	O
a	O

which	O
had	O
been	O
thrown	O
overboard	O

The	O

was	O
eagerly	O

on	O

unluckily	O

this	O
to	O

as	O
a	O

consideration	O

For	O
we	O
all	O
imagined	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
driving	O
directly	O
on	O
the	O
neighbouring	O
island	O
of	O
Aguiguan	PNM
,	O
which	O
was	O
about	O
two	O

;	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
lowered	O
our	O
main	O
and	O
fore-yards	O
close	O
down	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
no	O

the	O

which	O
was	O
altogether	O
insufficient	O
to	O
carry	O
us	O
clear	O
of	O
this	O
imminent	O
peril	O
.	O

Urged	O
therefore	O
by	O
this	O
pressing	O
emergency	O
,	O
we	O
immediately	O
applied	O
ourselves	O
to	O
work	O
,	O
endeavouring	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
of	O
our	O
efforts	O
to	O
heave	O
up	O
the	O
main	O
and	O

,	O
in	O
hopes	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
but	O
be	O
enabled	O
to	O
make	O
use	O
of	O
our	O

we	O
might	O
possibly	O
weather	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
thereby	O
save	O
ourselves	O
from	O
this	O
impending	O

But	O
after	O
full	O
three	O
hours	O
'	O
ineffectual	O
labour	O
,	O
the	O
jeers	O
broke	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
men	O
being	O
quite	O
jaded	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
,	O
by	O
mere	O
debility	O
,	O
to	O
desist	O
,	O
and	O
quietly	O
to	O
expect	O
our	O
fate	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
then	O
conceived	O
to	O
be	O
unavoidable	O

For	O
we	O
soon	O
esteemed	O
ourselves	O
to	O
be	O
driven	O
just	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
night	O
was	O
so	O
extremely	O
dark	O
that	O
we	O
expected	O
to	O
discover	O
the	O
island	O
no	O
otherwise	O
than	O
by	O
striking	O
upon	O
it	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
belief	O
of	O
our	O
destruction	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
uncertainty	O
of	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
time	O
when	O
it	O
should	O
take	O
place	O
,	O
occasioned	O
us	O
to	O
pass	O
several	O
hours	O
under	O
the	O
most	O
serious	O
apprehensions	O
that	O
each	O
succeeding	O
moment	O
would	O
send	O
us	O
to	O
the	O
bottom	O

Nor	O
did	O
these	O
continued	O
terrors	O
of	O
instantly	O
striking	O
and	O
sinking	O
end	O
but	O
with	O
the	O
daybreak	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
with	O
great	O
transport	O
perceived	O
that	O
the	O
island	O
we	O
had	O
thus	O
dreaded	O
was	O
at	O
a	O
considerable	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
a	O
strong	O
northern	O
current	O
had	O
been	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
our	O
preservation	O
.	O

The	O
turbulent	O
weather	O
which	O
forced	O
us	O
from	O
Tinian	PNM
did	O
not	O
abate	O
till	O
three	O
days	O
after	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
swayed	O
up	O
the	O
fore-yard	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
heave	O
up	O
the	O
main-yard	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
jeers	O
broke	O
again	O
and	O
killed	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
,	O
and	O
prevented	O
us	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
from	O
proceeding	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
being	O
the	O
26th	O
of	O
September	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
day	O
of	O
most	O
severe	O
fatigue	O
to	O
us	O

for	O
it	O
must	O
be	O

in	O

no	O

person	O
from	O
the	O

bodily	O
labour	O
of	O

The	O
business	O
of	O
this	O
day	O
was	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
an	O
endeavour	O
to	O
heave	O
up	O
the	O

we	O

we	O
had	O
this	O
most	O

consideration	O
to	O
animate	O
us	O

that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
only	O

without	O

hazards	O
whenever	O

fell	O
in	O
with	O
the	O

again	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O

being	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
fully	O
apprized	O
of	O
the	O
consequence	O
of	O
this	O
enterprize	O
,	O
we	O
laboured	O
at	O
it	O
with	O
the	O
severest	O
application	O
for	O
twelve	O
hours	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
had	O
indeed	O
made	O
a	O
considerable	O
progress	O
,	O
having	O
brought	O
the	O
anchor	O
in	O
sight	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
growing	O
dark	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
being	O
excessively	O
fatigued	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
desist	O

and	O
to	O
leave	O
our	O
work	O
unfinished	O
till	O
the	O
next	O

then	O
,	O
refreshed	O
by	O
the	O
benefit	O
of	O
a	O
night	O

rest	O

we	O
compleated	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
hung	O
the	O
anchor	O
at	O
our	O
bow	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
27th	O
of	O
September	O
,	O
that	O
is	O

five	O
days	O
after	O
our	O

before	O

However	O

we	O
the	O

got	O
up	O

so	O
that	O

in	O
some	O

the	O

and	O
being	O

we	O
set	O

for	O
the	O

to	O

hopes	O
of	O

the	O

of	O

in	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
,	O
since	O
,	O
by	O
our	O
accounts	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
only	O
forty-seven	O

to	O
the	O

Hence	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
first	O
day	O
of	O
October	O
,	O
having	O
then	O
run	O
the	O
distance	O
necessary	O
for	O

the	O

according	O
to	O

we	O
were	O
in	O
full	O

seeing	O
it	O

but	O
here	O
we	O
were	O
unhappily	O
disappointed	O

and	O
were	O
thereby	O
convinced	O
that	O
a	O
current	O
had	O
driven	O
us	O
considerably	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
.	O

This	O
discovery	O
threw	O
us	O
into	O
a	O
new	O
perplexity	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
judge	O
how	O
much	O
we	O
might	O
hereby	O
have	O
deviated	O

and	O
consequently	O
how	O
long	O
we	O
might	O
still	O
expect	O
to	O
be	O
at	O
sea	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
great	O
apprehensions	O
that	O
our	O
stock	O
of	O
water	O
would	O
prove	O
deficient	O
,	O
since	O
we	O
were	O
doubtful	O
about	O
the	O
quantity	O
we	O
had	O
on	O

finding	O
many	O
of	O
our	O
casks	O
so	O
decayed	O
as	O
to	O

half	O
leaked	O
out	O

However	O

we	O
were	O
delivered	O
from	O
our	O
uncertainty	O
the	O
next	O
day	O

having	O
then	O
a	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
of	O

,	O
and	O
hence	O
we	O
computed	O
that	O
the	O
currents	O
had	O
driven	O
us	O
forty-four	O
leagues	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
of	O
our	O

Being	O
now	O
satisfied	O
of	O
our	O
situation	O
by	O
this	O
sight	O
of	O

we	O
kept	O
plying	O
to	O

with	O
excessive	O
labour	O
;	O
for	O
the	O

-RCB-	O
On	O
our	O
arrival	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
Spanish	O
bark	O
,	O
the	O
old	O
object	O
of	O
their	O
hopes	O
,	O
had	O
undergone	O
a	O
new	O
metamorphosis	O
:	O
for	O
those	O
on	O
shore	O
despairing	O
of	O
our	O
return	O
,	O
and	O
conceiving	O
that	O
the	O
lengthening	O
the	O
bark	O
,	O
as	O
formerly	O
proposed	O
,	O
was	O
both	O
a	O
toilsome	O
and	O
unnecessary	O
measure	O
,	O
considering	O
the	O
small	O
number	O
they	O
consisted	O
of	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
resolved	O
to	O
join	O
her	O
again	O
and	O
to	O
restore	O
her	O
to	O
her	O
first	O
state	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
this	O
scheme	O
they	O
had	O
made	O
some	O
progress	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
brought	O
the	O
two	O
parts	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
have	O
soon	O
compleated	O
her	O
,	O
had	O
not	O
our	O
coming	O
back	O
put	O
a	O
period	O
to	O
their	O
labours	O
and	O
disquietudes	O
.	O

These	O
people	O
we	O
had	O
left	O
behind	O
informed	O
us	O
that	O
just	O
before	O
we	O
were	O
seen	O
in	O
the	O
offing	O
two	O
proas	O
had	O
stood	O
in	O
very	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
continued	O
there	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
;	O
but	O
on	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
our	O
ship	O
they	O
crowded	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
presently	O
out	O
of	O
sight	O
.	O

And	O
on	O
this	O
occasion	O
I	O
must	O
mention	O
an	O
incident	O
,	O
which	O
though	O
it	O
happened	O
during	O
the	O
first	O
absence	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
was	O
then	O
omitted	O
,	O
to	O
avoid	O
interrupting	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
the	O
narration	O
.	O

It	O
hath	O
been	O
already	O
observed	O
that	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
detachment	O
sent	O
to	O
this	O
island	O
under	O
the	O
command	O
of	O
the	O
Spanish	O
Serjeant	O
lay	O
concealed	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
.	O

Indeed	O
we	O
were	O
the	O
less	O
solicitous	O
to	O
find	O
them	O
out	O
,	O
as	O
our	O
prisoners	O
all	O
assured	O
us	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
get	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
send	O
any	O
intelligence	O
about	O
us	O
to	O
Guam	PNM
.	O

But	O
when	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
drove	O
out	O
to	O
sea	O
and	O
left	O
the	O
commodore	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
he	O
one	O
day	O
,	O
attended	O
by	O
some	O
of	O
his	O
officers	O
,	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
tour	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
expedition	O
,	O
being	O
on	O
a	O
rising	O
ground	O
,	O
they	O
observed	O
in	O
the	O
valley	O
beneath	O
them	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
a	O
small	O
thicket	O
,	O
which	O
by	O
attending	O
to	O
more	O
nicely	O
they	O
found	O
had	O
a	O
progressive	O
motion	O
.	O

This	O
at	O
first	O
surprized	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
soon	O
perceived	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
several	O
large	O
coco	O
bushes	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
dragged	O
along	O
the	O
ground	O
by	O
persons	O
concealed	O
beneath	O
them	O
.	O

They	O
immediately	O
concluded	O
that	O
these	O
were	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
Serjeant	O
's	O
party	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
indeed	O
true	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
the	O
commodore	O
and	O
his	O
people	O
made	O
after	O
them	O
,	O
in	O
hopes	O
of	O
tracing	O
out	O
their	O
retreat	O
.	O

The	O
Indians	O
,	O
remarking	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
discovered	O
,	O
hurried	O
away	O
with	O
precipitation	O
;	O
but	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
was	O
so	O
near	O
them	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
lose	O
sight	O
of	O
them	O
till	O
they	O
arrived	O
at	O
their	O
cell	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
and	O
his	O
officers	O
entering	O
,	O
found	O
to	O
be	O

there	O
being	O
a	O
passage	O
from	O
it	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
contrived	O
for	O
the	O
conveniency	O
of	O
flight	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
led	O
down	O
a	O
precipice	O

They	O
here	O
met	O
with	O
an	O
old	O
firelock	O
or	O
two	O
,	O
but	O
no	O
other	O
arms	O

However	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
quantity	O
of	O
provisions	O
,	O
particularly	O
salted	O
sparibs	O
of	O
pork	O

which	O
were	O
excellent	O
;	O
and	O
from	O
what	O
our	O
people	O
saw	O
,	O
they	O
concluded	O
that	O
the	O
extraordinary	O
appetite	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
acquired	O
at	O
this	O
island	O
was	O
not	O
confined	O
to	O
themselves	O
alone	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
being	O
about	O
noon	O
,	O
the	O
Indians	O
laid	O
out	O
a	O
very	O
plentiful	O
repast	O
,	O
considering	O
their	O
numbers	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
their	O
bread-fruit	O
and	O
coconuts	O
prepared	O
ready	O
for	O
eating	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
manner	O
too	O
which	O
plainly	O
evinced	O
that	O
with	O
them	O
a	O
good	O
meal	O
was	O
neither	O
an	O
uncommon	O
nor	O
an	O
unheeded	O
article	O

The	O
commodore	O

in	O

searched	O
after	O
the	O
path	O
by	O
which	O
the	O
Indians	O
had	O
escaped	O
,	O
he	O
and	O
his	O
officers	O
contented	O
themselves	O
with	O
sitting	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
dinner	O
which	O
was	O
thus	O
luckily	O
fitted	O
to	O
their	O
present	O
hunger	O
;	O
after	O
which	O
they	O
returned	O
back	O
to	O
their	O
old	O
habitation	O

displeased	O
at	O
missing	O
the	O
Indians	O

as	O
they	O
hoped	O
to	O

engaged	O
them	O
in	O
our	O
service	O

if	O
they	O
could	O
have	O
had	O
any	O
conference	O
with	O
them	O

I	O
must	O
add	O
,	O
that	O
notwithstanding	O
what	O
our	O

had	O
asserted	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
afterwards	O
assured	O
that	O
these	O

off	O

to	O

an	O
anchor	O
again	O
,	O
after	O
our	O
second	O

off	O
to	O

by	O
the	O

to	O
fifty	O

we	O
supposed	O
would	O
be	O
sufficient	O
during	O
our	O
passage	O
to	O
Macao	PNM
,	O
we	O
on	O
the	O
next	O

sent	O
one	O
of	O

on	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

I	O
shall	O

a	O
description	O
of	O

or	O
Marian	PNM
Islands	PNM

of	O
which	O
this	O
of	O
Tinian	PNM
is	O
one	O

These	O
islands	O
were	O
discovered	O
by	O
Magellan	O
in	O
the	O
year	O
1521	O
;	O
and	O
from	O

for	O
they	O
are	O
described	O
as	O
very	O
beautiful	O
islands	O

and	O
as	O
lying	O
between	O
15	O

16	O
degrees	O
of	O

These	O
characteristics	O
are	O

applicable	O
to	O
the	O
two	O

places	O
;	O
for	O
the	O

occasioned	O
the	O

it	O
the	O

From	O
what	O
has	O

it	O
appears	O
that	O
the	O

extremely	O
few	O
compared	O

I	O
shall	O
here	O
insert	O
a	O
very	O
exact	O
description	O
of	O
the	O
build	O

of	O

fell	O
into	O

on	O
our	O
first	O
arrival	O
at	O

Mr.	O

took	O
it	O

might	O
delineate	O
its	O

with	O
greater	O
accuracy	O
:	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
following	O
account	O
may	O
be	O
relied	O
on	O
.	O

The	O
name	O
of	O
flying	O
proa	O
,	O
appropriated	O
to	O
these	O
vessels	O
,	O
is	O
owing	O
to	O
the	O
swiftness	O
with	O
which	O
they	O
sail	O
.	O

Of	O
this	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
assert	O
such	O
stories	O
as	O
must	O
appear	O
altogether	O
incredible	O
to	O
one	O
who	O
has	O
never	O
seen	O
these	O
vessels	O
move	O
;	O
nor	O
are	O
they	O
the	O
only	O
people	O
who	O
recount	O
these	O
extraordinary	O
tales	O
of	O
their	O
celerity	O

for	O
those	O
who	O
shall	O
have	O
the	O
curiosity	O
to	O
enquire	O
at	O

about	O
an	O

there	O
some	O

with	O
a	O

at	O

will	O
meet	O
with	O
accounts	O
not	O
less	O
wonderful	O
than	O
any	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
have	O
related	O

However	O
,	O
from	O
some	O
rude	O
estimations	O
made	O
by	O
us	O
of	O
the	O
velocity	O
with	O
which	O
they	O
crossed	O
the	O

at	O
a	O
distance	O
while	O
we	O
lay	O
at	O
Tinian	PNM
,	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
help	O
believing	O
that	O
with	O
a	O
brisk	O
trade-wind	O
they	O
will	O
run	O
near	O
twenty	O
miles	O
an	O

;	O
which	O
,	O
though	O
greatly	O
short	O
of	O
what	O
the	O

report	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
is	O
yet	O
a	O
prodigious	O
degree	O
of	O
swiftness	O

But	O
let	O
us	O
give	O
a	O
distinct	O
idea	O
of	O
its	O

The	O

The	O

carries	O
six	O

are	O

From	O
the	O
description	O
of	O
these	O
vessels	O
it	O
is	O
sufficiently	O
obvious	O
how	O
dexterously	O
they	O
are	O
fitted	O
for	O
ranging	O
this	O
collection	O
of	O
islands	O
called	O
the	O
Ladrones	O
:	O
since	O
as	O
these	O
islands	O
bear	O
nearly	O
N.	O
and	O
S.	O
of	O
each	O

,	O
and	O
are	O
all	O
within	O
the	O

of	O

the	O

and	O
with	O
either	O

,	O
can	O
run	O
from	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
islands	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
and	O
back	O
again	O
only	O
by	O
shifting	O
the	O

without	O
ever	O
putting	O
about	O

and	O
by	O
the	O
flatness	O
of	O
their	O
lee	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
small	O
breadth	O
,	O
they	O
are	O
capable	O
of	O
lying	O
much	O
nearer	O
the	O
wind	O
than	O
any	O
other	O
vessel	O
hitherto	O
known	O
,	O
and	O
thereby	O
have	O
an	O
advantage	O
which	O
no	O
vessels	O
that	O
go	O
large	O
can	O
ever	O
pretend	O
to	O
.	O

The	O
advantage	O
I	O
mean	O
is	O
that	O
of	O
running	O
with	O
a	O
velocity	O
nearly	O
as	O
great	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
sometimes	O
greater	O
,	O
than	O
what	O
the	O
wind	O
blows	O
with	O
.	O

This	O
,	O
however	O
paradoxical	O
it	O
may	O
appear	O
,	O
is	O
evident	O
enough	O
in	O
similar	O
instances	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
since	O
it	O
is	O
well	O
known	O
that	O
the	O
sails	O
of	O
a	O
windmill	O
often	O
move	O
faster	O
than	O
the	O
wind	O
;	O
and	O
one	O
great	O
superiority	O
of	O
common	O
windmills	O
over	O
all	O
others	O
that	O
ever	O
were	O
,	O
or	O
ever	O
will	O
be	O
,	O
contrived	O
-LCB-	O
314	O
-RCB-	O
to	O
move	O
with	O
an	O
horizontal	O
motion	O
,	O
is	O
analogous	O
to	O
the	O
case	O
we	O
have	O
mentioned	O
of	O
a	O
vessel	O
upon	O
a	O
wind	O
and	O
before	O
the	O
wind	O
:	O
for	O
the	O
sails	O
of	O
an	O
horizontal	O
windmill	O
,	O
the	O
faster	O
they	O
move	O
the	O
more	O
they	O
detract	O
from	O
the	O
impulse	O
of	O
the	O
wind	O
upon	O
them	O
;	O
whereas	O
the	O
common	O
windmills	O
,	O
by	O
moving	O
perpendicular	O
to	O
the	O
torrent	O
of	O
air	O
,	O
are	O
nearly	O
as	O
forcibly	O
acted	O
on	O
by	O
the	O
wind	O
when	O
they	O
are	O
in	O
motion	O
as	O
when	O
they	O
are	O
at	O
rest	O
.	O

Thus	O
much	O
may	O
suffice	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
description	O
and	O
nature	O
of	O
these	O
singular	O
embarkations	O
.	O

I	O
must	O
add	O
that	O
vessels	O
bearing	O
some	O
obscure	O
resemblance	O
to	O
these	O
are	O
to	O
be	O
met	O
with	O
in	O
various	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
East	PNM

,	O
but	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
learn	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
compared	O
with	O
those	O
of	O
the	O
Ladrones	O
,	O
either	O
for	O
their	O
construction	O
or	O
celerity	O
;	O
which	O
should	O
induce	O
one	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
originally	O
the	O
invention	O
of	O
some	O
genius	O
of	O
these	O
islands	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
afterwards	O
imperfectly	O
copied	O
by	O
the	O
neighbouring	O
nations	O
:	O
for	O
though	O
the	O
Ladrones	O
have	O
no	O
immediate	O
intercourse	O
with	O
any	O
other	O
people	O
,	O
yet	O
there	O
lie	O
to	O
the	O
S.	O
and	O
S.W.	O
of	O
them	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
islands	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
imagined	O
to	O
extend	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
New	PNM
Guinea	PNM
.	O

These	O
islands	O
are	O
so	O
near	O
the	O
Ladrones	O
that	O
canoes	O
from	O
them	O
have	O
sometimes	O
by	O
distress	O
been	O
driven	O
to	O
Guam	PNM
,	O
and	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
did	O
once	O
dispatch	O
a	O
bark	O
for	O
their	O
discovery	O

which	O
left	O
two	O
Jesuits	O
amongst	O
them	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
afterwards	O
murthered	O

Whence	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
presumed	O
that	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
of	O
the	O
Ladrones	O
,	O
with	O
their	O
proas	O
,	O
may	O
by	O

or	O
casualties	O
have	O
been	O

amongst	O
those	O

Indeed	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
conceive	O
that	O
the	O

range	O
of	O
islands	O
stretches	O
to	O
the	O
S.E.	O
as	O
well	O
as	O

and	O
to	O
a	O

If	O
that	O

was	O
any	O

imitation	O
of	O
the	O
flying	O

which	O
is	O
no	O
very	O
improbable	O
conjecture	O
,	O
it	O
must	O
then	O
be	O
supposed	O
that	O
a	O
range	O
of	O
islands	O
,	O
near	O
enough	O
to	O
each	O

is	O
continued	O
thither	O
from	O

This	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
farther	O
evinced	O
from	O

that	O
all	O

And	O
as	O
there	O
may	O
be	O

some	O

that	O

whence	O
in	O
this	O

On	O
the	O
21st	O
of	O
October	O
,	O
in	O

evening	O
,	O
we	O
took	O
our	O

of	O
the	O
Island	PNM
of	PNM
Tinian	PNM
,	O
steering	O
the	O
proper	O
course	O
for	O
Macao	PNM
in	O
China	PNM
.	O

The	O
eastern	O
monsoon	O
was	O
now	O
,	O
we	O
reckoned	O
,	O
fairly	O
settled	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
constant	O
gale	O
blowing	O
right	O
astern	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
generally	O
ran	O
from	O
forty	O
to	O
fifty	O
leagues	O
a	O
day	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
large	O
hollow	O
sea	O
pursuing	O
us	O
,	O
which	O
occasioned	O
the	O
ship	O
to	O
labour	O
much	O
;	O
whence	O
our	O
leak	O
was	O
augmented	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
received	O
great	O
damage	O
in	O
our	O
rigging	O
,	O
which	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
was	O
grown	O
very	O
rotten	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
our	O
people	O
were	O
now	O
happily	O
in	O
full	O
health	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
complaints	O
of	O
fatigue	O
,	O
but	O
all	O
went	O
through	O
their	O
attendance	O
on	O
the	O
pumps	O
,	O
and	O
every	O
other	O
duty	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
with	O
ease	O
and	O
chearfulness	O
.	O

Before	O
we	O
left	O
Tinian	O
we	O
swept	O
for	O
our	O
best	O
and	O
small	O
bower	O
,	O
and	O
employed	O
the	O
Indians	O
to	O
dive	O
in	O
search	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
all	O
to	O
no	O
purpose	O
.	O

Hence	O
,	O
except	O
our	O
prize	O
anchors	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
stowed	O
in	O
the	O
hold	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
too	O
light	O
to	O
be	O
depended	O
on	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
only	O
our	O
sheet-anchor	O
left	O
:	O
and	O
that	O
being	O
obviously	O
much	O
too	O
heavy	O
for	O
a	O
coasting-anchor	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
under	O
great	O
concern	O
how	O
we	O
should	O
manage	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
China	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
entire	O
strangers	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
we	O
should	O
doubtless	O
be	O
frequently	O
under	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
coming	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
at	O
length	O
removed	O
the	O
difficulty	O
by	O
fixing	O
two	O
of	O
our	O
largest	O
prize	O
anchors	O
into	O
one	O
stock	O
and	O
placing	O
between	O
their	O
shanks	O
two	O
guns	O
,	O
four	O
pounders	O
.	O

This	O
we	O
intended	O
to	O
serve	O
as	O
a	O
best	O
bower	O
:	O
and	O
a	O
third	O
prize	O
anchor	O
being	O
in	O
like	O
manner	O
joined	O
to	O
our	O
stream-anchor	O
,	O
with	O
guns	O
between	O
them	O
,	O
made	O
us	O
a	O
small	O
bower	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
besides	O
our	O
sheet-anchor	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
again	O
two	O
others	O
at	O
our	O
bows	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
which	O
weighed	O
3900	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
2900	O
pounds	O
.	O

The	O
3d	O
of	O
November	O
,	O
about	O
three	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
an	O
island	O
,	O
which	O
at	O
first	O
we	O
imagined	O
to	O
be	O
Botel	PNM

-RCB-	O
Xima	O
,	O
but	O
on	O
our	O
nearer	O
approach	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
much	O
smaller	O
than	O
that	O
is	O
usually	O
represented	O
;	O
and	O
about	O
an	O
hour	O
after	O
we	O
saw	O
another	O
island	O
,	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
miles	O
farther	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
.	O

As	O
no	O

or	O
journal	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
took	O
notice	O
of	O
any	O
island	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
of	O
Formosa	PNM
but	O
Botel	O

Xima	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
observation	O
of	O
our	O
latitude	O
at	O
noon	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
some	O
perplexity	O
,	O
apprehending	O
that	O
an	O
extraordinary	O
current	O
had	O
driven	O
us	O
into	O
the	O
neighbourhood	O
of	O
the	O
Bashee	PNM
Islands	PNM

We	O
therefore	O
,	O
when	O
night	O
came	O
on	O
,	O
brought	O
to	O
,	O
and	O
continued	O
in	O
that	O
posture	O
till	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
which	O
proving	O
dark	O
and	O
cloudy	O
,	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
prolonged	O
our	O
uncertainty	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
clearing	O
up	O
about	O
nine	O
o'clock	O
,	O
we	O
again	O
discerned	O
the	O
two	O
islands	O
abovementioned	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
now	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
pressed	O
forwards	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
eleven	O
got	O
a	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
southern	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Formosa	PNM

This	O
satisfied	O
us	O
that	O
the	O

island	O
we	O
saw	O
was	O
Botel	PNM

and	O
the	O

a	O

lying	O
five	O

,	O
not	O
being	O
mentioned	O
in	O

books	O
or	O

had	O
been	O
the	O

all	O
our	O
doubts	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
made	O
the	O
Island	PNM
of	PNM

we	O
steered	O
W.	O
by	O
S.	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
double	O
its	O
extremity	O
,	O
and	O
kept	O
a	O
good	O
look-out	O
for	O
the	O
rocks	O
of	O

,	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
not	O

and	O
the	O

at	O

it	O
was	O

that	O

where	O

by	O

the	O

it	O
was	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
we	O
were	O
surprized	O
with	O
a	O

of	O
what	O
we	O
at	O

conceived	O
to	O
have	O

but	O
on	O
a	O

we	O
discerned	O
them	O
to	O

only	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
fires	O
on	O
the	O
Island	PNM
of	PNM

These	O
we	O
imagined	O
were	O
intended	O
by	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
of	O
that	O
island	O
as	O
signals	O
to	O
invite	O
us	O
to	O

but	O
that	O
suited	O

our	O

we	O
being	O
impatient	O
to	O
reach	O
the	O
port	O
of	O
Macao	PNM
as	O
soon	O
as	O
possible	O
.	O

From	O
Formosa	PNM
we	O
steered	O
W.N.W.	O
and	O
sometimes	O
still	O
more	O
northerly	O
,	O
proposing	O
to	O
fall	O
in	O
with	O
the	O

of	O

to	O
the	O
eastward	O
of	O

as	O
the	O

is	O
usually	O
esteemed	O
an	O
excellent	O
direction	O
for	O

bound	O
to	O
Macao	PNM

We	O
continued	O
this	O
course	O
till	O
the	O
following	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
frequently	O
brought	O
to	O
,	O
to	O
try	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
soundings	O

but	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
5th	O
of	O

,	O
at	O
nine	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
before	O
we	O
struck	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
had	O
forty-two	O
fathom	O

and	O
a	O
bottom	O
of	O
grey	O

mixed	O
with	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
run	O
about	O
twenty	O
miles	O
farther	O
W.N.W.	O
we	O
had	O
thirty-five	O
fathom	O
and	O
the	O
same	O
bottom	O
;	O
then	O
our	O
soundings	O
gradually	O
decreased	O
from	O
thirty-five	O
to	O
twenty-five	O

;	O
but	O
soon	O
after	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
surprize	O
,	O
they	O
jumped	O
back	O
again	O
to	O
thirty	O

This	O
was	O
an	O
alteration	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
very	O

account	O

We	O
for	O
this	O
reason	O
kept	O
a	O
careful	O
look	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
altered	O
our	O
course	O
to	O
N.N.W.	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
run	O
thirty-five	O
miles	O
in	O
that	O
direction	O
,	O
our	O
soundings	O
again	O
gradually	O
diminished	O
to	O
twenty-two	O

,	O
and	O
we	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
about	O
midnight	O

manned	O
with	O

and	O
none	O
of	O
those	O
we	O
saw	O
with	O
less	O
than	O
three	O

Nor	O
was	O
this	O
swarm	O
of	O
fishing	O
vessels	O
peculiar	O
to	O
that	O
spot	O
:	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
ran	O
on	O
to	O
the	O

,	O
we	O
found	O
them	O
as	O
abundant	O
on	O
every	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
coast	O

We	O
at	O
first	O
doubted	O
not	O
but	O
we	O
should	O
procure	O
a	O
pilot	O
from	O
them	O
to	O
carry	O
us	O
to	O
Macao	PNM
;	O
but	O
though	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
came	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
tempt	O
them	O
by	O
showing	O
them	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
dollars	O
,	O
a	O
most	O
alluring	O
bait	O
for	O
Chinese	O
of	O
all	O
ranks	O
and	O
professions	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
entice	O
them	O
on	O
board	O
us	O
,	O
nor	O
procure	O
any	O
directions	O
from	O
them	O
;	O
though	O
,	O
I	O
presume	O
,	O
the	O
only	O
difficulty	O
was	O
their	O
not	O
comprehending	O
what	O
we	O
wanted	O
them	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
have	O
no	O
communication	O
with	O
them	O
but	O
by	O
signs	O
.	O

Indeed	O
we	O
often	O
pronounced	O
the	O
word	O
Macao	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
we	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
suppose	O
they	O
understood	O
in	O
a	O
different	O
sense	O
,	O
since	O
in	O
return	O
they	O
sometimes	O
held	O
up	O
fish	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
afterwards	O
learnt	O
that	O
the	O
Chinese	O
name	O
for	O
fish	O
is	O
of	O
a	O
somewhat	O
similar	O
sound	O
.	O

But	O
what	O
surprized	O
us	O
most	O
was	O
the	O
inattention	O
and	O
want	O
of	O
curiosity	O
which	O
we	O
observed	O
in	O
this	O
herd	O
of	O
fishermen	O
.	O

A	O
ship	O
like	O
ours	O
had	O
doubtless	O
never	O
been	O
in	O
these	O
seas	O
before	O
;	O
and	O
perhaps	O
there	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
one	O
amongst	O
all	O
the	O
Chinese	O
,	O
employed	O
in	O
that	O
fishery	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
ever	O
seen	O
any	O
European	O
vessel	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
reasonably	O
have	O
expected	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
considered	O
by	O
them	O
as	O
a	O
very	O
uncommon	O
and	O
extraordinary	O
object	O
.	O

But	O
though	O
many	O
of	O
their	O
boats	O
came	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
yet	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
appear	O
to	O
be	O
at	O
all	O
interested	O
about	O
us	O
,	O
nor	O
did	O
they	O
deviate	O
in	O
the	O
least	O
from	O
their	O
course	O
to	O
regard	O
us	O
.	O

Which	O
insensibility	O

of	O
maritime	O
persons	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
matter	O
relating	O
to	O
their	O
own	O
profession	O
,	O
is	O
scarcely	O
to	O
be	O
credited	O
,	O
did	O
not	O
the	O
general	O
behaviour	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
in	O

instances	O
furnish	O
us	O
with	O
continual	O
proofs	O
of	O
a	O
similar	O
turn	O
of	O

It	O
may	O
perhaps	O
be	O
doubted	O
whether	O
this	O
cast	O
of	O
temper	O
be	O
the	O
effect	O
of	O
nature	O

but	O
,	O
in	O

it	O
is	O
an	O
incontestable	O
symptom	O
of	O
a	O
mean	O
and	O
contemptible	O
disposition	O
,	O
and	O
is	O
alone	O
a	O
sufficient	O
confutation	O
of	O
the	O
extravagant	O
praises	O
which	O

we	O
came	O
within	O

we	O
had	O
constantly	O
a	O

to	O

we	O
were	O
in	O

and	O
very	O
near	O
it	O

we	O
had	O
for	O
a	O
short	O
space	O
a	O
bottom	O
of	O
greenish	O
mud	O
,	O
intermixed	O
with	O

It	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
5th	O
of	O
November	O
,	O
at	O
midnight	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
first	O
made	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
China	PNM

The	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
about	O
two	O
o'clock	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
standing	O
to	O
the	O

,	O
within	O
two	O

of	O
the	O

surrounded	O
by	O

vessels	O
in	O
as	O
great	O
numbers	O
as	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
we	O
perceived	O
that	O
a	O
boat	O
ahead	O
of	O
us	O
waved	O
a	O
red	O
flag	O
and	O
blew	O
a	O
horn	O
.	O

This	O
we	O
considered	O
as	O
a	O
signal	O
made	O
to	O
us	O
either	O
to	O
warn	O
us	O
of	O
some	O
shoal	O

or	O
to	O
inform	O
us	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
supply	O
us	O
with	O
a	O
pilot	O
.	O

We	O
therefore	O
immediately	O
sent	O
our	O
cutter	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
to	O
know	O
their	O
intentions	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
soon	O
convinced	O
of	O
our	O
mistake	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
that	O
this	O
boat	O
was	O
the	O
commodore	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
fishery	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
signal	O
she	O
had	O
made	O
was	O
to	O
order	O
them	O
all	O
to	O
leave	O
off	O
fishing	O
and	O
to	O
return	O
in	O
shore	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
saw	O
them	O
instantly	O
obey	O

Being	O
thus	O
disappointed	O
we	O
kept	O
on	O
our	O
course	O
,	O
and	O
shortly	O

passed	O
by	O
two	O

lay	O
four	O

five	O

we	O
therefore	O
brought	O
to	O

the	O
morning	O

when	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
satisfaction	O
to	O

it	O

Pedro	PNM

the	O

as	O
we	O

Being	O

we	O

one	O

CHAPTER	O
VII	O
PROCEEDINGS	O
AT	O
MACAO	O
The	O
city	O
of	O
Macao	PNM
,	O
in	O
the	O
road	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
on	O
the	O
12th	O
of	O
November	O
,	O
is	O
a	O
Portuguese	O
settlement	O
,	O
situated	O
in	O
an	O
island	O
at	O
the	O
entrance	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
of	O
Canton	PNM
.	O

It	O
was	O
formerly	O
very	O
rich	O
and	O
populous	O
,	O
and	O
capable	O
of	O
defending	O
itself	O
against	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
the	O
adjacent	O
Chinese	O
governors	O
:	O
but	O
at	O
present	O
it	O
is	O
much	O
fallen	O
from	O
its	O
antient	O
splendor	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
it	O
is	O
inhabited	O
by	O
Portuguese	O
,	O
and	O
hath	O
a	O
governor	O
nominated	O
by	O
the	O
King	O
of	O
Portugal	PNM
,	O
yet	O
it	O
subsists	O
merely	O
by	O
the	O
sufferance	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
,	O
who	O
can	O
starve	O
the	O
place	O
and	O
dispossess	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
whenever	O
they	O
please	O
.	O

This	O
obliges	O
the	O
Governor	O
of	O
Macao	PNM
to	O
behave	O
with	O
great	O
circumspection	O
,	O
and	O
carefully	O
to	O
avoid	O
every	O
circumstance	O
that	O
may	O
give	O
offence	O
to	O
the	O
Chinese	O
.	O

The	O
river	O
of	O
Canton	PNM
,	O
off	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
which	O
this	O
city	O
lies	O
,	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
Chinese	O
port	O
frequented	O
by	O
European	O
ships	O
;	O
and	O
is	O
,	O
on	O
many	O
accounts	O
,	O
a	O
more	O
commodious	O
harbour	O
than	O
Macao	PNM
:	O
but	O
the	O
peculiar	O
customs	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
,	O
solely	O
adapted	O
to	O
the	O
entertainment	O
of	O
trading	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
apprehensions	O
of	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
lest	O
he	O
should	O
embroil	O
the	O
East	PNM
India	PNM
Company	O
with	O
the	O
Regency	O
of	O
Canton	PNM
if	O
he	O
should	O
insist	O
on	O
being	O
treated	O
upon	O
a	O
different	O
footing	O
than	O
the	O
merchantmen	O
,	O
made	O
him	O
resolve	O
rather	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Macao	PNM
than	O
to	O
venture	O
into	O
the	O
river	PNM
of	PNM
Canton	PNM
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
had	O
not	O
this	O
reason	O
prevailed	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
himself	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
fear	O
.	O

For	O
it	O
is	O
certain	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
entered	O
the	O
port	O
of	O
Canton	PNM
,	O
and	O
might	O
have	O
continued	O
there	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
he	O
pleased	O
,	O
and	O
afterwards	O
have	O
left	O
it	O
again	O
,	O
although	O
the	O
whole	O
power	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
empire	O
had	O
been	O
brought	O
together	O
to	O
oppose	O
him	O
.	O

The	O
commodore	O
,	O
not	O
to	O
depart	O
from	O
his	O
usual	O
prudence	O
,	O
no	O
sooner	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
in	O
Macao	PNM
road	O
than	O
he	O
dispatched	O
an	O
officer	O
with	O
his	O
compliments	O
to	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
Governor	O
of	O
Macao	PNM
,	O
requesting	O
his	O
excellency	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
same	O
officer	O
,	O
to	O
advise	O
him	O
in	O
what	O
manner	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
proper	O
to	O
act	O
to	O
avoid	O
offending	O
the	O
Chinese	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
there	O
were	O
then	O
-LCB-	O
324	O
-RCB-	O
four	O
of	O
our	O
ships	O
in	O
their	O
power	O
at	O
Canton	PNM
,	O
was	O
a	O
matter	O
worthy	O
of	O
attention	O
.	O

The	O
difficulty	O
which	O
the	O
commodore	O
principally	O
apprehended	O
related	O
to	O
the	O
duty	O
usually	O
paid	O
by	O
ships	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
of	O
Canton	PNM
,	O
according	O
to	O
their	O
tunnage	O
.	O

For	O
,	O
as	O
men-of-war	O
are	O
exempted	O
in	O
every	O
foreign	O
harbour	O
from	O
all	O
manner	O
of	O
port	O
charges	O
,	O
the	O
commodore	O
thought	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
derogatory	O
to	O
the	O
honour	O
of	O
his	O
country	O
to	O
submit	O
to	O
this	O
duty	O
in	O
China	PNM
:	O
and	O
therefore	O
he	O
desired	O
the	O
advice	O
of	O
the	O
Governor	O
of	O
Macao	PNM
,	O
who	O
,	O
being	O
an	O
European	O
,	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
ignorant	O
of	O
the	O
privileges	O
claimed	O
by	O
a	O
British	O
man-of-war	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
might	O
be	O
expected	O
to	O
give	O
us	O
the	O
best	O
lights	O
for	O
obviating	O
this	O
perplexity	O
.	O

Our	O
boat	O
returned	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
with	O
two	O
officers	O
sent	O
by	O
the	O
governor	O
,	O
who	O
informed	O
the	O
commodore	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
governor	O
's	O
opinion	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
ventured	O
into	O
the	O
river	O
of	O
Canton	PNM
the	O
duty	O
would	O
certainly	O
be	O
expected	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
commodore	O
approved	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
send	O
him	O
a	O
pilot	O
,	O
who	O
should	O
conduct	O
us	O
into	O
another	O
safe	O
harbour	O
,	O
called	O
the	O
Typa	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
every	O
way	O
commodious	O
for	O
careening	O
the	O
ship	O
-LRB-	O
an	O
operation	O
we	O
were	O
resolved	O
to	O
begin	O
upon	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
possible	O
-RRB-	O
and	O
where	O
,	O
in	O
all	O
probability	O
,	O
the	O
above-mentioned	O
duty	O
would	O
never	O
be	O
demanded	O
.	O

This	O
proposal	O
the	O
commodore	O
agreed	O
to	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
weighed	O
anchor	O
,	O
under	O
the	O
direction	O
of	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
pilot	O
,	O
and	O
steered	O
for	O
the	O
intended	O
harbour	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
entered	O
between	O
two	O
islands	O
,	O
which	O
form	O
the	O
eastern	O
passage	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
our	O
soundings	O
decreased	O
to	O
three	O
fathom	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
pilot	O
assuring	O
us	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
least	O
depth	O
we	O
should	O
meet	O
with	O
,	O
we	O
continued	O
our	O
course	O
,	O
till	O
at	O
length	O
the	O
ship	O
stuck	O
fast	O
in	O
the	O
mud	O
,	O
with	O
only	O
eighteen	O
foot	O
water	O
abaft	O
;	O
and	O
,	O

tide	O
of	O
ebb	O
making	O
,	O
the	O
water	O
sewed	O
to	O
sixteen	O
feet	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
ship	O
remained	O
perfectly	O
upright	O
;	O
we	O
then	O
sounded	O
all	O
round	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
discovering	O
that	O
the	O
water	O
deepened	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
,	O
we	O
carried	O
out	O
our	O
small	O
bower	O
with	O
two	O
hawsers	O
an	O
end	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
return	O
of	O

the	O

afloat	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
breeze	O
springing	O
up	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
instant	O
,	O
we	O
set	O
the	O
fore-top	O
sail	O
and	O
,	O
slipping	O
the	O
hawser	O
,	O
ran	O
into	O
the	O
harbour	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
moored	O
in	O
about	O
five	O

water	O

This	O
harbour	O
of	O
the	O

formed	O
by	O
a	O

and	O
is	O
about	O
six	O
miles	O
distant	O
from	O

Here	O
we	O
saluted	O
the	O
castle	O
of	O
Macao	PNM
with	O
eleven	O

which	O
were	O
returned	O
by	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
the	O

paid	O
a	O
visit	O
in	O
person	O
to	O
the	O
governor	O

and	O
was	O
saluted	O
at	O

by	O
eleven	O

Mr.	O
Alison	O
's	O
business	O
in	O
this	O
visit	O
was	O
to	O
solicit	O
the	O
governor	O
to	O
grant	O
us	O
a	O
supply	O
both	O
of	O
provisions	O
and	O
of	O
such	O

stores	O
as	O
were	O
necessary	O
to	O

the	O

The	O
governor	O
seemed	O
really	O
inclined	O
to	O
do	O
us	O
all	O
the	O
service	O
he	O
could	O
,	O
and	O
assured	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
friendly	O
manner	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
privately	O
give	O
us	O
all	O
the	O
assistance	O
in	O
his	O
power	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
frankly	O
owned	O
that	O
he	O
dared	O
not	O
openly	O
to	O
furnish	O
us	O
with	O
anything	O
we	O
demanded	O
unless	O
we	O
first	O
produced	O
an	O
order	O
for	O
it	O
from	O
the	O
Viceroy	O
of	O
Canton	PNM
,	O
since	O
he	O
himself	O
neither	O
received	O
provisions	O
for	O
his	O
garrison	O
nor	O
any	O
other	O
necessaries	O
but	O
by	O
permission	O
from	O
the	O
Chinese	PNM
Government	PNM
;	O
and	O
as	O
they	O
took	O
care	O
only	O
to	O
victual	O
him	O
from	O
day	O
to	O
day	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
indeed	O
no	O
other	O
than	O
their	O
vassal	O
,	O
whom	O
they	O
could	O
at	O
all	O
times	O
compel	O
to	O
submit	O
to	O
their	O
own	O
terms	O
by	O
laying	O
an	O
embargo	O
on	O
his	O
provisions	O
.	O

On	O
this	O
declaration	O
of	O
the	O
governor	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
resolved	O
himself	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Canton	PNM
to	O
procure	O
a	O
licence	O
from	O
the	O
viceroy	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
accordingly	O
hired	O
a	O
Chinese	O
boat	O
for	O
himself	O
and	O
his	O
attendants	O
;	O
but	O
just	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
ready	O
to	O
embark	O
,	O
the	O
hoppo	O
,	O
or	O
Chinese	O
custom-house	O
officer	O
of	O
Macao	PNM
,	O
refused	O
to	O
grant	O
a	O
permit	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
ordered	O
the	O
watermen	O
not	O
to	O
proceed	O
at	O
their	O
peril	O
.	O

The	O
commodore	O
at	O
first	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
prevail	O
with	O
the	O
hoppo	O
to	O
withdraw	O
his	O
injunction	O
and	O
to	O
grant	O
a	O
permit	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
governor	O
of	O
Macao	PNM
employed	O
his	O
interest	O
with	O
the	O
hoppo	O
to	O
the	O
same	O
purpose	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
officer	O
continuing	O
inflexible	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
told	O
him	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
permit	O
was	O
any	O
longer	O
refused	O
he	O
would	O
man	O

arm	O
the	O

boats	O

asking	O
the	O

at	O
the	O

time	O
who	O
he	O
imagined	O
would	O
dare	O
to	O
oppose	O
them	O
in	O
their	O
passage	O
.	O

This	O
threat	O
immediately	O
brought	O
about	O
what	O
his	O
intreaties	O
had	O
endeavoured	O
at	O
in	O
vain	O
;	O
the	O
permit	O
was	O
granted	O

and	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
went	O
to	O
Canton	PNM

On	O
his	O
arrival	O
there	O
,	O
he	O
consulted	O
with	O
the	O
supercargoes	O

how	O
to	O
procure	O
an	O

from	O
the	O
viceroy	O
for	O
the	O
necessaries	O
he	O
wanted	O
:	O

in	O
this	O
he	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
suppose	O
that	O
the	O

not	O
the	O

how	O

is	O
not	O
easy	O
to	O

unless	O

apprehended	O
that	O
the	O
presence	O
of	O
a	O

of	O
force	O
might	O
damp	O
their	O
Manila	O
trade	O

and	O
therefore	O
acted	O
in	O
this	O
manner	O
with	O
a	O
view	O
of	O
forcing	O
the	O
commodore	O
to	O
Batavia	PNM

though	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
as	O

in	O

I	O
therefore	O
rather	O
impute	O

to	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

and	O
to	O
the	O

were	O
in	O
some	O
degree	O
terrified	O
even	O
with	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O

and	O
could	O
not	O
think	O

who	O
is	O
doubtless	O
fond	O
of	O
all	O
opportunities	O
of	O
fleecing	O
them	O

without	O

a	O

might	O

However	O

be	O
this	O

the	O

Mr.	O

therefore	O
told	O

that	O
he	O
would	O
proceed	O
to	O
Batavia	PNM
and	O
refit	O
his	O

The	O
merchants	O

on	O
this	O

undertook	O
to	O
procure	O
him	O
provisions	O

though	O
they	O
assured	O
him	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
what	O
they	O
durst	O
not	O
engage	O
in	O
openly	O

but	O
they	O
proposed	O
to	O
manage	O
it	O
in	O
a	O

by	O
putting	O
a	O

on	O

This	O
article	O

which	O

the	O

But	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
-LRB-	O
who	O
never	O
intended	O
going	O
to	O

-RRB-	O
found	O
on	O

to	O
the	O

considerably	O
increased	O
;	O
so	O
that	O

upon	O
the	O
whole	O

he	O
was	O
fully	O
satisfied	O
that	O
though	O
he	O
should	O
lay	O
in	O
a	O
sufficient	O
stock	O
of	O

yet	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
impossible	O
for	O
him	O
to	O
put	O

Since	O

if	O
he	O
left	O
the	O
port	O
with	O
his	O
ship	O
in	O
her	O
present	O
condition	O
she	O
would	O
be	O
in	O
the	O

therefore	O

notwithstanding	O

her	O
hove	O
down	O
before	O
he	O
departed	O
from	O
Macao	PNM

He	O
was	O
fully	O
convinced	O

by	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
observed	O
at	O
Canton	PNM

that	O

the	O
East	O

all	O
his	O
perplexity	O

For	O
he	O
now	O
saw	O
clearly	O
that	O

at	O

carried	O
his	O
ship	O
into	O
the	O

being	O
in	O

The	O

and	O
raised	O
many	O
difficulties	O
about	O
it	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
Mr.	O

suspected	O
him	O
of	O
being	O
in	O
league	O
with	O
the	O
merchants	O
of	O
Canton	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
always	O
shewn	O
a	O
great	O
apprehension	O
of	O
the	O

having	O
any	O
immediate	O
intercourse	O
with	O
the	O

and	O
therefore	O
the	O
commodore	O

not	O
without	O
some	O
resentment	O
,	O
took	O
back	O
his	O
letter	O
from	O

told	O
him	O

immediately	O

send	O
it	O
to	O
Canton	PNM
in	O
his	O

The	O

the	O

and	O
fearing	O
to	O

it	O

how	O

delivered	O
it	O
to	O
one	O
of	O

the	O

one	O
of	O

In	O

I	O
must	O
observe	O

too	O

having	O
omitted	O
it	O
before	O
,	O
that	O
whilst	O
we	O
lay	O
at	O

we	O
were	O
informed	O
by	O

the	O

were	O

I	O
have	O
formerly	O
taken	O
notice	O
that	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
their	O
separation	O
we	O
suspected	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
lost	O
:	O
and	O
there	O
were	O
many	O
reasons	O
which	O
greatly	O
favoured	O
this	O
suspicion	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
knew	O
that	O
the	O
_	O
Severn	O
_	O
in	O
particular	O
was	O
extremely	O
sickly	O
;	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
more	O
obvious	O
to	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
ships	O
,	O
as	O
in	O
the	O
preceding	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
voyage	O
her	O
commander	O
,	O
Captain	O
Legg	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
remarkable	O
for	O
his	O
exemplary	O
punctuality	O
in	O
keeping	O
his	O
station	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
,	O
during	O
the	O
last	O
ten	O
days	O
before	O
his	O
separation	O
,	O
his	O
crew	O
was	O
so	O
diminished	O
and	O
enfeebled	O
,	O
that	O
with	O
his	O
utmost	O
efforts	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
possibly	O
maintain	O
his	O
proper	O
position	O
with	O
his	O
wonted	O
exactness	O
.	O

The	O
extraordinary	O
sickness	O
on	O

him	O
was	O
by	O
many	O
imputed	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
new	O
,	O
and	O
on	O
that	O
account	O
was	O
believed	O
to	O
be	O

but	O
whatever	O
was	O

the	O

she	O
buryed	O
more	O

than	O
any	O
of	O
them	O

insomuch	O
that	O
the	O

was	O
obliged	O
to	O
recruit	O
her	O
with	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
fresh	O
hands	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
the	O
mortality	O
still	O

on	O

her	O

she	O
was	O

at	O

reduced	O
to	O
the	O

I	O
have	O
already	O

Hence	O
the	O
commodore	O
himself	O
firmly	O
believed	O
she	O
was	O
lost	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
it	O
was	O
with	O
great	O
joy	O
we	O
received	O
the	O

of	O
her	O
and	O
the	O

after	O
the	O
strong	O

which	O
had	O
so	O

prevailed	O

to	O
proceed	O
with	O

Notwithstanding	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

at	O
his	O
leaving	O

there	O
were	O
great	O
debates	O
in	O

upon	O
his	O
affair	O
,	O
partly	O
perhaps	O
owing	O
to	O
its	O
being	O
so	O
unusual	O
a	O
case	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
part	O
to	O
the	O
influence	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
suppose	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
intrigues	O
of	O
the	O
French	O
at	O
Canton	PNM
:	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
countryman	O
and	O
fast	O
friend	O
residing	O
on	O
the	O
spot	O
who	O
spoke	O
the	O
language	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
not	O
unacquainted	O
with	O
the	O
venality	O
of	O
the	O
government	O
,	O
nor	O
with	O
the	O
persons	O
of	O
several	O
of	O
the	O

and	O
consequently	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
at	O
a	O
loss	O
for	O

of	O
traversing	O
the	O
assistance	O
desired	O
by	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
.	O

Indeed	O
this	O
opposition	O
of	O
the	O
French	O
was	O
not	O
merely	O
the	O
effect	O
of	O
national	O
prejudice	O
,	O
or	O
a	O
contrariety	O
of	O
political	O
interests	O
;	O
but	O
was	O
in	O
good	O
measure	O
owing	O
to	O
vanity	O
,	O
a	O
motive	O
of	O
much	O
more	O
weight	O
with	O
the	O
generality	O
of	O
mankind	O
than	O
any	O
attachment	O
to	O
the	O
public	O
service	O
of	O
the	O
community	O
.	O

For	O
the	O
French	O
pretending	O
their	O
Indiamen	O
to	O
be	O
men-of-war	O
,	O
their	O
officers	O
were	O
apprehensive	O
that	O
any	O
distinction	O
granted	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
his	O
bearing	O
the	O
king	O
's	O
commission	O
would	O
render	O
them	O
less	O
considerable	O
in	O
the	O
eyes	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
establish	O
a	O
prepossession	O
at	O
Canton	PNM
in	O
favour	O
of	O
ships	O
of	O

,	O
by	O
which	O
they	O
,	O
as	O
trading	O

,	O
would	O
suffer	O
in	O
their	O
importance	O

And	O
I	O
wish	O
the	O
affectation	O
of	O
endeavouring	O
to	O
pass	O
for	O
men-of-war	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
fear	O
of	O
sinking	O
in	O
the	O

of	O

,	O
if	O
the	O

a	O

This	O
the	O

seemed	O
to	O
think	O
an	O
unreasonable	O
sum	O

and	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
persuade	O
them	O
to	O
work	O
by	O

;	O
but	O
that	O
was	O
a	O

they	O
would	O
not	O
hearken	O

;	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
at	O

agreed	O
that	O
the	O
carpenters	O
should	O
have	O
to	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
about	O
six	O
hundred	O
pounds	O
for	O
their	O
work	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
smiths	O
should	O
be	O
paid	O
for	O
their	O
iron-work	O
by	O
weight	O
,	O
allowing	O
them	O
at	O
the	O
rate	O
of	O
three	O

for	O
the	O

and	O
forty-six	O

for	O

This	O
being	O

the	O

exerted	O
himself	O
to	O
get	O
the	O

all	O

ship	O
,	O
to	O
their	O
great	O
joy	O
,	O
since	O
not	O
only	O
the	O
fatigue	O
of	O
careening	O
had	O
been	O
considerable	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
apprehensive	O
of	O
being	O
attacked	O
by	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
whilst	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
thus	O
incapacitated	O
for	O
defence	O
.	O

Nor	O
were	O
their	O
fears	O
altogether	O
groundless	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
learnt	O
afterwards	O
,	O
by	O
a	O
Portuguese	O
vessel	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
at	O
Manila	PNM
had	O
been	O
informed	O
that	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
Typa	O
,	O
and	O
intended	O
to	O
careen	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
thereupon	O
the	O
governor	O
had	O
summoned	O
his	O
council	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
proposed	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
endeavour	O
to	O
burn	O
her	O
whilst	O
she	O
was	O
careening	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
an	O
enterprize	O
which	O
,	O
if	O
properly	O
conducted	O
,	O
might	O
have	O
put	O
them	O
in	O
great	O
danger	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
farther	O
reported	O
that	O
this	O
scheme	O
was	O
not	O
only	O
proposed	O
,	O
but	O
resolved	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
a	O
captain	O
of	O
a	O
vessel	O
had	O
actually	O
undertaken	O
to	O
perform	O
the	O
business	O
for	O
forty	O
thousand	O
dollars	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
to	O
receive	O
unless	O
he	O
succeeded	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
governor	O
pretending	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
treasure	O
in	O
the	O
royal	O
chest	O
,	O
and	O
insisting	O
that	O
the	O
merchants	O
should	O
advance	O
the	O
money	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
refusing	O
to	O
comply	O
with	O
the	O
demand	O
,	O
the	O
affair	O
was	O
dropped	O
.	O

Perhaps	O
the	O
merchants	O
suspected	O
that	O
the	O
whole	O
was	O
only	O
a	O
pretext	O
to	O
get	O
forty	O
thousand	O
dollars	O
from	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
this	O
was	O
affirmed	O
by	O
some	O
who	O
bore	O
the	O
governor	O
no	O
good-will	O
,	O
but	O
with	O
what	O
truth	O
it	O
is	O
difficult	O
to	O
ascertain	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
was	O
righted	O
,	O
they	O
took	O
on	O
board	O
her	O
powder	O
and	O
gunners	O
'	O
stores	O
,	O
and	O
proceeded	O
with	O
getting	O

-RCB-	O
in	O
their	O
guns	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
possible	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
used	O
their	O
utmost	O
expedition	O
in	O
repairing	O
the	O
fore-mast	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
compleating	O
the	O
other	O
articles	O
of	O
her	O
refitment	O
.	O

But	O
whilst	O
they	O
were	O
thus	O
employed	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
alarmed	O
on	O
the	O
10th	O
of	O
March	O
by	O
a	O
Chinese	O
fisherman	O
,	O
who	O
brought	O
them	O
intelligence	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
on	O
board	O
a	O
large	O
Spanish	O
ship	O
off	O
the	O
Grand	PNM
Ladrone	PNM
,	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
two	O
more	O
in	O
company	O
with	O
her	O
.	O

He	O
added	O
several	O
particulars	O
to	O
his	O
relation	O
,	O
as	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
brought	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
officers	O
to	O
Macao	PNM
,	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
on	O
this	O
,	O
boats	O
went	O
off	O
early	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
from	O
Macao	PNM
to	O
them	O
:	O
and	O
the	O
better	O
to	O
establish	O
the	O
belief	O
of	O
his	O
veracity	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
he	O
desired	O
no	O
money	O
if	O
his	O
information	O
should	O
not	O
prove	O
true	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
presently	O
believed	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
fore-mentioned	O
expedition	O
from	O
Manila	PNM
,	O
and	O
the	O
commodore	O
immediately	O
fitted	O
his	O
cannon	O
and	O
small	O
arms	O
in	O
the	O
best	O
manner	O
he	O
could	O
for	O
defence	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
then	O
his	O
pinnace	O
and	O
cutter	O
in	O
the	O

who	O
had	O
been	O
ordered	O
to	O
examine	O
a	O

vessel	O
which	O
was	O
getting	O
under	O

,	O
he	O
sent	O
them	O
the	O
advice	O
he	O
had	O
received	O
,	O
and	O
directed	O
them	O
to	O
look	O
out	O
strictly	O

Indeed	O
,	O
no	O
Spanish	O
ships	O
ever	O
appeared	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
soon	O
satisfied	O
the	O
whole	O
of	O
the	O
story	O
was	O
a	O
fiction	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
difficult	O
to	O
conceive	O
what	O
reason	O
could	O
induce	O
the	O
fellow	O
to	O
be	O
at	O
such	O
extraordinary	O
pains	O
to	O
impose	O
on	O
them	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O

when	O
they	O
had	O

the	O

had	O

her	O
for	O

and	O
before	O
this	O

the	O

grew	O
very	O
uneasy	O

extremely	O
desirous	O
that	O

this	O

the	O

was	O
as	O
eagerly	O

At	O

about	O
the	O

of	O

,	O
two	O

on	O

to	O

His	O

too	O
was	O
somewhat	O

for	O
he	O
had	O
entered	O
twenty-three	O

during	O

at	O
Macao	PNM

the	O

He	O
gave	O
out	O
at	O

that	O
he	O
was	O
bound	O
to	O
Batavia	PNM

and	O
thence	O
to	O

is	O
considered	O

by	O
the	O
confidence	O
he	O
had	O
expressed	O
in	O
the	O
strength	O
of	O
his	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
dexterity	O
of	O
his	O
hands	O

he	O
had	O
persuaded	O
not	O
only	O
his	O
own	O
crew	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
people	O
at	O
Macao	PNM
likewise	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
proposed	O
to	O
try	O
this	O
unusual	O
experiment	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
many	O
letters	O
sent	O
on	O
board	O
him	O
by	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
of	O
Canton	PNM
and	O
Macao	O
for	O
their	O
friends	O
at	O
Batavia	PNM
.	O

But	O
his	O
real	O
design	O
was	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
different	O
nature	O
:	O
for	O
he	O
supposed	O
that	O
instead	O
of	O
one	O
annual	O
ship	O
from	O
Acapulco	PNM
to	O
Manila	PNM
,	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
this	O

,	O
in	O
all	O
probability	O
,	O
two	O
,	O
since	O
,	O
by	O
being	O
before	O
Acapulco	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
prevented	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
from	O
putting	O
to	O
sea	O
the	O
preceding	O
season	O
.	O

He	O
therefore	O
,	O
not	O
discouraged	O
by	O
his	O
former	O
disasters	O
,	O
resolved	O
again	O
to	O
risque	O
the	O
casualties	O
of	O
the	O
Pacific	PNM
Ocean	PNM
,	O
and	O
to	O
cruise	O
for	O
these	O
returning	O
vessels	O
off	O
Cape	PNM
Espiritu	PNM
Santo	PNM
on	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Samal	PNM
,	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
first	O
land	O
they	O
always	O
make	O
at	O
the	O
Philippine	PNM

:	O
and	O
as	O
June	O
is	O
generally	O
the	O
month	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
arrive	O
there	O
,	O
he	O
doubted	O
not	O
but	O
he	O
should	O
get	O
to	O
his	O
intended	O
station	O
time	O
enough	O
to	O
intercept	O
them	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
true	O
they	O
were	O
said	O
to	O
be	O
stout	O
vessels	O
,	O
mounting	O
forty-four	O
guns	O
apiece	O
,	O
and	O
carrying	O
above	O
five	O
hundred	O

and	O
might	O
be	O
expected	O
to	O
return	O

he	O
himself	O
had	O

two	O

twenty-seven	O
hands	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
near	O
thirty	O
were	O
boys	O
.	O

But	O
this	O
disproportion	O
of	O
strength	O
did	O
not	O
deter	O
him	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
knew	O
his	O
ship	O
to	O
be	O
much	O
-LCB-	O

-RCB-	O
better	O
fitted	O
for	O
a	O
sea	O
engagement	O
than	O
theirs	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
expect	O
that	O
his	O
men	O
would	O
exert	O
themselves	O
after	O
a	O
most	O
extraordinary	O
manner	O
when	O
they	O
had	O
in	O
view	O
the	O
immense	O
wealth	O
of	O
these	O
Manila	PNM
galeons	O
.	O

This	O
project	O
the	O
commodore	O
had	O
resolved	O
on	O
in	O
his	O
own	O
thoughts	O
ever	O
since	O
his	O
leaving	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Mexico	PNM
,	O
and	O
the	O
greatest	O
mortification	O
which	O
he	O
received	O
from	O
the	O
various	O
delays	O
he	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
in	O
China	PNM
,	O
was	O
his	O
apprehension	O
lest	O
he	O
might	O
be	O
thereby	O
so	O
long	O
retarded	O
as	O
to	O
let	O
the	O
galeons	O
escape	O
him	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
at	O
Macao	PNM
it	O
was	O
incumbent	O
on	O
him	O
to	O
keep	O
these	O
views	O
extremely	O
secret	O
,	O
for	O
there	O
being	O
a	O
great	O
intercourse	O
and	O
a	O
mutual	O
connection	O
of	O
interests	O
between	O
that	O
port	O
and	O
Manila	PNM
,	O
he	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
fear	O
that	O
if	O
his	O
designs	O
were	O
discovered	O
,	O
intelligence	O
would	O
be	O
immediately	O
sent	O
to	O
Manila	PNM
,	O
and	O
measures	O
would	O
be	O
taken	O
to	O
prevent	O
the	O
galeons	O
from	O
falling	O
into	O
his	O
hands	O
.	O

But	O
being	O
now	O
at	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
entirely	O
clear	O
of	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
he	O
summoned	O
all	O
his	O
people	O
on	O
the	O
quarter-deck	O
and	O
informed	O
them	O
of	O
his	O
resolution	O
to	O
cruise	O
for	O
the	O
two	O
Manila	PNM
ships	O
,	O
of	O
whose	O
wealth	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
ignorant	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
them	O
he	O
should	O
chuse	O
a	O
station	O
where	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
fail	O
of	O
meeting	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
though	O
they	O
were	O
stout	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
full	O
manned	O
,	O
yet	O
,	O
if	O
his	O
own	O
people	O
behaved	O
with	O
their	O
accustomed	O
spirit	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
certain	O
he	O
should	O
prove	O
too	O
hard	O
for	O
them	O
both	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
at	O
least	O
could	O
not	O
fail	O
of	O
becoming	O
his	O
prize	O
.	O

He	O
further	O
added	O
that	O
many	O
ridiculous	O
tales	O
had	O
been	O
propagated	O
about	O
the	O
strength	O
of	O
the	O
sides	O
of	O
these	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
being	O
impenetrable	O
to	O
cannon	O
shot	O
;	O
that	O
these	O
fictions	O
had	O
been	O
principally	O
invented	O
to	O
palliate	O
the	O
cowardice	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
had	O
formerly	O
engaged	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
hoped	O
there	O
were	O
none	O
of	O
those	O
present	O
weak	O
enough	O
to	O
give	O
credit	O
to	O
so	O
absurd	O
a	O
story	O
.	O

For	O
his	O
own	O
part	O
,	O
he	O
did	O
assure	O
them	O
upon	O
his	O
word	O
that	O
,	O
whenever	O
he	O
fell	O
in	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
fight	O
them	O

This	O

they	O

the	O

disappointments	O
they	O
had	O

met	O

at	O

For	O
,	O
firmly	O
relying	O
on	O
the	O
assurances	O
of	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
certainly	O
meet	O
with	O
the	O
galeons	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
too	O
sanguine	O
to	O
doubt	O
a	O
moment	O
of	O
mastering	O
them	O

so	O
that	O
they	O
considered	O
themselves	O

this	O

was	O

spread	O
through	O

that	O
the	O

who	O
had	O
taken	O
some	O
Chinese	O
sheep	O
to	O

with	O
him	O
for	O
his	O

enquiring	O
one	O

of	O

why	O
he	O
had	O
lately	O
seen	O
no	O
mutton	O
at	O

and	O
asking	O
him	O
if	O
all	O
the	O
sheep	O
were	O
killed	O
,	O
the	O
fellow	O
very	O
seriously	O
replied	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
indeed	O
two	O
sheep	O
left	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
if	O
his	O
honour	O
would	O
give	O
him	O

equal	O

is	O
what	O
can	O
scarcely	O
be	O

as	O

that	O

should	O

should	O

by	O

them	O
rather	O
terrible	O

This	O
seems	O
so	O
obvious	O
and	O
natural	O
a	O
conclusion	O

that	O
a	O
person	O
unacquainted	O

suppose	O
the	O

it	O

All	O
this	O
interval	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O

kept	O
her	O
first	O
advantageous	O
position	O
,	O
firing	O
her	O
cannon	O
with	O
great	O
regularity	O
and	O
briskness	O
,	O
whilst	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
the	O
galeon	O

decks	O
lay	O
open	O
to	O
her	O
top-men	O

who	O
having	O
at	O
their	O
first	O
volley	O
driven	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
from	O
their	O
tops	O
,	O
made	O
prodigious	O
havock	O
with	O
their	O
small	O
arms	O

killing	O

wounding	O
every	O
officer	O
but	O
one	O
that	O
appeared	O
on	O

and	O
wounding	O
in	O

the	O
general	O
of	O
the	O
galeon	O
himself	O
.	O

Thus	O
the	O
action	O
proceeded	O
for	O
at	O
least	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
;	O
but	O
then	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
lost	O
the	O
superiority	O
arising	O
from	O
her	O
original	O
situation	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
close	O
alongside	O
the	O
galeon	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
enemy	O
continued	O
to	O
fire	O
briskly	O
for	O
near	O
an	O
hour	O
longer	O
;	O
yet	O
even	O
in	O
this	O
posture	O
the	O
commodore	O
's	O
grape-shot	O
swept	O
their	O
decks	O
so	O
effectually	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
their	O
slain	O
and	O
wounded	O
became	O
so	O
considerable	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
began	O
to	O
fall	O
into	O
great	O
disorder	O
,	O
especially	O
as	O
the	O
general	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
the	O
life	O
of	O
the	O
action	O
,	O
was	O
no	O
longer	O
capable	O
of	O
exerting	O
himself	O
.	O

Their	O
confusion	O
was	O
visible	O
from	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
ships	O
were	O
so	O
near	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
Spanish	O
officers	O
were	O
seen	O
running	O
about	O
with	O
much	O
assiduity	O
,	O
to	O
prevent	O
the	O
desertion	O
of	O
their	O
men	O
from	O
their	O
quarters	O
.	O

But	O
all	O
their	O
endeavours	O
were	O
in	O
vain	O
,	O
for	O
after	O
having	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
last	O
effort	O
,	O
fired	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
guns	O
with	O
more	O
judgment	O
than	O
usual	O
,	O
they	O
yielded	O
up	O
the	O
contest	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
the	O
galeon	O
's	O
colours	O
being	O
singed	O
off	O
the	O
ensign	O
staff	O
in	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
the	O
engagement	O
,	O
she	O
struck	O
the	O
standard	O
at	O
her	O
main	O

;	O
the	O
person	O
who	O
was	O
-LCB-	O

perform	O
this	O
office	O
having	O
been	O
in	O
imminent	O
peril	O
of	O

had	O
not	O
the	O

who	O

about	O
,	O
given	O

orders	O
to	O
his	O
people	O
to	O
desist	O
from	O

Thus	O
was	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
possessed	O
of	O
this	O
rich	O
prize	O
,	O
amounting	O
in	O
value	O
to	O
near	O
a	O
million	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
of	O

She	O
was	O
called	O
the	O
_	O
Nostra	PNM
Signora	PNM
de	PNM
Cabadonga	PNM
_	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
commanded	O
by	O
General	O
Don	O
Jeronimo	O
de	O
Mentero	O
,	O
a	O
Portuguese	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
the	O
most	O
approved	O
officer	O
for	O
skill	O
and	O
courage	O
of	O
any	O
employed	O
in	O
that	O
service	O
.	O

The	O
galeon	O
was	O
much	O
larger	O
than	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
five	O
hundred	O
and	O
fifty	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
thirty-six	O
guns	O
mounted	O
for	O
action	O

besides	O
twenty-eight	O
pedreroes	O
in	O
her	O
gunwale	O
,	O
quarters	O
,	O
and	O
tops	O
,	O
each	O
of	O
which	O
carried	O
a	O
four-pound	O
ball	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
very	O
well	O
furnished	O
with	O
small	O
arms	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
particularly	O
provided	O
against	O
boarding	O
,	O
both	O
by	O
her	O
close	O
quarters	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
a	O
strong	O
network	O
of	O
two-inch	O
rope	O
which	O
was	O
laced	O
over	O
her	O
waist	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
defended	O
by	O
half-pikes	O
.	O

She	O
had	O
sixty-seven	O
killed	O
in	O
the	O
action	O
,	O
and	O
eighty-four	O
wounded	O
,	O
whilst	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
had	O
only	O
two	O
killed	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
lieutenant	O
and	O
sixteen	O
wounded	O
,	O
all	O
of	O
whom	O
but	O
one	O
recovered	O
:	O
of	O
so	O
little	O
consequence	O
are	O
the	O
most	O
destructive	O
arms	O
in	O

and	O
unpractised	O
hands	O

The	O
treasure	O
thus	O
taken	O
by	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
having	O
been	O
,	O
for	O
at	O
least	O
eighteen	O
months	O
,	O
the	O
great	O
object	O
of	O
their	O

it	O
is	O

all	O
their	O
reiterated	O
disappointments	O
,	O
they	O
at	O

saw	O
their	O
wishes	O
accomplished	O

But	O
their	O
joy	O
was	O
near	O
being	O
suddenly	O
damped	O
by	O
a	O
most	O
tremendous	O
incident	O
,	O
for	O
no	O
sooner	O
had	O
the	O
galeon	O
struck	O
,	O
than	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
lieutenants	O
coming	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
to	O
congratulate	O
him	O
on	O
his	O
prize	O
,	O
whispered	O
him	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
that	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
was	O
dangerously	O
on	O
fire	O
near	O
the	O
powder-room	O

The	O
commodore	O
received	O
this	O
dreadful	O
news	O
without	O
any	O
apparent	O
emotion	O
,	O
and	O
taking	O
care	O
not	O
to	O
alarm	O
his	O
people	O
,	O
gave	O
the	O
necessary	O
orders	O
for	O
extinguishing	O
the	O
fire	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
happily	O
done	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
,	O
though	O
its	O
appearance	O
at	O
first	O
was	O
extremely	O
terrible	O
.	O

It	O
seems	O
some	O
cartridges	O
had	O
been	O
blown	O
up	O
by	O
accident	O
between	O
decks	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
blast	O
had	O
communicated	O
its	O
flame	O
to	O
a	O
quantity	O
of	O
oakum	O
in	O
the	O
after	O
hatchway	O
,	O
near	O
the	O
after	O
powder-room	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
great	O
smother	O
and	O
smoke	O
of	O
the	O
oakum	O
occasioned	O
the	O
apprehension	O
of	O
a	O
more	O
extended	O
and	O
mischievous	O
conflagration	O
.	O

All	O
hopes	O
too	O
of	O
avoiding	O
-LCB-	O
349	O
-RCB-	O
its	O
fury	O
by	O
escaping	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
prize	O
had	O
instantly	O
vanished	O
,	O
for	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
moment	O
the	O
galeon	O
fell	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
on	O
the	O
starboard	O
quarter	O
,	O
though	O
she	O
was	O
fortunately	O
cleared	O
without	O
doing	O
or	O
receiving	O
any	O
considerable	O
damage	O

The	O
commodore	O
appointed	O
the	O
Manila	PNM
vessel	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
post	O
ship	O
in	O
his	O
Majesty	O
's	O
service	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
the	O
command	O
of	O
her	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Saumarez	O
,	O
his	O
first	O
lieutenant	O
,	O
who	O
before	O
night	O
sent	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
all	O
the	O
Spanish	O
prisoners	O
,	O
except	O
such	O
as	O
were	O
thought	O
the	O
most	O
proper	O
to	O
be	O
retained	O
to	O
assist	O
in	O
navigating	O
the	O
galeon	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
the	O
commodore	O
learnt	O
from	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
prisoners	O
that	O
the	O
other	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
kept	O
in	O
the	O
port	O
of	O
Acapulco	PNM
the	O
preceding	O
year	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
returning	O
in	O
company	O
with	O
the	O
present	O
prize	O
,	O
as	O
was	O
expected	O
,	O
had	O
set	O
sail	O
from	O
Acapulco	PNM
alone	O
much	O
sooner	O
than	O
usual	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
,	O
in	O
all	O
probability	O
,	O
got	O
into	O
the	O
port	O
of	O
Manila	PNM
long	O
before	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
arrived	O
off	O
Cape	PNM
Espiritu	PNM
Santo	PNM
,	O
so	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
his	O
present	O
success	O
,	O
had	O
great	O
reason	O
to	O
regret	O
his	O
loss	O
of	O
time	O
at	O
Macao	PNM
,	O
which	O
prevented	O
him	O
from	O
taking	O
two	O
rich	O
prizes	O
instead	O
of	O
one	O
.	O

The	O
commodore	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
action	O
was	O
ended	O
,	O
resolved	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
his	O
way	O
with	O
his	O
prize	O
for	O
the	O
river	O
of	O
Canton	PNM
,	O
being	O
the	O
meantime	O
fully	O
employed	O
in	O
securing	O
his	O
prisoners	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
removing	O
the	O
treasure	O
from	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
galeon	O
into	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
.	O

The	O
last	O
of	O
these	O
operations	O
was	O
too	O
important	O
to	O
be	O
postponed	O
,	O
for	O
as	O
the	O
navigation	O
to	O
Canton	PNM
was	O
thro	O
'	O
seas	O
but	O
little	O
known	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
season	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
,	O
very	O
tempestuous	O
weather	O
might	O
be	O
expected	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
of	O
great	O
consequence	O
that	O
the	O
treasure	O
should	O
be	O
sent	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
,	O
which	O
ship	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
presence	O
of	O
the	O
commander-in-chief	O
,	O
the	O
larger	O
number	O
of	O
her	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
her	O
other	O
advantages	O
,	O
was	O
doubtless	O
better	O
provided	O
against	O
all	O
the	O
casualties	O
of	O
winds	O
and	O
seas	O
than	O
the	O
galeon	O
.	O

And	O
the	O
securing	O
the	O
prisoners	O
was	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
still	O
more	O
consequence	O
,	O
as	O
not	O
only	O
the	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
treasure	O
but	O
the	O
lives	O
of	O
the	O
captors	O
depended	O
thereon	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
indeed	O
an	O
article	O
which	O
gave	O
the	O
commodore	O
much	O
trouble	O
and	O
disquietude	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
above	O
double	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
people	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
brought	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
observed	O
how	O
slenderly	O
she	O
was	O
manned	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
large	O
proportion	O
which	O
the	O
striplings	O
bore	O
to	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
could	O
not	O
help	O
expressing	O
themselves	O
with	O
great	O
indignation	O
to	O
be	O
thus	O
beaten	O
by	O
a	O
handful	O
of	O
boys	O

The	O
method	O
which	O
was	O
taken	O
-LCB-	O
350	O
-RCB-	O
to	O
hinder	O
them	O
from	O
rising	O
was	O
by	O
placing	O
all	O
but	O
the	O
officers	O
and	O
the	O
wounded	O
in	O
the	O
hold	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
as	O
much	O
air	O
as	O
possible	O
,	O
two	O
hatchways	O
were	O
left	O
open	O
;	O
but	O
then	O
-LRB-	O
to	O
avoid	O
any	O
danger	O
that	O
might	O
happen	O
whilst	O
the	O

should	O
be	O

upon	O

was	O
a	O
square	O

of	O
thick	O
planks	O

made	O
in	O
the	O

of	O
a	O

four	O

Mr.	O
Anson	O
informed	O
the	O
officer	O
that	O
his	O
own	O
ship	O
was	O
a	O
man-of-war	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
King	O
of	O
Great	PNM
Britain	PNM
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
other	O
in	O
company	O
with	O
him	O
was	O
a	O
prize	O
he	O
had	O
taken	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
going	O
into	O
Canton	O
river	O
to	O
shelter	O
himself	O
against	O
the	O
hurricanes	O
which	O
were	O
then	O
approaching	O

and	O
that	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
monsoon	O
shifted	O
he	O
should	O
set	O
sail	O
for	O
England	PNM

The	O
officer	O
then	O
desired	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
what	O
men	O

guns	O
,	O
and	O
ammunition	O
were	O
on	O

a	O
list	O

he	O
said	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
sent	O
to	O
the	O
government	O
of	O
Canton	PNM

But	O
when	O
these	O
articles	O
were	O
repeated	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
particularly	O
upon	O
his	O
being	O
told	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
in	O
the	O

four	O

firelocks	O
,	O
and	O
between	O
three	O

four	O

he	O
shrugged	O
up	O
his	O
shoulders	O
and	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
terrified	O
with	O
the	O
bare	O
recital	O
,	O
saying	O
that	O
no	O
ships	O
ever	O
came	O
into	O
Canton	O
river	O
armed	O
in	O
that	O
manner	O
;	O
adding	O
that	O
he	O
durst	O
not	O
set	O
down	O
the	O
whole	O

this	O
force	O
,	O
lest	O
it	O
should	O
too	O

After	O
he	O
had	O
finished	O
his	O
enquiries	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
preparing	O
to	O
depart	O
,	O
he	O
desired	O
to	O
leave	O
two	O
custom-house	O
officers	O
behind	O
him	O
,	O
on	O
which	O
the	O
commodore	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
though	O
as	O
a	O
man-of-war	O
he	O
was	O
prohibited	O
from	O

had	O
nothing	O
to	O

with	O

of	O
any	O
kind	O
,	O
yet	O
for	O
the	O
satisfaction	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
permit	O
two	O
of	O
their	O
people	O
to	O
be	O
left	O
on	O

who	O
might	O

how	O

The	O
officer	O
seemed	O
amazed	O
when	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
mentioned	O
being	O
exempted	O
from	O
all	O
duties	O
,	O
and	O
answered	O
that	O
the	O

must	O
be	O
paid	O
by	O
every	O

that	O

it	O
is	O
supposed	O
that	O

private	O
directions	O
were	O
given	O
by	O
him	O
to	O
the	O

not	O
to	O

the	O

an	O
enemy	O
from	O
forcing	O
his	O
way	O
through	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
is	O
obvious	O
from	O
the	O
description	O
of	O
these	O
forts	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
have	O
given	O
no	O
obstruction	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
's	O
passage	O
,	O
even	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
well	O
supplied	O
with	O
gunners	O
and	O
stores	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
pilot	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
Chinese	O
officer	O
had	O
been	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
refused	O
at	O
first	O
to	O
take	O
charge	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
till	O
he	O
had	O
leave	O
from	O
the	O
forts	O
,	O
yet	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
necessary	O
to	O
get	O
through	O
without	O
any	O
delay	O
,	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
the	O
bad	O
weather	O
which	O
was	O
hourly	O
expected	O
,	O
the	O
commodore	O
weighed	O
on	O
the	O
15th	O
,	O
and	O
ordered	O
the	O
pilot	O
to	O
carry	O
him	O
by	O
the	O
forts	O
,	O
threatening	O
him	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
ship	O
ran	O
aground	O
he	O
would	O
instantly	O
hang	O
him	O
up	O
at	O
the	O
yard-arm	O
.	O

The	O
pilot	O
,	O
awed	O
by	O
these	O
threats	O
,	O
carried	O
the	O
ship	O
through	O
safely	O
,	O
the	O
forts	O
not	O
attempting	O
to	O
dispute	O
the	O
passage	O
.	O

Indeed	O
the	O
poor	O
pilot	O
did	O
not	O
escape	O
the	O
resentment	O
of	O
his	O
countrymen	O
,	O
for	O
when	O
he	O
came	O
on	O
shore	O
he	O
was	O
seized	O
and	O
sent	O
to	O
prison	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
rigorously	O
disciplined	O
with	O
the	O
bamboo	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
he	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
get	O
at	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
afterwards	O
,	O
to	O
desire	O
of	O
him	O
some	O
recompence	O
for	O
the	O
chastisement	O
he	O
had	O
-LCB-	O
355	O
-RCB-	O
undergone	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
which	O
he	O
then	O
carried	O
very	O
significant	O
marks	O
about	O
him	O
;	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
in	O
commiseration	O
of	O
his	O
sufferings	O
,	O
gave	O
him	O
such	O
a	O
sum	O
of	O
money	O
as	O
would	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
have	O
enticed	O
a	O

undergone	O
a	O
dozen	O

Nor	O
was	O
the	O
pilot	O
the	O
only	O
person	O
that	O
suffered	O
on	O
this	O
occasion	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
commodore	O
soon	O
after	O
seeing	O
some	O
royal	O
junks	O
pass	O
by	O
him	O
from	O
Bocca	PNM
Tigris	PNM
towards	O
Canton	O
,	O
he	O
learnt	O
,	O
on	O
enquiry	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
mandarine	O
commanding	O
the	O
forts	O
was	O
a	O
prisoner	O
on	O
board	O
them	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
already	O
turned	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
now	O
carrying	O
to	O
Canton	PNM
,	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
expected	O
he	O
would	O
be	O
severely	O
punished	O
for	O
having	O
permitted	O
the	O
ships	O
to	O
pass	O
.	O

Upon	O
the	O
commodore	O
's	O
urging	O
the	O
unreasonableness	O
of	O
this	O
procedure	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
inability	O
of	O
the	O
forts	O
to	O
have	O
done	O
otherwise	O
,	O
and	O
explaining	O
to	O
the	O
Chinese	O
the	O
great	O
superiority	O
his	O
ships	O
would	O
have	O
had	O
over	O
the	O
forts	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
number	O
and	O
size	O
of	O
their	O
guns	O
,	O
the	O
Chinese	O
seemed	O
to	O
acquiesce	O
in	O
his	O
reasoning	O
,	O
and	O
allowed	O
that	O
their	O
forts	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
stopped	O
him	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
still	O
asserted	O
that	O
the	O
mandarine	O
would	O
infallibly	O
suffer	O
for	O
not	O
having	O
done	O
what	O
all	O
his	O
judges	O
were	O
convinced	O
was	O
impossible	O
.	O

To	O
such	O
indefensible	O
absurdities	O
are	O
those	O
obliged	O
to	O
submit	O
who	O
think	O
themselves	O
concerned	O
to	O

their	O
authority	O
when	O

But	O
to	O
return	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
16th	O
of	O
July	O
the	O
commodore	O
sent	O
his	O
second	O
lieutenant	O
to	O
Canton	PNM
with	O
a	O
letter	O
for	O
the	O
viceroy	O
,	O
informing	O
him	O
of	O
the	O
reason	O
of	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
's	O
_	O
putting	O
into	O
that	O
port	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
commodore	O
himself	O
soon	O
proposed	O
to	O
repair	O
to	O
Canton	PNM
to	O
pay	O
a	O
visit	O
to	O
his	O
excellency	O
.	O

The	O
lieutenant	O
was	O
very	O
civilly	O
received	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
promised	O
that	O
an	O
answer	O
should	O
be	O
sent	O
to	O
the	O
commodore	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
meantime	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
gave	O
leave	O
to	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
officers	O
of	O
the	O
galeon	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Canton	PNM
,	O
they	O
engaging	O
their	O
parole	O
to	O
return	O
in	O
two	O
days	O
.	O

When	O
these	O
prisoners	O
got	O
to	O
Canton	PNM
,	O
the	O
regency	O
sent	O
for	O
them	O
and	O
examined	O
them	O
,	O
enquiring	O
particularly	O
by	O
what	O
means	O
they	O
came	O
into	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
's	O
power	O
.	O

It	O
luckily	O
happened	O
that	O
on	O
this	O
occasion	O
the	O
prisoners	O
were	O
honest	O
enough	O
to	O
declare	O
that	O
as	O
the	O
kings	O
of	O
Great	PNM
Britain	PNM
and	O
of	O
Spain	PNM
were	O
at	O
war	O
they	O
had	O
proposed	O
to	O
themselves	O
the	O
taking	O
of	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
bore	O
down	O
upon	O
her	O
with	O
that	O
view	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
event	O
had	O
been	O
contrary	O
to	O
their	O
hopes	O
.	O

And	O
being	O
questioned	O
as	O
to	O
their	O
-LCB-	O
356	O
-RCB-	O
usage	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
they	O
frankly	O
acknowledged	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
treated	O
by	O
the	O
commodore	O
much	O
better	O
than	O
they	O
believed	O
they	O
should	O
have	O
treated	O
him	O
,	O
had	O
he	O
fallen	O
into	O
their	O
hands	O
.	O

This	O
confession	O
from	O
an	O
enemy	O
had	O
great	O
weight	O
with	O
the	O
Chinese	O
,	O
who	O
till	O
then	O
,	O
tho	O
'	O
they	O
had	O
revered	O
the	O
commodore	O
's	O
military	O
force	O
,	O
had	O
yet	O
suspected	O
his	O
morals	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
considered	O
him	O
rather	O
as	O
a	O
lawless	O
free-booter	O
than	O
as	O
one	O
commissioned	O
by	O
the	O
state	O
for	O
the	O
revenge	O
of	O
public	O
injuries	O
.	O

But	O
they	O
now	O
changed	O
their	O
opinions	O
,	O
and	O
regarded	O
him	O
as	O
a	O
more	O
important	O
person	O
;	O
to	O
which	O
perhaps	O
the	O
vast	O
treasure	O
of	O
his	O
prize	O
might	O
not	O
a	O
little	O
contribute	O
;	O
the	O
acquisition	O
of	O
wealth	O
being	O
a	O
matter	O
greatly	O
adapted	O
to	O
the	O
esteem	O
and	O
reverence	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
nation	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
examination	O
of	O
the	O
Spanish	O
prisoners	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
Chinese	O
had	O
no	O
reason	O
in	O
the	O
main	O
to	O
doubt	O
of	O
the	O
account	O
which	O
was	O
given	O
them	O
,	O
yet	O
there	O
were	O
two	O
circumstances	O
which	O
appeared	O
to	O
them	O
so	O
singular	O
as	O
to	O
deserve	O
a	O
more	O
ample	O
explanation	O
;	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
the	O
great	O
disproportion	O
of	O
men	O
between	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
and	O
the	O
galeon	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
was	O
the	O
humanity	O
with	O
which	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
the	O
galeon	O
were	O
treated	O
after	O
they	O
were	O
taken	O
.	O

The	O
mandarines	O
therefore	O
asked	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
how	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
be	O
overpowered	O
by	O
so	O
inferior	O
a	O
force	O
?	O

and	O
how	O
it	O
happened	O
,	O
since	O
the	O
two	O
nations	O
were	O
at	O
war	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
put	O
to	O
death	O
when	O
they	O
fell	O
into	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
the	O
English	O
?	O

To	O
the	O
first	O
of	O
these	O
enquiries	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
answered	O
that	O
though	O
they	O
had	O
more	O
men	O
than	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
,	O
yet	O
she	O
being	O
intended	O
solely	O
for	O
war	O
,	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
superiority	O
in	O
the	O
size	O
of	O
her	O
guns	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
many	O
other	O
articles	O
,	O
over	O
the	O
galeon	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
vessel	O
fitted	O
out	O
principally	O
for	O
traffic	O
:	O
and	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
second	O
question	O
,	O
they	O
told	O
the	O
Chinese	O
that	O
amongst	O
the	O
nations	O
of	O
Europe	PNM
it	O
was	O
not	O
customary	O
to	O
put	O
to	O
death	O
those	O
who	O
submitted	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
readily	O
owned	O
that	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
natural	O
bias	O
of	O
his	O
temper	O
,	O
had	O
treated	O
both	O
them	O
and	O
their	O
countrymen	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
formerly	O
been	O
in	O
his	O
power	O
,	O
with	O
very	O
unusual	O
courtesy	O
,	O
much	O
beyond	O
what	O
they	O
could	O
have	O
expected	O
or	O
than	O
was	O
required	O
by	O
the	O
customs	O
established	O
between	O
nations	O
at	O
war	O
with	O
each	O
other	O
.	O

These	O
replies	O
fully	O
satisfied	O
the	O
Chinese	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
wrought	O
very	O
powerfully	O
in	O
the	O
commodore	O
's	O
favour	O

On	O
the	O
20th	O
of	O
July	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
three	O
mandarines	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
boats	O
and	O
a	O
vast	O
retinue	O
,	O
came	O
on	O
-LCB-	O
357	O
-RCB-	O
board	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
and	O
delivered	O
to	O
the	O
commodore	O
the	O
Viceroy	O
of	O
Canton	O
's	O
order	O
for	O
a	O
daily	O
supply	O
of	O

and	O
for	O

to	O
carry	O
the	O
ships	O
up	O
the	O
river	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
second	O
bar	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
they	O
delivered	O
him	O
a	O
message	O
from	O
the	O
viceroy	O
in	O
answer	O
to	O
the	O
letter	O
sent	O
to	O
Canton	PNM
.	O

The	O
substance	O
of	O
the	O
message	O
was	O
that	O
the	O
viceroy	O
desired	O
to	O
be	O
excused	O
from	O
receiving	O
the	O
commodore	O
's	O
visit	O
during	O
the	O
then	O
excessive	O
hot	O
weather	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
assembling	O
the	O
mandarines	O
and	O
soldiers	O
necessary	O
to	O
that	O
ceremony	O
would	O
prove	O
extremely	O
inconvenient	O
and	O
fatiguing	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
in	O
September	O
when	O
the	O
weather	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
temperate	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
glad	O
to	O
see	O
both	O
the	O
commodore	O
himself	O
and	O
the	O
English	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
ship	O
that	O
was	O
with	O
him	O

As	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
knew	O
that	O
an	O
express	O
had	O
been	O
dispatched	O
to	O
the	O
court	O
at	O
Pekin	PNM
with	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
and	O
her	O
prize	O
being	O
arrived	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
of	O
Canton	PNM
,	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
doubt	O
but	O
the	O
principal	O
motive	O
for	O
putting	O
off	O
this	O
visit	O
was	O
that	O
the	O
regency	O
at	O
Canton	PNM
might	O
gain	O
time	O
to	O
receive	O
the	O
emperor	O
's	O
instructions	O
about	O
their	O
behaviour	O
on	O
this	O
unusual	O
affair	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
mandarines	O
had	O
delivered	O
their	O
message	O
they	O
began	O
to	O
talk	O
to	O
the	O
commodore	O
about	O
the	O
duties	O
to	O
be	O
paid	O
by	O
his	O
ships	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
immediately	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
never	O
submit	O
to	O
any	O
demand	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
;	O
that	O
as	O
he	O
neither	O
brought	O
any	O
merchandize	O
thither	O
,	O
nor	O
intended	O
to	O
carry	O
any	O
away	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
reasonably	O
deemed	O
within	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
the	O
emperor	O
's	O
orders	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
doubtless	O
calculated	O
for	O
trading	O
vessels	O
only	O
,	O
adding	O
that	O
no	O
duties	O
were	O
ever	O
demanded	O
of	O
men-of-war	O
by	O
nations	O
accustomed	O
to	O
their	O
reception	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
his	O
master	O
's	O
orders	O
expressly	O
forbade	O
him	O
from	O
paying	O
any	O
acknowledgment	O
for	O
his	O
ships	O
anchoring	O
in	O
any	O
port	O
whatever	O
.	O

The	O
mandarines	O
being	O
thus	O
cut	O
short	O
on	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
the	O
duty	O
,	O
they	O
said	O
they	O
had	O
another	O
matter	O
to	O
mention	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
remaining	O
one	O
they	O
had	O
in	O
charge	O
;	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
request	O
to	O
the	O
commodore	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
release	O
the	O
prisoners	O
he	O
had	O
taken	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
galeon	O
;	O
for	O
that	O
the	O
Viceroy	O
of	O
Canton	PNM
apprehended	O
the	O
emperor	O
,	O
his	O
master	O
,	O
might	O
be	O
displeased	O
if	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
informed	O
that	O
persons	O

who	O
were	O
his	O
allies	O

on	O
a	O

Mr.	O

no	O
difficulty	O
in	O
purchasing	O
provisions	O

yet	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
that	O
the	O

could	O
proceed	O
to	O
England	PNM
without	O
laying	O
in	O
a	O

quantity	O
both	O
of	O
provisions	O
and	O

stores	O
for	O
his	O
use	O
during	O
the	O
voyage	O

The	O
procuring	O
this	O
supply	O
was	O
attended	O
with	O
much	O
perplexity	O
;	O
for	O
there	O
were	O
people	O
at	O
Canton	PNM
who	O
had	O
undertaken	O
to	O
furnish	O
him	O
with	O
biscuit	O
and	O
whatever	O
else	O
he	O
wanted	O
;	O
and	O
his	O
linguist	O
,	O
towards	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
September	O
,	O
had	O
assured	O
him	O
from	O
day	O

that	O
all	O
was	O
ready	O
and	O
would	O
be	O
sent	O
on	O

immediately	O

But	O
a	O
fortnight	O
being	O
elapsed	O
,	O
and	O
nothing	O
brought	O
,	O
the	O
commodore	O
sent	O
to	O
Canton	PNM
to	O
enquire	O
more	O
particularly	O
into	O
the	O
reasons	O
of	O
this	O
disappointment	O
:	O
and	O
he	O
had	O
soon	O
the	O
vexation	O
to	O
be	O
informed	O
that	O
the	O
whole	O
was	O
an	O
illusion	O
;	O
that	O
no	O
order	O
had	O
been	O
procured	O
from	O
the	O
viceroy	O
to	O
furnish	O
him	O
with	O
his	O

stores	O

as	O
had	O
been	O
pretended	O
;	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O

nor	O
any	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
articles	O
in	O

which	O
had	O

had	O
taken	O
the	O
least	O
step	O
to	O
comply	O
with	O
their	O
agreement	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
most	O
disagreeable	O
news	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
it	O
suspected	O
that	O
the	O
furnishing	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
for	O
her	O
return	O
to	O
Great	PNM
Britain	PNM
might	O
prove	O
a	O
more	O
troublesome	O
matter	O
than	O
had	O
been	O
hitherto	O
imagined	O
;	O
especially	O
too	O
as	O
the	O
month	O
of	O
September	O
-LCB-	O
359	O
-RCB-	O
was	O
nearly	O
ended	O
without	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
's	O
having	O
received	O
any	O
message	O
from	O
the	O
Viceroy	O
of	O
Canton	PNM
.	O

And	O
here	O
perhaps	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
expected	O
that	O
a	O
satisfactory	O
account	O
should	O
be	O
given	O
of	O
the	O
motives	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
for	O
this	O
faithless	O
procedure	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
already	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
former	O
chapter	O
,	O
made	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
conjectures	O
about	O
a	O
similar	O
event	O
,	O
I	O
shall	O
not	O
repeat	O
them	O
again	O
in	O
this	O
place	O
;	O
but	O
shall	O
content	O
myself	O
with	O
observing	O
that	O
after	O
all	O
it	O
may	O
perhaps	O
be	O
impossible	O
for	O
an	O
European	O
,	O
ignorant	O
of	O
the	O
customs	O
and	O
manners	O
of	O
that	O
nation	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
fully	O
apprized	O
of	O
the	O
real	O
incitements	O
to	O
this	O
behaviour	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
thus	O
much	O
may	O
undoubtedly	O
be	O
asserted	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
artifice	O
,	O
falsehood	O
,	O
and	O
an	O
attachment	O
to	O
all	O
kinds	O
of	O
lucre	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
are	O
difficult	O
to	O
be	O
paralleled	O
by	O
any	O
other	O
people	O
.	O

But	O
then	O
the	O
particular	O
application	O
of	O
these	O
talents	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
manner	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
operate	O
on	O
every	O
emergency	O
,	O
are	O
often	O
beyond	O
the	O
reach	O
of	O
a	O
foreigner	O
's	O
penetration	O
:	O
so	O
that	O
though	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
surely	O
concluded	O
that	O
the	O
Chinese	O
had	O
some	O
interest	O
in	O
thus	O
amusing	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
easy	O
to	O
assign	O
the	O
individual	O
views	O
by	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
influenced	O
.	O

And	O
that	O
I	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
thought	O
too	O
severe	O
in	O
ascribing	O
to	O
this	O
nation	O
a	O
fraudulent	O
and	O
selfish	O
turn	O
of	O
temper	O
,	O
so	O
contradictory	O
to	O
the	O
character	O
given	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
legendary	O
accounts	O
of	O
the	O
Romish	O
missionaries	O
,	O
I	O
shall	O
here	O
mention	O
an	O
extraordinary	O
transaction	O
or	O
two	O
which	O
I	O
conceive	O
will	O
be	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
confirmation	O
of	O
what	O
I	O
have	O
advanced	O

When	O
the	O
commodore	O
lay	O
first	O
at	O
Macao	PNM
,	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
officers	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
extremely	O
ill	O
,	O
desired	O
leave	O
of	O
him	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
every	O
day	O
on	O
a	O
neighbouring	O
island	O
,	O
imagining	O
that	O
a	O
walk	O
upon	O
the	O
land	O
would	O
contribute	O
greatly	O
to	O
the	O
restoring	O
of	O
his	O
health	O

The	O
commodore	O
would	O
have	O
dissuaded	O
him	O
from	O
it	O
,	O
suspecting	O
the	O
tricks	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
officer	O
continued	O
importunate	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
end	O
the	O
boat	O
was	O
ordered	O
to	O
carry	O
him	O
thither	O

The	O
first	O
day	O
he	O
was	O
put	O
on	O
shore	O
he	O
took	O
his	O
exercise	O
and	O
returned	O
without	O
receiving	O
any	O
molestation	O
or	O
even	O
seeing	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
second	O
day	O
he	O
was	O
assaulted	O
just	O
after	O
his	O
arrival	O
by	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
Chinese	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
hoeing	O
rice	O
in	O
the	O
neighbourhood	O

and	O
who	O
beat	O
him	O
so	O
violently	O
with	O
the	O
handles	O
of	O
their	O
hoes	O
that	O
they	O
soon	O
laid	O
him	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
incapable	O
of	O
resistance	O
;	O
after	O
which	O
they	O
robbed	O
him	O
,	O
taking	O
from	O
him	O
his	O
sword	O
,	O
the	O
hilt	O
of	O
which	O
was	O

no	O

any	O
relief	O
;	O
till	O
at	O
last	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
flew	O
on	O
the	O
fellow	O
who	O
had	O
the	O

in	O
his	O
possession	O

and	O
wresting	O
it	O
out	O
of	O

drew	O

with	O
it	O
was	O
preparing	O
to	O
fall	O
on	O
the	O
Chinese	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
whom	O
he	O
could	O
not	O

failed	O
of	O

But	O
the	O
officer	O

perceiving	O
what	O
he	O
was	O
about	O
,	O
immediately	O
ordered	O
him	O
to	O
desist	O

thinking	O
it	O
more	O
prudent	O
to	O
submit	O
to	O
the	O
present	O
violence	O
than	O
to	O
embroil	O
his	O
commander	O
in	O
an	O
inextricable	O
squabble	O
with	O
the	O
Chinese	O
Government	O
by	O
the	O
death	O
of	O
their	O
subjects	O
:	O
which	O
calmness	O
in	O
this	O
gentleman	O
was	O
the	O
more	O
meritorious	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
known	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
person	O
of	O
an	O
uncommon	O
spirit	O
and	O
of	O
a	O
somewhat	O
hasty	O
temper	O

By	O
this	O
means	O
the	O
Chinese	O
speedily	O
recovered	O
the	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
sword	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
perceived	O
it	O
was	O
prohibited	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
use	O
of	O
against	O
them	O

and	O
carried	O
off	O
their	O
whole	O
booty	O
unmolested	O

No	O

were	O
they	O
gone	O
than	O
a	O
Chinese	O
on	O
horseback	O

very	O
well	O
dressed	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
had	O
the	O
air	O
and	O
appearance	O
of	O
a	O
gentleman	O
,	O
came	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
seaside	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
could	O
be	O
understood	O
by	O
his	O
signs	O
,	O
seemed	O
to	O
censure	O
the	O
conduct	O
of	O
his	O
countrymen	O
and	O
to	O
commiserate	O
the	O
officer	O

being	O
wonderfully	O
officious	O
to	O
assist	O
in	O
getting	O
him	O
on	O

the	O
boat	O
:	O
but	O
notwithstanding	O
this	O
behaviour	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
shrewdly	O
suspected	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
an	O
accomplice	O
in	O
the	O
theft	O
,	O
and	O
time	O
fully	O
made	O
out	O
the	O
justice	O
of	O
those	O
suspicions	O

When	O
the	O
boat	O
returned	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
officer	O
reported	O
what	O
had	O
passed	O
to	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
he	O
immediately	O
complained	O
of	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
mandarine	O
who	O
attended	O
to	O
see	O
his	O
ship	O
supplied	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
mandarine	O
coolly	O
observed	O
that	O
the	O
boat	O
ought	O
not	O
to	O
have	O
gone	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
promising	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
thieves	O
could	O
be	O
found	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
punished	O
:	O
though	O
it	O
appeared	O
plain	O
enough	O
by	O
his	O
manner	O
of	O

that	O
he	O
would	O
never	O

himself	O
any	O

a	O
considerable	O

,	O
the	O
person	O
who	O
had	O

from	O
the	O

came	O
with	O
eagerness	O
to	O
the	O
commodore	O
to	O
assure	O
him	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
principal	O
thieves	O
was	O
then	O
in	O
a	O

the	O

viewing	O
the	O

well	O
remembering	O
his	O
-LCB-	O

orders	O
were	O
immediately	O
given	O
to	O
seize	O
him	O

accordingly	O
secured	O
on	O

the	O

where	O
strange	O

This	O
thief	O
on	O
his	O

apprehended	O

so	O
much	O

in	O
his	O

that	O
it	O

on	O
the	O

the	O

visibly	O
no	O

share	O

Indeed	O
he	O
had	O
reason	O
enough	O
to	O

since	O
it	O
was	O
soon	O
apparent	O
that	O
he	O

to	O
the	O
whole	O

for	O
the	O

that	O

up	O
the	O

would	O
himself	O
order	O
him	O
to	O

the	O
mandarine	O

put	O

with	O
which	O

him	O

But	O
the	O

there	O

accordingly	O
Mr.	O

gave	O
a	O

to	O
his	O

to	O

fully	O

Mr.	O

thence	O
on	O
a	O

made	O
a	O
digression	O
to	O
the	O

which	O
had	O
been	O

and	O
asked	O
Mr.	O

if	O

Mr.	O

presently	O
perceived	O
the	O

These	O
necessary	O
steps	O
being	O
taken	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
not	O
unknown	O
to	O
the	O
Chinese	O
,	O
it	O
should	O
seem	O
as	O
if	O
their	O
deliberations	O
were	O
in	O
some	O
sort	O
perplexed	O
thereby	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
reasonable	O
to	O
imagine	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
general	O
very	O
desirous	O
of	O
getting	O
the	O
duties	O
to	O
be	O
paid	O
them	O
;	O
not	O
perhaps	O
solely	O
in	O
consideration	O
of	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
those	O
dues	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
keep	O
up	O
their	O
reputation	O
for	O
address	O
and	O
subtlety	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
avoid	O
the	O
imputation	O
of	O
receding	O
from	O
claims	O
on	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
already	O
so	O
frequently	O
insisted	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
now	O
foresaw	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
other	O
method	O
of	O
succeeding	O
than	O
by	O
violence	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
even	O
against	O
this	O
the	O
commodore	O
was	O
prepared	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
at	O
last	O
disposed	O
,	O
I	O
conceive	O
,	O
to	O
let	O
the	O
affair	O
drop	O
rather	O
than	O
entangle	O
themselves	O
in	O
an	O
hostile	O
measure	O
which	O
they	O
found	O
would	O
only	O
expose	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
risque	O
of	O
having	O
the	O
whole	O
navigation	O
of	O
their	O
port	O
destroyed	O
without	O
any	O
certain	O
prospect	O
of	O
gaining	O
their	O
favourite	O
point	O
.	O

But	O
though	O
there	O
is	O
reason	O
to	O
conclude	O
that	O
these	O
were	O
their	O
thoughts	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
yet	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
depart	O
at	O
once	O
from	O
the	O
evasive	O
conduct	O
to	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
hitherto	O
adhered	O
.	O

Since	O
when	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
morning	O
of	O
the	O
1st	O
of	O
October	O
,	O
was	O
preparing	O
to	O
set	O
out	O
for	O
Canton	PNM
,	O
his	O
linguist	O
came	O
to	O
him	O
from	O
the	O
mandarine	O
who	O
attended	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
to	O
tell	O
him	O
that	O
a	O
letter	O
had	O
been	O
received	O
from	O
the	O
Viceroy	O
of	O
Canton	PNM
,	O
desiring	O
the	O
commodore	O
to	O
put	O
off	O
his	O
going	O
thither	O
for	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
.	O

The	O
reality	O
of	O
this	O
message	O
was	O
not	O
then	O
questioned	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
day	O
,	O
another	O
linguist	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
who	O
with	O
much	O
seeming	O
fright	O
told	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
that	O
the	O
viceroy	O
had	O
expected	O
him	O
up	O
that	O
day	O
;	O
that	O
the	O
council	O
was	O
assembled	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
troops	O
had	O
been	O
under	O
arms	O
to	O
receive	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
viceroy	O
was	O
highly	O
offended	O
at	O
the	O
disappointment	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
sent	O
the	O
commodore	O
's	O
linguist	O
to	O
prison	O
,	O
chained	O
,	O
supposing	O
that	O
the	O
whole	O
had	O
been	O
owing	O
to	O
the	O
linguist	O
's	O
negligence	O
.	O

This	O
plausible	O
tale	O
gave	O
the	O
commodore	O
great	O
concern	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
him	O
apprehend	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
some	O
-LCB-	O

-RCB-	O
treachery	O
designed	O
him	O
which	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
yet	O
fathom	O
.	O

And	O
though	O
it	O
afterwards	O
appeared	O
that	O
the	O
whole	O
was	O
a	O
fiction	O
,	O
not	O
one	O
article	O
of	O
it	O
having	O
the	O
least	O
foundation	O
,	O
yet	O
for	O
reasons	O
best	O
known	O
to	O
themselves	O
this	O
falshood	O
was	O
so	O
well	O
supported	O
by	O
the	O
artifices	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
merchants	O
at	O
Canton	PNM
,	O
that	O
three	O
days	O
afterwards	O
the	O
commodore	O
received	O
a	O
letter	O
signed	O
by	O
all	O
the	O
supercargoes	O
of	O
the	O
English	O
ships	O
then	O
at	O
that	O
place	O
,	O
expressing	O
their	O
great	O
uneasiness	O
about	O
what	O
had	O
happened	O
,	O
and	O
intimating	O
their	O
fears	O
that	O
some	O
insult	O
would	O
be	O
offered	O
to	O
his	O
boat	O
if	O
he	O
came	O
thither	O
before	O
the	O
viceroy	O
was	O
fully	O
satisfied	O
of	O
the	O
mistake	O
.	O

To	O
this	O
letter	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
replied	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
believe	O
there	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
mistake	O
;	O
but	O
was	O
persuaded	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
forgery	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
to	O
prevent	O
his	O
visiting	O
the	O
viceroy	O
;	O
that	O
therefore	O
he	O
would	O
certainly	O
come	O
up	O
to	O
Canton	PNM
on	O
the	O
13th	O
of	O
October	O
,	O
confident	O
that	O
the	O

would	O
not	O
dare	O
to	O
offer	O
him	O
any	O
insult	O
,	O
as	O
well	O

should	O
want	O
neither	O

THE	O

When	O
the	O
commodore	O
arrived	O
at	O
Canton	PNM
,	O
he	O
was	O
visited	O
by	O
the	O
principal	O
Chinese	O
merchants	O
,	O
who	O
affected	O
to	O
appear	O
very	O
much	O
pleased	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
no	O
obstruction	O
in	O
getting	O
thither	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
thence	O
pretended	O
to	O
conclude	O
that	O
the	O
viceroy	O
was	O
satisfied	O
about	O
the	O
former	O
mistake	O
,	O
the	O
reality	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
still	O
insisted	O
on	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
conversation	O
which	O
passed	O
upon	O
this	O
occasion	O
,	O
they	O
took	O
care	O
to	O
insinuate	O
that	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
viceroy	O
should	O
be	O
informed	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
was	O
at	O
Canton	PNM
,	O
which	O
they	O
promised	O
should	O
be	O
done	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
persuaded	O
a	O
time	O
would	O
be	O
immediately	O
appointed	O
for	O
the	O
visit	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
principal	O
business	O
that	O
had	O
brought	O
the	O
commodore	O
to	O
that	O
city	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
the	O
merchants	O
returned	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
the	O
viceroy	O
was	O
then	O
so	O
fully	O
employed	O
in	O
preparing	O
his	O
dispatches	O
for	O
Pekin	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
getting	O
admittance	O
to	O
him	O
at	O
present	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
engaged	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
officers	O
of	O
his	O
court	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
information	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
at	O
leisure	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
proposed	O
to	O
notify	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
's	O
arrival	O
and	O
to	O
endeavour	O
to	O
fix	O
the	O
audience	O
.	O

The	O
commodore	O
was	O
already	O
too	O
well	O
acquainted	O
with	O
their	O
artifices	O
not	O
to	O
perceive	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
falshood	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
he	O
consulted	O
only	O
his	O
own	O
judgment	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
applied	O
directly	O
to	O
the	O
viceroy	O
by	O
other	O
hands	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
Chinese	O
merchants	O
had	O
so	O
far	O
prepossessed	O
the	O
supercargoes	O
of	O
our	O
ships	O
with	O
chimerical	O
fears	O
that	O
they	O
,	O
the	O
supercargoes	O
,	O
were	O
extremely	O
apprehensive	O
of	O
being	O
embroiled	O
with	O
the	O
government	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
suffering	O
in	O
their	O
interest	O
,	O
if	O
those	O
measures	O
were	O
taken	O
which	O
appeared	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
most	O
prudential	O
:	O
and	O
therefore	O
,	O
lest	O
the	O
malice	O
and	O
double	O
dealing	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
might	O
have	O
given	O
rise	O
to	O
some	O
sinister	O
incident	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
be	O
afterwards	O
laid	O
at	O
his	O
door	O
,	O
he	O
resolved	O
to	O
continue	O
passive	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
it	O
should	O
appear	O
-LCB-	O
368	O
-RCB-	O
that	O
he	O
lost	O
no	O
time	O
by	O
thus	O
suspending	O
his	O
own	O
opinion	O
.	O

In	O
pursuance	O
of	O
this	O
resolution	O
,	O
he	O
proposed	O
to	O
the	O
English	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
engage	O
not	O
to	O
take	O
any	O
immediate	O
step	O
himself	O
for	O
getting	O
admittance	O
to	O
the	O
viceroy	O
,	O
provided	O
the	O
Chinese	O
,	O
who	O
contracted	O
to	O
furnish	O
his	O
provisions	O
,	O
would	O
let	O
him	O
see	O
that	O
his	O
bread	O
was	O
baked	O
,	O
his	O
meat	O
salted	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
storee	O
prepared	O
with	O
the	O

dispatch	O

But	O
if	O
by	O
the	O
time	O
when	O
all	O
was	O
in	O
readiness	O
to	O
be	O
shipped	O
off	O
,	O
which	O
it	O
was	O
supposed	O
would	O
be	O
in	O
about	O
forty	O
days	O
,	O
the	O
merchants	O
should	O
not	O
have	O
procured	O
the	O
government	O
's	O
permission	O
to	O
send	O
it	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
then	O
the	O
commodore	O
was	O
determined	O
to	O
apply	O
to	O
the	O
viceroy	O
himself	O
.	O

These	O
were	O
the	O
terms	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
thought	O
proper	O
to	O
offer	O
to	O
quiet	O
the	O
uneasiness	O
of	O
the	O
supercargoes	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
the	O
apparent	O
equity	O
of	O
the	O
conditions	O
,	O
many	O
difficulties	O
and	O
objections	O
were	O
urged	O
;	O
nor	O
would	O
the	O
Chinese	O
agree	O
to	O
the	O
proposal	O
till	O
the	O
commodore	O
had	O
consented	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
every	O
article	O
he	O
bespoke	O
before	O
it	O
was	O
put	O
in	O
hand	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
the	O
contract	O
being	O
past	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
some	O
satisfaction	O
to	O
the	O
commodore	O
to	O
be	O
certain	O
that	O
his	O
preparations	O
were	O
now	O
going	O
on	O
;	O
and	O
being	O
himself	O
on	O
the	O
spot	O
,	O
he	O
took	O
care	O
to	O
hasten	O
them	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
possible	O
.	O

During	O
this	O
interval	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
stores	O
and	O
provisions	O
were	O
getting	O
ready	O
,	O
the	O
merchants	O
continually	O
entertained	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
with	O
accounts	O
of	O
their	O
various	O
endeavours	O
to	O
procure	O
a	O
licence	O
from	O
the	O
viceroy	O
and	O
their	O
frequent	O
disappointments	O

This	O
was	O
now	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
amusement	O
to	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
fully	O
satisfied	O
there	O

not	O
one	O

in	O
anything	O

when	O

resolved	O
to	O
demand	O
an	O
audience	O
of	O
the	O
viceroy	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
persuaded	O
that	O
,	O
without	O
this	O
ceremony	O
,	O
the	O
grant	O
of	O
a	O
permission	O
to	O
take	O
his	O
stores	O
on	O
board	O
would	O
meet	O
with	O
great	O
difficulty	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
24th	O
of	O
November	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
sent	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
officers	O
to	O
the	O
mandarine	O
who	O
commanded	O
the	O
guard	O
of	O
the	O
principal	O
gate	O
of	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Canton	PNM
with	O
a	O
letter	O
directed	O
to	O
the	O
viceroy	O
.	O

When	O
this	O
letter	O
was	O
delivered	O
to	O
the	O
mandarine	O
,	O
he	O
received	O
the	O
officer	O
who	O
brought	O
it	O
very	O
civilly	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
down	O
the	O
contents	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
Chinese	O
,	O
and	O
promised	O
that	O
the	O
viceroy	O
should	O
be	O
immediately	O
acquainted	O
with	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
told	O
the	O
officer	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
-LCB-	O
369	O
-RCB-	O
necessary	O
he	O
should	O
wait	O
for	O
an	O
answer	O
,	O
because	O
a	O
message	O
would	O
be	O
sent	O
to	O
the	O
commodore	O
himself	O
.	O

When	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
first	O
determined	O
to	O
write	O
this	O
letter	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
under	O
great	O
difficulties	O
about	O
a	O
proper	O
interpreter	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
well	O
aware	O
that	O
none	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
usually	O
employed	O
as	O
linguists	O
could	O
be	O
relied	O
on	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
at	O
last	O
prevailed	O
with	O
Mr.	O
Flint	O
,	O
an	O
English	O
gentleman	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
factory	O
,	O
who	O
spoke	O
Chinese	O
perfectly	O
well	O
,	O
to	O
accompany	O
his	O
officer	O
.	O

This	O
person	O
,	O
who	O
upon	O
that	O
occasion	O
and	O
many	O
others	O
was	O
of	O
singular	O
service	O
to	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
left	O
at	O
Canton	PNM
,	O
when	O
a	O
youth	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
late	O
Captain	O
Rigby	O
.	O

The	O
leaving	O
him	O
there	O
to	O
learn	O
the	O
Chinese	O
language	O
was	O
a	O
step	O
taken	O
by	O
that	O
captain	O
merely	O
from	O
his	O
own	O
persuasion	O
of	O
the	O
considerable	O
advantages	O
which	O
the	O
East	O
India	PNM
Company	O
might	O
one	O
day	O
receive	O
from	O
an	O
English	O
interpreter	O
,	O
and	O
tho	O
'	O
the	O
utility	O
of	O
this	O
measure	O
has	O
greatly	O
exceeded	O
all	O
that	O
was	O
expected	O
from	O
it	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
have	O
not	O
heard	O
that	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
to	O
this	O
hour	O
imitated	O
:	O
but	O
we	O
imprudently	O
choose	O
,	O
except	O
in	O
this	O
single	O
instance	O
,	O
to	O
carry	O
on	O
the	O
vast	O
transactions	O
of	O
the	O
port	O
of	O
Canton	PNM
either	O
by	O
the	O
ridiculous	O
jargon	O
of	O
broken	O
English	O
,	O
which	O
some	O
few	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
have	O
learnt	O
,	O
or	O
by	O
the	O
suspected	O
interpretation	O
of	O
the	O
linguists	O
of	O

nations	O
.	O

Two	O
days	O
after	O
the	O
sending	O
the	O
above-mentioned	O
letter	O
,	O
a	O
fire	O
broke	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
suburbs	O
of	O
Canton	PNM
.	O

On	O
the	O
first	O
alarm	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
went	O
thither	O
with	O
his	O
officers	O
and	O
his	O
boat	O
's	O
crew	O
to	O
aid	O
the	O
Chinese	O
.	O

When	O
he	O
came	O
there	O
,	O
he	O
found	O
that	O
it	O
had	O
begun	O
in	O
a	O
sailor	O
's	O
shed	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
by	O
the	O
slightness	O
of	O
the	O
buildings	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
aukwardness	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
getting	O
head	O
apace	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
he	O
perceived	O
that	O
by	O
pulling	O
down	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
adjacent	O
sheds	O
it	O
might	O
easily	O
be	O
extinguished	O
;	O
and	O
particularly	O
observing	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
then	O
running	O
along	O
a	O
wooden	O
cornice	O
,	O
which	O
blazed	O
fiercely	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
immediately	O
communicate	O
the	O
flame	O
to	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
,	O
he	O
ordered	O
his	O
people	O
to	O
begin	O
with	O
tearing	O
away	O
the	O
cornice	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
presently	O
attempted	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
soon	O
executed	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
meantime	O
he	O
was	O
told	O
that	O
as	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
mandarine	O
there	O
,	O
who	O
alone	O
has	O
a	O
power	O
to	O
direct	O
on	O
these	O
occasions	O
,	O
the	O
Chinese	O
would	O
make	O
him	O
,	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
answerable	O
for	O
whatever	O
should	O
be	O
pulled	O
down	O
by	O
his	O
command	O
.	O

Hereupon	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
and	O
his	O
attendants	O
desisted	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
sent	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
English	O
factory	O
,	O
to	O
assist	O
in	O
securing	O
the	O
company	O
's	O
treasure	O
and	O
effects	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
easy	O
-LCB-	O
370	O
-RCB-	O
to	O
foresee	O
that	O
no	O
distance	O
was	O
a	O
protection	O
against	O
the	O
rage	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
fire	O
,	O
where	O
so	O
little	O
was	O
done	O
to	O
put	O
a	O
stop	O
to	O
it	O
;	O
since	O
all	O
the	O
while	O
the	O
Chinese	O
contented	O
themselves	O
with	O
viewing	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
holding	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
idols	O
near	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
expect	O
should	O
check	O
its	O
progress	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
a	O
mandarine	O
came	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
city	O
,	O
attended	O
by	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
hundred	O
firemen	O
.	O

These	O
made	O
some	O
feeble	O
efforts	O
to	O
pull	O
down	O
the	O
neighbouring	O
houses	O
,	O
but	O
by	O
that	O
time	O
the	O
fire	O
had	O
greatly	O
extended	O
itself	O
and	O
was	O
got	O
amongst	O
the	O
merchants	O
'	O
warehouses	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Chinese	O
firemen	O
,	O
wanting	O
both	O
skill	O
and	O
spirit	O
,	O
were	O
incapable	O
of	O
checking	O
its	O
violence	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
its	O
fury	O
increased	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
feared	O
the	O
whole	O
city	O
would	O
be	O
destroyed	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
general	O
confusion	O
the	O
viceroy	O
himself	O
came	O
thither	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
commodore	O
was	O
sent	O
to	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
intreated	O
to	O
afford	O
his	O
assistance	O
,	O
being	O
told	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
take	O
any	O
measures	O
he	O
should	O
think	O
most	O
prudent	O
in	O
the	O
present	O
emergency	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
message	O
he	O
went	O
thither	O
a	O
second	O
time	O
,	O
carrying	O
with	O
him	O
about	O
forty	O
of	O
his	O
people	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
city	O
,	O
exerted	O
themselves	O
after	O
so	O
extraordinary	O
a	O
manner	O
as	O
in	O
that	O
country	O
was	O
altogether	O
without	O
example	O
.	O

For	O
,	O
behaving	O
with	O
the	O
agility	O
and	O
boldness	O
peculiar	O
to	O
sailors	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
rather	O
animated	O
than	O
deterred	O
by	O
the	O
flames	O
and	O
falling	O
buildings	O
amongst	O
which	O
they	O
wrought	O
;	O
whence	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
uncommon	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
most	O
forward	O
of	O
them	O
tumble	O
to	O
the	O
ground	O
on	O
the	O
roofs	O
and	O
amidst	O
the	O
ruins	O
of	O
houses	O
which	O
their	O
own	O
efforts	O
brought	O
down	O
under	O
them	O
.	O

By	O
their	O
resolution	O
and	O
activity	O
the	O
fire	O
was	O
soon	O
extinguished	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
amazement	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
:	O
and	O
it	O
fortunately	O
happened	O
too	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
buildings	O
being	O
all	O
on	O
one	O

escaped	O
with	O
no	O

some	O

bruises	O

The	O
fire	O
,	O
though	O
at	O

thus	O
luckily	O
extinguished	O
,	O
did	O
great	O
mischief	O
during	O
the	O
time	O
it	O
continued	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
consumed	O
a	O
hundred	O
shops	O
and	O
eleven	O
streets	O
full	O
of	O
warehouses	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
damage	O
amounted	O
to	O
an	O

sum	O
;	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
the	O

well	O
known	O
to	O
the	O

to	O

It	O
raged	O
indeed	O
with	O
unusual	O
violence	O
,	O
for	O
in	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
warehouses	O
there	O
were	O
large	O
quantities	O
of	O
camphire	O
,	O
which	O
greatly	O
added	O
to	O
its	O
fury	O

and	O
produced	O
a	O
column	O
of	O
exceeding	O
white	O
flame	O
,	O
which	O
-LCB-	O

-RCB-	O
blazed	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
air	O
to	O
such	O
a	O
prodigious	O
height	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
distinctly	O
seen	O
on	O

the	O

though	O
she	O
was	O
at	O

Whilst	O
the	O

were	O
labouring	O
at	O
the	O
fire	O
,	O
and	O
the	O

possessed	O
the	O
whole	O
city	O

several	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
considerable	O
Chinese	O
merchants	O
came	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
to	O
desire	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
let	O
each	O
of	O
them	O
have	O
one	O

his	O
soldiers	O
-LRB-	O

from	O

which	O
,	O
from	O
the	O

,	O
they	O
feared	O

in	O
the	O

Mr.	O
Anson	O
granted	O
them	O
this	O
request	O

and	O
all	O
the	O
men	O
that	O
he	O
thus	O
furnished	O
behaved	O
much	O
to	O
the	O
satisfaction	O
of	O
the	O
merchants	O
,	O
who	O
afterwards	O
highly	O
applauded	O
their	O
great	O
diligence	O
and	O
fidelity	O

By	O
this	O
means	O
,	O
the	O
resolution	O
of	O
the	O
English	O
in	O
mastering	O
the	O
fire	O

their	O
trusty	O
and	O
prudent	O
conduct	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
employed	O
as	O

,	O
was	O
the	O
general	O
subject	O
of	O
conversation	O
amongst	O
the	O
Chinese	O
.	O

And	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
principal	O
inhabitants	O
waited	O
on	O
the	O
commodore	O
to	O
thank	O
him	O
for	O
his	O
assistance	O
,	O
frankly	O
owning	O

him	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
preserved	O
their	O
city	O
from	O
being	O
totally	O
consumed	O
,	O
as	O
they	O

Soon	O
after	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
a	O
message	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
commodore	O
from	O
the	O
viceroy	O

appointing	O
the	O
30th	O
of	O

for	O
his	O
audience	O

which	O
sudden	O
resolution	O

in	O
a	O
matter	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
long	O
agitated	O
in	O

was	O
also	O
owing	O
to	O
the	O
signal	O

performed	O
by	O
Mr.	O

his	O

at	O
the	O

the	O

some	O

an	O

The	O
fixing	O
this	O
business	O
of	O
the	O
audience	O
was	O
on	O
every	O
account	O
a	O
circumstance	O
with	O
which	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
was	O
much	O
pleased	O
,	O
since	O
he	O
was	O
satisfied	O
the	O
Chinese	O
Government	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
determined	O
this	O

they	O
claimed	O

to	O
grant	O
him	O
all	O
he	O
could	O
reasonably	O
ask	O

For	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
well	O
knew	O
the	O
commodore	O
's	O
sentiments	O
,	O
it	O
would	O

a	O

not	O

Mr.	O

with	O
his	O

having	O
passed	O
through	O
the	O

of	O

he	O
was	O
then	O
conducted	O
to	O
the	O
great	O
hall	O
of	O
audience	O
,	O
where	O
he	O
found	O
the	O
viceroy	O
seated	O
under	O
a	O

in	O
the	O
emperor	O

chair	O
of	O

with	O
all	O
his	O

Here	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
vacant	O
seat	O
prepared	O
for	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
placed	O
on	O
his	O
arrival	O

He	O
was	O
ranked	O
the	O
third	O
in	O
order	O
from	O
the	O

,	O
there	O
being	O
above	O

only	O
the	O

who	O
in	O

precedence	O
of	O
all	O

When	O
the	O
commodore	O
was	O
seated	O
,	O
he	O
addressed	O
himself	O
to	O
the	O
viceroy	O
by	O
his	O
interpreter	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
with	O
reciting	O
the	O
various	O
methods	O
he	O
had	O
formerly	O
taken	O
to	O
get	O
an	O
audience	O
;	O
adding	O
that	O
he	O
imputed	O
the	O
delays	O
he	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
to	O
the	O
insincerity	O
of	O
those	O
he	O
had	O
employed	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
therefore	O
no	O
other	O
means	O
left	O
than	O
to	O
send	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
his	O
own	O
officer	O
with	O
a	O
letter	O
to	O
the	O
gate	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
mention	O
of	O
this	O
the	O
viceroy	O
interrupted	O
the	O
interpreter	O
,	O
and	O
bid	O
him	O
assure	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
that	O
the	O
first	O
knowledge	O
they	O
had	O
of	O
his	O
being	O
at	O
Canton	PNM
was	O
from	O
that	O
letter	O
.	O

Mr.	O
Anson	O
then	O
proceeded	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
the	O
subjects	O
of	O
the	O
King	O
of	O
Great	PNM
Britain	PNM
trading	O
to	O
China	PNM
had	O
complained	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
vexatious	O
impositions	O
both	O
of	O
the	O
merchants	O
and	O
inferior	O
custom-house	O
officers	O
,	O
to	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
frequently	O
necessitated	O
to	O
submit	O
,	O
by	O
reason	O
of	O
the	O
difficulty	O
of	O
getting	O
access	O
to	O
the	O
mandarines	O
,	O
who	O
alone	O
could	O
grant	O
them	O

That	O
it	O
was	O
his	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
's	O
,	O
duty	O
,	O
as	O
an	O
officer	O
of	O
the	O
King	O
of	O
Great	PNM
Britain	PNM
,	O
to	O
lay	O
before	O
the	O
viceroy	O
these	O
grievances	O
of	O
the	O
British	O
subjects	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
hoped	O
the	O
viceroy	O
would	O
take	O
into	O
consideration	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
give	O
orders	O
that	O
hereafter	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
no	O
just	O
reason	O
for	O
complaint	O
.	O

Here	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
paused	O
,	O
and	O
waited	O
some	O
time	O
in	O
expectation	O
of	O
an	O
answer	O
,	O
but	O
nothing	O
being	O
said	O
,	O
he	O
asked	O
his	O
interpreter	O
if	O
he	O
was	O
certain	O
the	O
viceroy	O
understood	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
urged	O
;	O
the	O
interpreter	O
told	O
him	O
he	O
was	O
certain	O
it	O
was	O
understood	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
believed	O
no	O
reply	O
would	O
be	O
made	O
to	O
it	O
.	O

Mr.	O
Anson	O
then	O
represented	O
to	O
the	O
viceroy	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
_	O
Haslingfield	O
_	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
dismasted	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
China	PNM
,	O
had	O
arrived	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
of	O
Canton	PNM
but	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
before	O
.	O

The	O
people	O
on	O
board	O
this	O
vessel	O
had	O
been	O
great	O
sufferers	O
by	O
the	O
fire	O
;	O
the	O
captain	O
in	O
particular	O
had	O
all	O
his	O
goods	O
burnt	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
lost	O
besides	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
confusion	O
,	O
a	O
chest	O
of	O
treasure	O
of	O
four	O
thousand	O
five	O
hundred	O
tahel	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
stolen	O
by	O
the	O
Chinese	O
boatmen	O
.	O

Mr.	O
Anson	O
therefore	O
desired	O
that	O
the	O
captain	O
might	O
have	O
the	O
assistance	O
of	O
the	O
government	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
apprehended	O
the	O
money	O
could	O
never	O
be	O
recovered	O
without	O
the	O
interposition	O
of	O
the	O
mandarines	O
.	O

And	O
to	O
this	O
request	O
the	O
viceroy	O
made	O
answer	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
settling	O
the	O
emperor	O
's	O
customs	O
for	O
that	O
ship	O
,	O
some	O
abatement	O
should	O
be	O
made	O
in	O
consideration	O
of	O
her	O
losses	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
the	O
commodore	O
having	O
dispatched	O
the	O
business	O
with	O
which	O
the	O
officers	O
of	O
the	O
East	O
India	PNM
Company	O
had	O
entrusted	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
entered	O
on	O
his	O
own	O
affairs	O
,	O
acquainting	O
the	O
viceroy	O
that	O
the	O
proper	O
season	O
was	O
already	O
set	O
in	O
for	O
returning	O
to	O
Europe	PNM
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
wanted	O
only	O
a	O
licence	O
to	O
ship	O
off	O
his	O
provisions	O
and	O
stores	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
all	O
ready	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
this	O
should	O
be	O
granted	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
should	O
have	O
gotten	O
his	O
necessaries	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
he	O
intended	O
to	O
leave	O
the	O
river	O
of	O
Canton	PNM
and	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
his	O
way	O
for	O
England	PNM
.	O

The	O
viceroy	O
replied	O
to	O
this	O
that	O
the	O
licence	O
should	O
be	O
immediately	O
issued	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
everything	O
should	O
be	O
ordered	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
following	O
day	O
.	O

And	O
finding	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
had	O
nothing	O
farther	O
to	O
insist	O
on	O
,	O
the	O
viceroy	O
continued	O
the	O
conversation	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
acknowledging	O
in	O
very	O
civil	O
terms	O
how	O
much	O
the	O
Chinese	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
him	O
for	O
his	O
signal	O
services	O
at	O
the	O
fire	O
,	O
and	O
owning	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
saved	O
the	O
city	O
from	O
being	O
destroyed	O
:	O
then	O
observing	O
that	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
good	O
while	O
on	O
their	O
coast	O
,	O
he	O
closed	O
his	O
discourse	O
by	O
wishing	O
the	O
commodore	O
-LCB-	O
374	O
-RCB-	O
a	O
prosperous	O
voyage	O
to	O
Europe	PNM
,	O
after	O
which	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
thanking	O
him	O
for	O
his	O
civility	O
and	O
assistance	O
,	O
took	O
his	O
leave	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
commodore	O
was	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
hall	O
of	O
audience	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
much	O
pressed	O
to	O
go	O
into	O
a	O
neighbouring	O
apartment	O
,	O
where	O
there	O
was	O
an	O
entertainment	O
provided	O
;	O
but	O
finding	O
,	O
on	O
enquiry	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
viceroy	O
himself	O
was	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
present	O
,	O
he	O
declined	O
the	O
invitation	O
and	O
departed	O
,	O
attended	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
manner	O
as	O
at	O
his	O
arrival	O
,	O
only	O
on	O
his	O
leaving	O
the	O
city	O
he	O
was	O
saluted	O
with	O
three	O
guns	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
as	O
many	O
as	O
in	O
that	O
country	O
are	O
ever	O
fired	O
on	O
any	O
ceremony	O
.	O

Thus	O
the	O
commodore	O
,	O
to	O
his	O
great	O
joy	O
,	O
at	O
last	O
finished	O
this	O
troublesome	O
affair	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
preceding	O
four	O
months	O
,	O
had	O
given	O
him	O
much	O
disquietude	O
.	O

Indeed	O
he	O
was	O
highly	O
pleased	O
with	O
procuring	O
a	O
licence	O
for	O
the	O
shipping	O
off	O
his	O
stores	O
and	O
provisions	O
,	O
as	O
thereby	O
he	O
was	O
enabled	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
Great	PNM
Britain	PNM
with	O
the	O
first	O
of	O
the	O
monsoons	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
prevent	O
all	O
intelligence	O
of	O
his	O
being	O
expected	O
:	O
but	O
this	O
,	O
though	O
a	O
very	O
important	O
point	O
,	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
circumstance	O
which	O
gave	O
him	O
the	O
greatest	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
was	O
more	O
particularly	O
attentive	O
to	O
the	O
authentic	O
precedent	O
established	O
on	O
this	O
occasion	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
his	O
Majesty	O
's	O
ships	O
of	O
war	O
are	O
for	O
the	O
future	O
exempted	O
from	O
all	O
demands	O
of	O
duty	O
in	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
ports	O
of	O
China	PNM
.	O

In	O
pursuance	O
of	O
the	O
promises	O
of	O
the	O
viceroy	O
,	O
the	O
provisions	O
were	O
begun	O
to	O
be	O
sent	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
day	O
succeeding	O
the	O
audience	O
,	O
and	O
four	O
days	O
after	O
,	O
the	O
commodore	O
embarked	O
at	O
Canton	PNM
for	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
all	O
the	O
preparations	O
for	O
putting	O
to	O
sea	O
were	O
pursued	O
with	O
so	O
much	O
vigilance	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
so	O
soon	O
compleated	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
7th	O
of	O
December	O
the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
and	O
her	O
prize	O
unmoored	O
and	O
stood	O
down	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
passing	O
through	O
the	O
Bocca	PNM
Tigris	PNM
on	O
the	O
10th	O
.	O

On	O
this	O
occasion	O
I	O
must	O
observe	O
that	O
the	O
Chinese	O
had	O
taken	O
care	O
to	O
man	O
the	O
two	O
forts	O
on	O
each	O
side	O
of	O
that	O
passage	O
with	O
as	O
many	O
men	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
well	O
contain	O
,	O
the	O
greatest	O
part	O
of	O
them	O
armed	O
with	O
pikes	O
and	O
matchlock	O
musquets	O
.	O

These	O
garrisons	O
affected	O
to	O
shew	O
themselves	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
possible	O
to	O
the	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
doubtless	O
intended	O
to	O
induce	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
to	O
think	O
more	O
reverently	O
than	O
he	O
had	O
hitherto	O
done	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
military	O
power	O
.	O

For	O
this	O
purpose	O
they	O
were	O
equipped	O
with	O
extraordinary	O
parade	O
,	O
having	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
colours	O
exposed	O
to	O

and	O
on	O

and	O
a	O
soldier	O
of	O
unusual	O
size	O
,	O
dressed	O
in	O
very	O
sightly	O
armour	O
,	O
stalked	O
about	O
on	O
-LCB-	O

-RCB-	O
the	O
parapet	O
with	O
a	O
battle-ax	O
in	O

to	O
put	O
on	O
as	O
important	O
and	O
martial	O
an	O
air	O
as	O
possible	O
,	O
though	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
observers	O
on	O

the	O
_	O
Centurion	O
_	O
shrewdly	O
suspected	O

from	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
his	O
armour	O
,	O
that	O
instead	O
of	O
steel	O
it	O
was	O
composed	O

The	O

now	O
without	O

and	O
consequently	O
upon	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
leaving	O
the	O

I	O

before	O
I	O
quit	O
all	O
mention	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
affairs	O

to	O
subjoin	O
a	O
few	O
remarks	O
on	O
the	O
disposition	O
and	O
genius	O
of	O
that	O
celebrated	O
people	O

And	O
though	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
supposed	O
that	O
observations	O
made	O
at	O

only	O
,	O
a	O
place	O
situated	O
in	O
a	O
corner	O
of	O

very	O
imperfect	O

any	O

yet	O
as	O
those	O
who	O
have	O
had	O
opportunities	O
of	O
examining	O
the	O
inner	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
have	O
been	O
evidently	O
influenced	O
by	O
very	O
ridiculous	O
prepossessions	O

and	O
as	O
the	O
transactions	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Anson	O
with	O
the	O
regency	O
of	O
Canton	O
were	O
of	O
an	O
uncommon	O
nature	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
many	O
circumstances	O
occurred	O
different	O
perhaps	O
from	O
any	O
which	O
have	O
happened	O
before	O
,	O
I	O
hope	O
the	O
following	O
reflections	O
,	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
drawn	O
from	O
these	O
incidents	O
,	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
altogether	O

to	O
the	O
reader	O

That	O
the	O
Chinese	O
are	O
a	O
very	O
ingenious	O
and	O
industrious	O
people	O
is	O
sufficiently	O
evinced	O
from	O
the	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
curious	O

it	O
may	O
perhaps	O
be	O
truly	O

that	O
these	O

we	O

that	O

are	O

as	O
the	O

between	O

the	O
morality	O

taught	O

so	O
that	O
from	O
the	O

by	O
some	O
of	O

one	O
should	O
be	O

judge	O
from	O
the	O
specimens	O
exhibited	O
in	O
the	O
works	O
of	O
the	O
missionaries	O
,	O
we	O
shall	O
find	O
them	O
frequently	O
employed	O
in	O
recommending	O
ridiculous	O

instead	O
of	O

Indeed	O
,	O
the	O

pretension	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
to	O
a	O
more	O
refined	O
morality	O
than	O
their	O
neighbours	O
is	O
founded	O
not	O
on	O
their	O
integrity	O

but	O
solely	O
on	O
the	O

their	O
constant	O
attention	O
to	O
suppress	O
all	O

But	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
considered	O
that	O

are	O
often	O
not	O

mischievous	O
to	O
the	O

of	O
mankind	O
than	O
impetuosity	O
and	O
vehemence	O
of	O

:	O
since	O
these	O
,	O
though	O
usually	O
liable	O
to	O
the	O

do	O
not	O
exclude	O
sincerity	O

nor	O
many	O

laudable	O
qualities	O

And	O
perhaps	O
,	O
if	O
this	O
matter	O
was	O
examined	O
to	O
the	O
bottom	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
appear	O
that	O
the	O
calm	O

turn	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O

on	O
which	O
they	O
so	O
much	O
value	O
themselves	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
distinguishes	O
the	O
nation	O
from	O
all	O
others	O
,	O
is	O
in	O
reality	O
the	O
source	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
exceptionable	O
part	O
of	O
their	O
character	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
often	O
observed	O
by	O
those	O
who	O
have	O
attended	O
to	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
mankind	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
difficult	O
to	O
curb	O
the	O
more	O
robust	O
and	O

that	O
the	O
timidity	O

and	O
dishonesty	O
of	O
the	O

may	O

in	O

the	O

the	O

finished	O
their	O

Mr.	O
Anson	O
had	O
learnt	O
enough	O
from	O
the	O
English	O
at	O
Canton	PNM
to	O
conjecture	O
that	O
the	O
war	O
with	O
Spain	PNM
was	O
still	O
continued	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
probably	O
the	O
French	O
might	O
engage	O
in	O
the	O
assistance	O
of	O
Spain	PNM
before	O
he	O
could	O
arrive	O
in	O
Great	PNM
Britain	PNM
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
,	O
knowing	O
that	O
no	O
intelligence	O
could	O
come	O
to	O
Europe	PNM
of	O
the	O
prize	O
he	O
had	O
taken	O

the	O

had	O
on	O
board	O
till	O
the	O
return	O
of	O
the	O
merchantmen	O
from	O

,	O
he	O
was	O
resolved	O
to	O
make	O
all	O
possible	O
expedition	O
in	O
getting	O
back	O

that	O
he	O
might	O
be	O
himself	O
the	O
first	O
messenger	O
of	O
his	O

good	O

he	O

to	O

accepted	O
