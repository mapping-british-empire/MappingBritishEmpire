have	O

as	O

that	O

easily	O
had	O
,	O
they	O
run	O
into	O
one	O
so	O
like	O
their	O

;	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
Privateers	O
in	O
Time	O
of	O
War	O
are	O
a	O
Nursery	O
for	O
Pyrates	O
against	O
a	O

_	O
_	O
Now	O
we	O
have	O
accounted	O
for	O
their	O
Rise	O

Beginning	O
,	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
natural	O
to	O
enquire	O
why	O
they	O
are	O
not	O
taken	O
and	O
destroy	O
'd	O
,	O
before	O
they	O
come	O

that	O

This	O

will	O
not	O
turn	O
much	O
to	O
the	O

what	O

with	O

_	O
_	O
I	O
say	O

't	O
is	O
strange	O
that	O

Reason	O
why	O

A	O
