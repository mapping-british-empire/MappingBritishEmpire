SIR	O

May	O
it	O
please	O
you	O
to	O
pardon	O
the	O
boldness	O
of	O
a	O
stranger	O
to	O
your	O

,	O
if	O
upon	O
the	O
encouragement	O
of	O

he	O
presumes	O
so	O
much	O
upon	O
your	O

,	O
as	O
to	O
lay	O
before	O
you	O
this	O
account	O
of	O
his	O

As	O
the	O
scene	O
of	O
them	O
is	O
not	O

remote	O

but	O
for	O
the	O
most	O

there	O
may	O
be	O
some	O
things	O

some	O

not	O

I	O
have	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
of	O
the	O
vanity	O
of	O
a	O
traveller	O
as	O
to	O
be	O
fond	O

of	O
this	O
kind	O
;	O
nor	O
can	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
plain	O
piece	O
of	O
mine	O
deserves	O
a	O
place	O
among	O
your	O
more	O
curious	O

much	O

have	O
I	O
the	O
arrogance	O
to	O

your	O

of	O

for	O
the	O

faults	O

both	O
of	O

I	O
avow	O

according	O
to	O
my	O

a	O

Before	O
the	O
reader	O
proceed	O
any	O
further	O
in	O
the	O
perusal	O
of	O
this	O
work	O
I	O
must	O
bespeak	O
a	O
little	O
of	O
his	O
patience	O
here	O
to	O
take	O
along	O
with	O
him	O
this	O
short	O
account	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
composed	O
of	O
a	O
mixed	O
relation	O
of	O
places	O

actions	O
in	O
the	O

order	O
of	O
time	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
occurred	O

for	O
which	O

I	O
kept	O

In	O
the	O
description	O
of	O

,	O
I	O
have	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
give	O
what	O
satisfaction	O
I	O
could	O
to	O
my	O
countrymen	O
;	O
though	O
possibly	O
to	O
the	O
describing	O
several	O
things	O
that	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
much	O
better	O
accounted	O
for	O
by	O
others	O
:	O
choosing	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
particular	O
than	O
might	O
be	O
needful	O
,	O
with	O
respect	O
to	O
the	O
intelligent	O
reader	O
,	O
rather	O
than	O
to	O
omit	O
what	O
I	O
thought	O
might	O
tend	O
to	O
the	O
information	O
of	O
persons	O
no	O
less	O
sensible	O
and	O
inquisitive	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
so	O
learned	O
or	O

For	O
which	O
reason	O
my	O
chief	O
care	O
has	O
been	O
to	O
be	O
as	O
particular	O
as	O
was	O
consistent	O
with	O
my	O
intended	O
brevity	O
in	O
setting	O
down	O
such	O
observables	O
as	O
I	O
met	O
with	O

Nor	O
have	O
I	O
given	O
myself	O
any	O
great	O
trouble	O
since	O
my	O
return	O
to	O
compare	O
my	O
discoveries	O
with	O
those	O
of	O
others	O
:	O
the	O
rather	O
because	O
,	O
should	O
it	O
so	O
happen	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
described	O
some	O
places	O
or	O
things	O
which	O
others	O
have	O
done	O
before	O
me	O
,	O
yet	O
in	O
different	O
accounts	O

even	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
things	O

it	O
can	O
hardly	O
be	O
but	O
there	O
will	O
be	O
some	O
new	O
light	O
afforded	O
by	O
each	O
of	O
them	O

But	O
after	O
all	O
,	O
considering	O
that	O
the	O
main	O
of	O
this	O
voyage	O
has	O
its	O
scene	O
laid	O
in	O

tracts	O
of	O
the	O
remoter	O
parts	O
both	O
of	O
the	O

by	O
any	O

I	O
may	O
without	O
vanity	O
encourage	O
the	O
reader	O
to	O
expect	O
many	O
things	O
wholly	O
new	O
to	O
him	O

and	O
many	O
others	O
more	O
fully	O
described	O
than	O
he	O

elsewhere	O

for	O
which	O
not	O

in	O
this	O

As	O
for	O
the	O
actions	O
of	O
the	O
company	O
among	O
whom	O
I	O
made	O
the	O
greatest	O
part	O
of	O
this	O

a	O
thread	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
have	O
carried	O
on	O
through	O
it	O

it	O
is	O
not	O
to	O
divert	O
the	O
reader	O
with	O
them	O
that	O
I	O
mention	O
them	O
,	O
much	O
less	O
that	O
I	O
take	O
any	O
pleasure	O
in	O

for	O
method	O

and	O
for	O
the	O
reader	O
's	O
satisfaction	O
;	O
who	O
could	O
not	O
so	O
well	O
acquiesce	O
in	O
my	O
description	O
of	O
places	O

without	O

the	O

without	O
an	O

And	O
as	O
for	O
the	O

themselves	O

they	O
make	O
for	O
the	O
reader	O
's	O
advantage	O
,	O
how	O
little	O
soever	O
for	O
mine	O
;	O
since	O
thereby	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
the	O
better	O
enabled	O
to	O
gratify	O
his	O
curiosity	O
;	O
as	O
one	O
who	O
rambles	O
about	O
a	O
country	O
can	O
give	O
usually	O
a	O
better	O
account	O
of	O
it	O
than	O
a	O
carrier	O
who	O
jogs	O
on	O
to	O
his	O
inn	O
without	O
ever	O
going	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
road	O
.	O

As	O
to	O
my	O
style	O
,	O
it	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
expected	O
that	O
a	O
seaman	O
should	O
affect	O
politeness	O
;	O
for	O
were	O
I	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
little	O
solicitous	O
about	O
it	O
in	O
a	O
work	O
of	O
this	O
nature	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
frequently	O
indeed	O
divested	O
myself	O
of	O
sea-phrases	O
to	O
gratify	O
the	O
land	O
reader	O
;	O
for	O
which	O
the	O
seamen	O
will	O
hardly	O
forgive	O
me	O
:	O
and	O
yet	O
,	O
possibly	O
,	O
I	O
shall	O
not	O
seem	O
complaisant	O
enough	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
;	O
because	O
I	O
still	O
retain	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
so	O
many	O
sea-terms	O
.	O

I	O
confess	O
I	O
have	O
not	O
been	O
at	O
all	O
scrupulous	O
in	O
this	O
matter	O
,	O
either	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
one	O
or	O
the	O
other	O
of	O
these	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
am	O
persuaded	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
what	O
I	O
say	O
be	O
intelligible	O
,	O
it	O
matters	O
not	O
greatly	O
in	O
what	O
words	O
it	O
is	O
expressed	O
.	O

For	O
the	O
same	O
reason	O
I	O
have	O
not	O
been	O
curious	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
spelling	O
of	O
the	O
names	O
of	O
places	O

which	O
in	O

the	O

of	O

according	O
to	O
their	O
different	O
humours	O

neither	O
have	O
I	O
confined	O
myself	O

such	O

are	O
given	O
by	O
learned	O
authors	O
,	O
or	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
enquired	O
after	O
many	O
of	O
them	O

I	O
write	O
for	O
my	O
countrymen	O
;	O
and	O
have	O
therefore	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
most	O
part	O
,	O
used	O
such	O
names	O
as	O
are	O
familiar	O
to	O
our	O
English	O
seamen	O
,	O
and	O
those	O
of	O
our	O
colonies	O
abroad	O
,	O
yet	O
without	O
neglecting	O
others	O
that	O
occurred	O
.	O

As	O
it	O
might	O
suffice	O
me	O
to	O
have	O
given	O
such	O
names	O
and	O
descriptions	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
I	O
shall	O
leave	O
to	O
those	O
of	O
more	O
leisure	O
and	O
opportunity	O
the	O
trouble	O
of	O
comparing	O
these	O
with	O
those	O
which	O
other	O
authors	O
have	O
assigned	O

The	O
reader	O
will	O
find	O
as	O
he	O
goes	O
along	O
some	O
references	O
to	O
an	O
appendix	O
which	O
I	O
once	O
designed	O
to	O
this	O
book	O
;	O
as	O

to	O
a	O
chapter	O
about	O
the	O
winds	O
in	O
different	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
;	O
to	O

description	O
of	O
the	O
Bay	PNM

in	O
the	O
West	PNM

where	O
I	O
lived	O
long	O
in	O

besides	O
those	O
contained	O
in	O
this	O

But	O
such	O
an	O
appendix	O
would	O
have	O
swelled	O
it	O
too	O
unreasonably	O

therefore	O
I	O
chose	O

to	O
publish	O
it	O
hereafter	O

itself	O

as	O
opportunity	O
shall	O
serve	O

And	O
the	O
same	O
must	O
be	O
said	O
also	O
as	O
to	O
a	O
particular	O
voyage	O
from	O
Achin	PNM
in	O
the	O
isle	O
of	O
Sumatra	PNM
,	O
to	O
Tonquin	PNM
,	PNM
Malacca	PNM
,	O

,	O
which	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
inserted	O
as	O
part	O
of	O
this	O
general	O
one	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
too	O
long	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
,	O
omitting	O
it	O
for	O
the	O
present	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
carried	O
on	O
this	O

next	O
way	O
from	O
Sumatra	PNM
to	O
England	PNM
;	O
and	O
so	O
made	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

to	O

For	O
the	O

the	O

of	O
the	O
voyage	O
and	O
the	O
situation	O
of	O
the	O

mentioned	O
in	O
it	O
I	O
have	O
caused	O
several	O

some	O

its	O

which	O
to	O

may	O
seem	O

that	O
which	O
Mr.	O

has	O
published	O
in	O
the	O
History	O

which	O
he	O
offers	O

I	O
must	O

this	O

I	O
first	O
set	O
out	O
of	O

on	O
this	O

at	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O

I	O
went	O
a	O
passenger	O
,	O
designing	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
thither	O
to	O
go	O
from	O
thence	O
to	O
the	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM
Campeachy	PNM
in	O
the	O
Gulf	PNM

,	O
to	O
cut	O
log-wood	O
:	O
where	O
in	O
a	O
former	O
voyage	O
I	O
had	O
spent	O
about	O
three	O
years	O
in	O
that	O
employ	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
was	O
well	O
acquainted	O
with	O
the	O
place	O
and	O
the	O
work	O
.	O

We	O
sailed	O
with	O
a	O
prosperous	O
gale	O
without	O
any	O
impediment	O
or	O
remarkable	O
passage	O
in	O
our	O
voyage	O
:	O
unless	O
that	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
in	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
Hispaniola	PNM
,	O
and	O
were	O
coasting	O
along	O
on	O

by	O
the	O
little	O
isles	O
of	O
Vacca	PNM

I	O
observed	O
Captain	O

was	O
more	O
vigilant	O
than	O
ordinary	O
,	O
keeping	O
at	O
a	O
good	O
distance	O
off	O
shore	O
,	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
coming	O
too	O
near	O
those	O
small	O
low	O
islands	O
;	O
as	O
he	O
did	O
once	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
voyage	O
from	O
England	PNM
,	O
about	O
the	O
year	O
1673	O
,	O
losing	O
his	O
ship	O
there	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
carelessness	O
of	O
his	O
mates	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
succeeded	O
better	O
;	O
and	O
arrived	O
safe	O
at	O
Port	PNM
Royal	PNM
in	O
Jamaica	PNM
some	O
time	O
in	O
April	O
1679	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
immediately	O
ashore	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
brought	O
some	O
goods	O
with	O
me	O
from	O
England	PNM
which	O
I	O
intended	O
to	O
sell	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
stock	O
myself	O
with	O
rum	O

sugar	O
,	O

,	O
as	O
I	O
knew	O
would	O
sell	O
among	O
the	O
Campeachy	O
log-wood-cutters	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
I	O
sold	O
my	O
English	O
cargo	O
at	O
Port	PNM
Royal	PNM
;	O
but	O
upon	O
some	O
maturer	O
considerations	O
of	O
my	O
intended	O
voyage	O
to	O
Campeachy	O
I	O
changed	O
my	O
thoughts	O
of	O
that	O
design	O
,	O
and	O
continued	O
at	O
Jamaica	PNM
all	O
that	O
year	O
in	O
expectation	O
of	O
some	O
other	O
business	O
.	O

I	O
shall	O
not	O
trouble	O
the	O
reader	O
with	O
my	O
observations	O
at	O
that	O
isle	O
,	O
so	O
well	O
known	O
to	O

nor	O
with	O
the	O
particulars	O
of	O
my	O

during	O
my	O

there	O
.	O

But	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
having	O
there	O
made	O
a	O
purchase	O
of	O
a	O
small	O
estate	O
in	O
Dorsetshire	O
,	O
near	O
my	O
native	O
country	O
of	O
Somerset	O
,	O
of	O
one	O
whose	O
title	O
to	O
it	O
I	O
was	O
well	O
assured	O
of	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
just	O
embarking	O
myself	O
for	O
England	PNM
,	O
about	O
Christmas	O
1679	O
,	O
when	O
one	O
Mr.	O
Hobby	O
invited	O
me	O
to	O
go	O
first	O
a	O
short	O
trading	O
voyage	O
to	O
the	O
country	O
of	O
the	O
Moskitos	O
,	O
of	O
whom	O
I	O
shall	O
speak	O
in	O
my	O
first	O
chapter	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
willing	O
to	O
get	O
up	O
some	O
money	O
before	O
my	O
return	O
,	O
having	O
laid	O
out	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
at	O
Jamaica	PNM
;	O
so	O
I	O
sent	O
the	O
writing	O
of	O
my	O
new	O
purchase	O
along	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
friends	O
whom	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
accompanied	O
to	O
England	PNM
,	O
and	O
went	O
on	O
board	O
Mr.	O
Hobby	O
.	O

Soon	O
after	O
our	O
setting	O
out	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
again	O
in	O
Negril	PNM
Bay	PNM
,	O
at	O
the	O
west	O
end	O
of	O
Jamaica	PNM
;	O
but	O
finding	O
there	O
Captain	O
Coxon	O
,	O
Sawkins	O
,	O
Sharp	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
privateers	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Hobby	O
's	O
men	O
all	O
left	O
him	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
them	O
upon	O
an	O
expedition	O
they	O
had	O
contrived	O
,	O
leaving	O
not	O
one	O
with	O
him	O
beside	O
myself	O
;	O
and	O
being	O
thus	O
left	O
alone	O
,	O
after	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
days	O
'	O
stay	O
with	O
Mr.	O
Hobby	O
I	O
was	O
the	O
more	O
easily	O
persuaded	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
them	O
too	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
shortly	O
after	O
Christmas	O
1679	O
when	O
we	O
set	O
out	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
expedition	O
was	O
to	O
Portobello	PNM
;	O
which	O
being	O
accomplished	O
it	O
was	O
resolved	O
to	O
march	O
by	O
land	O
over	O
the	O
Isthmus	O
of	O
Darien	O
upon	O
some	O
new	O
adventures	O
in	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
.	O

Accordingly	O
on	O
the	O
5th	O
of	O
April	O
1680	O
we	O
went	O
ashore	O
on	O
the	O
Isthmus	O
,	O
near	O
Golden	PNM
Island	PNM
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Samballoes	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
between	O
three	O
and	O
four	O
hundred	O
men	O
,	O
carrying	O
with	O
us	O
such	O
provisions	O
as	O
were	O
necessary	O
,	O
and	O
toys	O
wherewith	O
to	O
gratify	O
the	O
wild	O
Indians	O
through	O
whose	O
country	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
pass	O
.	O

In	O
about	O
nine	O
days	O
'	O
march	O
we	O
arrived	O
at	O
Santa	PNM
Maria	PNM
and	O
took	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
a	O
stay	O
there	O
of	O
about	O
three	O
days	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
to	O
the	O
South	PNM
Sea	PNM
coast	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
embarked	O
ourselves	O
in	O
such	O
Canoas	O
and	O
periago	O
's	O
as	O
our	O
Indian	O
friends	O
furnished	O
us	O
withal	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
in	O
sight	O
of	O
Panama	PNM
by	O
the	O
23rd	O
of	O
April	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
in	O
vain	O
attempted	O
Puebla	PNM
Nova	PNM
,	O
before	O
which	O
Sawkins	O
,	O
then	O
commander	O
in	O
chief	O
,	O
and	O
others	O
,	O
were	O
killed	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
some	O
stay	O
at	O
the	O
neighbouring	O
isles	O
of	O
Quibo	PNM
.	O

Here	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
change	O
our	O
course	O
and	O
stand	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
for	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Peru	PNM
.	O

Accordingly	O
we	O
left	O
the	O
keys	O
or	O
isles	O
of	O
Quibo	PNM
the	O
6th	O
of	O
June	O
,	O
and	O
spent	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
in	O
that	O
southern	O
course	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
touching	O
at	O
the	O
isles	O
of	O
Gorgona	PNM
and	O
Plata	PNM
,	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
Ylo	O
,	O
a	O
small	O
town	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Peru	PNM
,	O
and	O
took	O
it	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
in	O
October	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
November	O
we	O
went	O
thence	O
to	O
Coquimbo	PNM
on	O
the	O
same	O
coast	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
Christmas	O
were	O
got	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
isle	O
of	O
John	PNM
Fernando	PNM
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
farthest	O
of	O
our	O
course	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
.	O

After	O
Christmas	O
we	O
went	O
back	O
again	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
,	O
having	O
a	O
design	O
upon	O
Arica	PNM
,	O
a	O
strong	O
town	O
advantageously	O
situated	O
in	O
the	O
hollow	O
of	O
the	O
elbow	O
,	O
or	O
bending	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
Peruvian	O
coast	O
.	O

But	O
being	O
there	O
repulsed	O
with	O
great	O
loss	O
,	O
we	O
continued	O
our	O
course	O
northward	O
,	O
till	O
by	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
April	O
we	O
were	O
come	O
in	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
isle	O
of	O

,	O
a	O
little	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
of	O
the	O
Equinoctial	O
Line	O

1681	O
I	O
have	O
related	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
my	O
voyage	O
thus	O
summarily	O
and	O
concisely	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
because	O
the	O
world	O
has	O
accounts	O
of	O
it	O
already	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
relations	O
that	O
Mr.	O

have	O
given	O

expedition	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
made	O
chief	O
commander	O
upon	O
Sawkins	O
'	O
being	O
killed	O
;	O
as	O
also	O
because	O
in	O
the	O
prosecution	O
of	O
this	O
voyage	O
I	O
shall	O
come	O
to	O

of	O
these	O

of	O
my	O
going	O
the	O

as	O
they	O
occurred	O
to	O
me	O

And	O
for	O
this	O
reason	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
avoid	O
needless	O
repetitions	O

and	O
hasten	O

such	O

the	O

one	O

We	O
had	O

little	O

before	O

the	O

in	O
strong	O

us	O
before	O
we	O

in	O

for	O

we	O
cut	O
up	O
an	O

to	O
keep	O
the	O

out	O

About	O
10	O
a	O
Clock	O
at	O
night	O
we	O
got	O
in	O
about	O
7	O
leagues	O
to	O
windward	O
of	O
Cape	PNM
Passao	PNM
under	O
the	O
Line	O

and	O
then	O
it	O
proved	O
calm	O

we	O
lay	O

drove	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
being	O
fatigued	O
the	O

The	O
18th	O
day	O
we	O
had	O
little	O
wind	O
till	O
the	O
afternoon	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
made	O
sail	O
,	O
standing	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
,	O
having	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
south-south-west	O
and	O
fair	O
weather	O

At	O
7	O
a	O
Clock	O
we	O
came	O
abreast	O
of	O
Cape	PNM
Passao	PNM
and	O
found	O
a	O
small	O
bark	O
at	O
an	O
anchor	O
in	O
a	O
small	O
bay	O
to	O
leeward	O
of	O
the	O
cape	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
took	O
,	O
our	O
own	O
boats	O
being	O
too	O
small	O
to	O
transport	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
took	O
her	O
just	O
under	O
the	O
Equinoctial	O
Line	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
not	O
only	O
a	O
help	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
taking	O
her	O
we	O
were	O
safe	O
from	O
being	O
described	O
:	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
design	O
to	O
have	O
meddled	O
with	O
any	O
when	O
we	O
parted	O
with	O
our	O
consorts	O
,	O
nor	O
to	O
have	O
seen	O
any	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
have	O
helped	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
bark	O
came	O
from	O
Gallio	PNM
laden	O
with	O
timber	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
bound	O
for	O
Guiaquil	PNM
.	O

The	O
19th	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
about	O
12	O
leagues	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
of	O
Cape	PNM
St.	PNM
Francisco	PNM
to	O
put	O
our	O
new	O
bark	O
into	O
a	O
better	O
trim	O
.	O

In	O
3	O
or	O
4	O
hours	O
time	O
we	O
finished	O
our	O
business	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
sail	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
steered	O
along	O
the	O
coast	O
with	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
south-south-west	O
,	O
intending	O
to	O
touch	O
at	O
Gorgonia	PNM
.	O

Being	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
of	O
Cape	PNM
St.	PNM
Francisco	PNM
we	O
met	O
with	O
very	O
wet	O
weather	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
wind	O
continuing	O
we	O
arrived	O
at	O
Gorgonia	PNM
the	O
24th	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
before	O
it	O
was	O
light	O
;	O
we	O
were	O
afraid	O
to	O
approach	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
daytime	O
for	O
fear	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
should	O
lie	O
there	O
for	O
us	O
,	O
it	O
being	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
careen	O
'd	O
lately	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
they	O
might	O
expect	O
us	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
ashore	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
had	O
been	O
there	O
to	O
seek	O
after	O
us	O
,	O
by	O
a	O
house	O
they	O
had	O
built	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
entertain	O
100	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
a	O
great	O
cross	O
before	O
the	O
doors	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
token	O
enough	O
that	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
did	O
expect	O
us	O
this	O
day	O
again	O
;	O
therefore	O
we	O
examined	O
our	O
prisoners	O
if	O
they	O
knew	O
anything	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
who	O
confessed	O
they	O
had	O
heard	O
of	O
a	O
periago	O
-LRB-	O
or	O
large	O
Canoa	PNM

that	O
rowed	O
with	O
14	O

river	O
on	O
the	O
Main	O
,	O
and	O
once	O
in	O
2	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
came	O
over	O
to	O

purposely	O
to	O
see	O
for	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
having	O

us	O

she	O
was	O
to	O
make	O
all	O

to	O
Panama	PNM
with	O
the	O
news	O
;	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
three	O
ships	O
ready	O
to	O
send	O
after	O
us	O

We	O
lay	O
here	O
all	O
the	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
scrubbed	O
our	O
new	O
bark	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
ever	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
chased	O
we	O
might	O
the	O
better	O
escape	O
:	O
we	O
filled	O
our	O
water	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
went	O
from	O
thence	O
,	O
having	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
south-west	O
a	O
brisk	O
gale	O
.	O

The	O
25th	O
day	O
we	O
had	O
much	O
wind	O
and	O
rain	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
lost	O
the	O
Canoa	PNM
that	O
had	O
been	O
cut	O
and	O
was	O
joined	O
together	O
;	O
we	O
would	O
have	O
kept	O
all	O
our	O
Canoas	O
to	O
carry	O
us	O
up	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
the	O
bark	O
not	O
being	O
so	O
convenient	O
.	O

The	O
27th	O
day	O
we	O
went	O
from	O
thence	O
with	O
a	O
moderate	O
gale	O
of	O
wind	O
at	O
south-west	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
we	O
had	O
excessive	O
showers	O
of	O
rain	O
.	O

The	O
28th	O
day	O
was	O
very	O
wet	O
all	O
the	O
morning	O
;	O
betwixt	O
10	O
and	O
11	O
it	O
cleared	O
up	O
and	O
we	O
saw	O
two	O
great	O
ships	O
about	O
a	O
league	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
of	O
us	O

we	O
being	O
then	O
two	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O

and	O
about	O
10	O
leagues	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
of	O
point	O
Garrachina	PNM

These	O
ships	O
had	O
been	O
cruising	O
between	O
Gorgonia	PNM
and	O
the	O
Gulf	O
6	O
months	O
;	O
but	O
whether	O
our	O
prisoners	O
did	O
know	O
it	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
tell	O

We	O
presently	O
furled	O
our	O
sails	O
and	O
rowed	O
in	O
close	O
under	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
knowing	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
cruisers	O
;	O
for	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
bound	O
to	O
Panama	PNM
this	O
wind	O
would	O
have	O
carried	O
them	O
thither	O
;	O
and	O
no	O
ships	O
bound	O
from	O
Panama	PNM
come	O
on	O
this	O

the	O
north	O

of	O
the	O

till	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
keys	O
of	O
Quibo	PNM
to	O
the	O
westward	O

and	O
then	O
if	O
they	O

The	O
glare	O
did	O
not	O
continue	O

again	O

and	O
kept	O
us	O
from	O
the	O

:	O
but	O
if	O
they	O
had	O

we	O
were	O

to	O
run	O
our	O

ashore	O

and	O
take	O
ourselves	O
to	O
the	O

for	O
we	O
knew	O
that	O
the	O

lived	O
in	O
these	O
parts	O
never	O
had	O
any	O
commerce	O
with	O

The	O
29th	O

at	O
9	O

we	O
likewise	O
kept	O
a	O

all	O
the	O

for	O

The	O
30th	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
at	O
8	O
a	O
Clock	O
we	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
Gulf	PNM
of	PNM
St.	PNM
Michael	PNM
's	PNM
mouth	PNM
;	O
for	O
we	O
put	O
from	O
point	O
Garrachina	PNM
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
designing	O
to	O
have	O
reached	O
the	O
islands	O
in	O
the	O
gulf	O
before	O
day	O
;	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
the	O
better	O
work	O
our	O
escape	O
from	O
our	O
enemies	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
should	O
find	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
waiting	O
to	O
stop	O
our	O
passage	O
.	O

About	O
9	O
a	O
Clock	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
a	O
mile	O
without	O
a	O
large	O
island	O
,	O
which	O
lies	O
4	O
miles	O
from	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
;	O
we	O
had	O
other	O
small	O
islands	O
without	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
have	O
gone	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
having	O
a	O
strong	O
tide	O
of	O
flood	O
,	O
but	O
would	O
not	O
adventure	O
farther	O
till	O
we	O
had	O
looked	O
well	O
about	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
immediately	O
sent	O
a	O
Canoa	O
ashore	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
saw	O
-LRB-	O
what	O
we	O
always	O
feared	O
-RRB-	O
a	O
ship	O
at	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
lying	O
close	O
by	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
large	O
tent	O
by	O
it	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
hard	O
task	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
escape	O
them	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
Canoa	PNM
came	O
aboard	O
with	O
this	O
news	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
were	O
a	O
little	O
disheartened	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
I	O
ever	O
expected	O
.	O

Our	O
care	O
was	O
now	O
to	O
get	O
safe	O
overland	O
,	O
seeing	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
land	O
here	O
according	O
to	O
our	O
desire	O
:	O
therefore	O
before	O
the	O
tide	O
of	O
flood	O
was	O
spent	O
we	O
manned	O
our	O
Canoa	PNM
and	O
rowed	O
again	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
the	O
enemy	O
was	O
yet	O
in	O
motion	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
ashore	O
we	O
dispersed	O
ourselves	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
island	O
to	O
prevent	O
our	O
enemies	O
from	O
coming	O
any	O
way	O
to	O
view	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
presently	O
after	O
high-water	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
small	O
Canoa	O
coming	O
over	O
from	O
the	O
ship	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
on	O
;	O
which	O
made	O
us	O
all	O
get	O
into	O
our	O
Canoa	O
and	O
wait	O
their	O
coming	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
lay	O
close	O
till	O
they	O
came	O
within	O
pistol-shot	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
being	O
ready	O
,	O
we	O
started	O
out	O
and	O
took	O
them	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
in	O
her	O
one	O
white	O
man	O
and	O
two	O
Indians	O
;	O
who	O
being	O
examined	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
which	O
we	O
saw	O
at	O
the	O
river	O
's	O
mouth	O
had	O
lain	O
there	O
six	O
months	O
,	O
guarding	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
waiting	O
for	O
our	O
coming	O
;	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
12	O
guns	O
and	O
150	O
seamen	O
and	O
soldiers	O
:	O
that	O
the	O
seamen	O
all	O
lay	O
aboard	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
soldiers	O
lay	O
ashore	O
in	O
their	O
tents	O
;	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
300	O
men	O
at	O
the	O
mines	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
all	O
small	O
arms	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
he	O
aboard	O
in	O
two	O
tides	O
'	O
time	O
.	O

They	O
likewise	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
two	O
ships	O
cruising	O
in	O
the	O
bay	O
between	O
this	O
place	O
and	O
Gorgonia	PNM
;	O
the	O
biggest	O
had	O
20	O
guns	O
and	O
200	O
men	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
10	O
guns	O
and	O
150	O
men	O
:	O
besides	O
all	O
this	O
they	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
the	O
Indians	O
on	O
this	O
side	O
the	O
country	O
were	O
our	O
enemies	O
;	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
worse	O
news	O
of	O
all	O
.	O

However	O
we	O
presently	O
brought	O
these	O
prisoners	O
aboard	O
and	O
got	O
under	O
sail	O
,	O
turning	O
out	O
with	O
the	O
tide	O
of	O
ebb	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
convenient	O
to	O
stay	O
longer	O
there	O
.	O

We	O
did	O
not	O
long	O
consider	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
;	O
but	O
intended	O
to	O
land	O
that	O
night	O
or	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
betimes	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
question	O
but	O
we	O
should	O
either	O
get	O
a	O
good	O
commerce	O
with	O
the	O
Indians	O
by	O
such	O
toys	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
purposely	O
brought	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
or	O
else	O
force	O
our	O
way	O
through	O
their	O
country	O
in	O
spite	O
of	O
all	O
their	O
opposition	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
fear	O
what	O
these	O
Spaniards	O
could	O
do	O
against	O
us	O
in	O
case	O
they	O
should	O
land	O
and	O
come	O
after	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
strong	O
southerly	O
wind	O
which	O
blew	O
right	O
in	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
the	O
tide	O
of	O
ebb	O
being	O
far	O
spent	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
turn	O
out	O
.	O

I	O
persuaded	O
them	O
to	O
run	O
into	O
the	O
river	PNM
of	PNM
Congo	PNM
,	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
large	O
river	O
about	O
three	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
island	O
where	O
we	O
lay	O
;	O
which	O
with	O
a	O
southerly	O
wind	O
we	O
could	O
have	O
done	O
:	O
and	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
got	O
so	O
high	O
as	O
the	O
tide	O
flows	O
,	O
then	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
landed	O
.	O

But	O
all	O
the	O
arguments	O
I	O
could	O
use	O
were	O
not	O
of	O
force	O
sufficient	O
to	O
convince	O
them	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
large	O
river	O
so	O
near	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
would	O
land	O
somewhere	O
,	O
they	O
neither	O
did	O
know	O
how	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
nor	O
when	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
rowed	O
and	O
towed	O
against	O
the	O
wind	O
all	O
night	O
we	O
just	O
got	O
about	O
Cape	PNM
St.	PNM
Lorenzo	PNM
in	O
the	O
morning	O
;	O
and	O
sailed	O
about	O
4	O
miles	O
farther	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
,	O
and	O
run	O
into	O
a	O
small	O
creek	O
within	O
two	O
keys	O
,	O
or	O
little	O
islands	O
,	O
and	O
rowed	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
the	O
creek	O
,	O
being	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
we	O
landed	O
May	O

We	O
got	O
out	O
all	O
our	O
provision	O
and	O
clothes	O
and	O
then	O
sunk	O
our	O
vessel	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
were	O
landing	O
and	O
fixing	O
our	O
snap-sacks	O
to	O
march	O
our	O
Moskito	O
Indians	O
struck	O
a	O
plentiful	O
dish	O
of	O
fish	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
immediately	O
dressed	O
,	O
and	O
therewith	O
satisfied	O
our	O
hunger	O
.	O

Having	O
made	O
mention	O
of	O
the	O
Moskito	O
Indians	O
it	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
amiss	O
to	O
conclude	O
this	O
chapter	O
with	O
a	O
short	O
account	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
tall	O
,	O
well	O
made	O
,	O
raw-boned	O
,	O
lusty	O
,	O
strong	O

and	O
nimble	O
of	O

lank	O
black	O
hair	O

stern	O
,	O
hard	O
favoured	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
a	O
dark	O
copper-colour	O
complexion	O

They	O
are	O
but	O
a	O
small	O
nation	O
or	O
family	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
100	O
men	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
number	O

inhabiting	O
on	O
the	O
Main	O
on	O
the	O

near	O
Cape	PNM
Gratia	PNM
Dios	PNM
;	O
between	O
Cape	PNM
Honduras	PNM
and	O
Nicaragua	PNM

They	O
are	O
very	O
ingenious	O
at	O
throwing	O
the	O
lance	O
,	O
fishgig	O
,	O
harpoon	O
,	O
or	O
any	O
manner	O
of	O
dart	O
,	O
being	O
bred	O
to	O
it	O
from	O
their	O
infancy	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
children	O
,	O
imitating	O
their	O
parents	O
,	O
never	O
go	O
abroad	O
without	O
a	O
lance	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
throw	O
at	O
any	O
object	O
,	O
till	O
use	O
has	O
made	O
them	O
masters	O
of	O
the	O
art	O
.	O

Then	O
they	O
learn	O
to	O
put	O
by	O
a	O
lance	O
,	O
arrow	O
,	O
or	O
dart	O
:	O
the	O
manner	O
is	O
thus	O
.	O

Two	O
boys	O
stand	O
at	O
a	O
small	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
dart	O
a	O
blunt	O
stick	O
at	O
one	O
another	O
;	O
each	O
of	O
them	O
holding	O
a	O
small	O
stick	O
in	O
his	O
right	O
hand	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
he	O
strikes	O
away	O
that	O
which	O
was	O
darted	O
at	O
him	O
.	O

As	O
they	O
grow	O
in	O
years	O
they	O
become	O
more	O
dexterous	O
and	O
courageous	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
they	O
will	O
stand	O
a	O
fair	O
mark	O
to	O
anyone	O
that	O
will	O
shoot	O
arrows	O
at	O
them	O
;	O
which	O
they	O
will	O
put	O
by	O
with	O
a	O
very	O
small	O
stick	O
,	O
no	O
bigger	O
than	O
the	O
rod	O
of	O
a	O
fowling-piece	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
are	O
grown	O
to	O
be	O
men	O
they	O
will	O
guard	O
themselves	O
from	O
arrows	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
come	O
very	O
thick	O
at	O
them	O
,	O
provided	O
two	O
do	O
not	O
happen	O
to	O
come	O
at	O
once	O

They	O
have	O
extraordinary	O
good	O
eyes	O

and	O
will	O
descry	O
a	O
sail	O
at	O
sea	O
farther	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
anything	O
better	O
,	O
than	O
we	O

Their	O
chiefest	O
employment	O
in	O
their	O
own	O
country	O
is	O
to	O
strike	O
fish	O

turtle	O

,	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
which	O
I	O

For	O
this	O
they	O
are	O
esteemed	O
and	O
coveted	O
by	O
all	O
privateers	O
;	O
for	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
ship	O
will	O
maintain	O
100	O
men	O
:	O
so	O
that	O
when	O
we	O
careen	O
our	O
ships	O
we	O
choose	O
commonly	O
such	O
places	O
where	O
there	O
is	O
plenty	O
of	O
turtle	O
or	O
manatee	O
for	O
these	O
Moskito	O
men	O
to	O
strike	O
:	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
rare	O
to	O
find	O
privateers	O
destitute	O
of	O
one	O
or	O
more	O
of	O
them	O
when	O
the	O
commander	O
or	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
are	O
English	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
love	O
the	O
French	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
they	O
hate	O
mortally	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
come	O
among	O
privateers	O
,	O
they	O
get	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
guns	O
,	O
and	O
prove	O
very	O
good	O
marksmen	O
:	O
they	O
behave	O
themselves	O
very	O
bold	O
in	O
fight	O
,	O
and	O
never	O
seem	O
to	O
flinch	O
nor	O
hang	O
back	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
white	O
men	O
with	O
whom	O
they	O
are	O
know	O
better	O
than	O
they	O
do	O
when	O
it	O
is	O
best	O
to	O
fight	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
let	O
the	O
disadvantage	O
of	O
their	O
party	O
be	O
never	O
so	O
great	O
,	O
they	O
will	O
never	O
yield	O
nor	O
give	O
back	O
while	O
any	O
of	O
their	O
party	O
stand	O
.	O

I	O
could	O
never	O
perceive	O
any	O
religion	O
nor	O
any	O
ceremonies	O
or	O
superstitious	O
observations	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
being	O
ready	O
to	O
imitate	O
us	O
in	O
whatsoever	O
they	O
saw	O
us	O
do	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
.	O

Only	O
they	O
seem	O
to	O
fear	O
the	O
devil	O
,	O
whom	O
they	O
call	O
Wallesaw	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
say	O
he	O
often	O
appears	O
to	O
some	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
whom	O
our	O
men	O
commonly	O
call	O
their	O
priest	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
desire	O
to	O
speak	O
with	O
him	O
on	O
urgent	O
business	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
rest	O
know	O
not	O
anything	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
nor	O
how	O
he	O
appears	O
,	O
otherwise	O
than	O
as	O
these	O
priests	O
tell	O
them	O
.	O

Yet	O
they	O
all	O
say	O
they	O
must	O
not	O
anger	O
him	O
,	O
for	O
then	O
he	O
will	O
beat	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
sometimes	O
he	O
carries	O
away	O
these	O
their	O
priests	O
.	O

Thus	O
much	O
I	O
have	O
heard	O
from	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
who	O
speak	O
good	O
English	O

They	O
marry	O
but	O
one	O

with	O
whom	O
they	O
live	O
till	O
death	O
separates	O
them	O

At	O
their	O
first	O

together	O
the	O

makes	O
a	O
very	O
small	O

Being	O
landed	O
May	O
the	O
1st	O
,	O
we	O
began	O
our	O
march	O
about	O
3	O
a	O
Clock	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
directing	O
our	O
course	O
by	O
our	O
pocket	O
compasses	O
north-east	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
gone	O
about	O
2	O
miles	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
foot	O
of	O
a	O
hill	O
where	O
we	O
built	O
small	O
huts	O
and	O
lay	O
all	O
night	O
;	O
having	O
excessive	O
rains	O
till	O
12	O
a	O
clock	O
.	O

The	O
2nd	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
having	O
fair	O
weather	O
we	O
ascended	O
the	O
hill	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
a	O
small	O
Indian	O
path	O
which	O
we	O
followed	O
till	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
run	O
too	O
much	O
easterly	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
doubting	O
it	O
would	O
carry	O
us	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
we	O
climbed	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
highest	O
trees	O
on	O
the	O
hill	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
not	O
meanly	O
furnished	O
with	O
as	O
large	O
and	O
tall	O
trees	O
as	O
ever	O
I	O
saw	O
:	O
at	O
length	O
we	O
discovered	O
some	O
houses	O
in	O
a	O
valley	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
being	O
steep	O
could	O
not	O
descend	O
on	O
that	O
side	O
,	O
but	O
followed	O
the	O
small	O
path	O
which	O
led	O
us	O
down	O
the	O
hill	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
presently	O
found	O
several	O
other	O
Indian	O
houses	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
that	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
at	O
the	O
foot	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
had	O
none	O
but	O
women	O
at	O
home	O
who	O
could	O
not	O
speak	O
Spanish	O
,	O
but	O
gave	O
each	O
of	O
us	O
a	O
good	O
calabash	O
or	O
shell-full	O
of	O
corn-drink	O
.	O

The	O
other	O
houses	O
had	O
some	O
men	O
at	O
home	O
,	O
but	O
none	O
that	O
spoke	O
Spanish	O
;	O
yet	O
we	O
made	O
a	O
shift	O
to	O
buy	O
such	O
food	O
as	O
their	O
houses	O
or	O
plantations	O
afforded	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
dressed	O
and	O
ate	O
all	O
together	O
;	O
having	O
all	O
sorts	O
of	O
our	O
provision	O
in	O
common	O
,	O
because	O
none	O
should	O
live	O
better	O
than	O
others	O
,	O
or	O
pay	O
dearer	O
for	O
anything	O
than	O
it	O
was	O
worth	O
.	O

This	O
day	O
we	O
had	O
marched	O
6	O
mile	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
the	O
husbands	O
of	O
those	O
women	O
came	O
home	O
and	O
told	O
us	O
in	O
broken	O
Spanish	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
on	O
board	O
of	O
the	O
guard-ship	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
fled	O
from	O
two	O
days	O
before	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
not	O
above	O
3	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
Congo	PNM
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
go	O
from	O
thence	O
aboard	O
the	O
guard-ship	O
in	O
half	O
a	O
tide	O
's	O
time	O
.	O

This	O
evening	O
we	O
supped	O
plentifully	O
on	O
fowls	O
and	O
peccary	O
;	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
wild	O
hogs	O
which	O
we	O
bought	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
;	O
yams	O
,	O
potatoes	O
,	O
and	O
plantains	O
served	O
us	O
for	O
bread	O
,	O
whereof	O
we	O
had	O
enough	O
.	O

After	O
supper	O
we	O
agreed	O
with	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
Indians	O
to	O
guide	O
us	O
a	O
day	O
's	O
march	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
towards	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
;	O
he	O
was	O
to	O
have	O
for	O
his	O
pains	O
a	O
hatchet	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
bargain	O
was	O
to	O
bring	O
us	O
to	O
a	O
certain	O
Indian	O
's	O
habitation	O
,	O
who	O
could	O
speak	O
Spanish	O
,	O
from	O
whom	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
hopes	O
to	O
be	O
better	O
satisfied	O
of	O
our	O
journey	O
.	O

The	O
3rd	O
day	O
having	O
fair	O
weather	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
stir	O
betimes	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
out	O
between	O
6	O
and	O
7	O
a	O
clock	O
,	O
marching	O
through	O
several	O
old	O
ruined	O
plantations	O
.	O

This	O
morning	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
being	O
tired	O
gave	O
us	O
the	O
slip	O
.	O

By	O
12	O
a	O
clock	O
we	O
had	O
gone	O
8	O
mile	O
,	O
and	O
arrived	O
at	O
the	O
Indian	O
's	O
house	O
,	O
who	O
lived	O
on	O
the	O
bank	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
Congo	PNM
and	O
spoke	O
very	O
good	O
Spanish	O
;	O
to	O
whom	O
we	O
declared	O
the	O
reason	O
of	O
this	O
visit	O
.	O

At	O
first	O
he	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
dubious	O
of	O
entertaining	O
any	O
discourse	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
impertinent	O
answers	O
to	O
the	O
questions	O
that	O
we	O
demanded	O
of	O
him	O
;	O
he	O
told	O
us	O
he	O
knew	O
no	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
carry	O
us	O
to	O
Cheapo	PNM
,	O
or	O
Santa	PNM
Maria	PNM
,	O
which	O
we	O
knew	O
to	O
be	O
Spanish	O
garrisons	O
;	O
the	O
one	O
lying	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
:	O
either	O
of	O
them	O
at	O
least	O
20	O
miles	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
way	O
.	O

We	O
could	O
get	O
no	O
other	O
answer	O
from	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
his	O
discourse	O
was	O
in	O
such	O
an	O
angry	O
tone	O
as	O
plainly	O
declared	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
our	O
friend	O
.	O

However	O
we	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
virtue	O
of	O
necessity	O
and	O
humour	O
him	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
neither	O
time	O
nor	O
place	O
to	O
be	O
angry	O
with	O
the	O
Indians	O
;	O
all	O
our	O
lives	O
lying	O
in	O
their	O
hand	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
now	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
loss	O
,	O
not	O
knowing	O
what	O
course	O
to	O
take	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
tempted	O
him	O
with	O
beads	O
,	O
money	O
,	O
hatchets	O
,	O
machetes	O
,	O
or	O
long	O
knives	O
;	O
but	O
nothing	O
would	O
work	O
on	O
him	O
,	O
till	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
took	O
a	O
sky-coloured	O
petticoat	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
bag	O
and	O
put	O
it	O
on	O
his	O
wife	O
;	O
who	O
was	O
so	O
much	O
pleased	O
with	O
the	O
present	O
that	O
she	O
immediately	O
began	O
to	O
chatter	O
to	O
her	O
husband	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
brought	O
him	O
into	O
a	O
better	O
humour	O
.	O

He	O
could	O
then	O
tell	O
us	O
that	O
he	O
knew	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
have	O
gone	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
cut	O
his	O
foot	O
two	O
days	O
before	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
him	O
incapable	O
of	O
serving	O
us	O
himself	O
:	O
but	O
he	O
would	O
take	O
care	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
not	O
want	O
a	O
guide	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
he	O
hired	O
the	O
same	O
Indian	O
who	O
brought	O
us	O
hither	O
to	O
conduct	O
us	O
two	O
days	O
'	O
march	O
further	O
for	O
another	O
hatchet	O
.	O

The	O
old	O
man	O
would	O
have	O
stayed	O
us	O
here	O
all	O
the	O
day	O
because	O
it	O
rained	O
very	O
hard	O
;	O
but	O
our	O

required	O
more	O
haste	O
,	O
our	O
enemies	O
lying	O
so	O
near	O
us	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
go	O
from	O
his	O
house	O
aboard	O
the	O
guard-ship	O
in	O
a	O
tide	O
's	O
time	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
4th	O
day	O
since	O
they	O
saw	O
us	O
.	O

So	O
we	O
marched	O
3	O
miles	O
farther	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
built	O
huts	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
stayed	O
all	O
night	O
;	O
it	O
rained	O
all	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
greatest	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
night	O

The	O
4th	O
day	O
we	O
began	O
our	O
march	O
betimes	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
forenoons	O
were	O
commonly	O
fair	O
,	O
but	O
much	O
rain	O
after	O
noon	O
:	O
though	O
whether	O
it	O
rained	O
or	O
shined	O
it	O
was	O
much	O
at	O
one	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
verily	O
believe	O
we	O
crossed	O
the	O
rivers	O
30	O
times	O
this	O
day	O
:	O
the	O
Indians	O
having	O
no	O
paths	O
to	O
travel	O
from	O
one	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
to	O
another	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
guided	O
themselves	O
by	O
the	O
rivers	O
.	O

We	O
marched	O
this	O
day	O
12	O
miles	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
built	O
our	O
hut	O
,	O
and	O
lay	O
down	O
to	O
sleep	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
always	O
kept	O
two	O
men	O
on	O
the	O
watch	O
;	O
otherwise	O
our	O
own	O
slaves	O
might	O
have	O
knocked	O
us	O
on	O
the	O
head	O
while	O
we	O
slept	O
.	O

It	O
rained	O
violently	O
all	O
the	O
afternoon	O
and	O
most	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
night	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
much	O
ado	O
to	O
kindle	O
a	O
fire	O
this	O
evening	O
:	O
our	O
huts	O
were	O
but	O
very	O
mean	O
or	O
ordinary	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
fire	O
small	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
dry	O
our	O
clothes	O
,	O
scarce	O
warm	O
ourselves	O
,	O
and	O
no	O
sort	O
of	O
food	O
for	O
the	O
belly	O
;	O
all	O
which	O
made	O
it	O
very	O
hard	O
with	O
us	O
.	O

I	O
confess	O
these	O
hardships	O
quite	O
expelled	O
the	O
thoughts	O
of	O
an	O
enemy	O
,	O
for	O
now	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
4	O
days	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
have	O
but	O
few	O
other	O
cares	O
than	O
how	O
to	O
get	O
guides	O
and	O
food	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
were	O
seldom	O
in	O
our	O
thoughts	O
.	O

The	O
5th	O
day	O
we	O
set	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
betimes	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
travelled	O
7	O
miles	O
in	O
those	O
wild	O
pathless	O
woods	O
,	O
by	O
10	O
a	O
clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
we	O
arrived	O
at	O
a	O
young	O
Spanish	O
Indian	O
's	O
house	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
formerly	O
lived	O
with	O
the	O
Bishop	O
of	O
Panama	PNM
.	O

The	O
young	O
Indian	O
was	O
very	O
brisk	O
,	O
spoke	O
very	O
good	O
Spanish	O
,	O
and	O
received	O
us	O
very	O
kindly	O
.	O

This	O
plantation	O
afforded	O
us	O
store	O
of	O
provisions	O
,	O
yams	O
,	O
and	O
potatoes	O
,	O
but	O
nothing	O
of	O
any	O
flesh	O
besides	O
2	O
fat	O
monkeys	O
we	O
shot	O
,	O
part	O
whereof	O
we	O
distributed	O
to	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
company	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
weak	O
and	O
sickly	O
;	O
for	O
others	O
we	O
got	O
eggs	O
and	O
such	O
refreshments	O
as	O
the	O
Indians	O
had	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
still	O
provided	O
for	O
the	O
sick	O
and	O
weak	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
Spanish	O
Indian	O
in	O
our	O
company	O
,	O
who	O
first	O
took	O
up	O
arms	O
with	O
Captain	O
Sawkins	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
been	O
with	O
us	O
ever	O
since	O
his	O
death	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
persuaded	O
to	O
live	O
here	O
by	O
the	O
master	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
,	O
who	O
promised	O
him	O
his	O
sister	O
in	O
marriage	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
be	O
assistant	O
to	O
him	O
in	O
clearing	O
a	O
plantation	O
:	O
but	O
we	O
would	O
not	O
consent	O
to	O
part	O
from	O
him	O
here	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
some	O
treachery	O
,	O
but	O
promised	O
to	O
release	O
him	O
in	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
certainly	O
out	O
of	O
danger	O
of	O
our	O
enemies	O
.	O

We	O
stayed	O
here	O
all	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
and	O
dried	O
our	O
clothes	O
and	O
ammunition	O
,	O
cleared	O
our	O
guns	O
,	O
and	O
provided	O
ourselves	O
for	O
a	O
march	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
.	O

Our	O
surgeon	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Wafer	O
,	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
sad	O
disaster	O
here	O
:	O
being	O
drying	O
his	O
powder	O
,	O
a	O
careless	O
fellow	O
passed	O
by	O
with	O
his	O
pipe	O
lighted	O
and	O
set	O
fire	O
to	O
his	O
powder	O
,	O
which	O
blew	O
up	O
and	O
scorched	O
his	O
knee	O
,	O
and	O
reduced	O
him	O
to	O
that	O
condition	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
march	O
;	O
wherefore	O
we	O
allowed	O
him	O
a	O
slave	O
to	O
carry	O
his	O
things	O
,	O
being	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
the	O
more	O
concerned	O
at	O
the	O
accident	O
,	O
because	O
liable	O
ourselves	O
every	O
moment	O
to	O
misfortune	O
,	O
and	O
none	O
to	O
look	O
after	O
us	O
but	O
him	O
.	O

This	O
Indian	O
plantation	O
was	O
seated	O
on	O
the	O
bank	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
Congo	PNM
,	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
fat	O
soil	O
,	O
and	O
thus	O
far	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
come	O
in	O
our	O
Canoa	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
persuaded	O
them	O
to	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
6th	O
day	O
we	O
set	O
out	O
again	O
,	O
having	O
hired	O
another	O
guide	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
first	O
crossed	O
the	O
river	O
Congo	PNM
in	O
a	O
Canoa	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
from	O
our	O
first	O
landing	O
on	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
being	O
over	O
,	O
we	O
marched	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
two	O
miles	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
another	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
forded	O
several	O
times	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
deep	O
.	O

Two	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
were	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
keep	O
company	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
came	O
after	O
us	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
able	O
.	O

The	O
last	O
time	O
we	O
forded	O
the	O
river	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
deep	O
that	O
our	O
tallest	O
men	O
stood	O
in	O
the	O
deepest	O
place	O
and	O
handed	O
the	O
sick	O
,	O
weak	O
and	O
short	O
men	O
;	O
by	O
which	O
means	O
we	O
all	O
got	O
over	O
safe	O
,	O
except	O
those	O
two	O
who	O
were	O
behind	O
.	O

Foreseeing	O
a	O
necessity	O
of	O
wading	O
through	O
rivers	O
frequently	O
in	O
our	O
land-march	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
care	O
before	O
I	O
left	O
the	O
ship	O
to	O
provide	O
myself	O
a	O
large	O
joint	O
of	O
bamboo	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
stopped	O
at	O
both	O
ends	O
,	O
closing	O
it	O
with	O
wax	O
,	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
keep	O
out	O
any	O
water	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
I	O
preserved	O
my	O
journal	O
and	O
other	O
writings	O
from	O
being	O
wet	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
was	O
often	O
forced	O
to	O
swim	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
were	O
over	O
this	O
river	O
,	O
we	O
sat	O
down	O
to	O
wait	O
the	O
coming	O
of	O
our	O
consorts	O
who	O
were	O
left	O
behind	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
they	O
came	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
river	O
by	O
that	O
time	O
was	O
so	O
high	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
over	O
it	O
,	O
neither	O
could	O
we	O
help	O
them	O
over	O
,	O
but	O
bid	O
them	O
be	O
of	O
good	O
comfort	O
,	O
and	O
stay	O
till	O
the	O
river	O
did	O
fall	O
:	O
but	O
we	O
marched	O
two	O
miles	O
farther	O
by	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
built	O
our	O
huts	O
,	O
having	O
gone	O
this	O
day	O
six	O
miles	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
scarce	O
finished	O
our	O
huts	O
before	O
the	O
river	O
rose	O
much	O
higher	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
overflowing	O
the	O
banks	O
,	O
obliged	O
us	O
to	O
remove	O
into	O
higher	O
ground	O
:	O
but	O
the	O
next	O
night	O
came	O
on	O
before	O
we	O
could	O
build	O
more	O
huts	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
lay	O
straggling	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
some	O
under	O
one	O
tree	O
,	O
some	O
under	O
another	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
find	O
conveniency	O
,	O
which	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
indifferent	O
comfortable	O
if	O
the	O
weather	O
had	O
been	O
fair	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
greatest	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
night	O
we	O
had	O
extraordinary	O
hard	O
rain	O
,	O
with	O
much	O
lightning	O
,	O
and	O
terrible	O
claps	O
of	O
thunder	O
.	O

These	O
hardships	O
and	O
inconveniencies	O
made	O
us	O
all	O
careless	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
watch	O
kept	O
-LRB-	O
though	O
I	O
believe	O
nobody	O
did	O
sleep	O
-RRB-	O
so	O
our	O
slaves	O
,	O
taking	O
the	O
opportunity	O
,	O
went	O
away	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
;	O
all	O
but	O
one	O
who	O
was	O
hid	O
in	O
some	O
hole	O
and	O
knew	O
nothing	O
of	O
their	O
design	O
,	O
or	O
else	O
fell	O
asleep	O
.	O

Those	O
that	O
went	O
away	O
carried	O
with	O
them	O
our	O
surgeon	O
's	O
gun	O
and	O
all	O
his	O
money	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
being	O
the	O
8th	O
day	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
river	O
's	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
it	O
much	O
fallen	O
;	O
and	O
here	O
our	O
guide	O
would	O
have	O
us	O
ford	O
it	O
again	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
being	O
deep	O
and	O
the	O
current	O
running	O
swift	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
.	O

Then	O
we	O
contrived	O
to	O
swim	O
over	O
;	O
those	O
that	O
could	O
not	O
swim	O
we	O
were	O
resolved	O
to	O
help	O
over	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
:	O
but	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
feasible	O
:	O
for	O
we	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
all	O
our	O
things	O
over	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
we	O
concluded	O
to	O
send	O
one	O
man	O
over	O
with	O
a	O
line	O
,	O
who	O
should	O
haul	O
over	O
all	O
our	O
things	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
get	O
the	O
men	O
over	O
.	O

This	O
being	O
agreed	O
on	O
,	O
one	O
George	O
Gayny	O
took	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
a	O
line	O
and	O
made	O
it	O
fast	O
about	O
his	O
neck	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
the	O
other	O
end	O
ashore	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
man	O
stood	O
by	O
the	O
line	O
to	O
clear	O
it	O
away	O
to	O
him	O
.	O

But	O
when	O
Gayny	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
midst	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
the	O
,	O
line	O
in	O
drawing	O
after	O
him	O
,	O
chanced	O
to	O
kink	O
or	O
grow	O
entangled	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
that	O
stood	O
by	O
to	O
clear	O
it	O
away	O
stopped	O
the	O
line	O
,	O
which	O
turned	O
Gayny	O
on	O
his	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
that	O
had	O
the	O
line	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
threw	O
it	O
all	O
into	O
the	O
river	O
after	O
him	O
,	O
thinking	O
he	O
might	O
recover	O
himself	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
stream	O
running	O
very	O
swift	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
man	O
having	O
three	O
hundred	O
dollars	O
at	O
his	O
back	O
,	O
was	O
carried	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
never	O
seen	O
more	O
by	O
us	O
.	O

Those	O
two	O
men	O
whom	O
we	O
left	O
behind	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
,	O
told	O
us	O
afterwards	O
that	O
they	O
found	O
him	O
lying	O
dead	O
in	O
a	O
creek	O
where	O
the	O
eddy	O
had	O
driven	O
him	O
ashore	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
money	O
on	O
his	O
back	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
meddled	O
not	O
with	O
any	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
being	O
only	O
in	O
care	O
how	O
to	O
work	O
their	O
way	O
through	O
a	O
wild	O
unknown	O
country	O
.	O

This	O
put	O
a	O
period	O
to	O
that	O
contrivance	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
fourth	O
man	O
that	O
we	O
lost	O
in	O
this	O
land-journey	O
;	O
for	O
these	O
two	O
men	O
that	O
we	O
left	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
did	O
not	O
come	O
to	O
us	O
till	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
North	O
Seas	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
yielded	O
them	O
also	O
for	O
lost	O
.	O

Being	O
frustrated	O
at	O
getting	O
over	O
the	O
river	O
this	O
way	O
,	O
we	O
looked	O
about	O
for	O
a	O
tree	O
to	O
fell	O
across	O
the	O
river	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
we	O
found	O
one	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
cut	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
reached	O
clear	O
over	O
:	O
on	O
this	O
we	O
passed	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
small	O
plantain-walk	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
soon	O
ransacked	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
were	O
busy	O
getting	O
plantains	O
our	O

was	O
gone	O

hours	O
came	O
to	O
us	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
with	O
him	O
an	O
old	O
Indian	O
to	O
whom	O
he	O
delivered	O
up	O
his	O
charge	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
hatchet	O
and	O
dismissed	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
entered	O
ourselves	O
under	O
the	O
conduct	O
of	O
our	O
new	O
guide	O
:	O
who	O
immediately	O
led	O
us	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
crossed	O
another	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
entered	O
into	O
a	O
large	O
valley	O
of	O
the	O
fattest	O
land	O
I	O
did	O
ever	O
take	O
notice	O
of	O
;	O
the	O
trees	O
were	O
not	O
very	O
thick	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
largest	O
that	O
I	O
saw	O
in	O
all	O
my	O
travels	O
;	O
we	O
saw	O
great	O
tracks	O
which	O
were	O
made	O
by	O
the	O
peccaries	O
,	O
but	O
saw	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
marched	O
in	O
this	O
pleasant	O
country	O
till	O
3	O
a	O
clock	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
in	O
all	O
about	O
4	O
miles	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
arrived	O
at	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
's	O
country	O
house	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
only	O
a	O
habitation	O
for	O
hunting	O
:	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
small	O
plantain-walk	O
,	O
some	O
yams	O
,	O
and	O
potatoes	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
took	O
up	O
our	O
quarters	O
for	O
this	O
day	O
and	O
refreshed	O
ourselves	O
with	O
such	O
food	O
as	O
the	O
place	O
afforded	O
,	O
and	O
dried	O
our	O
clothes	O
and	O
ammunition	O
.	O

At	O
this	O
place	O
our	O
young	O
Spanish	O
Indian	O
provided	O
to	O
leave	O
us	O
,	O
for	O
now	O
we	O
thought	O
ourselves	O
past	O
danger	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
he	O
that	O
was	O
persuaded	O
to	O
stay	O
at	O
the	O
last	O
house	O
we	O
came	O
from	O
,	O
to	O
marry	O
the	O
young	O
man	O
's	O
sister	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
dismissed	O
him	O
according	O
to	O
our	O
promise	O
.	O

The	O
9th	O
day	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
conducted	O
us	O
towards	O
his	O
own	O
habitation	O
.	O

We	O
marched	O
about	O
5	O
miles	O
in	O
this	O
valley	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
ascended	O
a	O
hill	O
and	O
travelled	O
about	O
5	O
miles	O
farther	O
over	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
small	O
hills	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
any	O
settlement	O
.	O

Half	O
a	O
mile	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
plantations	O
we	O
light	O
of	O
a	O
path	O
,	O
which	O
carried	O
us	O
to	O
the	O
Indians	O
habitations	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
many	O
wooden	O
crosses	O
erected	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
which	O
created	O
some	O
jealousy	O
in	O
us	O
that	O
here	O
were	O
some	O
Spaniards	O
:	O
therefore	O
we	O
new-primed	O
all	O
our	O
guns	O
,	O
and	O
provided	O
ourselves	O
for	O
an	O
enemy	O
;	O
but	O
coming	O
into	O
the	O
town	O
found	O
none	O
but	O
Indians	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
all	O
got	O
together	O
in	O
a	O
large	O
house	O
to	O
receive	O
us	O
:	O
for	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
had	O
a	O
little	O
boy	O
with	O
him	O
that	O
he	O
sent	O
before	O
.	O

They	O
made	O
us	O
welcome	O
to	O
such	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
very	O
mean	O
;	O
for	O
these	O
were	O
new	O
plantations	O
,	O
the	O
corn	O
being	O
not	O
eared	O
.	O

Potatoes	O
,	O
yams	O
,	O
and	O
plantains	O
they	O
had	O
none	O
but	O
what	O
they	O
brought	O
from	O
their	O
old	O
plantations	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
spoke	O
good	O
Spanish	O
:	O
two	O
young	O
men	O
could	O
speak	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
it	O
caused	O
us	O
to	O
take	O
more	O
notice	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

To	O
these	O
we	O
made	O
a	O
present	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
them	O
to	O
get	O
us	O
a	O
guide	O
to	O
conduct	O
us	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
,	O
or	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
promised	O
to	O
do	O
themselves	O
;	O
if	O
we	O
would	O
reward	O
them	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
told	O
us	O
we	O
must	O
lie	O
still	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
thought	O
ourselves	O
nearer	O
the	O
North	O
Sea	O
than	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
and	O
proposed	O
to	O
go	O
without	O
a	O
guide	O
rather	O
than	O
stay	O
here	O
a	O
whole	O
day	O
:	O
however	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
who	O
were	O
tired	O
resolved	O
to	O
stay	O
behind	O
;	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Wafer	O
our	O
surgeon	O
,	O
who	O
marched	O
in	O
great	O
pain	O
ever	O
since	O
his	O
knee	O
was	O
burned	O
with	O
powder	O
,	O
was	O
resolved	O
to	O
stay	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
10th	O
day	O
we	O
got	O
up	O
betimes	O
,	O
resolving	O
to	O
march	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
Indians	O
opposed	O
it	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
seeing	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
persuade	O
us	O
to	O
stay	O
,	O
they	O
came	O
with	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
taken	O
leave	O
of	O
our	O
friends	O
,	O
we	O
set	O
out	O
.	O

Here	O
therefore	O
we	O
left	O
the	O
surgeon	O
and	O
two	O
more	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
said	O
,	O
and	O
marched	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
following	O
our	O
guides	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
often	O
looked	O
on	O
our	O
pocket	O
compasses	O
and	O
showed	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
guides	O
,	O
pointing	O
at	O
the	O
way	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
go	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
them	O
shake	O
their	O
heads	O
and	O
say	O
they	O
were	O
pretty	O
things	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
convenient	O
for	O
us	O
.	O

After	O
we	O
had	O
descended	O
the	O
hills	O
on	O
which	O
the	O
town	O
stood	O
we	O
came	O
down	O
into	O
a	O
valley	O
,	O
and	O
guided	O
ourselves	O
by	O
a	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
crossed	O
22	O
times	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
marched	O
9	O
miles	O
,	O
we	O
built	O
huts	O
and	O
lay	O
there	O
all	O
night	O
:	O
this	O
evening	O
I	O
killed	O
a	O
quaum	O
,	O
a	O
large	O
bird	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
a	O
turkey	O
,	O
wherewith	O
we	O
treated	O
our	O
guides	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
brought	O
no	O
provision	O
with	O
us	O
.	O

This	O
night	O
our	O
last	O
slave	O
ran	O
away	O
.	O

The	O
eleventh	O
day	O
we	O
marched	O
10	O
mile	O
farther	O
,	O
and	O
built	O
huts	O
at	O
night	O
;	O
but	O
went	O
supperless	O
to	O
bed	O
.	O

The	O
twelfth	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
we	O
crossed	O
a	O
deep	O
river	O
,	O
passing	O
over	O
it	O
on	O
a	O
tree	O
,	O
and	O
marched	O
7	O
mile	O
in	O
a	O
low	O
swampy	O
ground	O
;	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
a	O
great	O
deep	O
river	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
over	O
.	O

We	O
built	O
huts	O
upon	O
its	O
banks	O
and	O
lay	O
there	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
upon	O
our	O
barbecues	O
,	O
or	O
frames	O
of	O
sticks	O
raised	O
about	O
3	O
foot	O
from	O
the	O
ground	O
.	O

The	O
thirteenth	O
day	O
when	O
we	O
turned	O
out	O
the	O
river	O
had	O
overflowed	O
its	O
banks	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
2	O
foot	O
deep	O
in	O
our	O
huts	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
guides	O
went	O
from	O
us	O
,	O
not	O
telling	O
us	O
their	O
intent	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
us	O
think	O
they	O
were	O
returned	O
home	O
again	O
.	O

Now	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
repent	O
our	O
haste	O
in	O
coming	O
from	O
the	O
settlements	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
food	O
since	O
we	O
came	O
from	O
thence	O
.	O

Indeed	O
we	O
got	O
macaw-berries	O
in	O
this	O
place	O
,	O
wherewith	O
we	O
satisfied	O
ourselves	O
this	O
day	O
though	O
coarsely	O
.	O

The	O
fourteenth	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
betimes	O
our	O
guides	O
came	O
to	O
us	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
the	O
waters	O
being	O
fallen	O
within	O
their	O
bounds	O
,	O
they	O
carried	O
us	O
to	O
a	O
tree	O
that	O
stood	O
on	O
the	O
bank	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
us	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
fell	O
that	O
tree	O
across	O
it	O
we	O
might	O
pass	O
:	O
if	O
not	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
pass	O
no	O
farther	O
.	O

Therefore	O
we	O
set	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
axe-men	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
,	O
who	O
felled	O
it	O
exactly	O
across	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
boughs	O
just	O
reached	O
over	O
;	O
on	O
this	O
we	O
passed	O
very	O
safe	O
.	O

We	O
afterwards	O
crossed	O
another	O
river	O
three	O
times	O
,	O
with	O
much	O
difficulty	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
3	O
a	O
clock	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
Indian	O
settlement	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
met	O
a	O
drove	O
of	O
monkeys	O
,	O
and	O
killed	O
4	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
stayed	O
here	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
having	O
marched	O
this	O
day	O
6	O
miles	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
got	O
plantains	O
enough	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
kind	O
reception	O
of	O
the	O
Indian	O
that	O
lived	O
here	O
all	O
alone	O
,	O
except	O
one	O
boy	O
to	O
wait	O
on	O
him	O
.	O

The	O
fifteenth	O
day	O
when	O
we	O
set	O
out	O
,	O
the	O
kind	O
Indian	O
and	O
his	O
boy	O
went	O
with	O
us	O
in	O
a	O
Canoa	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
us	O
over	O
such	O
places	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
ford	O
:	O
and	O
,	O
being	O
past	O
those	O
great	O
rivers	O
,	O
he	O
returned	O
back	O
again	O
,	O
having	O
helped	O
us	O
at	O
least	O
2	O
mile	O
.	O

We	O
marched	O
afterwards	O
5	O
mile	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
large	O
plantain-walks	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
took	O
up	O
our	O
quarters	O
that	O
night	O
;	O
we	O
there	O
fed	O
plentifully	O
on	O
plantains	O
,	O
both	O
ripe	O
and	O
green	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
fair	O
weather	O
all	O
the	O
day	O
and	O
night	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
these	O
were	O
the	O
largest	O
plantain-walks	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
biggest	O
plantains	O
that	O
ever	O
I	O
saw	O
,	O
but	O
no	O
house	O
near	O
them	O
:	O
we	O
gathered	O
what	O
we	O
pleased	O
by	O
our	O
guide	O
's	O
orders	O
.	O

The	O
sixteenth	O
day	O
we	O
marched	O
3	O
mile	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
large	O
settlement	O
where	O
we	O
abode	O
all	O
day	O
:	O
not	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
us	O
but	O
wished	O
the	O
journey	O
at	O
an	O
end	O
;	O
our	O
feet	O
being	O
blistered	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
thighs	O
stripped	O
with	O
wading	O
through	O
so	O
many	O
rivers	O
;	O
the	O
way	O
being	O
almost	O
continually	O
through	O
rivers	O
or	O
pathless	O
woods	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
five	O
of	O
us	O
went	O
to	O
seek	O
for	O
game	O
and	O
killed	O
3	O
monkeys	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
dressed	O
for	O
supper	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
first	O
began	O
to	O
have	O
fair	O
weather	O
,	O
which	O
continued	O
with	O
us	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
North	PNM
Seas	PNM
.	O

The	O
eighteenth	O
day	O
we	O
set	O
out	O
at	O
10	O
a	O
clock	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Indians	O
with	O
5	O
Canoas	O
carried	O
us	O
a	O
league	O
up	O
a	O
river	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
we	O
landed	O
the	O
kind	O
Indians	O
went	O
with	O
us	O
and	O
carried	O
our	O
burdens	O
.	O

We	O
marched	O
3	O
mile	O
farther	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
built	O
our	O
huts	O
,	O
having	O
travelled	O
from	O
the	O
last	O
settlements	O
6	O
mile	O
.	O

The	O
nineteenth	O
day	O
our	O
guides	O
lost	O
their	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
march	O
above	O
2	O
mile	O
.	O

The	O
twentieth	O
day	O
by	O
12	O
a	O
clock	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
Cheapo	PNM
River	PNM

The	O
rivers	O

crossed	O
hitherto	O
run	O
all	O
into	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM

and	O
this	O
of	O
Cheapo	O
was	O
the	O
last	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
that	O
run	O
that	O
way	O

Here	O
an	O
old	O
man	O
who	O
came	O
from	O
the	O
last	O
settlements	O
distributed	O
his	O
burthen	O
of	O
plantains	O
amongst	O
us	O
and	O
,	O
taking	O
his	O
leave	O
,	O
returned	O
home	O

Afterward	O
we	O
forded	O
the	O
river	O
and	O
marched	O
to	O
the	O
foot	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
high	O
mountain	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
lay	O
all	O
night	O

This	O
day	O
we	O
marched	O
about	O
9	O
miles	O

The	O
21st	O
day	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
returned	O
back	O

and	O
we	O
marched	O
up	O
a	O
very	O
high	O
mountain	O
;	O
being	O
on	O
the	O

we	O
went	O
some	O

on	O
a	O
ridge	O

and	O
steep	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O

then	O
descended	O
a	O

came	O
to	O
a	O

22nd	O
day	O
we	O
marched	O
over	O
another	O
very	O
high	O
mountain	O
,	O
keeping	O
on	O
the	O
ridge	O
5	O
miles	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
end	O
we	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
comfort	O
,	O
saw	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
then	O
we	O
descended	O
,	O
and	O
parted	O
ourselves	O
into	O
3	O
companies	O
,	O
and	O
lay	O
by	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
a	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
we	O
met	O
that	O
runs	O
into	O
the	O
North	PNM
Sea	PNM
.	O

The	O
23rd	O
day	O
we	O
came	O
through	O
several	O
large	O
plantain-walks	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
10	O
a	O
clock	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
Indian	O
habitation	O
not	O
far	O
from	O
the	O
North	PNM
Seas	PNM
.	O

Here	O
we	O
got	O
Canoas	O
to	O
carry	O
as	O
down	O
the	O
river	O
Concepcion	O
to	O
the	O
seaside	O
;	O
having	O
gone	O
this	O
day	O
7	O
miles	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
Indians	O
at	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
settled	O
themselves	O
here	O
for	O
the	O
benefit	O
of	O
trade	O
with	O
the	O
privateers	O
;	O
and	O
their	O
commodities	O
were	O
yams	O
,	O
potatoes	O
,	O
plantains	O
,	O
sugarcane	O
,	O
fowls	O
,	O
and	O
eggs	O
.	O

The	O
Indians	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
there	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
English	O
and	O
French	O
ships	O
here	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
all	O
gone	O
but	O
one	O
barcolongo	O
,	O
a	O
French	O
privateer	O
that	O
lay	O
at	O
La	PNM
Sounds	PNM
Key	PNM
or	PNM
Island	PNM
.	O

This	O
island	O
is	O
about	O
3	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
Concepcion	O
,	O
and	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Samballoes	O
,	O
a	O
range	O
of	O
islands	O
reaching	O
for	O
about	O
20	O
leagues	O
from	O
Point	PNM
Samballas	PNM
to	O
Golden	PNM
Island	PNM
eastward	O
.	O

These	O
islands	O
or	O
keys	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
call	O
them	O
,	O
were	O
first	O
made	O
the	O
rendezvous	O
of	O
privateers	O
in	O
the	O
year	O
1679	O
,	O
being	O
very	O
convenient	O
for	O
careening	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
names	O
given	O
to	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
by	O
the	O
captains	O
of	O
the	O
privateers	O
:	O
as	O
this	O

Key	O
particularly	O

Thus	O
we	O
finished	O
our	O
journey	O
from	O
the	O
South	PNM
Sea	PNM
to	O
the	O
North	O
in	O
23	O
days	O
;	O
in	O
which	O
time	O
by	O
my	O
account	O
we	O
travelled	O
110	O
miles	O
,	O
crossing	O
some	O
very	O
high	O
mountains	O
;	O
but	O
our	O
common	O
march	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
valleys	O
among	O
deep	O
and	O
dangerous	O
rivers	O
.	O

At	O
our	O
first	O
landing	O
in	O
this	O
country	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
told	O
that	O
the	O
Indians	O
were	O
our	O
enemies	O
;	O
we	O
knew	O
the	O
rivers	O
to	O
be	O
deep	O
,	O
the	O
wet	O
season	O
to	O
be	O
coming	O
in	O
;	O
yet	O
,	O
excepting	O
those	O
we	O
left	O
behind	O
,	O
we	O
lost	O
but	O
one	O
man	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
drowned	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
.	O

Our	O
first	O
landing	O
place	O
on	O
the	O
south	O
coast	O
was	O
very	O
disadvantageous	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
travelled	O
at	O
least	O
fifty	O
miles	O
more	O
than	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
have	O
done	O
,	O
could	O
we	O
have	O
gone	O
up	O
Cheapo	PNM
River	PNM
,	PNM
or	O
Santa	PNM
Maria	PNM
River	PNM
;	O
for	O
at	O
either	O
of	O
these	O
places	O
a	O
man	O
may	O
pass	O
from	O
sea	O
to	O
sea	O
in	O
three	O
days	O
time	O
with	O
ease	O
.	O

The	O
Indians	O
can	O
do	O
it	O
in	O
a	O
day	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
you	O
may	O
see	O
how	O
easy	O
it	O
is	O
for	O
a	O
party	O
of	O
men	O
to	O
travel	O
over	O
.	O

I	O
must	O
confess	O
the	O
Indians	O
did	O
assist	O
us	O
very	O
much	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
question	O
whether	O
ever	O
we	O
had	O
got	O
over	O
without	O
their	O
assistance	O
,	O
because	O
they	O
brought	O
us	O
from	O
time	O
to	O
time	O
to	O
their	O
plantations	O
where	O
we	O
always	O
got	O
provision	O
,	O
which	O
else	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
wanted	O
.	O

But	O
if	O
a	O
party	O
of	O
500	O
or	O
600	O
men	O
or	O
more	O
were	O
minded	O
to	O
travel	O
from	O
the	O
North	O
to	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
they	O
may	O
do	O
it	O
without	O
asking	O
leave	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
;	O
though	O
it	O
be	O
much	O
better	O
to	O
be	O
friends	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
24th	O
of	O

-LRB-	O

The	O
first	O
thing	O
we	O
did	O
was	O
to	O

such	O

as	O
we	O
could	O
to	O
gratify	O
our	O
Indian	O

were	O

to	O

them	O
to	O
their	O

This	O
we	O
did	O
by	O
giving	O
them	O
beads	O
,	O
knives	O
,	O

,	O
and	O
looking-glasses	O

which	O
we	O

half	O
a	O

we	O

could	O
not	O

us	O

our	O

yet	O

every	O

The	O

seemed	O
very	O
forward	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
any	O
town	O
that	O
the	O
English	O
could	O
or	O
would	O
propose	O

because	O
the	O

Pettit	PNM
Guavos	PNM
-LRB-	O
from	O
whom	O
the	O

lately	O
come	O
from	O
France	PNM
to	O
be	O
general	O
of	O
the	O

with	O

this	O

came	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
,	O
if	O

,	O
make	O
an	O
attempt	O
on	O
some	O

before	O
he	O
returned	O
again	O

The	O
English	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
company	O
with	O
the	O
French	O
,	O
seemed	O
to	O
approve	O
of	O
what	O
the	O
French	O
said	O
,	O
but	O
never	O
looked	O
on	O
that	O
general	O
to	O
be	O
fit	O
for	O
the	O
service	O
in	O
hand	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
it	O
was	O
concluded	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
a	O
town	O
,	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
have	O
forgot	O
;	O
it	O
lies	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
such	O
a	O
tedious	O
march	O
as	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
from	O
hence	O
to	O
Panama	PNM
.	O

Our	O
way	O
to	O
it	O
lay	O
up	O
Carpenter	PNM
's	PNM
River	PNM
,	O
which	O
is	O
about	O
60	O
leagues	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
of	O
Portobello	PNM
.	O

Our	O
greatest	O
obstruction	O
in	O
this	O
design	O
was	O
our	O
want	O
of	O
boats	O
:	O
therefore	O
it	O
was	O
concluded	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
all	O
our	O
fleet	O
to	O
St.	PNM
Andreas	PNM
,	O
a	O
small	O
uninhabited	O
island	O
lying	O
near	O
the	O
isle	O
of	O
Providence	PNM
,	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
in	O
13	O
degrees	O
15	O
minutes	O
north	O
latitude	O
,	O
and	O
from	O
Portobello	PNM
north-north-west	O
about	O
70	O
leagues	O
;	O
where	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
from	O
Carpenter	PNM
's	PNM
River	PNM
.	PNM

And	O
besides	O
,	O
at	O
this	O
island	O
we	O
might	O
build	O
Canoas	O
,	O
it	O
being	O
plentifully	O
stored	O
with	O
large	O
cedars	O
for	O
such	O
a	O
purpose	O
;	O
and	O
for	O
this	O
reason	O
the	O
Jamaica	PNM
men	O
come	O
hither	O
frequently	O
to	O
build	O
sloops	O
;	O
cedar	O
being	O
very	O
fit	O
for	O
building	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
being	O
to	O
be	O
had	O
here	O
at	O
free	O
cost	O
;	O
beside	O
other	O
wood	O
.	O

Jamaica	PNM
is	O
well	O
stored	O
with	O
cedars	O
of	O
its	O
own	O
,	O
chiefly	O
among	O
the	O
Rocky	O
Mountains	O
:	O
these	O
also	O
of	O
St.	PNM
Andreas	PNM
grow	O
in	O
stony	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
are	O
the	O
largest	O
that	O
ever	O
I	O
knew	O
or	O
heard	O
of	O
;	O
the	O
bodies	O
alone	O
being	O
ordinarily	O
40	O
or	O
50	O
foot	O
long	O

many	O
60	O
or	O
70	O
and	O
upwards	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
a	O
proportionable	O
bigness	O
.	O

The	O
Bermudas	O
Isles	O
are	O
well	O
stored	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
so	O
is	O
Virginia	PNM
,	O
which	O
is	O
generally	O
a	O
sandy	O
soil	O
.	O

I	O
saw	O
none	O
in	O
the	O
East	PNM

,	O
nor	O
in	O
the	O
South	PNM
Sea	PNM
coast	O
,	O
except	O
on	O
the	O
Isthmus	O
as	O
I	O
came	O
over	O
it	O
.	O

We	O
reckon	O
the	O
periago	O
's	O
and	O
Canoas	O
that	O
are	O
made	O
of	O
cedar	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
any	O
;	O
they	O
are	O
nothing	O
but	O
the	O
tree	O
itself	O
made	O
hollow	O
boat-wise	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
flat	O
bottom	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Canoa	O
generally	O
sharp	O
at	O
both	O
ends	O
,	O
the	O
periago	O
at	O
one	O
only	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
other	O
end	O
flat	O
.	O

But	O
what	O
is	O
commonly	O
said	O
of	O
cedar	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
worm	O
will	O
not	O
touch	O
it	O
,	O
is	O
a	O
mistake	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
have	O
seen	O
of	O
it	O
very	O
much	O
worm-eaten	O
.	O

All	O
things	O
being	O
thus	O
concluded	O
on	O
,	O
we	O
sailed	O
from	O
thence	O
,	O
directing	O
our	O
course	O
towards	O
St.	PNM
Andreas	PNM
.	O

We	O
kept	O
company	O
the	O
first	O
day	O
,	O
but	O
at	O
night	O
it	O
blew	O
a	O
hard	O
gale	O
at	O
north-east	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
ships	O
bore	O
away	O
:	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
others	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
leave	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
second	O
night	O
we	O
lost	O
all	O
our	O
company	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
now	O
belonging	O
to	O
Captain	O
Archembo	O
,	O
for	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O

Captain	O
Archembo	O
wanting	O
men	O
,	O
we	O
that	O
came	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
must	O
either	O
sail	O
with	O
him	O
or	O
remain	O
among	O
the	O
Indians	O
.	O

Indeed	O
we	O
found	O
no	O
cause	O
to	O
dislike	O
the	O
captain	O
;	O
but	O
his	O
French	O
seamen	O
were	O
the	O
saddest	O
creatures	O
that	O
ever	O
I	O
was	O
among	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
bad	O
weather	O
that	O
required	O
many	O
hands	O
aloft	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
biggest	O
part	O
of	O
them	O
never	O
stirred	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
hammocks	O
but	O
to	O
eat	O
or	O
ease	O
themselves	O

We	O
made	O
a	O
shift	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
island	O
the	O
fourth	O
day	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
met	O
Captain	O

who	O
came	O
thither	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
taken	O
a	O
Spanish	O
Tartan	O

wherein	O
were	O
30	O
men	O

all	O
well	O

They	O
fought	O
an	O
hour	O
before	O
they	O
yielded	O

The	O
news	O
they	O
related	O
was	O
that	O
they	O
came	O
from	O
Cartagene	PNM
in	O
company	O
of	O
11	O
armadillos	O
-LRB-	O
which	O
are	O
small	O

to	O
seek	O
for	O
the	O
fleet	O
of	O
privateers	O
lying	O
in	O
the	O
Samballoes	O
:	O
that	O
they	O
parted	O
from	O
the	O
armadillos	O
2	O
days	O
before	O
:	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
ordered	O
to	O
search	O
the	O
Samballoes	O
for	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
find	O
us	O
then	O
they	O
were	O
ordered	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Portobello	PNM

and	O
lay	O
there	O
till	O
they	O
had	O
farther	O
intelligence	O

us	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
supposed	O
these	O
armadillos	O
to	O
be	O
now	O
there	O

We	O
that	O
came	O
overland	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
,	O
being	O
weary	O
of	O
living	O
among	O
the	O
French	O
,	O
desired	O
Captain	O
Wright	O
to	O
fit	O
up	O
his	O
prize	O
the	O
Tartan	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
a	O
man-of-war	O
of	O
her	O
for	O
us	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
at	O
first	O
seemed	O
to	O
decline	O
,	O
because	O
he	O
was	O
settled	O
among	O
the	O
French	O
in	O
Hispaniola	PNM
,	O
and	O
was	O
very	O
well	O
beloved	O
both	O
by	O
the	O
governor	O
of	O
Pettit	O
Guavos	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
gentry	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
would	O
resent	O
it	O
ill	O
that	O
Captain	O
Wright	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
no	O
occasion	O
of	O
men	O
,	O
should	O
be	O
so	O
unkind	O
to	O
Captain	O
Archembo	O
as	O
to	O
seduce	O
his	O
men	O
from	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
being	O
so	O
meanly	O
manned	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
hardly	O
sail	O
his	O
ship	O
with	O
his	O
Frenchmen	O
.	O

We	O
told	O
him	O
we	O
would	O
no	O
longer	O
remain	O
with	O
Captain	O
Archembo	O
,	O
but	O
would	O
go	O
ashore	O
there	O
and	O
build	O
Canoas	O
to	O
transport	O
ourselves	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
Moskitos	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
entertain	O
us	O
;	O
for	O
privateers	O
are	O
not	O
obliged	O
to	O
any	O
ship	O
,	O
but	O
free	O
to	O
go	O
ashore	O
where	O
they	O

or	O
to	O
go	O
into	O
any	O
other	O
ship	O
that	O
will	O
entertain	O
them	O
,	O
only	O
paying	O
for	O
their	O
provision	O

When	O
Captain	O
Wright	O
saw	O
our	O
resolutions	O
he	O
agreed	O
with	O
us	O
on	O
condition	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
under	O
his	O
command	O
as	O
one	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O
,	O
to	O
which	O
we	O
unanimously	O
consented	O
.	O

We	O
stayed	O
here	O
about	O
10	O
days	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
any	O
more	O
of	O
our	O
fleet	O
would	O
come	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
there	O
came	O
no	O

Captain	O

These	O

take	O
to	O

Here	O
we	O
arrived	O
the	O
next	O

and	O
went	O
ashore	O
on	O
one	O

but	O
found	O
none	O

the	O

for	O
here	O

a	O

here	O

who	O
have	O
been	O
so	O

by	O
the	O

that	O
they	O
have	O

and	O
when	O
they	O

a	O

they	O
hide	O
themselves	O

otherwise	O
ships	O
that	O

take	O
them	O

make	O

and	O
I	O
have	O

some	O

They	O

They	O

The	O

This	O
they	O

all	O

They	O

Another	O

is	O

Finding	O
no	O

here	O
we	O
sailed	O
towards	O

At	O

is	O
a	O

it	O
is	O
deep	O
at	O

a	O

It	O
had	O
this	O
name	O
from	O
Captain	O
Bluefield	O
,	O
a	O
famous	O
privateer	O
living	O
on	O
Providence	PNM
Island	PNM
long	O
before	O
Jamaica	PNM
was	O
taken	O

Which	O
island	O

Providence	PNM
was	O
settled	O
by	O
the	O
English	O

and	O
belonged	O
to	O
the	O
Earls	O
of	O
Warwick	PNM

In	O
this	O
river	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
Canoa	O
coming	O
down	O
the	O
stream	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
we	O
went	O
with	O
our	O
Canoas	O
to	O
seek	O
for	O
inhabitants	O
yet	O
we	O
found	O
none	O
,	O
but	O
saw	O
in	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
places	O
signs	O
that	O
Indians	O
had	O
made	O
on	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O

The	O
Canoa	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
was	O
but	O
meanly	O
made	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
tools	O
,	O
therefore	O
we	O
concluded	O
these	O
Indians	O
have	O
no	O
commerce	O
with	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
nor	O
with	O
other	O
Indians	O
that	O
have	O

While	O
we	O
lay	O
here	O

our	O

went	O
in	O
their	O
Canoa	PNM
and	O
struck	O

some	O
manatee	O

or	O
sea-cow	O

Besides	O
this	O

I	O
have	O

their	O

on	O
the	O

The	O
mouth	O

The	O

The	O
neck	O
is	O
short	O

The	O
biggest	O
part	O

is	O
at	O

From	O
the	O

towards	O
the	O

it	O
retains	O
its	O
bigness	O

then	O
grows	O

about	O
14	O

The	O

till	O
they	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
they	O

Then	O
they	O
lie	O
still	O

paddle	O
very	O
softly	O

looking	O
well	O

and	O
he	O
that	O

and	O
stands	O
up	O
with	O
his	O
striking-staff	O
in	O
his	O

This	O
staff	O
is	O
about	O
8	O
foot	O
long	O
,	O
almost	O
as	O

as	O
a	O

At	O

the	O

of	O
the	O

comes	O
;	O
and	O
on	O
this	O
piece	O
of	O
bob-wood	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
line	O
of	O
10	O
or	O
12	O
fathom	O
wound	O
neatly	O
about	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
line	O
made	O

to	O
it	O

The	O
other	O
end	O
of	O
the	O

is	O
made	O

harpoon	O

which	O
is	O
at	O
the	O
great	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
staff	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Moskito	O
men	O
keep	O
about	O
a	O
fathom	O
of	O
it	O
loose	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
.	O

When	O
he	O
strikes	O
,	O
the	O
harpoon	O
presently	O
comes	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
staff	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
the	O
manatee	O
swims	O
away	O
the	O
line	O
runs	O
off	O
from	O
the	O
bob	O
;	O
and	O
although	O
at	O
first	O
both	O
staff	O
and	O

may	O
be	O
carried	O
under	O
water	O
,	O
yet	O
as	O
the	O
line	O
runs	O
off	O
it	O
will	O
rise	O
again	O
.	O

Then	O
the	O
Moskito	O
men	O
paddle	O
with	O
all	O
their	O
might	O
to	O
get	O
hold	O
of	O
the	O
bob	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
spend	O
usually	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
before	O
they	O
get	O
in	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
Manatee	O
begins	O
to	O
be	O
tired	O
,	O
it	O
lies	O
still	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
Moskito	O
men	O
paddle	O
to	O
the	O
bob	O
and	O
take	O
it	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
begin	O
to	O
haul	O
in	O
the	O
line	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
manatee	O
feels	O
them	O
he	O
swims	O
away	O
again	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
Canoa	PNM
after	O
him	O
;	O
then	O
he	O
that	O
steers	O
must	O
be	O
nimble	O
to	O
turn	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
the	O
Canoa	PNM
that	O
way	O
that	O
his	O
consort	O
points	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
being	O
in	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
the	O
Canoa	PNM
,	O
and	O
holding	O
the	O
line	O
,	O
both	O
sees	O
and	O
feels	O
which	O
way	O
the	O
manatee	O
is	O
swimming	O
.	O

Thus	O
the	O
Canoa	PNM
is	O
towed	O
with	O
a	O
violent	O
motion	O
,	O
till	O
the	O
manatee	O
's	O
strength	O
decays	O
.	O

Then	O
they	O
gather	O
in	O
the	O
line	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
are	O
often	O
forced	O
to	O
let	O
all	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
very	O
end	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
creature	O
's	O
strength	O
is	O
spent	O
,	O
they	O
haul	O
it	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
Canoa	O
's	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
knock	O
it	O
on	O
the	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
tow	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
nearest	O
shore	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
make	O
it	O
fast	O
and	O
seek	O
for	O
another	O
;	O
which	O
having	O
taken	O
,	O
they	O
get	O
on	O
shore	O
with	O
it	O
to	O
put	O
it	O
into	O
their	O
Canoa	PNM
:	O
for	O
it	O
is	O
so	O
heavy	O
that	O
they	O
can	O
not	O
lift	O
it	O
in	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
haul	O
it	O
up	O
in	O
shoal	O
water	O
,	O
as	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
as	O
they	O
can	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
overset	O
the	O
Canoa	PNM
,	O
laying	O
one	O
side	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
manatee	O
.	O

Then	O
they	O
roll	O
in	O
,	O
which	O
brings	O
the	O
Canoa	PNM
upright	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
have	O
heaved	O
out	O
the	O
water	O
they	O
fasten	O
a	O
line	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
manatee	O
that	O
lies	O
afloat	O
,	O
and	O
tow	O
it	O
after	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
known	O
two	O
Moskito	O
men	O
for	O
a	O
week	O
every	O
day	O
bring	O
aboard	O
2	O
manatee	O
in	O
this	O
manner	O
;	O
the	O
least	O
of	O
which	O
has	O
not	O
weighed	O
less	O
than	O
600	O
pound	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
small	O
Canoa	O
,	O
that	O
three	O
Englishmen	O
would	O
scarce	O
adventure	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
strike	O
a	O
cow	O
that	O
has	O
a	O
young	O
one	O
they	O
seldom	O
miss	O
the	O
calf	O
,	O
for	O
she	O
commonly	O
takes	O
her	O
young	O
under	O
one	O
of	O
her	O
fins	O
.	O

But	O
if	O
the	O
calf	O
is	O
so	O
big	O
that	O
she	O
can	O
not	O
carry	O
it	O
,	O
or	O
so	O
frightened	O
that	O
she	O
only	O
minds	O
to	O
save	O
her	O
own	O
life	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
young	O
never	O
leaves	O
her	O
till	O
the	O
Moskito	O
men	O
have	O
an	O
opportunity	O
to	O
strike	O
her	O
.	O

The	O
manner	O
of	O
striking	O
manatee	O
and	O
tortoise	O
is	O
much	O
the	O
same	O
;	O
only	O
when	O
they	O
seek	O
for	O
manatee	O
they	O
paddle	O
so	O
gently	O
that	O
they	O
make	O
no	O
noise	O
,	O
and	O
never	O
touch	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
their	O
Canoa	PNM
with	O
their	O
paddle	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
creature	O
that	O
hears	O
very	O
well	O
.	O

But	O
they	O
are	O
not	O
so	O
nice	O
when	O
they	O
seek	O
for	O
tortoise	O
,	O
whose	O
eyes	O
are	O
better	O
than	O
his	O
ears	O
.	O

They	O
strike	O
the	O
tortoise	O
with	O
a	O
square	O
sharp	O
iron	O
peg	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
with	O
a	O
harpoon	O
.	O

The	O
Moskito	O
men	O
make	O
their	O
own	O
striking	O
instruments	O
,	O
as	O
harpoons	O
,	O
fishhooks	O
,	O
and	O
tortoise-irons	O
or	O
pegs	O
.	O

These	O
pegs	O
,	O
or	O
tortoise-irons	O
,	O
are	O
made	O
4-square	O
,	O
sharp	O
at	O
one	O
end	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
much	O
above	O
an	O
inch	O
in	O
length	O
,	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
figure	O
as	O
you	O
see	O
in	O
the	O
margin	O
.	O

The	O
small	O
spike	O
at	O
the	O
broad	O
end	O
has	O
a	O
line	O
fastened	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
goes	O
also	O
into	O
a	O
hole	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
striking-staff	O
,	O
which	O
when	O
the	O
tortoise	O
is	O
struck	O
flies	O
off	O
,	O
the	O
iron	O
and	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
line	O
fastened	O
to	O
it	O
going	O
quite	O
within	O
the	O
shell	O
,	O
where	O
it	O
is	O
so	O
buried	O
that	O
the	O
tortoise	O
can	O
not	O
possibly	O
escape	O
.	O

They	O
make	O
their	O
lines	O
both	O
for	O
fishing	O
and	O
striking	O
with	O
the	O
bark	O
of	O
maho	O
;	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
tree	O
or	O
shrub	O
that	O
grows	O
plentifully	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
West	O
Indies	O
,	O
and	O
whose	O
bark	O
is	O
made	O
up	O
of	O
strings	O
,	O
or	O
threads	O
very	O
strong	O
.	O

You	O
may	O
draw	O
it	O
off	O
either	O
in	O
flakes	O
or	O
small	O
threads	O
,	O
as	O
you	O
have	O
occasion	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
fit	O
for	O
any	O
manner	O
of	O
cordage	O
;	O
and	O
privateers	O
often	O
make	O
their	O
rigging	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

So	O
much	O
by	O
way	O
of	O
digression	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
cleaned	O
our	O
Tartan	O
we	O
sailed	O
from	O
hence	O
,	O
bound	O
for	O
Boca	PNM
Toro	PNM
,	O
which	O
is	O
an	O
opening	O

about	O
10	O

north	O
latitude	O
between	O
the	O
rivers	O
of	O
Veragne	PNM
and	O
Chagre	PNM
.	O

Here	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
Captain	O
Yankes	O
,	O
who	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
there	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
fleet	O
of	O
Spanish	O
armadillos	O
to	O
seek	O
us	O
:	O
that	O
Captain	O
Tristian	O

having	O
fallen	O
to	O

,	O
was	O
coming	O
to	O
Boca	PNM

,	O
and	O
fell	O
in	O
amongst	O
them	O
,	O
supposing	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
our	O
fleet	O
:	O
that	O
they	O
fired	O
and	O
chased	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
rowed	O
and	O
towed	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
supposed	O
he	O
got	O
away	O
:	O
that	O
Captain	O
Pain	O
was	O
likewise	O
chased	O
by	O
them	O
and	O
Captain	O
Williams	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
not	O
seen	O
them	O
since	O
they	O
lay	O
within	O
the	O
islands	O
:	O
that	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
never	O
came	O
in	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
Captain	O
Coxon	O
was	O
in	O
at	O
the	O
careening-place	O

This	O
Boca	PNM
Toro	PNM
is	O
a	O
place	O
that	O
the	O
privateers	O
use	O

resort	O
to	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
any	O
place	O
on	O
all	O
the	O
coast	O

a	O

The	O

no	O

;	O
but	O
are	O
very	O

They	O
have	O

Captain	O

Captain	O

with	O

we	O
consorted	O

We	O
lived	O
very	O
well	O
on	O
what	O
we	O
got	O
,	O
not	O
staying	O
long	O
in	O
one	O
place	O
;	O
but	O
sometimes	O
we	O
would	O
go	O
on	O
the	O
islands	O
,	O
where	O
there	O
grow	O
great	O
groves	O
of	O
sapadilloes	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
fruit	O
much	O
like	O
a	O
pear	O
,	O
but	O
more	O
juicy	O
;	O
and	O
under	O
those	O
trees	O
we	O
found	O
plenty	O
of	O
soldiers	O
,	O
a	O
little	O
kind	O
of	O
animals	O
that	O
live	O
in	O
shells	O
and	O
have	O
two	O
great	O
claws	O
like	O
a	O
crab	O
,	O
and	O
are	O
good	O
food	O

One	O
time	O
our	O
men	O
found	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
large	O
ones	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
sharp-set	O
had	O
them	O
dressed	O
,	O
but	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
very	O
sick	O
afterwards	O
,	O
being	O
poisoned	O
by	O
them	O
:	O
for	O
on	O
this	O
island	O
were	O
many	O
manchaneel-trees	O
,	O
whose	O
fruit	O
is	O
like	O
a	O
small	O
crab	O
,	O
and	O
smells	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
are	O
not	O
wholesome	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
commonly	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
meddling	O
with	O
any	O
animals	O
that	O
eat	O
them	O
.	O

And	O
this	O
we	O
take	O
for	O
a	O
general	O
rule	O
;	O
when	O
we	O
find	O
any	O
fruits	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
not	O
seen	O
before	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
see	O
them	O
pecked	O
by	O
birds	O
,	O
we	O
may	O
freely	O
eat	O
,	O
but	O
if	O
we	O
see	O
no	O
such	O
sign	O
we	O
let	O
them	O
alone	O
;	O
for	O
of	O
this	O
fruit	O
no	O
birds	O
will	O
taste	O

Many	O
of	O
these	O

have	O
of	O
these	O

growing	O
on	O
them	O

Thus	O
,	O
cruising	O
in	O
among	O
these	O
islands	O

at	O

we	O

It	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
an	O

and	O
the	O
next	O

we	O
fired	O
two	O

for	O
the	O

lived	O
on	O
the	O
Main	O
to	O
come	O
aboard	O

for	O
by	O
this	O

we	O
should	O
hear	O
from	O
our	O
five	O

that	O
we	O
left	O
in	O
the	O

this	O
being	O
about	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
May	O
when	O
we	O
parted	O
from	O
them	O

According	O
to	O
our	O
expectations	O
the	O
Indians	O
came	O
aboard	O
and	O
brought	O
our	O
friends	O
with	O
them	O
:	O
Mr.	O
Wafer	O
wore	O
a	O
clout	O
about	O
him	O

and	O
was	O
painted	O

an	O

and	O
he	O
was	O
some	O

aboard	O
before	O
I	O

him	O

One	O
of	O
them	O

named	O

within	O

was	O

on	O

After	O
this	O
we	O
went	O
to	O

to	O

of	O
these	O
,	O
to	O
meet	O
Captain	O

Captain	O

who	O
met	O
with	O
a	O
fleet	O
of	O
periago	O
's	O
laden	O
with	O
Indian	O
corn	O
,	O
hog	O
and	O

going	O
to	O
Cartagene	PNM
;	O
being	O
convoyed	O
by	O
a	O
small	O
armadillo	O
of	O
two	O

six	O

Her	O
they	O
chased	O
ashore	O

and	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
periago	O

;	O
but	O
they	O
got	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
off	O

and	O
brought	O
them	O
away	O

Here	O
Captain	O
Wright	O

and	O
Captain	O

barks	O
were	O
cleaned	O
;	O
and	O
we	O

ourselves	O
with	O
corn	O

and	O
then	O
went	O
towards	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Cartagene	PNM

In	O
our	O
way	O
thither	O
we	O
passed	O
by	O
the	O
river	PNM
of	PNM
Darien	PNM

which	O
is	O
very	O
broad	O
at	O

Captain	O
Coxon	O
,	O
about	O
6	O
months	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
,	O
went	O
up	O
this	O
river	O
with	O
a	O
party	O
of	O
men	O
:	O
every	O
man	O
carried	O
a	O
small	O
strong	O
bag	O
to	O
put	O
his	O
gold	O
in	O
;	O
expecting	O
great	O
riches	O
there	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
got	O
little	O
or	O
none	O
.	O

They	O
rowed	O
up	O
about	O
100	O
leagues	O
before	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
any	O
settlement	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
found	O
some	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
who	O
lived	O
there	O
to	O
truck	O
with	O
the	O
Indians	O
for	O
gold	O
;	O
there	O
being	O
gold	O
scales	O
in	O
every	O
house	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
admired	O
how	O
they	O
came	O
so	O
far	O
from	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
because	O
there	O
are	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
Indians	O
living	O
between	O
that	O
place	O
and	O
the	O
sea	O
who	O
are	O
very	O
dreadful	O
to	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
and	O
will	O
not	O
have	O
any	O
commerce	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
nor	O
with	O
any	O
white	O
people	O
.	O

They	O
use	O
trunks	O
about	O
8	O
foot	O
long	O
,	O
out	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
blow	O
poisoned	O
darts	O
;	O
and	O
are	O
so	O
silent	O
in	O
their	O
attacks	O
on	O
their	O
enemies	O
,	O
and	O
retreat	O
so	O
nimbly	O
again	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
can	O
never	O
find	O
them	O
.	O

Their	O
darts	O
are	O
made	O
of	O
macaw-wood	O
,	O
being	O
about	O
the	O
bigness	O
and	O
length	O
of	O
a	O
knitting-needle	O
;	O
one	O
end	O
is	O

the	O

is	O
jagged	O
with	O
notches	O
like	O
a	O
harpoon	O

so	O
that	O
whatever	O
it	O
strikes	O
into	O
it	O
immediately	O
breaks	O
off	O
by	O
the	O
weight	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O
end	O
;	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
of	O
strength	O
to	O
bear	O
-LRB-	O
it	O
being	O
made	O
so	O
slender	O
for	O
that	O

-RRB-	O
and	O
is	O
very	O
difficult	O
to	O
be	O
got	O
out	O
again	O
by	O

of	O
those	O

These	O

have	O
always	O
war	O
with	O
our	O

and	O
live	O
on	O
both	O

this	O

50	O

60	O

from	O
the	O

but	O
not	O
near	O

There	O
are	O

and	O
some	O

belonging	O
to	O
it	O

This	O
relation	O
I	O
had	O
from	O
several	O
men	O
who	O
accompanied	O
Captain	O

in	O
that	O

he	O
is	O

To	O

the	O
prosecution	O
of	O
our	O

meeting	O
with	O
nothing	O

Cartagene	O

so	O

for	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
place	O
of	O
incredible	O
wealth	O

by	O

of	O
the	O

often	O
in	O

Any	O

this	O

report	O
that	O

again	O
settled	O
themselves	O
in	O
it	O

and	O
made	O
it	O
very	O
strong	O

We	O
entered	O
the	O
fort	O
and	O
brought	O
two	O
small	O
guns	O
aboard	O

From	O
thence	O
we	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
Rancho	O

one	O

two	O
small	O
Indian	O
villages	O
where	O
the	O

keep	O
two	O

The	O

lie	O
about	O
4	O

5	O

as	O
I	O
have	O
been	O

;	O
thither	O
the	O
fishing	O
barks	O
go	O

then	O
the	O
divers	O
go	O
down	O
to	O
the	O

and	O
fill	O
a	O

-LRB-	O
which	O
is	O

-RRB-	O
with	O
oysters	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
come	O
up	O
others	O
go	O
down	O
,	O
two	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
;	O
this	O
they	O
do	O
till	O
the	O
bark	O
is	O
full	O

and	O
then	O
go	O
ashore	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
old	O
men	O

women	O

and	O
children	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
open	O
the	O

,	O
there	O
being	O
a	O
Spanish	O
overseer	O
to	O
look	O
after	O
the	O
pearl	O

Yet	O
these	O
Indians	O
do	O
very	O
often	O
secure	O
the	O
best	O
pearl	O
for	O
themselves	O

as	O
many	O
Jamaica	PNM

up	O

At	O
this	O

we	O
went	O
ashore	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
found	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
barks	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
great	O
heaps	O
of	O
oyster-shells	O

but	O
the	O

in	O
another	O

,	O
we	O
took	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O

who	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
stubborn	O
sort	O
of	O

they	O
are	O
long-visaged	O

somewhat	O
rising	O
in	O
the	O

of	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
report	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
very	O

nation	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
will	O
not	O

themselves	O

Yet	O
they	O
have	O
Spanish	O
priests	O
among	O

;	O
and	O
by	O
trading	O
have	O
brought	O
them	O
to	O

somewhat	O

but	O
can	O
not	O
keep	O
a	O

at	O

Captain	O

came	O
up	O

her	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
half	O

Captain	O

who	O

better	O
than	O
the	O

-LRB-	O
the	O

was	O
in	O
-RRB-	O
came	O
up	O
with	O

and	O
laid	O
her	O
aboard	O

then	O
Captain	O
Wright	O
also	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
took	O
her	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
up	O
.	O

They	O
lost	O
2	O
or	O
3	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
7	O
or	O
8	O
wounded	O

The	O
prize	O
was	O
a	O
ship	O
of	O
12	O
guns	O
and	O
40	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
all	O
good	O

She	O
was	O
laden	O
with	O
sugar	O

tobacco	O
,	O
and	O
8	O
or	O
10	O
tuns	O
of	O

she	O
came	O
from	O
St.	PNM
Jago	PNM
on	O
Cuba	PNM
,	O
and	O
was	O
bound	O
to	O
Cartagene	PNM
.	O

We	O
went	O
back	O
with	O
her	O
to	O
Rio	PNM
Grande	PNM
to	O
fix	O
our	O
rigging	O
which	O
was	O
shattered	O
in	O
the	O
fight	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
consider	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
her	O
;	O
for	O
these	O
were	O
commodities	O
of	O
little	O
use	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
worth	O
going	O
into	O
a	O
port	O
with	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
Rio	O
Grande	O
Captain	O
Wright	O
demanded	O
the	O
prize	O
as	O
his	O
due	O
by	O
virtue	O
of	O
his	O
commission	O
:	O
Captain	O
Yankes	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
his	O
due	O
by	O
the	O
law	O
of	O
privateers	O
.	O

Indeed	O
Captain	O
Wright	O
had	O
the	O
most	O
right	O
to	O
her	O
,	O
having	O
by	O
his	O
commission	O
protected	O
Captain	O
Yankes	O
from	O
the	O
French	O
,	O
who	O
would	O
have	O
turned	O
him	O
out	O
because	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
commission	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
likewise	O
began	O
to	O
engage	O
her	O
first	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
company	O
were	O
all	O
afraid	O
that	O
Captain	O
Wright	O
would	O
presently	O
carry	O
her	O
into	O
a	O
port	O
;	O
therefore	O
most	O
of	O
Captain	O
Wright	O
's	O
men	O
stuck	O
to	O
Captain	O
Yankes	O
,	O
and	O
Captain	O
Wright	O
losing	O
his	O
prize	O
burned	O
his	O
own	O
bark	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
Captain	O
Yankes	O
's	O
,	O
it	O
being	O
bigger	O

his	O

;	O
the	O
Tartan	O
was	O
sold	O
to	O
a	O
Jamaica	PNM
trader	O
,	O
and	O
Captain	O
Yankes	O
commanded	O
the	O
prize-ship	O

We	O
went	O
again	O
from	O
hence	O
to	O
Rio	PNM

Hacha	PNM
,	O
and	O
set	O
the	O
prisoners	O
ashore	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
being	O
now	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
November	O
we	O
concluded	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Querisao	PNM
to	O
sell	O
our	O

if	O
favoured	O
by	O
W.erly	O
winds	O

which	O
were	O
now	O

We	O
sailed	O
from	O
thence	O
,	O
having	O
fair	O
weather	O
and	O
winds	O
to	O
our	O
mind	O
,	O
which	O
brought	O
us	O
to	O
Querisao	PNM
,	O
a	O
Dutch	O
island	O
.	O

Captain	O
Wright	O
went	O
ashore	O
to	O
the	O
governor	O
,	O
and	O
offered	O
him	O
the	O
sale	O
of	O
the	O
sugar	O
:	O
but	O
the	O
governor	O
told	O
him	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
trade	O
with	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
therefore	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
admit	O
us	O
in	O
there	O
;	O
but	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
go	O
to	O
St.	PNM

which	O
is	O
an	O

belonging	O
to	O
the	O

a	O

would	O
send	O
a	O

with	O
such	O

as	O
we	O
wanted	O

and	O
money	O
to	O

the	O

which	O
he	O
would	O
take	O
at	O
a	O

rate	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
not	O

Querisao	O
is	O
the	O

island	O
of	O

that	O
the	O

have	O
in	O
the	O
West	PNM

It	O
is	O
about	O
5	O

may	O
be	O
9	O

is	O
a	O
good	O

but	O
the	O
chiefest	O
harbour	O
is	O
about	O
3	O

on	O
the	O

where	O
the	O
Dutch	O
have	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
town	O
and	O
a	O
very	O
strong	O
fort	O

Ships	O
bound	O

must	O
be	O
sure	O
to	O
keep	O
close	O
to	O
the	O

At	O

it	O

Formerly	O
the	O

was	O
never	O

the	O

Captain	O

,	O
commander	O
of	O
a	O
privateer	O
of	O
six	O
guns	O
,	O
had	O
a	O
pleasant	O
accident	O
befall	O
him	O
at	O
this	O
island	O
.	O

He	O
came	O
hither	O
to	O
careen	O
,	O
intending	O
to	O
fit	O
himself	O
very	O
well	O
;	O
for	O
here	O
lay	O
driven	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
masts	O
,	O
yards	O
,	O
timbers	O
,	O
and	O
many	O
things	O
that	O
he	O
wanted	O
,	O
therefore	O
he	O
hauled	O
into	O
the	O
harbour	O
,	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
unrigged	O
his	O
ship	O
.	O

Before	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
a	O
Dutch	O
ship	O
of	O
twenty	O
guns	O
was	O
sent	O
from	O
Querisao	PNM
to	O
take	O
up	O
the	O
guns	O
that	O
were	O
lost	O
on	O
the	O
reef	O
:	O
but	O
seeing	O
a	O
ship	O
in	O
the	O
harbour	O
,	O
and	O
knowing	O
her	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
French	O
privateer	O
,	O
they	O
thought	O
to	O
take	O
her	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
within	O
a	O
mile	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
fire	O
at	O
her	O
,	O
intending	O
to	O
warp	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
narrow	O
going	O
in	O

Captain	O
Pain	O
got	O
ashore	O
some	O
of	O
his	O
guns	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
what	O
he	O
could	O
to	O
resist	O
them	O
;	O
though	O
he	O
did	O
in	O
a	O
manner	O
conclude	O
he	O
must	O
be	O
taken	O
.	O

But	O
while	O
his	O
men	O
were	O
thus	O
busied	O
he	O
spied	O
a	O
Dutch	O
sloop	O
turning	O
to	O
get	O
into	O
the	O
road	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
her	O
at	O
the	O
evening	O
anchor	O
at	O
the	O
west	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

This	O
gave	O
him	O
some	O
hope	O
of	O
making	O
his	O
escape	O
;	O
which	O
he	O
did	O
by	O
sending	O
two	O
Canoas	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
aboard	O
the	O
sloop	O
,	O
who	O
took	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
considerable	O
purchase	O
in	O
her	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
went	O
away	O
in	O
her	O
,	O
making	O
a	O
good	O
reprisal	O
and	O
leaving	O
his	O
own	O
empty	O
ship	O
to	O
the	O
Dutch	O
man-of-war	O

There	O
is	O
another	O

which	O
is	O
overgrown	O
with	O

I	O
have	O
seen	O
it	O

was	O
never	O

There	O
are	O
no	O

that	O
I	O
could	O

Whilst	O

we	O
careen	O
'd	O
Captain	O

was	O
not	O

Accordingly	O
we	O
hauled	O
close	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
small	O
islands	O
and	O
got	O
our	O
guns	O
ashore	O

built	O
a	O

planted	O
all	O

from	O
coming	O
to	O
us	O
while	O
we	O
lay	O
on	O
the	O
careen	O
:	O
then	O
we	O
made	O
a	O
house	O

covered	O
it	O
with	O
our	O

came	O
through	O

to	O

we	O
sold	O
about	O

The	O

we	O

The	O
east	O

of	O
the	O
island	O
is	O
overgrown	O
with	O
black	O
mangrove-trees	O

There	O
are	O
3	O
sorts	O
of	O
mangrove-trees	O
,	O
black	O
,	O
red	O
and	O
white	O

The	O
black	O
mangrove	O
is	O
the	O
largest	O
tree	O
;	O
the	O
body	O
about	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
an	O
oak	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
20	O
feet	O

It	O
is	O
very	O
hard	O

extraordinary	O
heavy	O

therefore	O
not	O
much	O

The	O

mangrove	O
grows	O
commonly	O
by	O
the	O
seaside	O

The	O
body	O
is	O

Cumana	PNM
where	O
the	O
privateers	O
were	O
once	O
repulsed	O
without	O
daring	O
to	O
attempt	O
it	O
any	O
more	O
,	O
being	O
the	O
only	O
place	O
in	O
the	O
North	O

they	O
attempted	O
in	O
vain	O
for	O
many	O
years	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
since	O
throw	O
it	O
in	O
their	O
teeth	O
frequently	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
word	O
of	O
reproach	O
or	O
defiance	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

Not	O
far	O
from	O
that	O
place	O
is	O
Verina	PNM

a	O
small	O
village	O

Spanish	O
plantation	O

famous	O
for	O
its	O

reputed	O
the	O

But	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
Caraccos	PNM
,	O
all	O
this	O
coast	O
is	O
subject	O
to	O
dry	O
winds	O
,	O
generally	O
north-east	O
,	O
which	O
caused	O
us	O
to	O
have	O
scabby	O
lips	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
always	O
found	O
it	O
thus	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
in	O
different	O
seasons	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
on	O
this	O
coast	O
several	O
times	O
.	O

In	O
other	O
respects	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
healthy	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
sweet	O
clear	O
air	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
have	O
lookouts	O
or	O
scouts	O
on	O
the	O
hills	O
,	O
and	O
breast-works	O
in	O
the	O
valleys	O
,	O
and	O
most	O
of	O
their	O
Negroes	O
are	O
furnished	O
with	O
arms	O
also	O
for	O
defence	O
of	O
the	O

The	O
Dutch	O
have	O
a	O
very	O
profitable	O
trade	O
here	O
almost	O
to	O
themselves	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
known	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
great	O
ships	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
each	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
of	O
thirty	O
or	O
forty	O
guns	O
.	O

They	O
carry	O
hither	O
all	O
sorts	O
of	O
European	O
commodities	O
,	O
especially	O
linen	O
;	O
making	O
vast	O
returns	O
,	O
chiefly	O
in	O
silver	O
and	O
Cacoa	PNM
.	O

And	O
I	O
have	O
often	O
wondered	O
and	O
regretted	O
it	O
that	O
none	O
of	O
my	O
own	O
countrymen	O
find	O
the	O
way	O
thither	O
directly	O
from	O
England	PNM
;	O
for	O
our	O
Jamaica	PNM
men	O
trade	O
thither	O
indeed	O
,	O
and	O
find	O
the	O
sweet	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
carry	O
English	O
commodities	O
at	O
second	O
or	O
third	O
hand	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
lay	O
on	O
this	O
coast	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
ashore	O
in	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
bays	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
7	O
or	O
8	O
tun	O
of	O
Cacoa	PNM
;	O
and	O
after	O
that	O
3	O
barks	O
,	O
one	O
laden	O
with	O
hides	O
,	O
the	O
second	O
with	O
European	O
commodities	O
,	O
the	O
third	O
with	O
earthenware	O
and	O

With	O
these	O
3	O
barks	O
we	O
went	O
again	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Roca	PNM
's	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
shared	O
our	O
commodities	O
and	O
separated	O
,	O
having	O
vessels	O
enough	O
to	O
transport	O
us	O
all	O
whither	O
we	O
thought	O
most	O
convenient	O

Twenty	O
of	O
us	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
about	O
60	O

took	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
vessels	O
and	O
our	O
share	O
of	O
the	O
goods	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
directly	O
for	O
Virginia	PNM
.	O

In	O
our	O
way	O
thither	O
we	O
took	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
sucking-fishes	O
:	O
for	O
when	O
we	O
see	O
them	O
about	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
we	O
cast	O
out	O
a	O
line	O
and	O
hook	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
will	O
take	O
it	O
with	O
any	O
manner	O
of	O
bait	O
,	O
whether	O
fish	O
or	O
flesh	O

The	O
sucking-fish	O
is	O
about	O
the	O
bigness	O
of	O
a	O
large	O
whiting	O

and	O
much	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
make	O
towards	O
the	O
tail	O

but	O
the	O
head	O
is	O

From	O
the	O
head	O
to	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
its	O
back	O
there	O
grows	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
flesh	O
of	O
a	O
hard	O
gristly	O
substance	O
like	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
limpet	O
-LRB-	O
a	O
shellfish	O
tapering	O
up	O
pyramidically	O
-RRB-	O
which	O
sticks	O
to	O
the	O
rocks	O
;	O
or	O
like	O
the	O
head	O
or	O
mouth	O
of	O
a	O
shell-snail	O
,	O
but	O
harder	O
.	O

This	O
excrescence	O
is	O
of	O
a	O
flat	O

oval	O
form	O
,	O
about	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
inches	O

five	O
or	O
six	O
broad	O
;	O
and	O
rising	O
about	O
half	O
an	O
inch	O
high	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
full	O
of	O
small	O
ridges	O
with	O
which	O
it	O
will	O
fasten	O
itself	O
to	O
anything	O
that	O
it	O
meets	O
with	O
in	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
just	O
as	O
a	O
snail	O
does	O
to	O
a	O
wall	O
.	O

When	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
happen	O
to	O
come	O
about	O
a	O
ship	O
they	O
seldom	O
leave	O
her	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
will	O
feed	O
on	O
such	O
filth	O
as	O
is	O
daily	O
thrown	O
overboard	O
,	O
or	O
on	O
mere	O
excrements	O
.	O

When	O
it	O
is	O
fair	O
weather	O
,	O
and	O
but	O
little	O
wind	O
,	O
they	O
will	O
play	O
about	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
blustering	O
weather	O
,	O
or	O
when	O
the	O
ship	O
sails	O
quick	O
,	O
they	O
commonly	O
fasten	O
themselves	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
bottom	O
,	O
from	O
whence	O
neither	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
motion	O
,	O
though	O
never	O
so	O
swift	O
,	O
nor	O
the	O
most	O
tempestuous	O
sea	O
can	O
remove	O
them	O
.	O

They	O
will	O
likewise	O
fasten	O
themselves	O
to	O
any	O
other	O
bigger	O
fish	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
never	O
swim	O
fast	O
themselves	O
if	O
they	O
meet	O
with	O
anything	O
to	O
carry	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
found	O
them	O
sticking	O
to	O
a	O
shark	O
after	O
it	O
was	O
hauled	O
in	O
on	O
the	O
deck	O
,	O
though	O
a	O
shark	O
is	O
so	O
strong	O
and	O
boisterous	O
a	O
fish	O
,	O
and	O
throws	O
about	O
him	O
so	O
vehemently	O
for	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
together	O
,	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
,	O
when	O
caught	O
,	O
that	O
did	O
not	O
the	O
sucking-fish	O
stick	O
at	O
no	O
ordinary	O
rate	O
,	O
it	O
must	O
needs	O
be	O
cast	O
off	O
by	O
so	O
much	O
violence	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
usual	O
also	O
to	O
see	O
them	O
sticking	O
to	O
turtle	O
,	O
to	O
any	O
old	O
trees	O
,	O
planks	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
like	O
,	O
that	O
lie	O
driven	O
at	O
sea	O
.	O

Any	O
knobs	O
or	O
inequalities	O
at	O
a	O
ship	O
's	O
bottom	O
are	O
a	O
great	O
hindrance	O
to	O
the	O
swiftness	O
of	O
its	O
sailing	O
;	O
and	O
10	O
or	O
12	O
of	O
these	O
sticking	O
to	O
it	O
must	O
needs	O
retard	O
it	O
as	O
much	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
manner	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
its	O
bottom	O
were	O
foul	O
.	O

So	O
that	O
I	O
am	O
inclined	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
this	O
fish	O
is	O
the	O
remora	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
the	O
ancients	O
tell	O
such	O
stories	O
;	O
if	O
it	O
be	O
not	O
I	O
know	O
no	O
other	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
leave	O
the	O
reader	O
to	O
judge	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
seen	O
of	O
these	O
sucking-fishes	O
in	O
great	O
plenty	O
in	O
the	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM

in	O
all	O
the	O

Coppinger	O
bought	O
for	O
a	O
small	O
matter	O
;	O
yet	O
I	O
believe	O
he	O
gave	O
more	O
than	O
it	O
was	O
worth	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
not	O
a	O
man	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
that	O
knew	O
ambergris	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
have	O
since	O
seen	O
it	O
in	O
other	O
places	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
am	O
certain	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
right	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
of	O
a	O
dark	O
colour	O
,	O
like	O
sheep	O
dung	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
soft	O
,	O
but	O
of	O
no	O
smell	O
,	O
and	O
possibly	O
it	O
was	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
goat	O
's	O
dung	O
.	O

I	O
afterwards	O
saw	O
some	O
sold	O
at	O
the	O
Nicobars	O
in	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
which	O
was	O
of	O
a	O
lighter	O
colour	O
,	O
but	O
very	O
hard	O
,	O
neither	O
had	O
it	O
any	O
smell	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
also	O
I	O
suppose	O
was	O
a	O
cheat	O
.	O

Yet	O
it	O
is	O
certain	O
that	O
in	O
both	O
these	O
places	O
there	O
is	O
ambergris	O
found	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
told	O
by	O
one	O
John	O
Read	O
,	O
a	O
Bristol	O
man	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
apprentice	O
to	O
a	O
master	O
who	O
traded	O
to	O
these	O
islands	O
of	O
Cape	PNM
Verde	PNM
and	O
once	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
riding	O
at	O
an	O
anchor	O
at	O
Fogo	PNM
,	O
another	O
of	O
these	O
islands	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
lump	O
of	O
it	O
swam	O
by	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
boat	O
being	O
ashore	O
he	O
missed	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
knew	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
ambergris	O
,	O
having	O
taken	O
up	O
a	O
lump	O
swimming	O
in	O
the	O
like	O
manner	O
the	O
voyage	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
master	O
having	O
at	O
several	O
times	O
bought	O
pieces	O
of	O
it	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
of	O
the	O
isle	O
of	O
Fogo	PNM
so	O
as	O
to	O
enrich	O
himself	O
thereby	O
.	O

And	O
so	O
at	O
the	O
Nicobars	O
Englishmen	O
have	O
bought	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
credibly	O
informed	O
,	O
great	O
quantities	O
of	O
very	O
good	O
ambergris	O
.	O

Yet	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
are	O
so	O
subtle	O
that	O
they	O
will	O
counterfeit	O
it	O
,	O
both	O
there	O
and	O
here	O
:	O
and	O
I	O
have	O
heard	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
Gulf	PNM
of	PNM
Florida	PNM
,	O
whence	O
much	O
of	O
it	O
comes	O

the	O
native	O

there	O
use	O
the	O

fraud	O

Upon	O
this	O
occasion	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
omit	O
to	O
tell	O
my	O
reader	O
what	O
I	O
learnt	O
from	O
Mr.	O

and	O
likewise	O
very	O
sober	O

told	O
this	O
Mr.	O
Hill	O
that	O
,	O
being	O
in	O
the	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM
Honduras	PNM
to	O

over	O

one	O

a	O

,	O
he	O
found	O
it	O
to	O
weigh	O
a	O

upwards	O

When	O
he	O
first	O
found	O
it	O
it	O
lay	O
dry	O
above	O
the	O

which	O
the	O

came	O
to	O

he	O
observed	O
in	O

Mr.	O

some	O

Besides	O

We	O
went	O
from	O
this	O
Island	O

to	O
St.	PNM

another	O
of	O

lying	O
west-south-west	O

about	O
22	O

We	O
arrived	O
there	O
the	O
next	O

we	O
left	O
the	O

,	O
and	O
anchored	O
on	O
the	O
south-east	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
pretty	O
large	O
island	O

it	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
Cape	PNM

and	O
lies	O
in	O
a	O

The	O
longest	O

which	O

about	O
30	O

and	O
the	O

two	O
about	O
20	O

It	O

rocky	O
all	O
round	O

the	O

yet	O
in	O
the	O

it	O
there	O
are	O

where	O
the	O
Portuguese	O

which	O
inhabit	O
here	O
,	O
have	O
vineyards	O
and	O
plantations	O

and	O
wood	O
for	O

Here	O
are	O
many	O
goats	O

which	O
are	O
but	O
poor	O
in	O
comparison	O
with	O
those	O
in	O

yet	O
much	O
better	O
than	O
those	O

there	O
are	O
likewise	O
many	O

The	O
governor	O
of	O
this	O

came	O
aboard	O
us	O
with	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
gentlemen	O
more	O
in	O
his	O
company	O
who	O
were	O
all	O
indifferently	O
well	O

accoutred	O
with	O
swords	O

;	O
but	O
the	O

that	O
accompanied	O
him	O
to	O
the	O

,	O
which	O
were	O
about	O
twenty	O
or	O
thirty	O
men	O
more	O
,	O
were	O
but	O
in	O
a	O
ragged	O
garb	O

The	O
governor	O
brought	O
aboard	O
some	O
wine	O
made	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
which	O
tasted	O
much	O
like	O
Madeira	PNM
wine	O
:	O
it	O
was	O
of	O
a	O
pale	O
colour	O
,	O
and	O
looked	O
thick	O

He	O
told	O
us	O
the	O
chief	O
town	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
valley	O
fourteen	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
bay	O
where	O
we	O
rode	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
there	O
under	O
him	O
above	O
one	O
hundred	O
families	O

besides	O
other	O
inhabitants	O
that	O
lived	O
scattering	O
in	O

They	O
were	O
all	O
very	O
swarthy	O
;	O
the	O

was	O
the	O
clearest	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
yet	O
of	O
a	O
dark	O
tawny	O
complexion	O

At	O
this	O
island	O
we	O
scrubbed	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
our	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
here	O
also	O
we	O
dug	O
wells	O
ashore	O
on	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
and	O
filled	O
all	O
our	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
5	O
or	O
6	O
days	O

we	O
went	O
from	O

next	O
day	O
and	O
anchoring	O
on	O
the	O
north-west	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O

We	O
sent	O
our	O
boat	O
on	O
shore	O

intending	O
to	O
have	O
purchased	O
some	O
provision	O

as	O
beef	O

with	O
which	O
this	O

is	O
better	O

than	O
the	O

But	O
the	O

would	O
not	O

our	O

to	O

;	O
for	O
about	O
a	O

I	O

the	O

have	O
seen	O
most	O

them	O
at	O
a	O

They	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
mountainous	O

some	O

St.	PNM

but	O
of	O
little	O
note	O

only	O
Fogo	O
is	O
remarkable	O
for	O
its	O

it	O
is	O
all	O

Their	O

The	O

Our	O
entrance	O
among	O
these	O
islands	O
was	O
from	O
the	O
north-east	O
;	O
for	O
in	O
our	O
passage	O
from	O
Virginia	PNM
we	O
ran	O
pretty	O
fair	O
toward	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Gualata	PNM
in	O
Africa	PNM
to	O
preserve	O
the	O
trade-wind	O
,	O
lest	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
borne	O
off	O
too	O
much	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
and	O
so	O
lose	O
the	O
islands	O
.	O

We	O
anchored	O
at	O
the	O
south	O
of	O
Sal	O
and	O
passing	O
by	O
the	O
south	O
of	O
St.	O
Nicholas	O
anchored	O
again	O
at	O
Mayo	PNM
,	O
as	O
has	O
been	O
said	O
;	O
where	O
we	O
made	O
the	O
shorter	O
stay	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
could	O
get	O
no	O
flesh	O
among	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
by	O
reason	O
of	O
the	O
regret	O
they	O
had	O
at	O
their	O
governor	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
men	O
being	O
carried	O
away	O
by	O
Captain	O
Bond	O
.	O

So	O
leaving	O
the	O
isles	O
of	O
Cape	PNM
Verde	PNM
we	O
stood	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
with	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
east-north-east	O
,	O
intending	O
to	O
have	O
touched	O
no	O
more	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
Straits	PNM
of	PNM
Magellan	PNM
.	O

But	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
10	O
degrees	O
north	O
we	O
met	O
the	O
winds	O
at	O
south	O
by	O
W.	O
and	O
south-south-west	O
.	O

Therefore	O
we	O
altered	O
our	O
resolutions	O
and	O
steered	O
away	O
for	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Guinea	PNM
,	O
and	O
in	O
few	O
days	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
of	O
Sherborough	PNM
,	O
which	O
is	O
an	O
English	O
factory	O
lying	O
south	O
of	O
Sierra	PNM
Leone	PNM
.	O

We	O
had	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
who	O
was	O
well	O
acquainted	O
there	O
;	O
and	O
by	O
his	O
direction	O
we	O
went	O
in	O
among	O
the	O
shoals	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
.	O

Sherborough	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
from	O
us	O
so	O
I	O
can	O
give	O
no	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
or	O
our	O
factory	O
there	O
;	O
save	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
informed	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
considerable	O
trade	O
driven	O
there	O
for	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
red	O
wood	O
for	O
dyeing	O
,	O
which	O
grows	O
in	O
that	O
country	O
very	O
plentifully	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
called	O
by	O
our	O
people	O
cam-wood	O
.	O

A	O
little	O
within	O
the	O
shore	O
where	O
we	O
anchored	O
was	O
a	O
town	O
of	O
Negroes	O
,	O
natives	O
of	O
this	O
coast	O

It	O
was	O
screened	O
from	O
our	O
sight	O
by	O
a	O
large	O
grove	O
of	O
trees	O
that	O
grew	O
between	O
them	O
and	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
went	O
thither	O
to	O
them	O
several	O
times	O
during	O
the	O
3	O
or	O
4	O
days	O
of	O
our	O
stay	O
here	O
to	O
refresh	O
ourselves	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
as	O
often	O
came	O
aboard	O
us	O

bringing	O
with	O
them	O
plantains	O

sugar-cane	O
,	O
palm-wines	O
,	O
rice	O
,	O
fowls	O
,	O
and	O
honey	O

which	O
they	O
sold	O
us	O

They	O
were	O
no	O
way	O
shy	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
being	O
well	O
acquainted	O
with	O
the	O
English	O
,	O
by	O
reason	O
of	O
our	O
Guinea	O
factories	O
and	O
trade	O
.	O

This	O
town	O
seemed	O
pretty	O
large	O
;	O
the	O
houses	O
are	O
but	O
low	O
and	O
ordinary	O
:	O
but	O
one	O
great	O
house	O
in	O
the	O

of	O
it	O
where	O
their	O
chief	O
men	O
meet	O
and	O
receive	O
strangers	O

and	O
here	O
they	O
treated	O
us	O
with	O
palm-wine	O

As	O
to	O
their	O
persons	O
,	O
they	O
are	O
like	O

While	O
we	O
lay	O
here	O
we	O
scrubbed	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
our	O
ship	O
and	O
then	O
filled	O
all	O
our	O
water-casks	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
buying	O
up	O
2	O
puncheons	O
of	O
rice	O
for	O
our	O

,	O
we	O
departed	O
from	O
hence	O
about	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
November	O
1683	O
,	O
prosecuting	O
our	O
intended	O
course	O
towards	O
the	O
Straits	PNM
of	PNM
Magellan	PNM
.	O

We	O
had	O
but	O
little	O
wind	O
after	O
we	O
got	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
hot	O
weather	O
with	O
some	O
fierce	O
tornadoes	O
,	O
commonly	O
rising	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
north-east	O
which	O
brought	O
thunder	O
,	O
lightning	O
,	O
and	O
rain	O
.	O

These	O
did	O
not	O
last	O
long	O
;	O
sometimes	O
not	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
wind	O
would	O
shuffle	O
about	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
fall	O
flat	O
calm	O
;	O
for	O
these	O
tornadoes	O
commonly	O
come	O
against	O
the	O
wind	O
that	O
is	O
then	O
blowing	O
,	O
as	O
our	O
thunder-clouds	O
are	O
often	O
observed	O
to	O
do	O
in	O
England	PNM
;	O
but	O
the	O
tornadoes	O
I	O
shall	O
describe	O
more	O
largely	O
in	O
my	O
Chapter	O
of	O
Winds	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
Appendix	O
to	O
this	O
book	O

At	O
this	O
time	O
many	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
were	O
taken	O
with	O
fevers	O
yet	O
we	O
lost	O
but	O
one	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
lay	O
in	O
the	O
calms	O
we	O
caught	O
several	O
great	O
sharks	O
;	O
sometimes	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
in	O
a	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
ate	O
them	O
all	O
,	O
boiling	O
and	O
squeezing	O
them	O
dry	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
stewing	O
them	O
with	O
vinegar	O
,	O
pepper	O
,	O
etc.	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
but	O
little	O
flesh	O
aboard	O
.	O

We	O
took	O
the	O
benefit	O
of	O
every	O
tornado	O
,	O
which	O
came	O
sometimes	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
in	O
a	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
what	O
sail	O
we	O
could	O
to	O
get	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
but	O
little	O
wind	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
over	O
;	O
and	O
those	O
small	O
winds	O
between	O
the	O
tornadoes	O
were	O
much	O
against	O
us	O
,	O
at	O
south	O
by	O
east	O
and	O
south-south-east	O
till	O
we	O
passed	O
the	O
Equinoctial	O
Line	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
crossed	O
about	O
a	O
degree	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
of	O
the	O
meridian	O
of	O
the	O
isle	O
of	O
St.	PNM
Jago	PNM
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Cape	PNM

Islands	PNM

At	O
first	O
we	O
could	O
scarcely	O
lie	O
south-west	O
but	O
,	O
being	O
got	O
a	O
degree	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
of	O
the	O
Line	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
veered	O
most	O
easterly	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
stemmed	O
south-west	O
by	O
south	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
got	O
farther	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
,	O
so	O
the	O
wind	O
came	O
about	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
and	O
freshened	O
upon	O
us	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
3	O
south	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
south-east	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
5	O
we	O
had	O
it	O
at	O
east	O
south	O
where	O
it	O
stood	O
a	O
considerable	O
time	O
and	O
blew	O
a	O
fresh	O
top-gallant	O
gale	O
.	O

We	O
then	O
made	O
the	O
best	O
use	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
steering	O
on	O
briskly	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
sail	O
we	O
could	O
make	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
wind	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
18th	O
of	O
January	O
carried	O
us	O
into	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
36	O
south	O
.	O

In	O
all	O
this	O
time	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
nothing	O
worthy	O
remark	O
;	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
a	O
fish	O
except	O
flying	O
fish	O

which	O
have	O
been	O
so	O

I	O
think	O
it	O
needless	O
to	O

1684	O
Here	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
sea	O
much	O
changed	O
from	O
its	O
natural	O
greenness	O
to	O
a	O
white	O

which	O
caused	O
us	O
to	O

of	O
Sibbel	O

were	O
so	O

From	O
the	O
time	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
10	O
degrees	O
south	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
these	O

had	O
the	O

the	O

The	O
day	O
that	O
we	O
made	O
these	O

we	O
saw	O
great	O
shoals	O
of	O
small	O

coloured	O
the	O
sea	O
in	O
red	O
spots	O
for	O
a	O
mile	O

and	O
we	O
drew	O
some	O

them	O
out	O
of	O
the	O

in	O
our	O
water-buckets	O

I	O

Captain	O

Leaving	O

the	O

as	O
having	O
neither	O

the	O
winds	O
hanging	O

blowing	O
hard	O

oft	O
put	O

that	O

The	O
6th	O
day	O
of	O

we	O
fell	O
in	O
with	O
the	O

We	O

and	O
,	O
seeing	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
mouth	O

and	O
then	O
it	O
fell	O
calm	O

and	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
strong	O
tide	O
setting	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
straits	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
,	O
and	O
like	O
to	O
founder	O
our	O

;	O
but	O
whether	O

I	O

only	O

At	O

At	O

us	O
that	O
at	O

to	O

in	O
the	O

-LRB-	O

mention	O

made	O
of	O
very	O

Valdivia	PNM
:	O
and	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
with	O
whom	O
I	O
have	O
discoursed	O
have	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
high	O
land	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
between	O
Coquimbo	PNM

-RRB-	O
and	O
Valdivia	PNM
,	O
which	O
is	O
in	O
40	O

so	O
that	O
by	O
all	O
likelihood	O
these	O
ridges	O

do	O
run	O
in	O

The	O
excessive	O
height	O
of	O
these	O

may	O
possibly	O
be	O
the	O
reason	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
no	O
rivers	O
of	O

that	O
fall	O
into	O
these	O

Some	O

very	O

of	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
in	O
some	O

there	O
is	O
not	O
one	O
that	O
comes	O
out	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
in	O
150	O
or	O
200	O
leagues	O

where	O
they	O

they	O
are	O
30	O

shallow	O
to	O

Besides	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
do	O
not	O

run	O

but	O
are	O
dry	O
at	O
certain	O

the	O
17th	O
of	O
May	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
our	O
men	O
were	O
mustered	O
of	O
both	O
ships	O
'	O
companies	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
arms	O
proved	O

We	O
were	O
in	O
all	O
108	O
men	O
fit	O
for	O
service	O
besides	O
the	O
sick	O
:	O
and	O
the	O
next	O

we	O
intended	O
to	O
sail	O

take	O
the	O

But	O
the	O
next	O

,	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
being	O
ashore	O

on	O
the	O

the	O

between	O
it	O

the	O

We	O
soon	O
got	O
our	O
anchors	O
up	O
and	O
chased	O
:	O
and	O
Captain	O
Eaton	O
,	O
who	O
drew	O
the	O

draught	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
put	O
through	O
between	O
the	O

and	O
went	O
after	O
those	O

that	O
were	O
without	O
the	O

We	O
in	O
Captain	O
Cook	O

ship	O
went	O
after	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
which	O
stood	O
in	O
for	O
the	O
mainland	O

but	O
we	O
soon	O
fetched	O
her	O
up	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
taken	O
her	O
,	O
stood	O
in	O
again	O
with	O
her	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
saw	O
that	O
Captain	O
Eaton	O
wanted	O
no	O
help	O
,	O
having	O
taken	O
both	O
those	O
that	O
he	O
went	O
after	O
.	O

He	O
came	O
in	O
with	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
prizes	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
other	O
was	O
so	O
far	O
to	O
leeward	O
and	O
so	O
deep	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
then	O
get	O
her	O
in	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
hoped	O
to	O
get	O
her	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
:	O

being	O
deep	O

to	O
go	O
down	O
before	O
the	O

to	O
Panama	PNM

she	O
would	O
not	O

The	O
19th	O
day	O
she	O
turned	O
all	O
day	O
,	O
but	O
got	O
nothing	O

the	O

Our	O
Moskito	O

,	O
according	O
to	O
their	O

struck	O
six	O

These	O

Two	O

them	O
were	O
laden	O
as	O
deep	O

they	O
could	O
swim	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
was	O
not	O
above	O

not	O
sail	O
till	O
we	O
were	O
gone	O
out	O

for	O
he	O

In	O
the	O
biggest	O

was	O
a	O

to	O
the	O

Upon	O
this	O

we	O
altered	O
our	O

and	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
our	O
three	O

which	O
are	O

I	O
shall	O
here	O
omit	O
the	O
description	O
of	O
Truxillo	PNM

in	O
my	O
Appendix	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
latter	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
book	O

I	O

towards	O
California	PNM

The	O
19th	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
we	O
sailed	O
from	O
the	O
island	O
Lobos	PNM
with	O
Captain	O
Eaton	O
in	O
our	O
company	O
.	O

We	O
carried	O
the	O
three	O
flour	O
prizes	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
our	O
first	O
prize	O
laden	O
with	O
timber	O
we	O
left	O
here	O
at	O
an	O
anchor	O
;	O
the	O
wind	O
was	O
at	O
south	O
by	O
east	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
common	O
trade-wind	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
steered	O
away	O
N.	O
W.	O
by	O
north	O
intending	O
to	O
run	O
into	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
the	O
isles	O
Gallapagos	O
,	O
and	O
steer	O
off	O
west	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
the	O
certain	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
could	O
not	O
shape	O
a	O
direct	O
course	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
within	O
40	O
minutes	O
of	O
the	O
Equator	O
we	O
steered	O
west	O
,	O
having	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
south	O
,	O
a	O
very	O
moderate	O
gentle	O
gale	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
31st	O
day	O
of	O
May	O
when	O
we	O
first	O
had	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
islands	O
Gallapagos	O
:	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
appeared	O
on	O
our	O
weather	O
bow	O
,	O
some	O
on	O
our	O
lee	O
bow	O
,	O
others	O
right	O
ahead	O
.	O

We	O
at	O
first	O
sight	O
trimmed	O
our	O
sails	O
and	O
steered	O
as	O
nigh	O
the	O
wind	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
striving	O
to	O
get	O
to	O
the	O
southermost	O
of	O
them	O
but	O
,	O
our	O
prizes	O
being	O
deep	O
laden	O
,	O
their	O
sails	O
but	O
small	O
and	O
thin	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
very	O
small	O
gale	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
keep	O
up	O
with	O
us	O
;	O
therefore	O
we	O
likewise	O
edged	O
away	O
again	O
a	O
point	O
from	O
the	O
wind	O
to	O
keep	O
near	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
the	O
ship	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
and	O
Captain	O
Eaton	O
anchored	O
on	O
the	O
east	O

one	O
of	O
the	O

The	O
Gallapagos	O
Islands	O
are	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
uninhabited	O
islands	O
lying	O
under	O
and	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
of	O
the	O
Equator	O
.	O

The	O
eastermost	O
of	O
them	O
are	O
about	O
110	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
Main	O

They	O
are	O
laid	O
down	O
in	O
the	O

181	O
,	O
reaching	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
176	O
,	O
therefore	O
their	O
longitude	O
from	O
England	PNM
westward	O
is	O
about	O
68	O
degrees	O

But	O
I	O
believe	O
our	O
hydrographers	O
do	O
not	O
place	O
them	O
far	O
enough	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O

The	O

They	O

They	O

a	O
few	O
dildoe-trees	O

The	O
dildoe-tree	O
is	O
a	O
green	O

shrub	O
that	O
grows	O
about	O
10	O

Close	O

in	O
the	O

I	O
did	O
never	O

any	O

There	O
is	O
water	O
on	O
these	O

among	O
the	O

Some	O
other	O
of	O
these	O
islands	O
are	O
mostly	O
plain	O
and	O
low	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
land	O
more	O
fertile	O

producing	O
trees	O
of	O
divers	O

Some	O
of	O
the	O

of	O
these	O

are	O
nine	O

ten	O

six	O

seven	O

the	O

In	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
when	O
they	O

discovered	O
these	O

found	O
multitudes	O

and	O
named	O

I	O
do	O
believe	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
place	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
that	O
is	O
so	O
plentifully	O
stored	O

The	O
Guanos	O
here	O
are	O
fat	O
and	O
large	O
as	O
any	O
that	O
I	O
ever	O
saw	O

they	O
are	O
so	O

The	O
land-turtle	O
are	O
here	O
so	O
numerous	O
that	O
5	O
or	O
600	O
men	O
might	O
subsist	O
on	O
them	O
alone	O
for	O
several	O
months	O
without	O
any	O

no	O

One	O

the	O

3	O

4	O
sorts	O
of	O
these	O
creatures	O
in	O
the	O
West	PNM
Indies	PNM
.	O

One	O
is	O
called	O
by	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
hecatee	O
;	O
these	O
live	O
most	O
in	O
fresh-water	O
ponds	O
,	O
and	O
seldom	O
come	O
on	O
land	O
.	O

They	O
weigh	O
about	O
10	O
or	O
15	O
pound	O
;	O
they	O
have	O
small	O
legs	O
and	O
flat	O
feet	O
,	O
and	O
small	O
long	O
necks	O
.	O

Another	O
sort	O
is	O
called	O
tenapen	O
;	O
these	O
are	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
less	O
than	O
the	O
hecatee	O
;	O
the	O
shell	O
on	O
their	O
backs	O
is	O
all	O
carved	O
naturally	O
,	O
finely	O
wrought	O
,	O
and	O
well	O
clouded	O
:	O
the	O
backs	O
of	O
these	O
are	O
rounder	O
than	O
those	O
before	O
mentioned	O
;	O
they	O
are	O
otherwise	O
much	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
form	O
:	O
these	O
delight	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
wet	O
swampy	O
places	O
,	O
or	O
on	O
the	O
land	O
near	O
such	O
places	O
.	O

Both	O
these	O
sorts	O
are	O
very	O
good	O
meat	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
in	O
great	O
plenty	O
on	O
the	O
isles	O
of	O
Pines	O
near	O
Cuba	PNM
:	O
there	O
the	O
Spanish	O
hunters	O
when	O
they	O
meet	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
bring	O
them	O
home	O
to	O
their	O
huts	O
,	O
and	O
mark	O
them	O
by	O
notching	O
their	O
shells	O
,	O
then	O
let	O
them	O
go	O
;	O
this	O
they	O
do	O
to	O
have	O
them	O
at	O
hand	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
never	O
ramble	O
far	O
from	O
thence	O

When	O
these	O
hunters	O
return	O
to	O
Cuba	PNM
,	O
after	O
about	O
a	O
month	O
or	O
six	O
weeks	O
'	O
stay	O
,	O
they	O
carry	O
with	O
them	O
3	O
or	O
400	O
or	O
more	O
of	O
these	O
creatures	O
to	O
sell	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
are	O
very	O
good	O
meat	O
,	O
and	O
every	O
man	O
knows	O
his	O
own	O
by	O
their	O
marks	O
.	O

These	O
tortoise	O
in	O
the	O
Gallapagos	O
are	O
more	O
like	O
the	O
hecatee	O
except	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
before	O
,	O
they	O
are	O
much	O
bigger	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
very	O
long	O
small	O
necks	O
and	O
little	O
heads	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
some	O
green	O
snakes	O
on	O
these	O
islands	O
,	O
but	O
no	O
other	O
land	O
animal	O
that	O
I	O
did	O
ever	O
see	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
great	O
plenty	O
of	O
turtle-doves	O
so	O
tame	O
that	O
a	O
man	O
may	O
kill	O
5	O
or	O
6	O
dozen	O
in	O
a	O
forenoon	O
with	O
a	O
stick	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
somewhat	O
less	O
than	O
a	O
pigeon	O
,	O
and	O
are	O
very	O
good	O
meat	O
,	O
and	O
commonly	O
fat	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
good	O
wide	O
channels	O
between	O
these	O
islands	O
fit	O
for	O
ships	O
to	O
pass	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
some	O
places	O
shoal	O
water	O
where	O
there	O
grows	O
plenty	O
of	O
turtle-grass	O
;	O
therefore	O
these	O
islands	O
are	O
plentifully	O
stored	O
with	O
sea-turtle	O
of	O
that	O
sort	O
which	O
is	O
called	O
the	O
green	O
turtle	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
hitherto	O
deferred	O
the	O
description	O
of	O
these	O
creatures	O
therefore	O
I	O
shall	O
give	O
it	O
here	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
4	O
sorts	O
of	O
sea-turtle	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
the	O
trunk-turtle	O
,	O
the	O
loggerhead	O
,	O
the	O
hawksbill	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
green	O
turtle	O
.	O

The	O
trunk-turtle	O
is	O
commonly	O
bigger	O
than	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
their	O
backs	O
are	O
higher	O
and	O
rounder	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
flesh	O
rank	O
and	O
not	O
wholesome	O
.	O

The	O
loggerhead	O
is	O
so	O
called	O
because	O
it	O
has	O
a	O
great	O
head	O
,	O
much	O
bigger	O
than	O
the	O
other	O
sorts	O
;	O
their	O
flesh	O
is	O
likewise	O
very	O
rank	O
,	O
and	O
seldom	O
eaten	O
but	O
in	O
case	O
of	O
necessity	O
:	O
they	O
feed	O
on	O
moss	O
that	O
grows	O
about	O
rocks	O
.	O

The	O
hawksbill-turtle	O
is	O
the	O
least	O
kind	O
,	O
they	O
are	O
so	O
called	O
because	O
their	O
mouths	O
are	O
long	O
and	O
small	O
,	O
somewhat	O
resembling	O
the	O
bill	O
of	O
a	O
hawk	O
:	O
on	O
the	O
backs	O
of	O
these	O
hawksbill	O
turtle	O
grows	O
that	O
shell	O
which	O
is	O
so	O
much	O
esteemed	O
for	O
making	O
cabinets	O
,	O
combs	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
things	O
.	O

The	O
largest	O
of	O
them	O
may	O
have	O
3	O
pound	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
of	O
shell	O
;	O
I	O
have	O
taken	O
some	O
that	O
have	O
had	O
3	O
pound	O
10	O
ounces	O
:	O
but	O
they	O
commonly	O
have	O
a	O
pound	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
or	O
two	O
pound	O
;	O
some	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
.	O

These	O
are	O
but	O
ordinary	O
food	O
,	O
but	O
generally	O
sweeter	O
than	O
the	O
loggerhead	O
:	O
yet	O
these	O
hawksbills	O
in	O
some	O
places	O
are	O
unwholesome	O
,	O
causing	O
them	O
that	O
eat	O
them	O
to	O
purge	O
and	O
vomit	O
excessively	O
,	O
especially	O
those	O
between	O
the	O
Samballoes	O
and	O
Portobello	PNM
.	O

We	O
meet	O
with	O
other	O
fish	O
in	O
the	O
West	O
Indies	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
malignant	O
nature	O
:	O
but	O
I	O
shall	O
describe	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
Appendix	O
.	O

These	O
hawksbill-turtles	O
are	O
better	O
or	O
worse	O
according	O
to	O
their	O
feeding	O
.	O

In	O
some	O
places	O
they	O
feed	O
on	O
grass	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
green	O
tortoise	O
also	O
does	O
;	O
in	O
other	O
places	O
they	O
keep	O
among	O
rocks	O
and	O
feed	O
on	O
moss	O
or	O
seaweeds	O
;	O
but	O
these	O
are	O
not	O
so	O
sweet	O
as	O
those	O
that	O
eat	O
grass	O
,	O
neither	O
is	O
their	O
shell	O
so	O
clear	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
are	O
commonly	O
overgrown	O
with	O
barnacles	O
which	O
spoil	O
the	O
shell	O
;	O
and	O
their	O
flesh	O
is	O
commonly	O
yellow	O
,	O
especially	O
the	O
fat	O

Hawksbill-turtle	O
are	O
in	O
many	O
places	O
of	O
the	O

These	O
and	O
all	O

time	O
80	O

In	O

When	O
a	O
sea-turtle	O
turns	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
to	O
lay	O
she	O
is	O
at	O

an	O
hour	O
before	O
she	O
returns	O
again	O

for	O
she	O
is	O
to	O
go	O
above	O

and	O
if	O
it	O
be	O
low-water	O
when	O
she	O
comes	O
ashore	O
,	O
she	O
must	O
rest	O
once	O

being	O
heavy	O
,	O
before	O
she	O
comes	O
to	O
the	O
place	O

she	O
lays	O

When	O
she	O
has	O
found	O
a	O
place	O
for	O
her	O
purpose	O
she	O
makes	O
a	O
great	O
hole	O
with	O
her	O
fins	O
in	O
the	O
sand	O
,	O
wherein	O
she	O
lays	O
her	O
eggs	O

then	O
covers	O
them	O
2	O
foot	O

with	O
the	O

come	O
ashore	O
the	O
next	O

All	O
sorts	O
of	O
turtle	O
use	O
the	O
same	O
methods	O
in	O
laying	O
.	O

I	O
knew	O
a	O
man	O
in	O
Jamaica	PNM
that	O
made	O
8	O
pound	O
Sterling	O
of	O
the	O
shell	O
of	O
these	O
hawksbill	O
turtle	O
which	O
he	O
got	O
in	O
one	O
season	O
and	O
in	O
one	O
small	O
bay	O
,	O
not	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
long	O
.	O

The	O
manner	O
of	O
taking	O
them	O
is	O
to	O
watch	O
the	O
bay	O
by	O
walking	O
from	O
one	O

all	O
night	O

making	O
no	O
noise	O

keeping	O
any	O
sort	O
of	O

When	O
the	O
turtle	O
comes	O
ashore	O
the	O
man	O
that	O
watches	O
for	O
them	O
turns	O
them	O
on	O
their	O

then	O
hauls	O
them	O
above	O

A	O
large	O
green	O
turtle	O

with	O
her	O
weight	O

The	O
hawksbill-turtle	O
are	O
not	O
only	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
West	PNM

on	O
the	O
coast	O

I	O
never	O

any	O
in	O
the	O
South	PNM

The	O
green	O
turtle	O
are	O
so	O
called	O
because	O
their	O
shell	O
is	O
greener	O
than	O
any	O
other	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
very	O
thin	O
and	O
clear	O
and	O
better	O
clouded	O
than	O
the	O
hawksbill	O

but	O
it	O
is	O
used	O
only	O
for	O
inlays	O

being	O
extraordinary	O
thin	O

These	O
turtles	O
are	O
generally	O
larger	O

the	O
hawksbill	O
;	O
one	O
will	O
weigh	O
2	O

their	O
heads	O
round	O

One	O
thing	O
is	O
very	O
strange	O

remarkable	O
in	O
these	O

that	O
at	O

it	O
is	O
not	O

The	O
most	O
remarkable	O
places	O
that	O
I	O
did	O
ever	O
hear	O
of	O
for	O
their	O

is	O
at	O
an	O

Doubtless	O
they	O
swim	O
some	O
hundreds	O

to	O
those	O
two	O

for	O

at	O

that	O

it	O

Those	O
that	O

In	O
the	O

the	O
place	O
where	O
they	O

from	O

at	O

the	O

It	O
is	O
reported	O
of	O
these	O

that	O
they	O
are	O
nine	O

in	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
the	O
male	O
on	O
the	O
female	O
's	O
back	O

It	O
is	O
observable	O
that	O
the	O
male	O
,	O
while	O
engendering	O
,	O
do	O
not	O
easily	O
forsake	O
their	O
female	O
:	O
for	O
I	O
have	O
gone	O
and	O
taken	O
hold	O
of	O
the	O
male	O
when	O
engendering	O
:	O
and	O
a	O
very	O
bad	O
striker	O
may	O
strike	O
them	O
then	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
male	O
is	O
not	O
shy	O
at	O
all	O
:	O
but	O
the	O
female	O
,	O
seeing	O
a	O
boat	O
when	O
they	O
rise	O
to	O
blow	O
,	O
would	O
make	O
her	O
escape	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
male	O
grasps	O
her	O
with	O
his	O
two	O
fore	O
fins	O
,	O
and	O
holds	O
her	O
fast	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
are	O
thus	O
coupled	O
it	O
is	O
best	O
to	O
strike	O
the	O
female	O
first	O
,	O
then	O
you	O
are	O
sure	O
of	O
the	O
male	O
also	O

These	O
creatures	O
are	O
thought	O
to	O
live	O
to	O
a	O
great	O
age	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
observed	O
by	O
the	O
Jamaica	PNM
turtlers	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
many	O
years	O
before	O
they	O
come	O

The	O
air	O
of	O
these	O

is	O
temperate	O

the	O

Here	O
is	O
constantly	O
a	O

sea-breeze	O
all	O
day	O

and	O
cooling	O

one	O
night	O
because	O
our	O

We	O

and	O
the	O

The	O
next	O
island	O

that	O
we	O
came	O

two	O

about	O
five	O

We	O
anchored	O
in	O

We	O
turned	O
them	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
more	O
came	O
up	O

it	O
to	O
be	O
their	O
custom	O
to	O
lie	O
in	O
the	O

so	O
we	O
never	O
took	O

sent	O
ashore	O
the	O

who	O
killed	O
as	O

Captain	O

§	O
There	O
he	O

in	O
his	O

12	O

The	O
year	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
islands	O
was	O
probably	O
the	O

Isla	PNM

Having	O
thus	O
concluded	O
;	O
the	O
12th	O
of	O
June	O
we	O
sailed	O
from	O
hence	O
,	O
designing	O
to	O
touch	O
at	O
the	O
island	O
Cocos	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
to	O
put	O
ashore	O
some	O
flour	O
there	O
as	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
our	O
way	O
to	O
Ria	PNM
Lexa	PNM
.	O

We	O
steered	O
north	O
till	O
in	O
latitude	O
4	O
degrees	O
40	O
minutes	O
,	O
intending	O
then	O
to	O
steer	O
west	O
by	O
north	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
expected	O
to	O
have	O
had	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
south	O
by	O
east	O
or	O
south-south-east	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
on	O
the	O
south	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
Equator	O
.	O

Thus	O
I	O
had	O
formerly	O
found	O
the	O
winds	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
in	O
these	O
latitudes	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
we	O
first	O
parted	O
from	O
the	O
Gallapagos	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
south	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
sailed	O
farther	O
north	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
winds	O
at	O
south	O
by	O
W.	O
then	O
at	O
south-south-west	O
,	O
winds	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
expect	O
.	O

We	O
thought	O
at	O
first	O
that	O
the	O
wind	O
would	O
come	O
about	O
again	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
sail	O
off	O
west	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
Cocos	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
south-west	O
by	O
south	O
and	O
could	O
lie	O
but	O
west	O
by	O
north	O
.	O

Yet	O
we	O
stood	O
that	O
course	O
till	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
5	O
degrees	O
40	O
minutes	O
north	O
and	O
then	O
despairing	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
winds	O
were	O
,	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
island	O
Cocos	O
,	O
we	O
steered	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
Main	O
;	O
for	O
had	O
we	O
seen	O
the	O
island	O
then	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
fetched	O
it	O
,	O
being	O
so	O
far	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
island	O
Cocos	O
is	O
so	O
named	O
by	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
because	O
there	O
are	O
abundance	O
of	O
coconut-trees	O
growing	O
on	O
it	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
not	O
only	O
in	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
places	O
but	O
grow	O
in	O
great	O
groves	O
,	O
all	O
round	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
sea	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
an	O
uninhabited	O
island	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
7	O
or	O
8	O
leagues	O
round	O
and	O
pretty	O
high	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
,	O
where	O
it	O
is	O
destitute	O
of	O
trees	O
,	O
but	O
looks	O
very	O
green	O
and	O
pleasant	O
with	O
a	O
herb	O
called	O
by	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
gramadael	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
low	O
land	O
by	O
the	O
seaside	O
.	O

This	O
island	O
is	O
in	O
5	O
degrees	O
15	O
minutes	O
north	O
of	O
the	O
Equator	O
;	O
it	O
is	O
environed	O
with	O
rocks	O
,	O
which	O
makes	O
it	O
almost	O
inaccessible	O
:	O
only	O
at	O
the	O
north-east	O
end	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
small	O
harbour	O
where	O
ships	O
may	O
safely	O
enter	O
and	O
ride	O
secure	O

In	O
this	O
harbour	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
fine	O
brook	O
of	O
fresh	O
water	O
running	O
into	O
the	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
account	O
that	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
give	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
same	O
also	O
from	O
Captain	O
Eaton	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
there	O
afterward	O

Any	O
who	O
like	O
us	O
had	O
not	O
experienced	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
winds	O
in	O
these	O
parts	O
might	O
reasonably	O
expect	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
have	O
sailed	O
with	O
a	O
flown	O
sheet	O
to	O
Ria	PNM
Lexa	PNM
;	O
but	O
we	O
found	O
ourselves	O
mistaken	O
,	O
for	O
as	O
we	O
came	O
nearer	O
the	O
shore	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
winds	O
right	O
in	O
our	O
teeth	O

I	O

refer	O
my	O

of	O
Winds	O
in	O
the	O

account	O

We	O
had	O
very	O
fair	O
weather	O

in	O
this	O
voyage	O
from	O

When	O

are	O
off	O

either	O

they	O

it	O

About	O

Captain	O

To	O
whom	O
our	O

that	O
the	O

The	O
three	O

who	O
were	O
very	O

at	O

began	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
bold	O

,	O
drawing	O

our	O

up	O

purposely	O
to	O

Our	O
men	O
often	O
laughed	O
at	O
their	O
temerity	O

and	O
asked	O
them	O
if	O
they	O
never	O
saw	O
any	O

They	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
they	O
themselves	O

that	O
they	O
lived	O
among	O
Spaniards	O

and	O
that	O
although	O
they	O
were	O

yet	O
they	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
3	O

our	O

At	O

they	O

them	O

Captain	O

for	O

These	O
Spanish	O

told	O
us	O
likewise	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
sent	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
taken	O
in	O

to	O

these	O
were	O
those	O
mentioned	O
by	O
the	O
president	O
of	O
Panama	PNM
:	O
it	O
being	O
demanded	O
of	O
them	O
to	O
give	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
estate	O
and	O
riches	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
;	O
they	O
said	O
that	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
were	O
most	O
husbandmen	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
employed	O
either	O
in	O
planting	O
and	O
manuring	O
of	O
corn	O
,	O
or	O
chiefly	O
about	O
cattle	O
;	O
they	O
having	O
large	O
savannahs	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
well	O
stored	O
with	O
bulls	O

;	O
that	O
by	O
the	O

in	O
some	O

there	O
grew	O
some	O
red-wood	O
,	O
useful	O
in	O
dyeing	O
;	O
of	O
this	O
they	O
said	O
there	O
was	O
little	O
profit	O
made	O
,	O
because	O
they	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
send	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
Lake	O
of	O
Nicaragua	PNM
,	O
which	O
runs	O
into	O
the	O
North	PNM
Seas	PNM
:	O
that	O
they	O
sent	O
thither	O
also	O
great	O
quantities	O
of	O
bull	O
and	O
cow-hides	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
from	O

in	O

Europe	PNM
commodities	O
;	O
as	O
hats	O

wherewith	O
they	O
clothed	O
themselves	O
;	O
that	O
the	O
flesh	O
of	O
the	O
cattle	O
turned	O
to	O
no	O
other	O
profit	O
than	O
sustenance	O
for	O
their	O

as	O
for	O

they	O

but	O
little	O
in	O
those	O
parts	O

After	O
they	O
had	O
given	O
this	O
relation	O
they	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
wanted	O
provision	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
beef	O
estancia	O
,	O
or	O
farm	O
of	O
bulls	O
and	O
cows	O
,	O
about	O
three	O
mile	O
off	O
where	O
we	O
might	O
kill	O
what	O
we	O
pleased	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
welcome	O
news	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
sort	O
of	O
flesh	O
since	O
we	O
left	O
the	O
Gallapagos	O
;	O
therefore	O
twenty-four	O
of	O
us	O
immediately	O
entered	O
into	O
two	O
boats	O
,	O
taking	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
Spanish	O
Indians	O
with	O
us	O
for	O
a	O
pilot	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
ashore	O
about	O
a	O
league	O
from	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

There	O
we	O
hauled	O
up	O
our	O
boats	O
dry	O
and	O
marched	O
all	O
away	O
,	O
following	O
our	O
guide	O
,	O
who	O
soon	O
brought	O
us	O
to	O
some	O
houses	O
and	O
a	O
large	O
pen	O
for	O
cattle	O
.	O

This	O
pen	O
stood	O
in	O
a	O
large	O
savannah	O
,	O
about	O
two	O
mile	O
from	O
our	O
boats	O
:	O
there	O
were	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
fat	O
bulls	O
and	O
cows	O
feeding	O
in	O
the	O
savannahs	O
;	O
some	O
of	O
us	O
would	O
have	O
killed	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
to	O
carry	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
but	O
others	O
opposed	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
better	O
to	O
stay	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
drive	O
the	O
cattle	O
into	O
the	O
pen	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
kill	O
20	O
or	O
30	O
,	O
or	O
as	O
many	O
as	O
we	O
pleased	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
minded	O
to	O
return	O
aboard	O
,	O
and	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
persuade	O
them	O
all	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
but	O
some	O
would	O
not	O
,	O
therefore	O
I	O
returned	O
with	O
12	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
half	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
the	O
other	O
12	O
behind	O
.	O

At	O
this	O
place	O
I	O
saw	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
tun	O
of	O
the	O
redwood	O
;	O
which	O
I	O
take	O
to	O
be	O
that	O
sort	O
of	O
wood	O
,	O
called	O
in	O
Jamaica	PNM
blood-wood	O
,	O
or	O
Nicaragua-wood	O
.	O

We	O
who	O
returned	O
aboard	O
met	O
no	O
one	O
to	O
oppose	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
we	O
expected	O
our	O
consorts	O
that	O
we	O
left	O
ashore	O
,	O
but	O
none	O
came	O
;	O
therefore	O
at	O
four	O
a	O
clock	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
ten	O
men	O
went	O
in	O
our	O
Canoa	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
was	O
become	O
of	O
them	O
:	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
bay	O
where	O
we	O
landed	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
estancia	O
they	O
found	O
our	O
men	O
all	O
on	O
a	O
small	O
rock	O
,	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
standing	O
in	O
the	O
water	O
up	O
to	O
their	O
waists	O
.	O

These	O
men	O
had	O
slept	O
ashore	O
in	O
the	O
house	O
and	O
turned	O
out	O
betimes	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
to	O
pen	O
the	O
cattle	O
;	O
2	O
or	O
3	O
went	O
one	O
way	O
and	O
as	O
many	O
another	O
way	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
cattle	O
to	O
the	O
pen	O
,	O
and	O
others	O
stood	O
at	O
the	O
pen	O
to	O
drive	O
them	O
in	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
were	O
thus	O
scattered	O
about	O
40	O
or	O
50	O
armed	O
Spaniards	O
came	O
in	O
among	O
them	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
immediately	O
called	O
to	O
each	O
other	O
and	O
drew	O
together	O
in	O
a	O
body	O
before	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
could	O
attack	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
marched	O
to	O
their	O
boat	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
hauled	O
up	O
dry	O
on	O
the	O
sand	O
.	O

But	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
sandy	O
bay	O
they	O
found	O
their	O
boat	O
all	O
in	O
flames	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
unpleasing	O
sight	O
for	O
they	O
knew	O
not	O
how	O
to	O
get	O
aboard	O
unless	O
they	O
marched	O
by	O
land	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
Captain	O
Cook	O
was	O
buried	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
near	O
a	O
league	O
.	O

The	O
greatest	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
was	O
thick	O
woods	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
might	O
easily	O
lay	O
an	O
ambush	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
at	O
which	O
they	O
are	O
very	O
expert	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
now	O
thought	O
them	O
secure	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
came	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
asked	O
them	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
pleased	O
to	O
walk	O
to	O
their	O
plantations	O
,	O
with	O
many	O
other	O
such	O
flouts	O
;	O
but	O
our	O
men	O
answered	O
never	O
a	O
word	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
about	O
half	O
ebb	O
when	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
took	O
notice	O
of	O
a	O
rock	O
a	O
good	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
just	O
appearing	O
above	O
water	O
;	O
he	O
showed	O
it	O
to	O
his	O
consorts	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
them	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
good	O
castle	O
for	O
them	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
get	O
thither	O
.	O

They	O
all	O
wished	O
themselves	O
there	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
who	O
lay	O
as	O
yet	O
at	O
a	O
good	O
distance	O
from	O
them	O
behind	O
the	O
bushes	O
,	O
as	O
secure	O
of	O
their	O
prey	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
whistle	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
a	O
shot	O
among	O
them	O
.	O

Having	O
therefore	O
well	O
considered	O
the	O
place	O
together	O
with	O
the	O
danger	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
,	O
they	O
proposed	O
to	O
send	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
tallest	O
men	O
to	O
try	O
if	O
the	O
sea	O
between	O
them	O
and	O
the	O
rock	O
were	O
fordable	O
.	O

This	O
counsel	O
they	O
presently	O
put	O
in	O
execution	O
and	O
found	O
it	O
according	O
to	O
their	O
desire	O
.	O

So	O
they	O
all	O
marched	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
rock	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
remained	O
till	O
the	O
Canoa	O
came	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
which	O
was	O
about	O
seven	O
hours	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
latter	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
ebb	O
when	O
they	O
first	O
went	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
rock	O
was	O
dry	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
the	O
tide	O
of	O
flood	O
returned	O
again	O
the	O
rock	O
was	O
covered	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
water	O
still	O
flowing	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
if	O
our	O
Canoa	O
had	O
stayed	O
but	O
one	O
hour	O
longer	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
in	O
as	O
great	O
danger	O
of	O
their	O
lives	O
from	O
the	O
sea	O
as	O
before	O
from	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
tide	O
rises	O
here	O
about	O
eight	O
foot	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
remained	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
expecting	O
to	O
see	O
them	O
destroyed	O
,	O
but	O
never	O
came	O
from	O
behind	O
the	O
bushes	O
where	O
they	O
first	O
planted	O
themselves	O
;	O
they	O
having	O
not	O
above	O
3	O
or	O
4	O
hand-guns	O
,	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
them	O
being	O
armed	O
with	O
lances	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
in	O
these	O
parts	O
are	O
very	O
expert	O
in	O
heaving	O
or	O
darting	O
the	O
lance	O
;	O
with	O
which	O
upon	O
occasion	O
,	O
they	O
will	O
do	O
great	O
feats	O
,	O
especially	O
in	O
ambuscades	O
:	O
and	O
by	O
their	O
good	O
will	O
,	O
they	O
care	O
not	O
for	O
fighting	O
otherwise	O
,	O
but	O
content	O
themselves	O
with	O
standing	O
aloof	O
,	O
threatening	O
and	O
calling	O
names	O
,	O
at	O
which	O
they	O
are	O
as	O
expert	O
as	O
the	O
other	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
if	O
their	O
tongues	O
be	O
quiet	O
,	O
we	O
always	O
take	O
it	O
for	O
granted	O
they	O
have	O
laid	O
some	O
ambush	O
.	O

Before	O
night	O
our	O
Canoa	O
came	O
aboard	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
our	O
men	O
all	O
safe	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
two	O
Canoas	O
were	O
sent	O
to	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
to	O
seek	O
for	O
a	O
large	O
Canoa	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
informed	O
was	O
there	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
have	O
neither	O
ships	O
nor	O
barks	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
but	O
a	O
few	O
Canoas	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
seldom	O
use	O
:	O
neither	O
are	O
there	O
any	O
fishermen	O
here	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
judge	O
,	O
because	O
fish	O
is	O
very	O
scarce	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
never	O
saw	O
any	O
here	O
,	O
neither	O
could	O
any	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
ever	O
take	O
any	O
;	O
and	O
yet	O
wherever	O
we	O
come	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
we	O
always	O
send	O
out	O
our	O
strikers	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
our	O
hooks	O
and	O
lines	O
overboard	O
,	O
to	O
try	O
for	O
fish	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
our	O
men	O
returned	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
and	O
brought	O
the	O
Canoa	PNM
with	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
sent	O
for	O
,	O
and	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
days	O
afterwards	O
the	O
two	O
Canoas	O
were	O
sent	O
out	O
again	O
for	O
another	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
likewise	O
brought	O
aboard	O

These	O
Canoas	O
were	O
fitted	O
with	O
thwarts	O

fit	O
for	O

and	O
one	O

While	O
we	O

we	O

for	O

plenty	O

which	O
is	O
most	O
proper	O
for	O
that	O

I	O
never	O

any	O
in	O
the	O
South	PNM

in	O
this	O

The	O
20th	O

Ria	PNM
Lexa	PNM
is	O
the	O
most	O
remarkable	O
land	O
on	O
all	O
this	O

there	O
is	O
a	O

The	O
sea-winds	O
are	O
here	O
at	O

The	O

,	O
to	O
resume	O
the	O

we	O

7	O

into	O
the	O

In	O
the	O

we	O
had	O
a	O

with	O
much	O
thunder	O

out	O
our	O

and	O
then	O
it	O
was	O
quite	O
calm	O

We	O
rowed	O
in	O
directly	O
for	O
the	O

and	O
thought	O
to	O

it	O

it	O
was	O
9	O
a	O

of	O
Ria	PNM

,	O
that	O

we	O
saw	O
a	O
house	O
on	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
coming	O
nearer	O
we	O
saw	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
stood	O
and	O
looked	O
on	O
us	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
within	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
then	O
they	O
went	O
into	O
their	O
Canoa	PNM
,	O
which	O
lay	O
on	O
the	O
inside	O
of	O
the	O
island	O

rowed	O
towards	O
the	O

we	O
overtook	O
them	O
before	O
they	O

over	O

brought	O
them	O
back	O

to	O
the	O

There	O
was	O
a	O

right	O

us	O
on	O
the	O

when	O
we	O
took	O
the	O
Canoa	PNM

who	O
immediately	O
rode	O
away	O
towards	O
the	O
town	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
he	O

The	O
rest	O
of	O
our	O

and	O
did	O
not	O
come	O
to	O
the	O

till	O
12	O
a	O
clock	O
,	O
therefore	O
we	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
stay	O
for	O
them	O
.	O

Before	O
they	O
came	O
we	O
examined	O
the	O

who	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
set	O
there	O
to	O
watch	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
governor	O
of	O
Ria	PNM
Lexa	PNM
received	O
a	O
letter	O
about	O
a	O
month	O

wherein	O
he	O
was	O
advised	O
of	O
some	O

come	O
into	O
the	O

,	O
and	O
therefore	O
admonished	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
careful	O
;	O
that	O
immediately	O
thereupon	O
the	O
governor	O
had	O
caused	O
a	O
house	O
to	O
be	O
built	O
on	O
this	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
ordered	O
four	O
men	O
to	O
be	O
continually	O
there	O
to	O
watch	O
night	O
and	O
day	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
they	O
saw	O
any	O
ship	O
coming	O
thither	O
they	O
were	O
to	O
give	O
notice	O
of	O
it	O

They	O
said	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
expect	O
to	O
see	O
boats	O
or	O
Canoas	O
,	O
but	O
looked	O
out	O
for	O
a	O
ship	O

At	O
first	O
they	O
took	O
us	O
in	O
our	O
advanced	O
Canoa	PNM
to	O
be	O
some	O
men	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
cast	O

;	O
till	O
,	O
seeing	O
3	O
or	O
4	O
Canoas	O
more	O
,	O
they	O
began	O
to	O
suspect	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
.	O

They	O
told	O
us	O
likewise	O
that	O
the	O
horseman	O
which	O
we	O
saw	O
did	O
come	O
to	O
them	O
every	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
an	O
hour	O
's	O
time	O
he	O
could	O
be	O
at	O
the	O
town	O
.	O

When	O
Captain	O
Eaton	O
and	O
his	O
Canoas	O
came	O
ashore	O
we	O
told	O
them	O
what	O
had	O
happened	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
now	O
three	O
hours	O
since	O
the	O
horseman	O
rode	O
away	O

and	O
we	O
could	O
not	O

to	O
get	O
to	O
the	O
town	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
two	O
hours	O
;	O
in	O
which	O
time	O
the	O
governor	O
having	O
notice	O
of	O
our	O
coming	O
might	O
be	O
provided	O
to	O
receive	O
us	O
at	O
his	O

therefore	O
we	O
thought	O
it	O

to	O
defer	O
this	O
design	O

,	O
our	O
ships	O

to	O
careen	O
our	O

The	O
26th	O

how	O
to	O

some	O

the	O

One	O
thing	O
I	O
have	O
observed	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
Indian	O
towns	O
under	O
the	O
Spanish	O
government	O
,	O
as	O

in	O

that	O
the	O
images	O

the	O

-LRB-	O
with	O
which	O
all	O

painted	O
in	O
an	O
Indian	O
complexion	O
,	O
and	O
partly	O
in	O
that	O
dress	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
those	O
towns	O
which	O
are	O
inhabited	O
chiefly	O
by	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
the	O

also	O

themselves	O
to	O
the	O

The	O
houses	O
here	O

the	O
Indians	O
of	O
both	O

good	O
field	O

,	O
remote	O

:	O
they	O

but	O
they	O
have	O
abundance	O
of	O
large	O
hog-plum-trees	O
growing	O
about	O

The	O
tree	O
that	O
bears	O
this	O
fruit	O
is	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
our	O
largest	O
plum-tree	O

the	O

they	O

The	O
trees	O
are	O

the	O
fruit	O
is	O
oval	O

as	O

It	O

I	O

those	O

Captain	O

The	O

the	O

with	O
the	O

These	O
salutations	O
being	O
ended	O
,	O
they	O
all	O
marched	O
towards	O
the	O
church	O

for	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
place	O
of	O
all	O
public	O
meetings	O

and	O
all	O
plays	O

pastimes	O
are	O

there	O
also	O
;	O
therefore	O
in	O
the	O
churches	O
belonging	O
to	O

towns	O
they	O
have	O
all	O

of	O
vizards	O

both	O

and	O
abundance	O
of	O
musical	O

The	O
strumstrum	O
is	O
made	O
somewhat	O
like	O
a	O
sittern	O
;	O
most	O
of	O
those	O
that	O
the	O

use	O
are	O

a	O

are	O
the	O
times	O
when	O
they	O
all	O
meet	O
to	O
make	O
merry	O

Their	O
mirth	O
consists	O
in	O
singing	O

and	O
sporting	O
in	O
those	O

All	O
the	O
Indians	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
acquainted	O
with	O
who	O
are	O
under	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
melancholy	O
than	O
other	O
Indians	O
that	O
are	O
free	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
these	O
public	O
meetings	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
are	O
in	O
the	O
greatest	O
of	O
their	O
jollity	O
,	O
their	O
mirth	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
rather	O
forced	O
than	O
real	O
.	O

Their	O
songs	O
are	O
very	O
melancholy	O
and	O
doleful	O
;	O
so	O
is	O
their	O
music	O
:	O
but	O
whether	O
it	O
be	O
natural	O
to	O
the	O
Indians	O
to	O
be	O
thus	O
melancholy	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
effect	O
of	O
their	O
slavery	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
not	O
certain	O
:	O
but	O
I	O
have	O
always	O
been	O
prone	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
then	O
only	O
condoling	O
their	O
misfortunes	O
,	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
their	O
country	O

:	O
which	O
although	O
these	O
that	O
are	O
now	O
living	O
do	O
not	O
know	O
,	O
nor	O
remember	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
free	O
,	O
yet	O
there	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
deep	O
impression	O
of	O
the	O
thoughts	O
of	O
the	O
slavery	O
which	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
have	O
brought	O
them	O
under	O
,	O
increased	O
probably	O
by	O
some	O
traditions	O
of	O
their	O
ancient	O
freedom	O
.	O

Captain	O
Davis	O
intended	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
in	O
the	O
church	O
to	O
shut	O
the	O
doors	O
and	O
then	O
make	O
a	O
bargain	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
letting	O
them	O
know	O
what	O
he	O
was	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
draw	O
them	O
afterwards	O
by	O
fair	O
means	O
to	O
our	O
assistance	O
:	O
the	O
friar	O
being	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
also	O
promised	O
to	O
engage	O
them	O
to	O
it	O
:	O
but	O
before	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
in	O
the	O
church	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
Captain	O
Davis	O
's	O
men	O
pushed	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
to	O
hasten	O
him	O
into	O
the	O
church	O
.	O

The	O
Indian	O
immediately	O
ran	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
taking	O
the	O
alarm	O
sprang	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
church	O
like	O
deer	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
hard	O
to	O
say	O
which	O
was	O
first	O
:	O
and	O
Captain	O
Davis	O
,	O
who	O
knew	O
nothing	O
of	O
what	O
happened	O
,	O
was	O
left	O
in	O
the	O
church	O
only	O
with	O
the	O
friar	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
fled	O
,	O
Captain	O
Davis	O
's	O
men	O
fired	O
and	O
killed	O
the	O
secretary	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
our	O
hopes	O
perished	O
by	O
the	O
indiscretion	O
of	O
one	O
foolish	O
fellow	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
the	O
ships	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
gulf	O
between	O
Point	PNM
Casivina	PNM
and	O
Mangera	PNM
,	O
and	O
anchored	O
near	O
the	O
island	O
Amapalla	PNM
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
in	O
10	O
fathom	O
water	O
,	O
clean	O
hard	O
sand	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
Captain	O
Davis	O
and	O
his	O
company	O
came	O
aboard	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
the	O
friar	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
who	O
told	O
Captain	O
Davis	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
secretary	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
killed	O
he	O
could	O
have	O
sent	O
him	O
a	O
letter	O
by	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
that	O
was	O
taken	O
at	O
Mangera	PNM
,	O
and	O
persuaded	O
him	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
now	O
the	O
only	O
way	O
was	O
to	O
send	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
Indians	O
to	O
seek	O
the	O
casica	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
himself	O
would	O
instruct	O
him	O
what	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
question	O
but	O
the	O
casica	O
would	O
come	O
in	O
on	O
his	O
word	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
we	O
sent	O
ashore	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
who	O
before	O
night	O
returned	O
with	O
the	O
casica	O
and	O
six	O
other	O
Indians	O
,	O
who	O
remained	O
with	O
us	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
that	O
we	O
stayed	O
here	O
.	O

These	O
Indians	O
did	O
us	O
good	O
service	O
;	O
especially	O
in	O
piloting	O
us	O
to	O
an	O
island	O
where	O
we	O
killed	O
beef	O
whenever	O
we	O
wanted	O
;	O
and	O
for	O
this	O
their	O
service	O
we	O
satisfied	O
them	O
to	O
their	O
hearts	O
'	O
content	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
at	O
this	O
island	O
Amapalla	PNM
that	O
a	O
party	O
of	O
Englishmen	O
and	O
Frenchmen	O
came	O
afterwards	O
,	O
and	O
stayed	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
landed	O
on	O
the	O
Main	O
,	O
and	O
marched	O
overland	O
to	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
River	PNM
,	O
which	O
disembogues	O
into	O
the	O
North	PNM
Seas	PNM
near	PNM
Cape	PNM
Gratia	PNM
Dios	O
,	O
and	O
is	O
therefore	O
called	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
River	PNM
:	O
near	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
this	O
river	O
they	O
made	O
bark-logs	O
-LRB-	O
which	O
I	O
shall	O
describe	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
chapter	O
-RRB-	O
and	O
so	O
went	O
into	O
the	O
North	PNM
Seas	PNM
.	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
way	O
that	O
Captain	O
Sharp	O
had	O
proposed	O
to	O
go	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
put	O
to	O
it	O
;	O
for	O
this	O
way	O
was	O
partly	O
known	O
by	O
privateers	O
by	O
the	O
discovery	O
that	O
was	O
made	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
about	O
30	O
years	O
since	O
,	O
by	O
a	O
party	O
of	O
Englishmen	O
that	O
went	O
up	O
that	O
river	O
in	O
Canoas	O
,	O
about	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
these	O
Frenchmen	O
made	O
their	O
bark-logs	O
:	O
there	O
they	O
landed	O
and	O
marched	O
to	O
a	O
town	O
called	O
Segovia	PNM
in	O
the	O
country	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
near	O
a	O
month	O
getting	O
up	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
for	O
there	O
were	O
many	O
cataracts	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
often	O
forced	O
to	O
leave	O
the	O
river	O
and	O
haul	O
their	O
Canoas	O
ashore	O
over	O
the	O
land	O
till	O
they	O
were	O
past	O
the	O
cataracts	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
launch	O
their	O
Canoas	O
again	O
into	O
the	O
river	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
discoursed	O
several	O
men	O
that	O
were	O
in	O
that	O
expedition	O

The	O
third	O

of	O

1684	O
we	O
sent	O
the	O

ashore	O
and	O
left	O
the	O
Indians	O
in	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O

hither	O

though	O

When	O
we	O

a	O

us	O

we	O

We	O

Passing	O
by	O
this	O
point	O

coming	O
from	O
the	O

you	O
will	O
see	O
a	O
small	O
low	O
point	O
which	O
you	O
might	O
suppose	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
cape	O
;	O
but	O
you	O
are	O
then	O
past	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
presently	O
afterwards	O
it	O
appears	O
with	O
three	O
points	O

The	O
land	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
within	O
this	O
cape	O
is	O
very	O
high	O

and	O
the	O
mountains	O
commonly	O
appear	O
very	O
black	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
in	O
with	O
this	O
cape	O
we	O
overtook	O
Captain	O
Eaton	O
,	O
plying	O
under	O
the	O
shore	O
:	O
he	O
in	O
his	O
passage	O
from	O
Amapalla	PNM
,	O
while	O
he	O
was	O
on	O
that	O
coast	O
,	O
met	O
with	O
such	O
terrible	O
tornadoes	O
of	O
thunder	O
and	O
lightning	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
and	O
all	O
his	O
men	O
related	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
never	O
met	O
with	O
the	O
like	O
in	O
any	O
place	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
very	O
much	O
affrighted	O
by	O
them	O
,	O
the	O
air	O
smelling	O
very	O
much	O
of	O
sulphur	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
apprehending	O
themselves	O
in	O
great	O
danger	O
of	O
being	O
burnt	O
by	O
the	O
lightning	O
.	O

He	O
touched	O
at	O
the	O
island	O
Cocos	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
ashore	O
200	O
packs	O
of	O
flour	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
loaded	O
his	O
boat	O
with	O
coconuts	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
in	O
fresh	O
water	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
we	O
separated	O
again	O
from	O
Captain	O
Eaton	O
;	O
for	O
he	O
stood	O
off	O
to	O
sea	O
and	O
we	O
plied	O
up	O
under	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
making	O
our	O
best	O
advantage	O
both	O
of	O

The	O
20th	O

came	O
to	O
the	O
island	O

The	O
21st	O

Captain	O

came	O
to	O
an	O

:	O
he	O
was	O
very	O
willing	O
to	O
have	O

with	O
us	O
again	O
;	O
but	O
Captain	O
Davis	O
's	O
men	O
were	O
so	O
unreasonable	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
allow	O
Captain	O

's	O
men	O
an	O
equal	O
share	O

them	O
in	O
what	O
they	O

sailed	O

we	O

no	O
sort	O
of	O
tree	O
;	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
it	O
appears	O
like	O
an	O
island	O
because	O
the	O
land	O
within	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
low	O

This	O
point	O
strikes	O
out	O

There	O
is	O

water	O
at	O
this	O

therefore	O
the	O

are	O
obliged	O
to	O
fetch	O
all	O
their	O
water	O
from	O
the	O
river	O
Colanche	O

By	O

who	O

a	O

The	O

that	O
it	O
was	O

believed	O
at	O

This	O

Captain	O

Captain	O

had	O
some	O
discourse	O
concerning	O

;	O
they	O
at	O

concluded	O
to	O
send	O
our	O
small	O

towards	O
the	O

of	O
Lima	PNM

as	O

This	O

ten	O
of	O

Captain	O

writ	O

his	O

the	O

was	O
appointed	O
for	O
the	O

When	O
this	O

was	O
gone	O
we	O
turned	O
another	O
bark	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
into	O
a	O
fire-ship	O
;	O
having	O
six	O

seven	O

her	O
;	O
and	O
while	O
the	O

were	O
at	O
work	O
about	O
the	O

we	O

The	O

of	O

we	O
finished	O
our	O

and	O
the	O
20th	O

we	O

the	O

We	O
had	O

The	O

we	O
crossed	O
over	O

The	O
30th	O

we	O
doubled	O

This	O

is	O
in	O

It	O
is	O

the	O

do	O
it	O

of	O

Besides	O

setting	O

they	O

therefore	O
they	O
always	O
beat	O
up	O
in	O

There	O
are	O
not	O

75	O
or	O
80	O
houses	O
and	O
two	O
churches	O

The	O
houses	O
are	O

low	O

ill	O
built	O

The	O
building	O
in	O
this	O
country	O
of	O
Peru	PNM
is	O
much	O
alike	O
on	O
all	O
the	O
sea-coast	O
.	O

The	O
walls	O
are	O
built	O
of	O
brick	O
made	O
with	O
earth	O
and	O
straw	O
kneaded	O
together	O
:	O
they	O
are	O
about	O
three	O
foot	O
long	O
,	O
two	O
foot	O
broad	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
foot	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
thick	O
:	O
they	O
never	O
burn	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
lay	O
them	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
to	O
dry	O
before	O
they	O
are	O
used	O
in	O
building	O
.	O

In	O
some	O
places	O
they	O
have	O
no	O
roofs	O
,	O
only	O
poles	O
laid	O
across	O
from	O
the	O
side	O
walls	O
and	O
covered	O
with	O
mats	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
those	O
walls	O
are	O
carried	O
up	O
to	O
a	O
considerable	O
height	O
.	O

But	O
where	O
they	O
build	O
roofs	O
upon	O
their	O
houses	O
the	O
walls	O
are	O
not	O
made	O
so	O
high	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
before	O
.	O

The	O
houses	O
in	O
general	O
all	O
over	O
this	O
kingdom	O
are	O
but	O
meanly	O
built	O
,	O
one	O
chief	O
reason	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
common	O
people	O
especially	O
,	O
is	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
materials	O
to	O
build	O
withal	O
;	O
for	O
however	O
it	O
be	O
more	O
within	O
land	O
,	O
yet	O
here	O
is	O
neither	O
stone	O
nor	O
timber	O
to	O
build	O
with	O
,	O
nor	O
any	O
materials	O
but	O
such	O
brick	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
described	O
;	O
and	O
even	O
the	O
stone	O
which	O
they	O
have	O
in	O
some	O
places	O
is	O
so	O
brittle	O
that	O
you	O
may	O
rub	O
it	O
into	O
sand	O
with	O
your	O
fingers	O
.	O

Another	O
reason	O
why	O
they	O
build	O
so	O
meanly	O
is	O
because	O
it	O
never	O
rains	O
;	O
therefore	O
they	O
only	O
endeavour	O
to	O
fence	O
themselves	O
from	O
the	O
sun	O
.	O

Yet	O
their	O
walls	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
built	O
but	O
with	O
an	O
ordinary	O
sort	O
of	O
brick	O
in	O
comparison	O
with	O
what	O
is	O
made	O
in	O
other	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
continue	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
as	O
firm	O
as	O
when	O
first	O
made	O
,	O
having	O
never	O
any	O
winds	O
nor	O
rains	O
to	O
rot	O
,	O
moulder	O
,	O
or	O
shake	O
them	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
richer	O
sort	O
have	O
timber	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
make	O
use	O
of	O
in	O
building	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
brought	O
from	O
other	O
places	O
.	O

This	O

about	O
30	O

having	O
no	O

I	O

a	O

in	O
the	O

our	O

landed	O
about	O
4	O
miles	O
to	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

and	O
took	O
some	O

sent	O
thither	O
to	O
watch	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
these	O

said	O
that	O
the	O
governor	O
of	O

came	O
with	O
100	O

to	O
Payta	PNM
the	O

purposely	O
to	O
oppose	O
our	O
landing	O
there	O
if	O
we	O
should	O
attempt	O
it	O

Our	O
men	O
marched	O
directly	O
to	O
the	O
fort	O
on	O
the	O
hill	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
it	O
without	O
the	O

Hereupon	O
the	O
governor	O
of	O
Piura	PNM
with	O
all	O
his	O

the	O
inhabitants	O
of	O
the	O

ran	O
away	O
as	O

as	O
they	O
could	O

Then	O
our	O
men	O
entered	O
the	O

found	O
it	O
emptied	O
both	O

there	O

not	O

a	O

The	O
prisoners	O
told	O
us	O
a	O
ship	O
had	O
been	O
here	O
a	O
little	O
before	O
and	O
burnt	O
a	O
great	O

but	O
did	O
not	O
land	O
their	O

;	O
and	O
that	O
here	O
they	O
put	O
ashore	O
all	O
their	O
prisoners	O
and	O
pilots	O
.	O

We	O
knew	O
this	O
must	O
be	O
Captain	O
Eaton	O
's	O
ship	O
which	O
had	O
done	O
this	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
these	O
circumstances	O
we	O
supposed	O
he	O
was	O
gone	O
to	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
,	O
it	O
being	O
always	O
designed	O
by	O
him	O
.	O

The	O
prisoners	O
told	O
us	O
also	O
that	O
,	O
since	O
Captain	O
Eaton	O
was	O
here	O
,	O
a	O
small	O
bark	O
had	O
been	O
off	O
the	O
harbour	O
and	O
taken	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
bark-logs	O
a-fishing	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
the	O
fishermen	O
bring	O
aboard	O
20	O
or	O
30	O
jars	O
of	O
fresh	O
water	O
.	O

This	O
we	O
supposed	O
was	O
our	O
bark	O
that	O
was	O
sent	O
to	O
the	O
Lobos	O
to	O
seek	O
Captain	O
Eaton	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
we	O
came	O
in	O
with	O
our	O
ships	O
and	O
anchored	O
before	O
the	O
town	O
in	O
10	O
fathom	O
water	O
,	O
near	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
stayed	O
till	O
the	O
sixth	O
day	O
,	O
in	O
hopes	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
ransom	O
from	O
the	O
town	O
.	O

Our	O
captains	O
demanded	O
300	O
packs	O
of	O
flour	O
,	O
3000	O
pound	O
of	O
Sugar	O
,	O
25	O
jars	O
of	O
wine	O
,	O
and	O
1000	O
jars	O
of	O
water	O
to	O
be	O
brought	O
off	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
got	O
nothing	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

Therefore	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
ordered	O
the	O
town	O
to	O
be	O
fired	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
presently	O
done	O
.	O

Then	O
all	O
our	O
men	O
came	O
aboard	O
,	O
and	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
ordered	O
the	O
bark	O
which	O
Captain	O
Harris	O
commanded	O
to	O
be	O
burnt	O
because	O
she	O
did	O
not	O
sail	O
well	O
.	O

At	O
night	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
land-wind	O
came	O
off	O
,	O
we	O
sailed	O
from	O
hence	O
towards	O
Lobos	O
.	O

The	O
10th	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
sail	O
bearing	O
N.	O
W.	O
by	O
north	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
well	O
discern	O
her	O
on	O
our	O
deck	O
.	O

We	O
immediately	O
chased	O
,	O
separating	O
ourselves	O
the	O
better	O
to	O
meet	O
her	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
missed	O
her	O
.	O

Therefore	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
we	O
again	O
trimmed	O
sharp	O
and	O
made	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
our	O
way	O
to	O
Lobos	PNM

The	O
14th	O
day	O
we	O
had	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
Lobos	PNM

Terra	PNM
:	O
it	O
bore	O
east	O
from	O
us	O
;	O
we	O
stood	O
in	O
towards	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
betwixt	O
7	O
and	O
8	O
a	O
clock	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
at	O
the	O
north-east	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
in	O
4	O

This	O
island	O
at	O

is	O
of	O
an	O
indifferent	O
height	O

and	O
appears	O

About	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O

there	O
is	O
a	O

where	O
there	O
is	O
7	O

The	O
15th	O
day	O
we	O
went	O
ashore	O
and	O
found	O
abundance	O
of	O
penguins	O
and	O
boobies	O
,	O
and	O
seal	O
in	O
great	O
quantities	O
.	O

We	O
sent	O
aboard	O
of	O
all	O
these	O
to	O
be	O
dressed	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
tasted	O
any	O
flesh	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
before	O
;	O
therefore	O
some	O
of	O
us	O
did	O
eat	O
very	O
heartily	O

Captain	O
Swan	O
,	O
to	O
encourage	O
his	O
men	O
to	O
eat	O
this	O
coarse	O

would	O

it	O
for	O
extraordinary	O

comparing	O
the	O
seal	O
to	O
a	O

the	O

and	O
the	O
penguins	O

this	O

to	O
train	O
them	O
to	O
live	O
contentedly	O
on	O
coarse	O
meat	O
,	O
not	O
knowing	O
but	O
we	O
might	O
be	O
forced	O
to	O
make	O
use	O
of	O
such	O
food	O
before	O
we	O
departed	O
out	O
of	O
these	O
seas	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
is	O
generally	O
seen	O
among	O
privateers	O
that	O
nothing	O
emboldens	O
them	O
sooner	O
to	O
mutiny	O
than	O
want	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
well	O
suffer	O
in	O
a	O
place	O
where	O
there	O
are	O
such	O
quantities	O
of	O

could	O
be	O
persuaded	O
to	O
be	O
content	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
we	O
sailed	O
from	O
Lobos	PNM
de	PNM
Terra	PNM
with	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
south	O
by	O
east	O
and	O
arrived	O
at	O
Lobos	PNM
de	PNM

on	O
the	O
19th	O
day	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
letter	O

left	O
by	O
our	O
bark	O
that	O
was	O
sent	O
to	O
seek	O
Captain	O

,	O
by	O
which	O
we	O
understood	O
that	O
Captain	O
Eaton	O
had	O
been	O
there	O
but	O
was	O
gone	O
before	O
they	O
arrived	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
left	O
no	O
letter	O
to	O
advise	O
us	O
which	O

he	O
was	O

and	O
that	O
our	O

was	O
again	O

us	O
by	O
the	O

,	O
else	O
resolving	O
to	O

We	O
were	O
sorry	O
to	O
hear	O
that	O
Captain	O
Eaton	O
was	O
gone	O
,	O
for	O
now	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
expect	O
to	O
meet	O
with	O
him	O
any	O
more	O
in	O
these	O
seas	O
.	O

The	O
21st	O
day	O
we	O
sent	O
out	O
our	O
Moskito	O
strikers	O
for	O
turtle	O
,	O
who	O
brought	O
aboard	O
enough	O
to	O
serve	O
both	O

'	O

;	O
and	O
this	O
they	O
did	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
that	O
we	O
abode	O
here	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
lay	O
at	O
this	O
island	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
made	O
new	O
yards	O
,	O
squarer	O
than	O
those	O
he	O
had	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
his	O

larger	O

and	O
our	O
ship	O

in	O
the	O

split	O
plank	O
for	O
firewood	O

and	O
put	O
aboard	O
as	O
many	O

as	O
we	O
could	O
conveniently	O

for	O
other	O
uses	O
:	O
here	O
being	O
plank	O

of	O
all	O

which	O
we	O

hither	O
in	O
the	O

that	O
we	O
took	O
and	O
left	O
here	O

The	O
26th	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
small	O
bark	O
about	O
3	O
leagues	O
north-north-west	O
from	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
we	O
supposing	O
her	O
to	O
be	O
our	O
own	O
bark	O
,	O
did	O
not	O
go	O
after	O
her	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
she	O
was	O
two	O
leagues	O
south	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
standing	O
off	O
to	O
sea	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
now	O
chase	O
her	O
neither	O
,	O
although	O
we	O
knew	O
she	O
was	O
not	O
our	O
bark	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
being	O
to	O
windward	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
she	O
could	O
have	O
made	O
her	O
escape	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
chased	O
her	O
.	O

This	O
bark	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
afterwards	O
informed	O

was	O

out	O

at	O
this	O

not	O
to	O

only	O
to	O
appear	O

we	O
should	O
soon	O

as	O
indeed	O
it	O
was	O

that	O
some	O
of	O
the	O

been	O
taken	O
up	O
by	O
one	O
who	O
came	O
from	O

with	O
a	O
patent	O
from	O
the	O
king	O
to	O
fish	O
in	O
those	O

for	O
wrecks	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
dying	O
,	O
the	O
project	O
ceased	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
wreck	O
still	O
remains	O
as	O
he	O
left	O
it	O
;	O
only	O
the	O
Indians	O
by	O
stealth	O
do	O
sometimes	O
take	O
up	O
some	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
taken	O
up	O
much	O
more	O
if	O
it	O
were	O
not	O
for	O
the	O
cat-fish	O
which	O
swarms	O
hereabouts	O
.	O

The	O
cat-fish	O
is	O
much	O
like	O
a	O
whiting	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
head	O
is	O
flatter	O
and	O
bigger	O

It	O
has	O
a	O
great	O
wide	O
mouth	O
,	O
and	O
certain	O
small	O
strings	O
pointing	O
out	O
from	O
each	O
side	O
of	O
it	O

like	O
cat	O

whiskers	O
;	O
and	O
for	O
that	O
reason	O
it	O
is	O
called	O
a	O
cat-fish	O
.	O

It	O
has	O
three	O
fins	O
;	O
one	O
growing	O
on	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
his	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
on	O
either	O
side	O

Each	O
of	O
these	O
fins	O
has	O
a	O
stiff	O
sharp	O
bone	O
which	O
is	O
very	O
venomous	O
if	O
it	O
strikes	O
into	O
a	O
man	O
's	O
flesh	O
;	O
therefore	O
it	O
is	O
dangerous	O
diving	O
where	O
many	O

The	O

only	O
by	O
a	O
small	O
prick	O
with	O
the	O
fin	O
of	O
these	O
fish	O
:	O
therefore	O
when	O
we	O
catch	O
them	O
with	O
a	O
hook	O
we	O
tread	O
on	O
them	O
to	O
take	O
the	O

or	O
otherwise	O

a	O

This	O

The	O

Quito	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O

,	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
populous	O
city	O
,	O
seated	O
in	O
the	O
heart	O
of	O
the	O
country	O

It	O
is	O
inhabited	O

by	O
Spaniards	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
major	O
part	O
of	O
its	O
inhabitants	O
are	O
Indians	O
,	O
under	O
the	O
Spanish	O
government	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
environed	O
with	O
mountains	O
of	O
a	O
vast	O
height	O
,	O
from	O
whose	O
bowels	O
many	O

have	O
their	O

These	O
mountains	O
abound	O
in	O
gold	O

which	O
by	O
violent	O

is	O
washed	O
with	O
the	O

where	O
the	O

but	O
for	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O

the	O
gold	O
I	O
refer	O
you	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Wafer	O
's	O
book	O
:	O
only	O
I	O
shall	O
remark	O
here	O
that	O
Quito	PNM
is	O
the	O
place	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
kingdom	O
of	O
Peru	PNM
that	O
abounds	O
most	O
with	O
this	O
rich	O
metal	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
often	O
informed	O
.	O

The	O
country	O
is	O
subject	O
to	O
great	O
rains	O
and	O
very	O
thick	O
fogs	O
,	O
especially	O
the	O
valleys	O
.	O

For	O
that	O
reason	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
unwholesome	O
and	O
sickly	O
.	O

The	O
chiefest	O
distempers	O
are	O
fevers	O
,	O
violent	O
headache	O
,	O
pains	O
in	O
the	O
bowels	O
,	O
and	O
fluxes	O

I	O
know	O
no	O
place	O
where	O
gold	O
is	O
found	O
but	O
what	O
is	O
very	O
unhealthy	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
shall	O
more	O

relate	O
when	O
I	O

of	O
Achin	PNM

the	O
isle	O
of	O

Guiaquil	O
is	O
not	O
so	O
sickly	O
as	O
Quito	PNM
and	O
other	O
towns	O
farther	O
within	O
land	O
;	O
yet	O
in	O
comparison	O
with	O
the	O

that	O
are	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Mare	PNM
Pacifico	PNM
,	O
south	O
of	O
Cape	PNM
Blanco	PNM
,	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
sickly	O

It	O
was	O
to	O
this	O
town	O
of	O
Guiaquil	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
bound	O
;	O
therefore	O
we	O
left	O
our	O
ships	O
off	O
Cape	PNM
Blanco	PNM
and	O
ran	O
into	O
the	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM
Guiaquil	PNM
with	O
our	O
bark	O
and	O
Canoas	O
,	O
steering	O
in	O
for	O
the	O

where	O
we	O

the	O
next	O
day	O
after	O
we	O
left	O
our	O

and	O
from	O

we	O
sent	O

two	O
Canoas	O
the	O
next	O

to	O
Punta	PNM

At	O
this	O

abundance	O
of	O
oysters	O
and	O
other	O
shellfish	O
,	O
as	O
cockles	O

;	O
therefore	O
the	O
Indians	O
of	O
Puna	O
often	O
come	O
hither	O
to	O
get	O
these	O
fish	O
.	O

Our	O
Canoas	O
got	O
over	O
before	O

absconded	O
in	O
a	O

to	O
wait	O
for	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
Puna	PNM

The	O
next	O
morning	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
their	O
custom	O

came	O
thither	O
on	O
bark-logs	O
at	O
the	O
latter	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
ebb	O

were	O
all	O

The	O

by	O
their	O

the	O
two	O

the	O

all	O
its	O

The	O
next	O

they	O
took	O
a	O
small	O
bark	O
laden	O
with	O
Quito-cloth	O

She	O
came	O
from	O
Guiaquil	PNM

that	O
we	O

gone	O
off	O

the	O

I	O

lay	O
at	O
the	O

The	O
master	O
of	O
this	O

informed	O
our	O

that	O
there	O
were	O
three	O
barks	O
coming	O
from	O
Guiaquil	PNM

laden	O

he	O

they	O
would	O
come	O
from	O

the	O
next	O
tide	O

The	O
same	O
tide	O
of	O
ebb	O
that	O
they	O
took	O
the	O
cloth-bark	O
they	O
sent	O
a	O
canoa	O
to	O
our	O
bark	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
biggest	O
part	O
of	O
the	O

were	O

to	O

them	O
away	O
with	O

to	O
the	O
Indian	O

The	O

The	O
tide	O
of	O

spent	O
we	O
lay	O
at	O
this	O
town	O

the	O
last	O
of	O
the	O
ebb	O

then	O
rowed	O

five	O

it	O

supposed	O
that	O
before	O
that	O

we	O
should	O
be	O
masters	O
of	O
Guiaquil	PNM

We	O
had	O
not	O
rowed	O
above	O
two	O
mile	O
before	O
we	O
met	O
and	O
took	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
barks	O
laden	O
with	O
Negroes	O
;	O
the	O
master	O
of	O
her	O
said	O
that	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
would	O
come	O
from	O
Guiaquil	PNM
the	O
next	O
tide	O
of	O
ebb	O

We	O
cut	O
her	O
main-mast	O
down	O
and	O
left	O
her	O
at	O
an	O
anchor	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
now	O
strong	O
flood	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
we	O
rowed	O
with	O
all	O
speed	O
towards	O
the	O
town	O
in	O
hopes	O
to	O
get	O
thither	O
before	O
the	O
flood	O
was	O
down	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
farther	O
than	O
we	O
did	O
expect	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
,	O
or	O
else	O
our	O
Canoas	O
,	O
being	O
very	O
full	O
of	O
men	O
,	O
did	O
not	O
row	O
so	O
fast	O
as	O
we	O
would	O
have	O
them	O

The	O
day	O
broke	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
two	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
town	O

and	O
then	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
above	O
an	O
hour	O
's	O
flood	O
more	O
;	O
therefore	O
our	O
captains	O
desired	O
the	O
Indian	O
pilot	O
to	O
direct	O
us	O
to	O
some	O
creek	O
where	O
we	O
might	O
abscond	O
all	O
day	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
immediately	O
done	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
canoa	O
was	O
sent	O
toward	O
Puna	O
to	O
our	O
bark	O
to	O
order	O
them	O
not	O
to	O
move	O
nor	O
fire	O
till	O
the	O
next	O
day	O

But	O
she	O
came	O
too	O
late	O
to	O
countermand	O
the	O
first	O
orders	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
two	O
barks	O
before	O
mentioned	O
laden	O
with	O
Negroes	O
come	O
from	O
the	O
town	O
the	O
last	O
quarter	O
of	O
the	O

lay	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
close	O
by	O
the	O

on	O
one	O

we	O
rowed	O
upon	O
the	O

missed	O
them	O
;	O
neither	O

they	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
flood	O
was	O
spent	O
the	O
two	O

went	O
down	O

seeing	O
them	O

directly	O
towards	O
them	O

both	O
full	O

supposed	O
that	O

been	O
destroyed	O

and	O
that	O
the	O
two	O

sent	O

they	O
fired	O

The	O

the	O

them	O
both	O
.	O

The	O
firing	O
of	O
these	O
three	O
guns	O
made	O
a	O
great	O
disorder	O
among	O
our	O
advanced	O
men	O
,	O
for	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
did	O
believe	O
they	O
were	O
heard	O
at	O
Guiaquil	PNM
,	O
and	O
that	O
therefore	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
no	O
profit	O
to	O
lie	O
still	O
in	O
the	O
creek	O
;	O
but	O
either	O
row	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
town	O
or	O
back	O
again	O
to	O
our	O
ships	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
now	O
quarter	O
ebb	O
,	O
therefore	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
move	O
upwards	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
disposed	O
so	O
to	O
do	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
Captain	O
Davis	O
said	O
he	O
would	O
immediately	O
land	O
in	O
the	O
creek	O
where	O
they	O
lay	O
,	O
and	O
march	O
directly	O
to	O
the	O
town	O
,	O
if	O
but	O
forty	O
men	O
would	O
accompany	O
him	O
:	O
and	O
without	O
saying	O
more	O
words	O
he	O
landed	O
among	O
the	O
mangroves	O
in	O
the	O
marshes	O
.	O

Those	O
that	O
were	O
so	O
minded	O
followed	O
him	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
forty	O
or	O
fifty	O
.	O

Captain	O
Swan	O
lay	O
still	O
with	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
party	O
in	O
the	O
creek	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
thought	O
it	O
impossible	O
to	O
do	O
any	O
good	O
that	O
way	O
.	O

Captain	O
Davis	O
and	O
his	O
men	O
were	O
absent	O
about	O
four	O
hours	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
returned	O
all	O
wet	O
and	O
quite	O
tired	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
not	O
find	O
any	O
passage	O
out	O
into	O
the	O
firm	O
land	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
far	O
that	O
he	O
almost	O
despaired	O
of	O
getting	O
back	O
again	O
:	O
for	O
a	O
man	O
can	O
not	O
pass	O
through	O
those	O
red	O
mangroves	O
but	O
with	O
very	O
much	O
labour	O
.	O

When	O
Captain	O
Davis	O
was	O
returned	O
we	O
concluded	O
to	O
be	O
going	O
towards	O
the	O
town	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
the	O
next	O
flood	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
town	O
was	O
alarmed	O
,	O
we	O
purposed	O
to	O
return	O
again	O
without	O
attempting	O
anything	O
there	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
flood	O
we	O
rowed	O
away	O
and	O
passed	O
by	O
the	O
island	O
through	O
the	O
north-east	O
channel	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
narrowest	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
so	O
many	O
stumps	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
dangerous	O
passing	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
-LRB-	O
and	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
time	O
we	O
always	O
take	O
for	O
such	O
attempts	O
-RRB-	O
for	O
the	O
river	O
runs	O
very	O
swift	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
Canoas	O
stuck	O
on	O
a	O
stump	O
and	O
had	O
certainly	O
overset	O
if	O
she	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
immediately	O
rescued	O
by	O
others	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
were	O
come	O
almost	O
to	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
musket	O
fired	O
at	O
us	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
bushes	O
on	O
the	O
Main	O
.	O

We	O
then	O
had	O
the	O
town	O
open	O
before	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
presently	O
saw	O
lighted	O
torches	O
,	O
or	O
candles	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
town	O
over	O
;	O
whereas	O
before	O
the	O
gun	O
was	O
fired	O
there	O
was	O
but	O
one	O
light	O
:	O
therefore	O
we	O
now	O
concluded	O
we	O
were	O
discovered	O
:	O
yet	O
many	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
said	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
holy	O
day	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
indeed	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
therefore	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
were	O
making	O
fireworks	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
often	O
do	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
against	O
such	O
times	O
.	O

We	O
rowed	O
therefore	O
a	O
little	O
farther	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
firm	O
land	O
,	O
and	O
Captain	O
Davis	O
pitched	O
his	O
canoa	O
ashore	O
and	O
landed	O
with	O
his	O
men	O
.	O

Captain	O
Swan	O
and	O
most	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
it	O
convenient	O
to	O
attempt	O
anything	O
,	O
seeing	O
the	O
town	O
was	O
alarmed	O
;	O
but	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
being	O
upbraided	O
with	O
cowardice	O
,	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
and	O
his	O
men	O
landed	O
also	O
.	O

The	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
landed	O
was	O
about	O
two	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
town	O
:	O
it	O
was	O
all	O
overgrown	O
with	O
woods	O
so	O
thick	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
march	O
through	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
we	O
sat	O
down	O
,	O
waiting	O
for	O
the	O
light	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
two	O
Indian	O
pilots	O
with	O
us	O
;	O
one	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
with	O
us	O
a	O
month	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
having	O
received	O
some	O
abuses	O
from	O
a	O
gentleman	O
of	O
Guiaquil	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
revenged	O
offered	O
his	O
service	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
him	O
very	O
faithful	O
:	O
the	O
other	O
was	O
taken	O
by	O
us	O
not	O
above	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
as	O
willing	O
as	O
the	O
other	O
to	O
assist	O
us	O
.	O

This	O
latter	O
was	O
led	O
by	O
one	O
of	O
Captain	O
Davis	O
's	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
showed	O
himself	O
very	O
forward	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
town	O
,	O
and	O
upbraided	O
others	O
with	O
faint-heartedness	O
:	O
yet	O
this	O
man	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
he	O
afterwards	O
confessed	O
-RRB-	O
notwithstanding	O
his	O
courage	O
,	O
privately	O
cut	O
the	O
string	O
that	O
the	O
guide	O
was	O
made	O
fast	O
with	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
him	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
town	O
by	O
himself	O
,	O
not	O
caring	O
to	O
follow	O
him	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
he	O
thought	O
the	O
guide	O
was	O
got	O
far	O
enough	O
from	O
us	O
,	O
he	O
cried	O
out	O
that	O
the	O
pilot	O
was	O
gone	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
somebody	O
had	O
cut	O
the	O
cord	O
that	O
tied	O
him	O
.	O

This	O
put	O
every	O
man	O
in	O
a	O
moving	O
posture	O
to	O
seek	O
the	O
Indian	O
,	O
but	O
all	O
in	O
vain	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
consternation	O
was	O
great	O
,	O
being	O
in	O
the	O
dark	O
and	O
among	O
woods	O
;	O
so	O
the	O
design	O
was	O
wholly	O
dashed	O
,	O
for	O
not	O
a	O
man	O
after	O
that	O
had	O
the	O
heart	O
to	O
speak	O
of	O
going	O
farther	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
stayed	O
till	O
day	O
and	O
then	O
rowed	O
out	O
into	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
fair	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
town	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
before	O
,	O
makes	O
a	O
very	O
pleasant	O
prospect	O
.	O

We	O
lay	O
still	O
about	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
being	O
a	O
mile	O
or	O
something	O
better	O
from	O
the	O
town	O
.	O

They	O
did	O
not	O
fire	O
one	O
gun	O
at	O
us	O
,	O
nor	O
we	O
at	O
them	O
.	O

Thus	O
our	O
design	O
on	O
Guiaquil	O
failed	O
:	O
yet	O
Captain	O
Townley	O
and	O
Captain	O
Francois	O
Gronet	O
took	O
it	O
a	O
little	O
while	O
after	O
this	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
taken	O
a	O
full	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
town	O
we	O
rowed	O
over	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
went	O
ashore	O
to	O
a	O
beef	O
estancia	O
or	O
farm	O
and	O
killed	O
a	O
cow	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
dressed	O
and	O
ate	O
.	O

We	O
stayed	O
there	O
till	O
the	O
evening	O
tide	O
of	O
ebb	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
rowed	O
down	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
9th	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
arrived	O
at	O
Puna	PNM
.	O

In	O
our	O
way	O
thither	O
we	O
went	O
aboard	O
the	O
three	O
barks	O
laden	O
with	O
Negroes	O
,	O
that	O
lay	O
at	O
their	O
anchor	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
the	O
barks	O
away	O
with	O
us	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
1000	O
Negroes	O
in	O
the	O
three	O
barks	O
,	O
all	O
lusty	O
young	O
men	O
and	O
women	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
Puna	PNM
we	O
sent	O
a	O
canoa	O
to	O
Punta	PNM
Arena	PNM
to	O
see	O
if	O
the	O
ships	O
were	O
come	O
thither	O
.	O

The	O
12th	O
day	O
she	O
returned	O
again	O
with	O
tidings	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
both	O
there	O
at	O
anchor	O
.	O

Therefore	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
we	O
all	O
went	O
aboard	O
of	O
our	O
ships	O
and	O
carried	O
the	O
cloth-bark	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
forty	O
of	O
the	O
stoutest	O
Negro	O
men	O
,	O
leaving	O
their	O
three	O
barks	O
with	O
the	O
rest	O
;	O
and	O
out	O
of	O
these	O
also	O
Captain	O
Davis	O
and	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
chose	O
about	O
14	O
or	O
15	O
apiece	O
,	O
and	O
turned	O
the	O
rest	O
ashore	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
never	O
a	O
greater	O
opportunity	O
put	O
into	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
men	O
to	O
enrich	O
themselves	O
than	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
have	O
gone	O
with	O
these	O
Negroes	O
and	O
settled	O
ourselves	O
at	O
Santa	PNM
Maria	PNM
,	O
on	O
the	O
Isthmus	PNM
of	PNM
Darien	PNM
,	O
and	O
employed	O
them	O
in	O
getting	O
gold	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
mines	O
there	O
.	O

Which	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
done	O
with	O
ease	O
:	O
for	O
about	O
six	O
months	O
before	O
this	O
Captain	O
Harris	O
-LRB-	O
who	O
was	O
now	O
with	O
us	O
-RRB-	O
coming	O
overland	O
from	O
the	O
North	PNM
Seas	PNM
with	O
his	O
body	O
of	O
Privateers	O

had	O
routed	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
town	O
and	O
gold-mines	O
of	O
Santa	PNM

,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
never	O
attempted	O
to	O
settle	O
there	O
again	O
since	O
:	O
add	O
to	O
this	O
that	O
the	O
Indian	O
neighbourhood	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
mortal	O
enemies	O
to	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
and	O
had	O
been	O
flushed	O
by	O
their	O
successes	O
against	O
them	O
,	O
through	O
the	O
assistance	O
of	O
the	O
privateers	O

for	O
several	O

were	O
our	O
fast	O
friends	O
and	O
ready	O
to	O
receive	O
and	O
assist	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
1000	O
Negroes	O
to	O
work	O
for	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
200	O
tun	O
of	O
flour	O
that	O
lay	O
at	O
the	O
Gallapagos	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
the	O
river	O
of	O
Santa	PNM
Maria	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
could	O
careen	O
and	O
fit	O
our	O
ships	O
;	O
and	O
might	O
fortify	O
the	O
mouth	O
so	O
that	O
if	O
all	O
the	O
strength	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
have	O
in	O
Peru	PNM
had	O
come	O
against	O
us	O
we	O
could	O
have	O
kept	O
them	O
out	O

If	O
they	O
lay	O
with	O
guard-ships	O
of	O
strength	O
to	O
keep	O
us	O
in	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
country	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
nation	O
of	O
Indians	O
that	O
were	O
our	O
friends	O
:	O
besides	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
principal	O
thing	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
North	PNM

to	O

us	O
;	O
from	O
whence	O
we	O
could	O
export	O

or	O
import	O
goods	O
or	O
men	O
to	O
our	O
assistance	O
;	O
for	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
had	O
assistance	O
from	O
all	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
West	O
Indies	O
;	O
many	O
thousands	O
of	O
privateers	O
from	O
Jamaica	PNM
and	O
the	O
French	O
islands	O
especially	O
would	O
have	O
flocked	O
over	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
long	O
before	O
this	O
time	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
masters	O
not	O
only	O
of	O
those	O
mines	O
-LRB-	O
the	O
richest	O

of	O

the	O

Quito	PNM
:	O
and	O
much	O
more	O
than	O
I	O
say	O
might	O

have	O
been	O
done	O

But	O
these	O
may	O
seem	O
to	O
the	O
reader	O
but	O
golden	O
dreams	O
:	O
to	O
leave	O
them	O
therefore	O
;	O
the	O
13th	O
day	O
we	O
sailed	O
from	O
Punta	PNM
Arena	PNM
towards	O
Plata	O
to	O
seek	O
our	O
bark	O
that	O
was	O
sent	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
Lobos	O
in	O
search	O
of	O
Captain	O

We	O
were	O
two	O
ships	O
in	O
company	O
and	O
two	O
barks	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
16th	O
day	O
we	O
arrived	O
at	O
Plata	PNM
,	O
but	O
found	O
no	O
bark	O
there	O
,	O
nor	O
any	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
we	O
went	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
main	O
to	O
fill	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
our	O
passage	O
met	O
our	O

she	O

the	O

an	O

with	O
trees	O
of	O
divers	O

;	O
so	O
that	O
sailing	O
by	O
this	O
coast	O
you	O
see	O
nothing	O
but	O
a	O
vast	O
grove	O
or	O
wood	O
;	O
which	O
is	O
so	O
much	O
the	O
more	O
pleasant	O
because	O
the	O
trees	O
are	O
of	O
several	O
forms	O
,	O
both	O
in	O
respect	O
to	O
their	O
growth	O
and	O

Our	O
design	O
was	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
in	O
my	O
first	O
chapter	O
,	O
to	O
search	O
for	O
Canoas	O
in	O

where	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
have	O
neither	O
settlement	O
or	O
trade	O
with	O
the	O
native	O
Indians	O

We	O
had	O
Spanish	O
pilots	O

and	O
Indians	O
bred	O
under	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
able	O

carry	O
us	O
into	O
any	O
harbour	O
or	O
river	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
wholly	O
unacquainted	O
with	O
those	O
rivers	O
which	O
were	O
not	O
frequented	O
by	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
many	O
such	O
unfrequented	O
rivers	O
between	O
Plata	PNM

indeed	O
all	O

from	O
the	O

only	O

on	O

there	O

Now	O
our	O
pilots	O
being	O
at	O
a	O
loss	O
on	O
these	O
less-frequented	O
coasts	O
,	O
we	O
supplied	O
that	O
defect	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
Spanish	O
pilot-books	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
took	O
in	O
their	O

these	O
we	O
found	O

Yet	O

the	O

full	O

it	O
is	O

This	O
however	O
could	O
be	O
no	O
discouragement	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
for	O
one	O

might	O

be	O

we	O
pitched	O

river	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
what	O
height	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
.	O

Probably	O
the	O
river	O
has	O
its	O
original	O
from	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
rich	O
mountains	O
near	O
the	O
city	O
Quibo	PNM
,	O
and	O
it	O
runs	O
through	O
a	O
country	O
as	O
rich	O
in	O
soil	O
as	O
perhaps	O
any	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
especially	O
when	O
it	O
draws	O
within	O
10	O
or	O
12	O
leagues	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
.	O

The	O
land	O
there	O
,	O
both	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
and	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
is	O
of	O
a	O
black	O
deep	O
mould	O
,	O
producing	O
extraordinary	O
great	O
tall	O
trees	O
of	O
many	O
sorts	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
usually	O
grow	O
in	O
these	O
hot	O
climates	O
.	O

I	O
shall	O
only	O
give	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
cotton	O
and	O
cabbage-trees	O
,	O
whereof	O
there	O
is	O
great	O
plenty	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
are	O
as	O
large	O
of	O
their	O
kinds	O
as	O
ever	O
I	O
saw	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
two	O
sorts	O
of	O
cotton-trees	O
,	O
one	O
is	O
called	O
the	O
red	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
the	O
white	O
cotton-tree	O
.	O

The	O
white	O
cotton-tree	O
grows	O
like	O
an	O
oak	O
,	O
but	O
generally	O
much	O
bigger	O
and	O
taller	O
than	O
our	O
oaks	O
:	O
the	O
body	O
is	O
straight	O
and	O
clear	O
from	O
knots	O
or	O
boughs	O
to	O
the	O
very	O
head	O
:	O
there	O
it	O
spreads	O
forth	O
many	O
great	O
limbs	O
just	O
like	O
an	O
oak	O
.	O

The	O
bark	O
is	O
smooth	O
and	O
of	O
a	O
grey	O
colour	O
:	O
the	O
leaves	O
are	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
a	O
large	O
plum-leaf	O
,	O
jagged	O
at	O
the	O
edge	O
;	O
they	O
are	O
oval	O
,	O
smooth	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
a	O
dark	O
green	O
colour	O
.	O

Some	O
of	O
these	O
trees	O
have	O
their	O
bodies	O
much	O
bigger	O
18	O
or	O
20	O
foot	O
high	O
than	O
nearer	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
being	O
big-bellied	O
like	O
ninepins	O
.	O

They	O
bear	O
a	O
very	O
fine	O
sort	O
of	O
cotton	O
,	O
called	O
silk-cotton	O
.	O

When	O
this	O
cotton	O
is	O
ripe	O
the	O
trees	O
appear	O
like	O
our	O
apple-trees	O
in	O
England	PNM
when	O
full	O
of	O
blossoms	O
.	O

If	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
mistake	O
the	O
cotton	O
falls	O
down	O
in	O
November	O
or	O
December	O
:	O
then	O
the	O
ground	O
is	O
covered	O
white	O
with	O
it	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
not	O
substantial	O
and	O
continuous	O
,	O
like	O
that	O
which	O
grows	O
upon	O
the	O
cotton-shrubs	O
in	O
plantations	O
,	O
but	O
like	O
the	O
down	O
of	O
thistles	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
did	O
never	O
know	O
any	O
use	O
made	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
West	O
Indies	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
worth	O
the	O
labour	O
of	O
gathering	O
it	O
:	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
the	O
natives	O
gather	O
and	O
use	O
it	O
for	O
pillows	O
.	O

It	O
has	O
a	O
small	O
black	O
seed	O
among	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
leaves	O
of	O
this	O
tree	O
fall	O
off	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
April	O
;	O
while	O
the	O
old	O
leaves	O
are	O
falling	O
off	O
the	O
young	O
ones	O
spring	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
week	O
's	O
time	O
the	O
tree	O
casts	O
off	O
her	O
old	O
robes	O
and	O
is	O
clothed	O
in	O
a	O
new	O
pleasant	O
garb	O
.	O

The	O
red	O
cotton-tree	O
is	O
like	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
but	O
hardly	O
so	O
big	O
:	O
it	O
bears	O
no	O
cotton	O
,	O
but	O
its	O
wood	O
is	O
somewhat	O
harder	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
,	O
yet	O
both	O
sorts	O
are	O
soft	O
spongy	O
wood	O
,	O
fit	O
for	O
no	O
use	O
that	O
I	O
know	O
but	O
only	O
for	O
Canoas	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
being	O
straight	O
and	O
tall	O
,	O
they	O
are	O
very	O
good	O
for	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
will	O
not	O
last	O
long	O
,	O
especially	O
if	O
not	O
drawn	O
ashore	O
often	O
and	O
tarred	O
;	O
otherwise	O
the	O
worm	O
and	O
the	O
water	O
soon	O
rot	O
them	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
the	O
biggest	O
trees	O
,	O
or	O
perhaps	O
weeds	O
rather	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
West	PNM
Indies	PNM
.	O

They	O
are	O
common	O
in	O
the	O
East	O
and	O
West	O
Indies	O
in	O
good	O
fat	O
land	O
.	O

As	O
the	O
cotton	O
is	O
the	O
biggest	O
tree	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
so	O
the	O
cabbage-tree	O
is	O
the	O
tallest	O
:	O
the	O
body	O
is	O
not	O
very	O
big	O
,	O
but	O
very	O
high	O
and	O
straight	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
measured	O
one	O
in	O
the	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM
Campeachy	PNM
120	O
feet	O
long	O
as	O
it	O
lay	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
are	O
some	O
much	O
higher	O
.	O

It	O
has	O
no	O
limbs	O
nor	O
boughs	O
,	O
but	O
at	O
the	O
head	O
there	O
are	O
many	O
branches	O
bigger	O
than	O
a	O
man	O
's	O
arm	O
.	O

These	O
branches	O
are	O
not	O
covered	O
but	O
flat	O
with	O
sharp	O
edges	O
;	O
they	O
are	O
12	O
or	O
14	O
foot	O
long	O
.	O

About	O
two	O
foot	O
from	O
the	O
trunk	O
the	O
branches	O
shoot	O
forth	O
small	O
long	O
leaves	O
about	O
an	O
inch	O
broad	O
,	O
which	O
grow	O
so	O
regularly	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
of	O
the	O
branch	O
that	O
the	O
whole	O
branch	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
but	O
one	O
leaf	O
made	O
up	O
of	O
many	O
small	O
ones	O
.	O

The	O
cabbage-fruit	O
shoots	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
midst	O
of	O
these	O
branches	O
from	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
;	O
it	O
is	O
invested	O
with	O
many	O
young	O
leaves	O
or	O
branches	O
which	O
are	O
ready	O
to	O
spread	O
abroad	O
as	O
the	O
old	O
branches	O
drop	O
and	O
fall	O
down	O
.	O

The	O
cabbage	O
itself	O
,	O
when	O
it	O
is	O
taken	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
leaves	O
which	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
folded	O
in	O
,	O
is	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
the	O
small	O
of	O
a	O
man	O
's	O
leg	O
and	O
a	O
foot	O
long	O
;	O
it	O
is	O
as	O
white	O
as	O
milk	O
and	O
as	O
sweet	O
as	O
a	O
nut	O
if	O
eaten	O
raw	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
sweet	O
and	O
wholesome	O
if	O
boiled	O
.	O

Besides	O
the	O
cabbage	O
itself	O
there	O
grow	O
out	O
between	O
the	O
cabbage	O
and	O
the	O
large	O
branches	O
small	O
twigs	O
,	O
as	O
of	O
a	O
shrub	O
,	O
about	O
two	O
foot	O
long	O
from	O
their	O

At	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
those	O
twigs	O
-LRB-	O
which	O
grow	O
very	O
thick	O
together	O
-RRB-	O
there	O
hang	O
berries	O
hard	O
and	O
round	O
and	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
a	O
cherry	O
.	O

These	O
the	O
trees	O
shed	O
every	O
year	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
are	O
very	O
good	O
for	O
hogs	O
:	O
for	O
this	O
reason	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
fine	O
any	O
who	O
shall	O
cut	O
down	O
any	O
of	O
these	O
in	O
their	O
woods	O
.	O

The	O
body	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
is	O
full	O
of	O
rings	O
round	O
it	O
,	O
half	O
a	O
foot	O
asunder	O
from	O
the	O
bottom	O
to	O
the	O
top	O
.	O

The	O
bark	O
is	O
thin	O
and	O
brittle	O
;	O
the	O
wood	O
is	O
black	O
and	O
very	O
hard	O
,	O
the	O
heart	O
or	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
is	O
white	O
pith	O
.	O

They	O
do	O
not	O
climb	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
cabbage	O
but	O
cut	O
them	O
down	O
;	O
for	O
should	O
they	O
gather	O
it	O
off	O
the	O
tree	O
as	O
it	O
stands	O
,	O
yet	O
its	O
head	O
being	O
gone	O
it	O
soon	O
dies	O
.	O

These	O
trees	O
are	O
much	O
used	O
by	O
planters	O
in	O
Jamaica	PNM
to	O
board	O
the	O
sides	O
of	O
the	O
houses	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
is	O
but	O
splitting	O
the	O
trunk	O
into	O
four	O
parts	O
with	O
an	O
axe	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
are	O
so	O
many	O
planks	O
.	O

Those	O
trees	O
appear	O
very	O
pleasant	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
beautify	O
the	O
whole	O
wood	O
,	O
spreading	O
their	O
green	O
branches	O
above	O
all	O
other	O
trees	O
.	O

All	O
this	O
country	O
is	O
subject	O
to	O
very	O
great	O
rains	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
Peru	PNM
pays	O
for	O
the	O
dry	O
weather	O
which	O
they	O
have	O
about	O
Lima	PNM
and	O
all	O
that	O
coast	O
.	O

I	O
believe	O
that	O
is	O
one	O
reason	O
why	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
have	O
made	O
such	O
small	O
discoveries	O
in	O
this	O
and	O
other	O
rivers	O
on	O
this	O
coast	O
.	O

Another	O
reason	O
may	O
be	O
because	O
it	O
lies	O
not	O
so	O
directly	O
in	O
their	O
way	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
coast	O
it	O
along	O
in	O
going	O
from	O
Panama	PNM
to	O
Lima	PNM
,	O
but	O
first	O
go	O
westward	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
keys	O
or	O
isles	O
of	O
Cobaya	PNM
,	O
for	O
a	O
westerly	O
wind	O
,	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
stand	O
over	O
towards	O
Cape	PNM
San	PNM
Francisco	PNM
,	O
not	O
touching	O
anywhere	O
usually	O
till	O
they	O
come	O
to	O
Manta	PNM
near	PNM
Cape	PNM
San	PNM
Lorenzo	PNM
.	O

In	O
their	O
return	O
indeed	O
from	O
Lima	PNM
to	O
Panama	PNM
they	O
may	O
keep	O
along	O
the	O
coast	O
hereabouts	O
;	O
but	O
then	O
their	O
ships	O
are	O
always	O
laden	O
;	O
whereas	O
the	O
light	O
ships	O
that	O
go	O
from	O
Panama	PNM
are	O
most	O
at	O
leisure	O
to	O
make	O
discoveries	O
.	O

A	O
third	O
reason	O
may	O
be	O
the	O
wildness	O
and	O
enmity	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
natives	O
on	O
this	O
coast	O
,	O
who	O
are	O
naturally	O
fortified	O
by	O
their	O
rivers	O
and	O
vast	O
woods	O
,	O
from	O
whence	O
with	O
their	O
arrows	O
they	O
can	O
easily	O
annoy	O
any	O
that	O
shall	O
land	O
there	O
to	O
assault	O
them	O
.	O

At	O
this	O
river	O
particularly	O
there	O
are	O
no	O
Indians	O
live	O
within	O
6	O
leagues	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
country	O
so	O
far	O
is	O
full	O
of	O
impassable	O
woods	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
to	O
get	O
at	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
mines	O
and	O
mountains	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
way	O
but	O
by	O
rowing	O
up	O
the	O
river	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
any	O
who	O
are	O
enemies	O
to	O
the	O
natives	O
attempt	O
this	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
are	O
always	O
hated	O
by	O
them	O
-RRB-	O
they	O
must	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
be	O
exposed	O
to	O
the	O
arrows	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
would	O
lie	O
purposely	O
in	O
ambush	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
for	O
them	O
.	O

These	O
wild	O
Indians	O
have	O
small	O
plantations	O
of	O
maize	O
and	O
good	O
plantain-gardens	O
;	O
for	O
plantains	O
are	O
their	O
chiefest	O
food	O
.	O

They	O
have	O
also	O
a	O
few	O
fowls	O
and	O
hogs	O

It	O
was	O
to	O
this	O
river	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
bound	O
to	O
seek	O
for	O
Canoas	PNM
,	O
therefore	O
the	O
26th	O
,	O
supposing	O
ourselves	O
to	O
be	O
abreast	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
from	O
our	O
ships	O
with	O
4	O
Canoas	O
.	O

The	O
27th	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
we	O
entered	O
at	O
half	O
flood	O
into	O
the	O
smaller	O
branch	O
of	O
that	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
rowed	O
up	O
six	O
leagues	O
before	O
we	O
met	O
any	O
inhabitants	O
.	O

There	O
we	O
found	O
two	O
small	O
huts	O
thatched	O
with	O
palmetto-leaves	O
.	O

The	O
Indians	O
,	O
seeing	O
us	O
rowing	O
towards	O
their	O
houses	O
,	O
got	O
their	O
wives	O
and	O
little	O
ones	O
,	O
with	O
their	O
household	O
stuff	O
,	O
into	O
their	O
Canoas	O
,	O
and	O
paddled	O
away	O
faster	O
than	O
we	O
could	O
row	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
keep	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
because	O
of	O
our	O
oars	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
with	O
their	O
paddles	O
kept	O
close	O
under	O
the	O
banks	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
had	O
not	O
the	O
strength	O
of	O
the	O
stream	O
against	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
.	O

These	O
huts	O
were	O
close	O
by	O
the	O
river	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
just	O
against	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
other	O
houses	O
a	O
league	O
from	O
us	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
main	O
stream	O
into	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
come	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
swift	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
afraid	O
to	O
put	O
over	O
for	O
fear	O
we	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
back	O
again	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
only	O
a	O
hog	O
,	O
some	O
Fowls	O
and	O
plantains	O
in	O
the	O
huts	O
:	O
we	O
killed	O
the	O
hog	O
and	O

came	O
to	O
an	O

we	O
took	O
the	O

We	O
arrived	O
at	O
Tomaco	PNM
about	O
12	O
a	O
clock	O
at	O
night	O

Here	O
we	O
took	O
all	O
the	O

the	O

a	O
Spanish	O
knight	O
called	O
Don	PNM

This	O

came	O
in	O
a	O

and	O
there	O
were	O
only	O

8	O

We	O
went	O
in	O
a	O
canoa	O
with	O
7	O
men	O

took	O
her	O
;	O
she	O
had	O

12	O

the	O

Here	O
an	O

canoa	O
came	O
aboard	O

These	O

could	O
not	O

neither	O

the	O

Indians	O
usually	O
thinking	O
all	O

We	O
gave	O
them	O
3	O
Or	O
4	O
calabashes	O
of	O

which	O
they	O
freely	O
drank	O

A	O

The	O
31st	O

two	O
of	O
our	O

up	O
the	O

They	O
had	O
rowed	O
seven	O

found	O

one	O

a	O

they	O

1685	O
The	O
first	O
day	O
of	O
January	O
1685	O
we	O
went	O
from	O
Tomaco	PNM
towards	O
Gallo	PNM
.	O

We	O
carried	O
the	O
knight	O
with	O
us	O
and	O
two	O
small	O
Canoas	O
which	O
we	O
took	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
rowing	O
over	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
Canoas	O
took	O
a	O
packet-boat	O
that	O
was	O
sent	O
from	O
Panama	PNM
to	O
Lima	PNM
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
threw	O
the	O
packet	O
of	O
letters	O
overboard	O
with	O
a	O
line	O
and	O
a	O
buoy	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
our	O
men	O
seeing	O
it	O
took	O
it	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
the	O
letters	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
prisoners	O
aboard	O
our	O
ships	O
that	O
were	O
then	O
at	O
an	O
anchor	O
at	O
Gallo	PNM
.	O

Here	O
we	O
stayed	O
till	O
the	O
6th	O
day	O
,	O
reading	O
the	O
letters	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
we	O
understood	O
that	O
the	O
armada	O
from	O
Old	PNM
Spain	PNM
was	O
come	O
to	O
Portobello	PNM
:	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
president	O
of	O
Panama	PNM
had	O
sent	O
this	O
packet	O
on	O
purpose	O
to	O
hasten	O
the	O
Plate	O
fleet	O
thither	O
from	O
Lima	PNM
.	O

We	O
were	O
very	O
joyful	O
of	O
this	O
news	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
sent	O
away	O
the	O
packet-boat	O
with	O
all	O
her	O
letters	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
altered	O
our	O
former	O
resolutions	O
of	O
going	O
to	O
Lavelia	PNM
.	O

We	O
now	O
concluded	O
to	O
careen	O
our	O
ships	O
as	O
speedily	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
be	O
ready	O
to	O
intercept	O
this	O
fleet	O
.	O

The	O
properest	O
place	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
think	O
on	O
for	O
doing	O
it	O
was	O
among	O
the	O
King	PNM
's	PNM
Islands	PNM
or	PNM
Pearl	PNM
Keys	O
,	O
because	O
they	O
are	O
near	O
Panama	PNM
and	O
all	O
ships	O
bound	O
to	O
Panama	PNM
from	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Lima	PNM
pass	O
by	O
them	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
being	O
there	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
possibly	O
miss	O
the	O
fleet	O
.	O

According	O
to	O
these	O
resolutions	O
we	O
sailed	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
execute	O
what	O
we	O
designed	O
.	O

We	O
were	O

We	O

out	O
all	O

Captain	O
Swan	O

which	O
never	O

for	O
the	O

,	O
the	O
tide	O

we	O
were	O

them	O
till	O
the	O
next	O
day	O

The	O
8th	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
we	O
descried	O
a	O
sail	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
of	O
us	O
;	O
the	O
wind	O
was	O
at	O

we	O
chased	O
her	O
and	O
before	O
noon	O
took	O
her	O

She	O
was	O
a	O
ship	O
of	O
about	O
90	O

laden	O
with	O
flour	O
;	O
she	O
came	O
from	O
Truxillo	PNM

was	O
bound	O
to	O
Panama	PNM

This	O

came	O
very	O
opportunely	O
to	O
us	O
for	O
flour	O
began	O
to	O
grow	O
scarce	O

and	O
Captain	O

who	O

as	O
I	O
said	O

had	O
none	O

had	O
from	O

the	O
island	O

The	O
harbour	O
where	O
we	O
careen	O
'd	O
was	O
encompassed	O
with	O
three	O
islands	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
ships	O
rode	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
.	O

That	O
on	O
which	O
we	O
hauled	O
our	O
ships	O
ashore	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
island	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
harbour	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
fine	O
small	O
sandy	O
bay	O
,	O
but	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
was	O
environed	O
with	O
rocks	O
on	O
which	O
at	O
low	O
water	O
we	O
did	O
use	O
to	O
gather	O
oysters	O
,	O
clams	O
,	O
mussels	O
,	O
and	O
limpets	O
.	O

The	O
clam	O
is	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
oyster	O
which	O
grows	O
so	O
fast	O
to	O
the	O
rock	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
separating	O
it	O
from	O
thence	O
,	O
therefore	O
we	O
did	O
open	O
it	O
where	O
it	O
grows	O
,	O
and	O
take	O
out	O
the	O
meat	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
very	O
large	O
,	O
fat	O
,	O
and	O
sweet	O

Here	O
are	O
a	O
few	O
common	O
oysters	O
such	O
as	O
we	O
have	O
in	O
England	PNM
,	O
of	O
which	O
sort	O
I	O
have	O
met	O
with	O
none	O
in	O

at	O

in	O
Port	PNM
St.	PNM

on	O

somewhat	O

;	O
but	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
mention	O

of	O
what	O
oysters	O
they	O
are	O

Here	O
are	O
some	O
Guanos	O

but	O
we	O
found	O
no	O
other	O
sort	O
of	O
land-animal	O

Here	O
are	O
also	O
some	O
pigeons	O
and	O
turtle-doves	O

The	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
islands	O
that	O
encompass	O
this	O
harbour	O
had	O
of	O
all	O
these	O
sorts	O
of	O
creatures	O

Our	O
men	O
therefore	O
did	O
every	O

go	O
over	O
in	O
Canoas	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
fish	O

fowl	O

or	O
hunt	O
for	O
Guanos	PNM

lying	O
there	O
in	O

,	O
and	O
carried	O
off	O
by	O
them	O
to	O
Panama	PNM
,	O
we	O
were	O
after	O
that	O
more	O
cautious	O
of	O
straggling	O
.	O

The	O
14th	O
day	O
of	O
February	O
1685	O
we	O
made	O
an	O
end	O
of	O
cleaning	O
our	O
ship	O
,	O
filled	O
all	O
our	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
stocked	O
ourselves	O
with	O
firewood	O
.	O

The	O
15th	O
day	O
we	O
went	O
out	O
from	O
among	O
the	O
islands	O
and	O
anchored	O
in	O
the	O
channel	O
between	O
them	O
and	O
the	O
Main	O
,	O
in	O
25	O
fathom	O

soft	O

The	O
Plate	O
fleet	O
was	O
not	O
yet	O
arrived	O
;	O
therefore	O
we	O
intended	O
to	O
cruise	O
before	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Panama	PNM
,	O
which	O
is	O
from	O
this	O
place	O
about	O
25	O
leagues	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
we	O
sailed	O
towards	O
Panama	PNM
,	O
passing	O
in	O
the	O
channel	O
between	O
the	O
King	PNM
's	PNM
Islands	PNM
and	O
the	O

It	O
is	O
very	O

having	O
the	O
Main	O
on	O
one	O
side	O

It	O
is	O
beautified	O
with	O

There	O
are	O
some	O

and	O
they	O
as	O

are	O
on	O
the	O

also	O
a	O

them	O

These	O

The	O
16th	O
day	O
we	O
anchored	O
at	O

in	O
17	O
fathom	O
water	O
about	O
a	O

the	O

with	O
the	O

at	O
north-north-east	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
abreast	O

we	O

about	O

very	O

to	O
the	O

that	O

by	O
them	O
;	O
some	O
of	O
which	O

It	O

out	O

off	O

with	O

from	O

began	O
to	O
entertain	O
such	O
thoughts	O
in	O

soon	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
resolution	O
to	O
make	O

which	O
we	O

did	O
with	O
Captain	O

so	O

took	O
the	O

in	O

The	O
occasion	O
of	O
this	O
our	O
late	O
friendship	O
with	O
those	O

was	O
thus	O
:	O
about	O
15	O
years	O
before	O
this	O

,	O
Captain	O

being	O

going	O
in	O
among	O
the	O
Samballoes	O

to	O
strike	O
fish	O
and	O
turtle	O
,	O
took	O
there	O
a	O
young	O
Indian	O
lad	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
paddling	O
about	O
in	O
a	O
canoa	O

He	O
brought	O
him	O
aboard	O
his	O

gave	O
him	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
John	PNM

him	O

intending	O
to	O

him	O
among	O

But	O
his	O
Moskito	O
strikers	O
,	O
taking	O
a	O
fancy	O
to	O
the	O
boy	O
,	O
begged	O
him	O
of	O
Captain	O

,	O
and	O
took	O
him	O
with	O
them	O
at	O
their	O

into	O
their	O

where	O
they	O

he	O

a	O

was	O
with	O

a	O

;	O
but	O
his	O

had	O
almost	O

Thus	O
he	O
lived	O
among	O
them	O
for	O
many	O

about	O
six	O

,	O
Captain	O

being	O
again	O
among	O
the	O

took	O
thence	O
another	O
Indian	O
boy	O
about	O
10	O

12	O
years	O

,	O
the	O
son	O

and	O
,	O
wanting	O

John	O

was	O
much	O
pleased	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
lad	O
there	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
came	O
into	O
his	O
mind	O
to	O
persuade	O
Captain	O
Wright	O
upon	O
this	O
occasion	O
to	O
endeavour	O
a	O
friendship	O
with	O
those	O
Indians	O
;	O
a	O
thing	O
our	O
privateers	O
had	O
long	O

never	O

attempt	O

having	O
such	O
dreadful	O
apprehensions	O
of	O
their	O
numbers	O
and	O
fierceness	O
:	O
but	O
John	O
Gret	O
offered	O
the	O
captain	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
go	O
ashore	O
and	O
negotiate	O
the	O
matter	O
;	O
who	O
accordingly	O
sent	O
him	O
in	O
his	O
canoa	O

he	O
was	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O

which	O
of	O
a	O

was	O
covered	O
with	O

with	O
their	O
bows	O

John	O
Gret	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
only	O
a	O
clout	O
about	O
his	O
middle	O
as	O
the	O
fashion	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
is	O

leapt	O

out	O
of	O
the	O

swam	O

retiring	O
a	O

and	O
the	O

ashore	O

seeing	O
him	O
in	O
that	O

hearing	O
him	O
call	O
to	O
them	O
in	O
their	O

tongue	O
-LRB-	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
recovered	O
by	O

suffered	O
him	O
quietly	O
to	O

and	O
gathered	O
all	O
about	O
to	O
hear	O
how	O
it	O
was	O
with	O
him	O

He	O
told	O
them	O
particularly	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
countrymen	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
taken	O
many	O
years	O
ago	O
by	O
the	O
English	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
used	O
him	O
very	O
kindly	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
mistaken	O
in	O
being	O
so	O
much	O
afraid	O
of	O
that	O
nation	O
who	O
were	O
not	O
enemies	O
to	O
them	O
but	O
to	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
:	O
to	O
confirm	O
this	O
he	O
told	O
them	O
how	O
well	O
the	O
English	O
treated	O
another	O
young	O
lad	O
of	O
theirs	O
they	O
had	O
lately	O
taken	O
,	O
such	O
a	O
one	O

was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
company	O
that	O
was	O
got	O
together	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O

He	O
persuaded	O
them	O
therefore	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
league	O
with	O
these	O
friendly	O
people	O
,	O
by	O
whose	O
help	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
quell	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
;	O
assuring	O
also	O
the	O
father	O
of	O
the	O
boy	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
but	O
go	O
with	O
him	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
which	O
they	O

at	O

at	O
an	O

it	O
was	O
Golden	PNM

-RRB-	O
he	O
should	O
have	O
his	O

restored	O
to	O
him	O
and	O
they	O
might	O
all	O
expect	O
a	O
very	O
kind	O
reception	O
.	O

Upon	O
these	O
assurances	O
20	O

John	O

these	O

The	O

never	O

the	O

if	O

Several	O
times	O

upon	O
our	O

they	O
enquired	O
of	O
us	O
what	O
was	O
become	O
of	O
their	O
countrymen	O

but	O
we	O
told	O
them	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
,	O
as	O
indeed	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
after	O
that	O
we	O
heard	O
this	O
story	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
concluded	O
the	O

killed	O

taken	O
them	O

But	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
the	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
progress	O
of	O
the	O
armada	O
which	O
we	O
left	O
at	O
Cartagene	PNM

After	O
an	O

stay	O
there	O

about	O
60	O

where	O
it	O
lies	O
30	O

Therefore	O
the	O

on	O
notice	O

There	O
are	O
no	O

not	O

about	O
Panama	PNM
itself	O

on	O

yet	O
in	O
the	O

they	O
are	O

Gentlemen	O
that	O
come	O
from	O

especially	O
in	O
these	O
months	O
,	O
cut	O
their	O

close	O

them	O
from	O
fevers	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
place	O
is	O
sickly	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
because	O
they	O
come	O
out	O
of	O
a	O

never	O

any	O

enjoys	O
a	O

I	O

to	O

this	O

any	O

Thus	O
much	O
for	O
Panama	PNM

The	O
20th	O
day	O
we	O
went	O
and	O
anchored	O
within	O
a	O
league	O
of	O
the	O
islands	O
Perico	PNM
-LRB-	O
which	O
are	O
only	O
3	O

in	O
expectation	O
of	O
the	O
president	O
of	O
Panama	PNM
's	O
answer	O
to	O
the	O

I	O
said	O
we	O
sent	O
him	O
by	O
Don	O

treating	O
about	O

this	O

the	O

which	O
he	O

us	O
his	O
parole	O
to	O
return	O
with	O
an	O
answer	O
.	O

The	O
21st	O
day	O
we	O
took	O
another	O
bark	O
laden	O
with	O
hogs	O
,	O
fowls	O
,	O
salt-beef	O
and	O
molasses	O
;	O
she	O
came	O
from	O
Lavelia	PNM

was	O
going	O
to	O
Panama	PNM

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
we	O
sent	O
another	O
letter	O
ashore	O
by	O
a	O
young	O
Mestizo	O
-LRB-	O
a	O
mixed	O
brood	O
of	O
Indians	O

the	O

,	O
and	O
3	O

4	O
copies	O
of	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
dispersed	O
abroad	O
among	O
the	O

This	O
letter	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
full	O
of	O
threats	O
,	O
together	O
with	O
the	O
young	O
man	O
's	O
managing	O
the	O
business	O

wrought	O
so	O
powerfully	O
among	O
the	O
common	O
people	O
that	O
the	O
city	O
was	O
in	O
an	O
uproar	O
.	O

The	O
president	O
immediately	O
sent	O
a	O
gentleman	O
aboard	O
,	O
who	O
demanded	O
the	O
flour-prize	O
that	O
we	O
took	O
off	O
of	O
Gallo	PNM
and	O
all	O
the	O
prisoners	O
for	O
the	O
ransom	O
of	O
our	O
two	O
men	O
:	O
but	O
our	O
captains	O
told	O
him	O
they	O
would	O
exchange	O
man	O

man	O

The	O
gentleman	O
said	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
orders	O
for	O
that	O
,	O
but	O
if	O
we	O
would	O
stay	O
till	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
he	O
would	O
bring	O
the	O
governors	O
'	O
answer	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
he	O
brought	O
aboard	O
our	O
two	O
men	O
and	O
had	O
about	O
40	O
prisoners	O
in	O
exchange	O
.	O

The	O
24th	O
day	O
we	O
ran	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
Tabago	PNM
.	O

Tabago	O
is	O
in	O
the	O
bay	O
and	O
about	O
six	O
leagues	O
south	O
of	O
Panama	PNM
.	O

It	O
is	O
about	O
3	O
mile	O
long	O
and	O
2	O
broad	O
,	O
a	O
high	O
mountainous	O
island	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
it	O
declines	O
with	O
a	O
gentle	O
descent	O
to	O
the	O
sea	O
.	O

The	O
land	O
by	O
the	O
sea	O
is	O
of	O
a	O
black	O
mould	O
and	O
deep	O
;	O
but	O
towards	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
mountain	O
it	O
is	O
strong	O
and	O
dry	O
.	O

The	O
north	O
side	O
of	O
this	O
island	O
makes	O
a	O
very	O
pleasant	O
show	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
garden	O
of	O
fruit	O
enclosed	O
with	O
many	O
high	O
trees	O
;	O
the	O
chiefest	O
fruits	O
are	O
plantains	O
and	O
bananas	O
.	O

They	O
thrive	O
very	O
well	O
from	O
the	O
foot	O
to	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
those	O
near	O
the	O
top	O
are	O
but	O
small	O
,	O
as	O
wanting	O
moisture	O
.	O

Close	O
by	O
the	O
sea	O
there	O
are	O
many	O
coconut-trees	O
,	O
which	O
make	O
a	O
very	O
pleasant	O
sight	O
.	O

Within	O
the	O
coconut-trees	O
there	O
grow	O
many	O
mammee-trees	O
.	O

The	O
mammee	O
is	O
a	O
large	O
,	O
tall	O
,	O
and	O
straight-bodied	O
tree	O
,	O
clean	O
without	O
knots	O
or	O
limbs	O
for	O
60	O
or	O
70	O
foot	O
or	O
more	O
.	O

The	O
head	O
spreads	O
abroad	O
into	O
many	O
small	O
limbs	O
which	O
grow	O
pretty	O
thick	O
and	O
close	O
together	O
.	O

The	O
bark	O
is	O
of	O
a	O
dark	O
grey	O
colour	O
,	O
thick	O
and	O
rough	O
,	O
full	O
of	O
large	O
chops	O
.	O

The	O
fruit	O
is	O
bigger	O
than	O
a	O
quince	O
;	O
it	O
is	O
round	O
and	O
covered	O
with	O
a	O
thick	O
rind	O
of	O
a	O
grey	O
colour	O
:	O
when	O
the	O
fruit	O
is	O
ripe	O
the	O
rind	O
is	O
yellow	O
and	O
tough	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
will	O
then	O
peel	O
off	O
like	O
leather	O
;	O
but	O
before	O
it	O
is	O
ripe	O
it	O
is	O
brittle	O
:	O
the	O
juice	O
is	O
then	O
white	O
and	O
clammy	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
ripe	O
not	O
so	O
.	O

The	O
ripe	O
fruit	O
under	O
the	O
rind	O
is	O
yellow	O
as	O
a	O
carrot	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
are	O
two	O
large	O
rough	O
stones	O
,	O
flat	O
,	O
and	O
each	O
of	O
them	O
much	O
bigger	O
than	O
an	O
almond	O
.	O

The	O
fruit	O
smells	O
very	O
well	O
and	O
the	O
taste	O
is	O
answerable	O
to	O
the	O
smell	O
.	O

The	O
south-west	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
has	O
never	O
been	O
cleared	O
but	O
is	O
full	O
of	O
firewood	O
and	O
trees	O
of	O
divers	O
sorts	O

There	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
fine	O
small	O
brook	O
of	O
fresh	O
water	O
that	O
springs	O
out	O
of	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
mountain	O
and	O
,	O
gliding	O
through	O
the	O
grove	O
of	O
fruit-trees	O
,	O
falls	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
on	O
the	O
north	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
small	O
town	O
standing	O
by	O
the	O
sea	O
with	O
a	O
church	O
at	O
one	O
end	O
,	O
but	O
now	O
the	O
biggest	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
destroyed	O
by	O
the	O

There	O
is	O
good	O
anchoring	O
right	O

about	O
a	O

There	O
is	O
a	O
small	O
island	O
close	O

the	O
north-west	O

of	O
this	O

this	O

has	O
no	O

While	O
we	O
lay	O
at	O
Tabago	PNM
we	O
had	O
like	O
to	O
have	O
had	O
a	O
scurvy	O
trick	O
played	O
us	O
by	O
a	O
pretended	O
merchant	O
from	O
Panama	PNM
,	O
who	O
came	O
as	O
by	O
stealth	O
to	O
traffic	O
with	O
us	O
privately	O
;	O
a	O
thing	O
common	O
enough	O
with	O
the	O
Spanish	O
merchants	O
,	O
both	O
in	O
the	O
North	O

South	PNM

notwithstanding	O
the	O
severe	O
prohibition	O
of	O
the	O

who	O
yet	O

connive	O
at	O
it	O
and	O
will	O
even	O
trade	O
with	O
the	O
privateers	O
themselves	O

Our	O
merchant	O
was	O
by	O
agreement	O
to	O
bring	O
out	O
his	O
bark	O
laden	O
with	O
goods	O
in	O
the	O
night	O

and	O
we	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
anchor	O
at	O
the	O
south	O
of	O
Perico	PNM

Out	O
he	O
came	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
fire-ship	O
instead	O
of	O
a	O
bark	O
,	O
and	O
approached	O
very	O
near	O

hailing	O
us	O
with	O
the	O
watch-word	O
we	O
had	O
agreed	O
upon	O
.	O

We	O
,	O
suspecting	O
the	O
worst	O

called	O
to	O
them	O
to	O

away	O
as	O

The	O

was	O
not	O
altogether	O
so	O
politick	O
in	O

to	O

us	O
at	O

upon	O

have	O
been	O

ashore	O

I	O
suppose	O
they	O
chose	O
Perico	O
rather	O
for	O
the	O
scene	O
of	O
their	O
enterprise	O
,	O
partly	O
because	O
they	O
might	O
there	O
best	O
skulk	O
among	O
the	O
islands	O

and	O
partly	O
because	O
,	O
if	O

,	O
they	O
could	O
thence	O
escape	O
best	O
from	O
our	O

two	O

During	O
this	O

Captain	O
Swan	O
-LRB-	O
whose	O

was	O
less	O

and	O
so	O
not	O
so	O

aimed	O
at	O
by	O
the	O

-RRB-	O
lay	O
about	O

off	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
canoa	O
at	O
the	O
buoy	O
of	O
his	O
anchor	O
,	O
as	O
fearing	O
some	O
treachery	O
from	O
our	O
pretended	O
merchant	O
;	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
before	O
the	O
bark	O
blew	O
up	O
he	O
saw	O
a	O
small	O
float	O
on	O
the	O
water	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
appeared	O
,	O
a	O
man	O
on	O
it	O
making	O
towards	O
his	O
ship	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
man	O
dived	O
and	O
disappeared	O
of	O
a	O
sudden	O
,	O
as	O
thinking	O
probably	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
discovered	O

This	O
was	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
one	O
coming	O
with	O
some	O
combustible	O

to	O
have	O
stuck	O
about	O
the	O

For	O
such	O
a	O
trick	O
Captain	O
Sharp	O
was	O
served	O
at	O
Coquimbo	PNM

and	O
his	O

The	O

that	O

but	O
after	O

she	O

This	O
Captain	O

was	O
he	O
of	O
whom	O
I	O
made	O
mention	O
in	O

4th	O
chapter	O

He	O
,	O
after	O
his	O
being	O
at	O
the	O
isles	O
of	O
Cape	PNM
Verde	PNM
,	O
stood	O
away	O
for	O
the	O
South	PNM

at	O
the	O
instigation	O
of	O
one	O
Richard	O
Morton	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
with	O
Captain	O
Sharp	O
in	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
.	O

In	O
his	O
way	O
he	O
met	O
with	O
Captain	O
Eaton	O
and	O
they	O
two	O
consorted	O
a	O
day	O
or	O
two	O
:	O
at	O
last	O
Morton	O
went	O
aboard	O
Captain	O
Eaton	O
and	O
persuaded	O
him	O
to	O
lose	O
Captain	O
Bond	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
which	O
Captain	O
Eaton	O
did	O
,	O
Morton	O
continuing	O
aboard	O
of	O
Captain	O
Eaton	O
,	O
as	O
finding	O
his	O
the	O
better	O
ship	O

Captain	O
Bond	O
thus	O
losing	O
both	O
his	O
consort	O
Eaton	O
,	O
and	O
Morton	O
his	O
pilot	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
ship	O
being	O
but	O
an	O
ordinary	O
sailer	O
,	O
he	O
despaired	O
of	O
getting	O
into	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
;	O
and	O
had	O
played	O
such	O
tricks	O
among	O
the	O
Caribbean	O
Isles	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
told	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
dare	O
to	O
appear	O
at	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
English	PNM
islands	PNM
.	O

Therefore	O
he	O
persuaded	O
his	O
men	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
and	O
they	O
consented	O
to	O
anything	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
propose	O
:	O
so	O
he	O
presently	O
steered	O
away	O
into	O
the	O
West	PNM
Indies	PNM
and	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
was	O
at	O
Portobello	PNM
.	O

He	O
presently	O
declared	O
to	O
the	O
governor	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
English	O
ships	O
coming	O
into	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
,	O
and	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
questioned	O
it	O
,	O
he	O
offered	O
to	O
be	O
kept	O
a	O
prisoner	O
till	O
time	O
should	O
discover	O
the	O
truth	O
of	O
what	O
he	O
said	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
believed	O
him	O
and	O
sent	O
him	O
away	O
to	O
Panama	PNM
where	O
he	O
was	O
in	O
great	O
esteem	O
.	O

This	O
several	O
prisoners	O
told	O
us	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
of	O
Panama	PNM
could	O
not	O
have	O
fitted	O
out	O
their	O
fire-ship	O
without	O
this	O
Captain	O
Bond	O
's	O
assistance	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
is	O
strange	O
to	O
say	O
how	O
grossly	O
ignorant	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
in	O
the	O
West	O
Indies	O
,	O
but	O
especially	O
in	O
the	O
South	O
Seas	O
,	O
are	O
of	O
sea-affairs	O
.	O

They	O
build	O
indeed	O
good	O
ships	O
,	O
but	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
small	O
matter	O
:	O
for	O
any	O
ship	O
of	O
a	O
good	O
bottom	O
will	O
serve	O
for	O
these	O
seas	O
on	O
the	O
south	O
coast	O
.	O

They	O
rig	O
their	O
ships	O
but	O
untowardly	O
,	O
have	O
no	O
guns	O
but	O
in	O
3	O
or	O
4	O
of	O
the	O
king	O
's	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
are	O
meanly	O
furnished	O
with	O
warlike	O
provisions	O
,	O
and	O
much	O
at	O
a	O
loss	O
for	O
the	O
making	O
any	O
fire-ships	O
or	O
other	O
less	O
useful	O
machines	O
.	O

Nay	O
,	O
they	O
have	O
not	O
the	O
sense	O
to	O
have	O
their	O
guns	O
run	O
within	O
the	O
sides	O
upon	O
their	O
discharge	O
,	O
but	O
have	O
platforms	O
without	O
for	O
the	O
men	O
to	O
stand	O
on	O
to	O
charge	O
them	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
when	O
we	O
come	O
near	O
we	O
can	O
fetch	O
them	O
down	O
with	O
small	O
shot	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
boats	O
.	O

A	O
main	O
reason	O
of	O
this	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
native	O
Spaniards	O
are	O
too	O
proud	O
to	O
be	O
seamen	O
,	O
but	O
use	O
the	O
Indians	O
for	O
all	O
those	O
offices	O
:	O
one	O
Spaniard	O
,	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
,	O
going	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
to	O
command	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
himself	O
of	O
little	O
more	O
knowledge	O
than	O
those	O
poor	O
ignorant	O
creatures	O
:	O
nor	O
can	O
they	O
gain	O
much	O
experience	O
,	O
seldom	O
going	O
far	O
off	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
but	O
coasting	O
along	O
the	O
shores	O
.	O

But	O
to	O
proceed	O
:	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
light	O
we	O
came	O
again	O
to	O
anchor	O
close	O
by	O
our	O
buoys	O
and	O
strove	O
to	O
get	O
our	O
anchors	O
again	O
;	O
but	O
our	O
buoy-ropes	O
,	O
being	O
rotten	O
,	O
broke	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
were	O
puzzling	O
about	O
our	O
anchors	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
Canoas	O
full	O
of	O
men	O
pass	O
between	O
Tabago	PNM
and	O
the	O
other	O
island	O
.	O

This	O
put	O
us	O
into	O
a	O
new	O
consternation	O
:	O
we	O
lay	O
still	O
some	O
time	O
till	O
we	O
saw	O
that	O
they	O
came	O
directly	O
towards	O
us	O
,	O
then	O
we	O
weighed	O
and	O
stood	O
towards	O
them	O
:	O
and	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
within	O
hail	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
English	O
and	O
French	O
privateers	O
come	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
North	O
Seas	O
through	O
the	O
Isthmus	PNM
of	PNM
Darien	PNM
.	O

They	O
were	O
280	O
men	O
in	O
28	O
Canoas	O
;	O
200	O
of	O
them	O
French	O
,	O
the	O
rest	O
English	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
commanded	O
by	O
Captain	O
Gronet	O
and	O
Captain	O
Lequie	O
.	O

We	O
presently	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
again	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
Canoas	O
came	O
aboard	O
.	O

These	O
men	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
180	O
English	O
men	O
more	O
,	O
under	O
the	O
command	O
of	O
Captain	O
Townley	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
of	O

these	O

had	O
been	O
-RRB-	O
to	O

them	O

All	O
the	O
Englishmen	O
that	O
came	O
over	O
in	O
this	O
party	O
were	O
immediately	O
entertained	O
by	O
Captain	O

and	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
in	O
their	O
own	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
French	O

were	O

to	O
have	O
our	O
flour-prize	O
to	O

them	O

and	O
Captain	O
Gronet	O
being	O
the	O

Captain	O

this	O

offered	O
Captain	O
Davis	O
and	O
Captain	O

each	O
of	O
them	O
a	O
new	O
commission	O
from	O
the	O

of	O
Pettit	PNM
Guavos	PNM

It	O
has	O
been	O
usual	O
for	O
many	O
years	O
past	O
for	O
the	O
governor	O
of	O

to	O
send	O
blank	O
commissions	O
to	O

by	O
many	O
of	O
his	O

with	O
orders	O
to	O

whom	O
they	O

the	O

of	O

Captain	O
Davis	O
accepted	O
of	O
one	O
,	O
having	O
before	O
only	O
an	O
old	O
commission	O
,	O
which	O
fell	O
to	O
him	O
by	O
inheritance	O
at	O
the	O
decease	O
of	O
Captain	O
Cook	O
;	O
who	O
took	O
it	O
from	O
Captain	O
Tristian	O
,	O
together	O
with	O
his	O
bark	O
,	O
as	O
is	O
before	O
mentioned	O

But	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
refused	O
it	O
,	O
saying	O
he	O
had	O
an	O
order	O
from	O
the	O
Duke	O
of	O
York	PNM
neither	O
to	O
give	O
offence	O
to	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
nor	O
to	O
receive	O
any	O
affront	O
from	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
injured	O
by	O
them	O
at	O
Valdivia	PNM
,	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
killed	O
some	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
and	O
wounded	O
several	O
more	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
he	O
thought	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
lawful	O
commission	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
to	O
right	O
himself	O
.	O

I	O
never	O
read	O
any	O
of	O
these	O
French	O
commissions	O
while	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
these	O
seas	O
,	O
nor	O
did	O
I	O
then	O
know	O
the	O
import	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
have	O
learnt	O
since	O
that	O
the	O
tenor	O
of	O
them	O
is	O
to	O
give	O
a	O
liberty	O
to	O
fish	O
,	O
fowl	O
,	O
and	O
hunt	O
.	O

The	O
occasion	O
of	O
this	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
island	O
Hispaniola	PNM
,	O
where	O
the	O
garrison	O
of	O
Pettit	PNM
Guavos	PNM
is	O
,	O
belongs	O
partly	O
to	O
the	O
French	O
and	O
partly	O
to	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
time	O
of	O
peace	O
these	O
commissions	O
are	O
given	O
as	O
a	O
warrant	O
to	O
those	O
of	O
each	O
side	O
to	O
protect	O
them	O
from	O
the	O
adverse	O
party	O
:	O
but	O
in	O
effect	O
the	O
French	O
do	O
not	O
restrain	O
them	O
to	O
Hispaniola	PNM
,	O
but	O
make	O
them	O
a	O
pretence	O
for	O
a	O
general	O
ravage	O
in	O
any	O
part	O
of	O
America	PNM
,	O
by	O
sea	O
or	O
land	O
.	O

Having	O
thus	O
disposed	O
of	O
our	O
associates	O
we	O
intended	O
to	O
sail	O
toward	O
the	O
Gulf	PNM
of	PNM
St.	PNM
Michael	PNM
to	O
seek	O
Captain	O
Townley	O
;	O
who	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
we	O
thought	O
might	O
be	O
entering	O
into	O
these	O
seas	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
the	O
second	O
day	O
of	O
March	O
1685	O
we	O
sailed	O
from	O
hence	O
towards	O
the	O
Gulf	PNM
of	PNM
St.	PNM
Michael	PNM
.	O

This	O
gulf	O
lies	O
near	O
30	O
leagues	O
from	O
Panama	PNM
towards	O
the	O
south-east	O

The	O
way	O
thither	O
from	O
Panama	PNM
is	O
to	O
pass	O
between	O
the	O
King	PNM

Islands	PNM
and	O
the	O

It	O
is	O
a	O

the	O

great	O

as	O
if	O
it	O

I	O
have	O
seen	O
a	O
lump	O
as	O

as	O
a	O

brought	O
by	O

-LRB-	O
who	O
took	O
120	O

that	O
there	O
were	O

these	O
they	O
were	O
forced	O

them	O

These	O
lumps	O
are	O

that	O
they	O

work	O
in	O
the	O
dry	O

in	O
the	O
rainy	O
season	O
when	O
the	O

do	O
overflow	O

not	O
work	O

the	O

where	O

Then	O
the	O

who	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
the	O
South	O

five	O

six	O
months	O

and	O
was	O
now	O
on	O
the	O

There	O
he	O

this	O

,	O
not	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
come	O
up	O
with	O
her	O
in	O
his	O
ship	O

he	O
detached	O
these	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
men	O
in	O
a	O
canoa	O
,	O
who	O
took	O
her	O

,	O
when	O
they	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
could	O
not	O
recover	O
their	O
own	O
ship	O
again	O
,	O
losing	O
company	O
with	O
her	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
therefore	O
they	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM
Panama	PNM
intending	O
to	O
go	O
overland	O
back	O
into	O
the	O
North	PNM
Seas	PNM
,	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
luckily	O
met	O
with	O
us	O
:	O
for	O
the	O
Isthmus	PNM
of	PNM
Darien	PNM
was	O
now	O
become	O
a	O

to	O
pass	O
between	O

at	O
their	O
pleasure	O

This	O
bark	O
of	O
Captain	O
Knight	O
's	O
had	O
in	O
her	O
40	O
or	O
50	O
jars	O
of	O
brandy	O
:	O
she	O
was	O
now	O
commanded	O
by	O
Mr.	O
Henry	O
More	O
;	O
but	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
,	O
intending	O
to	O
promote	O
Captain	O
Harris	O
,	O
caused	O
Mr.	O
More	O
to	O
be	O
turned	O
out	O
,	O
alleging	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
likely	O
these	O

were	O
run	O
away	O
from	O
their	O
commander	O

Mr.	O
More	O
willingly	O
resigned	O
her	O

and	O
went	O
aboard	O
of	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
and	O
became	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
now	O
the	O
latter	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
dry	O
season	O
here	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
water	O
at	O
the	O
King	PNM

Pearl	PNM
Islands	PNM
,	O
of	O
which	O
there	O
was	O
plenty	O
when	O
we	O
first	O
came	O
hither	O
,	O
was	O
now	O
dried	O
away	O

Therefore	O
we	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Point	PNM
Garachina	PNM
,	O
thinking	O
to	O
water	O
our	O

there	O
.	O

Captain	O
Harris	O
,	O
being	O
now	O
commander	O
of	O
the	O
new	O
bark	O
,	O
was	O
sent	O
into	O
the	O
river	O
of	O
Santa	PNM
Maria	PNM
to	O
see	O
for	O
those	O
men	O
that	O
the	O
Indians	O
told	O
us	O
of	O
,	O
whilst	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
ships	O
sailed	O
towards	O
Point	PNM
Garachina	PNM
;	O
where	O
we	O
arrived	O
the	O
21st	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
anchored	O
two	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
point	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
a	O
strong	O
tide	O
running	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
Sambo	PNM
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
we	O
ran	O
within	O
the	O
point	O
and	O
anchored	O
in	O
four	O
fathom	O
at	O
low	O
water	O
.	O

The	O
tide	O
rises	O
here	O
eight	O
or	O
nine	O
foot	O
:	O
the	O
flood	O
sets	O
north-north-east	O
,	O
the	O
ebb	O
south-south-west	O
.	O

The	O
Indians	O
that	O
inhabit	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
Sambo	O
came	O
to	O
us	O
in	O
Canoas	O
and	O
brought	O
plantains	O
and	O
bananas	O
.	O

They	O
could	O
not	O
speak	O
nor	O
understand	O
Spanish	O
;	O
therefore	O
I	O
believe	O
they	O
have	O
no	O
commerce	O
with	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
no	O
fresh	O
water	O
here	O
neither	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
went	O
from	O
hence	O
to	O
Port	PNM
Pinas	PNM
,	O
which	O
is	O
seven	O
leagues	O
south	O
by	O
W.	O
from	O
hence	O
.	O

Porto	O
Pinas	O
lies	O
in	O
latitude	O
7	O
degrees	O
north	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
so	O
called	O
because	O
there	O
are	O
many	O
pine-trees	O
growing	O
there	O
.	O

The	O
land	O
is	O
pretty	O
high	O
,	O
rising	O
gently	O
as	O
it	O
runs	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
.	O

This	O
country	O
near	O
the	O
sea	O
is	O
all	O
covered	O
with	O
pretty	O
high	O
woods	O
:	O
the	O
land	O
that	O
bounds	O
the	O
harbour	O
is	O
low	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
,	O
but	O
high	O
and	O
rocky	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
harbour	O
there	O
are	O
two	O
small	O
high	O
islands	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
barren	O
rocks	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
in	O
their	O
pilot-books	O
commend	O
this	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
harbour	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
lies	O
all	O
open	O
to	O
the	O
south-west	O
winds	O
,	O
which	O
frequently	O
blow	O
here	O
in	O
the	O
wet	O
season	O
:	O
beside	O
,	O
the	O
harbour	O
within	O
the	O
islands	O
is	O
a	O
place	O
of	O
but	O
small	O
extent	O
,	O
and	O
has	O
a	O
very	O
narrow	O
going	O
in	O
;	O
what	O
depth	O
of	O
water	O
there	O
is	O
in	O
the	O
harbour	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
.	O

The	O
25th	O
day	O
we	O
arrived	O
at	O
this	O
Harbour	O
of	O
Pines	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
go	O
in	O
with	O
our	O
ship	O
,	O
finding	O
it	O
but	O
an	O
ordinary	O
place	O
to	O
lie	O
at	O
.	O

We	O
sent	O
in	O
our	O
boats	O
to	O
search	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
found	O
a	O
stream	O
of	O
good	O
water	O
running	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
but	O
there	O
were	O
such	O
great	O
swelling	O
surges	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
harbour	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
conveniently	O
fill	O
our	O
water	O
there	O
.	O

The	O
26th	O
day	O
we	O
returned	O
to	O
Point	PNM
Garachina	PNM
again	O
.	O

In	O
our	O
way	O
we	O
took	O
a	O
small	O
vessel	O
laden	O
with	O
Cacoa	O
:	O
she	O
came	O
from	O
Guiaquil	PNM
.	O

The	O
29th	O
day	O
we	O
arrived	O
at	O
Point	PNM
Garachina	PNM
:	O
there	O
we	O
found	O
Captain	O
Harris	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
of	O
Santa	PNM
Maria	PNM
;	O
but	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
meet	O
the	O
men	O
that	O
he	O
went	O
for	O
:	O
yet	O
he	O
was	O
informed	O
again	O
by	O
the	O
Indians	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
making	O
Canoas	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
branches	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
of	O
Santa	PNM
Maria	PNM
.	O

Here	O
we	O
shared	O
our	O
Cacoa	PNM
lately	O
taken	O
.	O

Because	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
fill	O
our	O
water	O
here	O
we	O
designed	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Tabago	PNM
again	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
sure	O
to	O
be	O
supplied	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
on	O
the	O
30th	O
day	O
we	O
set	O
sail	O
,	O
being	O
now	O
nine	O
ships	O
in	O
company	O
;	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
small	O
wind	O
at	O
south-south-east	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
day	O
of	O
April	O
,	O
being	O
in	O
the	O
channel	O
between	O
the	O
King	PNM
's	PNM
Islands	PNM
and	O
the	O
Main	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
much	O
Thunder	O
,	O
lightning	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
rain	O
:	O
this	O
evening	O
we	O
anchored	O
at	O
the	O
island	O
Pacheca	PNM
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
sent	O
four	O
Canoas	O
before	O
us	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
Tabago	PNM
to	O
take	O
some	O
prisoners	O
for	O
information	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
followed	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
.	O

The	O
3rd	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
we	O
anchored	O
by	O
Perica	PNM
,	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
went	O
to	O
Tabago	PNM
where	O
we	O
found	O
our	O
four	O
Canoas	O
.	O

They	O
arrived	O
there	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
a	O
canoa	O
that	O
came	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
is	O
usual	O
-RRB-	O
from	O
Panama	PNM
for	O
plantains	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
canoa	O
four	O
Indians	O
and	O
a	O
Mulatto	O
.	O

The	O
Mulatto	O
,	O
because	O
he	O
said	O
he	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
fire-ship	O
that	O
came	O
to	O
burn	O
us	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
was	O
immediately	O
hanged	O
.	O

These	O
prisoners	O
confirmed	O
that	O
one	O
Captain	O
Bond	O
,	O
an	O
Englishman	O
,	O
did	O
command	O
her	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
filled	O
our	O
water	O
and	O
cut	O
firewood	O
;	O
and	O
from	O
hence	O
we	O
sent	O
four	O
Canoas	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
Main	O
with	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
lately	O
taken	O
to	O
guide	O
them	O
to	O
a	O
sugar-work	O
:	O
for	O
now	O
we	O
had	O
Cacoa	PNM
we	O
wanted	O
sugar	O
to	O
make	O
chocolate	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
chiefest	O
of	O
their	O
business	O
was	O
to	O
get	O
coppers	O
,	O
for	O
,	O
each	O
ship	O
having	O
now	O
so	O
many	O
men	O
,	O
our	O
pots	O
would	O
not	O
boil	O
victuals	O
fast	O
enough	O
though	O
we	O
kept	O
them	O
boiling	O
all	O
the	O
day	O
.	O

About	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
after	O
they	O
returned	O
aboard	O
with	O
three	O
coppers	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
lay	O
here	O
Captain	O
Davis	O
's	O
bark	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
Otoque	PNM

This	O
is	O
another	O
inhabited	O
island	O
in	O
the	O

of	PNM
Panama	PNM
;	O
not	O
so	O

there	O
are	O
good	O
plantain-walks	O
on	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
some	O

who	O
live	O
at	O
Panama	PNM
;	O
as	O
at	O
the	O
King	PNM

It	O
was	O
for	O
some	O
fowls	O
or	O
hogs	O
that	O
our	O
men	O
went	O
thither	O
;	O
but	O
by	O
accident	O
they	O
met	O
also	O
with	O
an	O
express	O
that	O
was	O
sent	O
to	O
Panama	PNM
with	O
an	O
account	O
that	O
the	O
Lima	O
fleet	O
was	O
at	O

Most	O
of	O
the	O
letters	O
were	O
thrown	O
overboard	O
and	O
lost	O
;	O
yet	O
we	O
found	O
some	O
that	O
said	O
positively	O
that	O
the	O

was	O
coming	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
strength	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
make	O
in	O
the	O

were	O

they	O
were	O

to	O
it	O
:	O
-LRB-	O
though	O
afterwards	O
they	O

having	O
first	O
landed	O
their	O

at	O

that	O
the	O

For	O
the	O
satisfaction	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
may	O
be	O

to	O

I	O
have	O

to	O

and	O
that	O
they	O
might	O

The	O
22nd	O

we	O
arrived	O
at	O
the	O
island	O
Chepelio	PNM

Chepelio	O
is	O
the	O
pleasantest	O
island	O

This	O

The	O
soil	O

The	O

is	O
planted	O
with	O
plantain-trees	O

which	O
are	O
not	O

the	O
fruit	O
extraordinary	O

The	O
sapadillo-tree	O
is	O
as	O

as	O
a	O

and	O
it	O
will	O
stick	O

then	O
the	O

but	O
after	O
it	O
has	O

two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
,	O
it	O
grows	O
soft	O
and	O
juicy	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
juice	O
is	O
clear	O
as	O
spring-water	O
and	O
very	O
sweet	O
;	O
in	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

about	O
the	O
bigness	O
of	O
a	O
pumpkin-seed	O
:	O
this	O
is	O
an	O
excellent	O
fruit	O

The	O
avocado-pear-tree	O
is	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
most	O
pear-trees	O
,	O
and	O
is	O
commonly	O
pretty	O
high	O
;	O
the	O
skin	O

pretty	O
smooth	O
;	O
the	O

and	O
the	O
fruit	O
as	O

It	O
is	O
of	O
a	O

till	O
it	O
is	O
ripe	O

and	O
then	O
it	O
is	O
a	O

They	O
are	O
seldom	O

to	O

till	O
they	O
have	O
been	O
gathered	O
two	O

three	O

;	O
then	O
they	O
become	O
soft	O
and	O
the	O
skin	O
or	O
rind	O
will	O
peel	O
off	O

The	O
substance	O
in	O
the	O

is	O
green	O

or	O
a	O
little	O

the	O
substance	O
there	O
is	O
a	O

This	O
fruit	O
has	O
no	O
taste	O
of	O
itself	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
it	O
is	O
usually	O
mixed	O
with	O
sugar	O

lime-juice	O

beaten	O
together	O
in	O
a	O
plate	O

and	O
this	O
is	O
an	O

The	O
ordinary	O

is	O
to	O
eat	O
it	O
with	O
a	O
little	O
salt	O
and	O
a	O
roasted	O
plantain	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
a	O
man	O
that	O
's	O
hungry	O
may	O
make	O
a	O
good	O
meal	O
of	O
it	O

It	O
is	O
very	O
wholesome	O
eaten	O
any	O
way	O

It	O
is	O
reported	O
that	O
this	O
fruit	O
provokes	O
to	O

and	O
therefore	O
is	O
said	O
to	O
be	O
much	O

by	O
the	O

and	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
they	O
are	O
much	O

by	O
them	O

for	O
I	O
have	O
met	O
with	O
plenty	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
many	O
places	O
in	O
the	O
North	O

where	O
the	O

which	O
were	O

the	O

The	O

the	O

described	O
at	O
the	O
island	O
Tabago	PNM

It	O
is	O
not	O

neither	O
is	O
the	O
fruit	O
so	O

The	O
rind	O
of	O
the	O

the	O

a	O
deep	O

and	O
it	O
has	O
a	O
rough	O

This	O
is	O
accounted	O
the	O
principal	O
fruit	O
of	O
the	O
West	PNM
Indies	PNM

It	O
is	O
very	O
pleasant	O
and	O

I	O
have	O
not	O

any	O
of	O
these	O
on	O

in	O
many	O
places	O
in	O
the	O
West	O

among	O
the	O

There	O
is	O
another	O
sort	O
of	O
mammee-tree	O
which	O
is	O
called	O
the	O
wild	O
mammee	O
:	O
this	O
bears	O
a	O
fruit	O
which	O
is	O
of	O
no	O
value	O

the	O
tree	O
is	O
straight	O

tall	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
tough	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
principally	O
used	O
for	O

The	O
star-apple-tree	O
grows	O
much	O
like	O
the	O
quince-tree	O

It	O
is	O
full	O

of	O
an	O
oval	O

and	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
dark	O
green	O
colour	O

The	O
fruit	O
is	O
as	O
big	O

which	O
is	O
commonly	O
so	O

this	O

I	O

The	O

The	O

We	O
arrived	O
at	O
Tabago	PNM
the	O
28th	O
day	O
:	O
there	O
our	O
prisoners	O
were	O
examined	O
concerning	O
the	O
strength	O
of	O
Panama	PNM
;	O
for	O
now	O
we	O
thought	O
ourselves	O
strong	O
enough	O
for	O
such	O
an	O
enterprise	O
,	O
being	O
near	O
1000	O
men	O

Out	O
of	O
these	O
,	O
on	O
occasion	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
have	O
landed	O
900	O

but	O
our	O
prisoners	O
gave	O
us	O
small	O
encouragement	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
assured	O
us	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
strength	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
was	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
many	O
men	O
were	O
come	O
from	O
Portobello	PNM

besides	O
its	O
own	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
who	O
of	O
themselves	O
were	O
more	O
in	O
number	O
than	O
we	O
.	O

These	O
reasons	O
,	O
together	O
with	O
the	O
strength	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
-LRB-	O
which	O
has	O
a	O
high	O

deterred	O
us	O
from	O

it	O

While	O
we	O
lay	O
there	O
at	O
Tabago	PNM
some	O

burnt	O
the	O

The	O
4th	O

we	O
sailed	O
hence	O
again	O
bound	O
for	O
the	O
King	PNM

there	O
we	O

on	O

Captain	O

From	O

The	O

they	O
took	O
there	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
seamen	O
belonging	O
to	O
Panama	PNM
,	O
who	O
said	O
that	O
provision	O
was	O
so	O
scarce	O

dear	O
there	O
that	O
the	O

were	O
almost	O

which	O

that	O
the	O

that	O

them	O

They	O
farther	O
reported	O
that	O
the	O

from	O
Lima	PNM
was	O
expected	O
every	O

;	O
for	O
it	O
was	O

that	O
they	O

and	O
that	O
the	O

The	O

It	O
is	O

The	O

It	O

we	O

When	O
it	O

the	O

a	O

the	O

again	O

,	O
being	O
to	O

we	O
kept	O
under	O

had	O

but	O
as	O
it	O
proved	O
this	O
was	O
only	O
a	O
stratagem	O
of	O
theirs	O

for	O
this	O

at	O
one	O

we	O

the	O

was	O
in	O

In	O
the	O
morning	O
therefore	O

contrary	O

we	O

were	O
coming	O

having	O
taken	O
a	O
turn	O
almost	O
round	O

we	O

owed	O
that	O
too	O

in	O

The	O
30th	O

in	O

again	O
the	O
24th	O

got	O
no	O

They	O
took	O

The	O

of	O
July	O
Captain	O
Knight	O
,	O
mentioned	O
in	O
my	O
last	O
chapter	O
,	O
came	O
to	O
us	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
been	O
cruising	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
but	O
got	O
nothing	O
beside	O
a	O
good	O
ship	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
he	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
,	O
as	O
high	O
as	O
the	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM
Guiaquil	PNM
,	O
where	O
he	O
took	O
a	O
bark-log	O
,	O
or	O
pair	O
of	O
bark-logs	O
as	O
we	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
laden	O
chiefly	O
with	O
flour	O

She	O
had	O
other	O
goods	O
,	O
as	O
wine	O
,	O
oil	O

brandy	O
,	O
sugar	O
,	O
soap	O
,	O
and	O
leather	O
of	O
goats	O
'	O
skins	O
:	O
and	O
he	O
took	O
out	O
as	O
much	O
of	O
each	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
occasion	O
for	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
turned	O
her	O
away	O
again	O
.	O

The	O
master	O
of	O
the	O
float	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
the	O
king	O
's	O
ships	O
were	O
gone	O
from	O
Lima	PNM
towards	O
Panama	PNM
:	O
that	O
they	O
carried	O
but	O
half	O
the	O
king	O
's	O
treasure	O
with	O
them	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
although	O
they	O
had	O
all	O
the	O
strength	O
that	O
the	O
kingdom	O
could	O
afford	O
:	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
merchant-ships	O
which	O
should	O
have	O
gone	O
with	O
them	O
were	O
laden	O
and	O
lying	O
at	O
Payta	PNM
,	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
further	O
orders	O
.	O

Captain	O
Knight	O
,	O
having	O
but	O
few	O
men	O
,	O
did	O
not	O
dare	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Payta	PNM
,	O
where	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
better	O
provided	O
,	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
taken	O
them	O
all	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
made	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
his	O
way	O
into	O
the	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM
Panama	PNM
,	O
in	O
hopes	O
to	O
find	O
us	O
there	O
enriched	O
with	O
the	O
spoils	O
of	O
the	O
Lima	O
fleet	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
coming	O
to	O
the	O
King	PNM
's	PNM
Islands	PNM
,	O
he	O
had	O
advice	O
by	O
a	O
prisoner	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
engaged	O
with	O
their	O
fleet	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
worsted	O
,	O
and	O
since	O
that	O
made	O
our	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
he	O
came	O
hither	O
to	O
seek	O
us	O
.	O

He	O
presently	O
consorted	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
his	O
men	O
to	O
work	O
to	O
make	O
Canoas	O
.	O

Every	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O
made	O
for	O
themselves	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
all	O
helped	O
each	O
other	O
to	O
launch	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
some	O
were	O
made	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
sea	O
.	O

The	O
manner	O
of	O
making	O
a	O
canoa	O
is	O
,	O
after	O
cutting	O
down	O
a	O
large	O
long	O
tree	O
,	O
and	O
squaring	O
the	O
uppermost	O
side	O

then	O
turning	O
it	O
upon	O
the	O
flat	O
side	O
,	O
to	O
shape	O
the	O
opposite	O
side	O
for	O
the	O
bottom	O
.	O

Then	O
again	O
they	O
turn	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
dig	O
the	O
inside	O
;	O
boring	O
also	O
three	O
holes	O
in	O
the	O
bottom	O
,	O
one	O
before	O
,	O
one	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
abaft	O
,	O
thereby	O
to	O
gauge	O
the	O
thickness	O
of	O
the	O
bottom	O
;	O
for	O
otherwise	O
we	O
might	O
cut	O
the	O
bottom	O
thinner	O
than	O
is	O
convenient	O
.	O

We	O
left	O
the	O
bottoms	O
commonly	O
about	O
three	O
inches	O
thick	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sides	O
two	O

the	O
ends	O

Captain	O

made	O
two	O
very	O
large	O
Canoas	O

Here	O
Captain	O

went	O
to	O
lay	O
his	O

but	O
she	O
being	O

Captain	O

The	O
20th	O
day	O
of	O
July	O
we	O
sailed	O
from	O
Quibo	PNM

and	O
three	O

,	O
which	O

had	O
not	O

We	O
passed	O
out	O
between	O
the	O
river	O
Quibo	PNM

the	O
Rancheria	PNM

leaving	O

the	O

on	O

The	O
wind	O
at	O
first	O
was	O
at	O
south-south-west	O
:	O
we	O
coasted	O
along	O
shore	O

passing	O
by	O
the	O
Gulf	PNM
of	PNM
Nicoya	PNM
,	O
the	O
Gulf	PNM

All	O
this	O

and	O
there	O
are	O
but	O
few	O
inhabitants	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
sailed	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
we	O
had	O
variable	O
winds	O
,	O
sometimes	O
south-west	O
and	O
at	O
west-south-west	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
at	O
east-north-east	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
had	O
them	O
most	O
commonly	O
at	O
south-west	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
tornado	O
or	O
two	O
every	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
or	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
we	O
had	O
land-winds	O
at	O
north-north-east	O

The	O
8th	O
day	O
of	O
August	O
,	O
being	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
11	O
degrees	O
20	O
minutes	O
by	O
observation	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
high	O
hill	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
towering	O
up	O
like	O
a	O
sugar-loaf	O
,	O
which	O
bore	O
north-east	O
by	O
north	O
.	O

We	O
supposed	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
Volcan	O
Vejo	O
by	O
the	O
smoke	O
which	O
ascended	O
from	O
its	O
top	O
;	O
therefore	O
we	O
steered	O
in	O
north	O
and	O
made	O
it	O
plainer	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
knew	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
that	O
volcano	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
sea-mark	O
for	O
the	O

for	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
before	O
in	O
Chapter	O
5	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
remarkable	O
mountain	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
brought	O
this	O
mountain	O
to	O
bear	O
north-east	O
we	O
got	O
out	O
all	O
our	O
Canoas	O
and	O
provided	O
to	O
embark	O
into	O
them	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
.	O

The	O
9th	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
being	O
about	O
eight	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
we	O
left	O
our	O
ships	O
under	O
the	O
charge	O
of	O
a	O
few	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
520	O
of	O
us	O
went	O
away	O
in	O
31	O
Canoas	O
,	O
rowing	O
towards	O
the	O
harbour	O
of	O
Ria	PNM
Lexa	PNM
.	O

We	O
had	O
fair	O
weather	O
and	O
little	O
wind	O
till	O
two	O
a	O
clock	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
then	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
tornado	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
with	O
much	O
thunder	O
,	O
lightning	O
and	O
rain	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
a	O
gust	O
of	O
wind	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
like	O
to	O
be	O
foundered	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
extremity	O
we	O
put	O
right	O
afore	O
the	O
wind	O
,	O
every	O
canoa	O
's	O
crew	O
making	O
what	O
shift	O
they	O
could	O
to	O
avoid	O
the	O
threatening	O
danger	O
.	O

The	O
small	O
Canoas	O
,	O
being	O
most	O
light	O
and	O
buoyant	O
,	O
mounted	O
nimbly	O
over	O
the	O
surges	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
great	O
heavy	O
Canoas	O
lay	O
like	O
logs	O
in	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
ready	O
to	O
be	O
swallowed	O
by	O
every	O
foaming	O
billow	O
.	O

Some	O
of	O
our	O
Canoas	O
were	O
half	O
full	O
of	O
water	O
yet	O
kept	O
two	O
men	O
constantly	O
heaving	O
it	O
out	O
.	O

The	O
fierceness	O
of	O
the	O
wind	O
continued	O
about	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
and	O
abated	O
by	O
degrees	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
the	O
wind	O
died	O
away	O
so	O
the	O
fury	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
abated	O
:	O
for	O
in	O
all	O
hot	O
countries	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
observed	O
,	O
the	O
sea	O
is	O
soon	O
raised	O
by	O
the	O
wind	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
soon	O
down	O
again	O
when	O
the	O
wind	O
is	O
gone	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
proverb	O
among	O
the	O
seamen	O
:	O
Up	O
wind	O
,	O
up	O
sea	O
,	O
down	O

,	O
down	O

At	O
seven	O
a	O
clock	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
it	O
was	O
quite	O
calm	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sea	O
as	O
smooth	O
as	O
a	O
mill-pond	O
.	O

Then	O
we	O
tugged	O
to	O
get	O
in	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
finding	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
do	O
it	O
before	O
day	O
,	O
we	O
rowed	O
off	O
again	O
to	O
keep	O
ourselves	O
out	O
of	O
sight	O
.	O

By	O
that	O
time	O
it	O
was	O
day	O
we	O
were	O
five	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
thought	O
was	O
far	O
enough	O
off	O
shore	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
intended	O
to	O
lie	O
till	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
but	O
at	O
three	O
a	O
clock	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
we	O
had	O
another	O
tornado	O
,	O
more	O
fierce	O
than	O
that	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
.	O

This	O
put	O
us	O
in	O
greater	O
peril	O
of	O
our	O
lives	O
,	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
last	O
so	O
long	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
violence	O
of	O
the	O
tornado	O
was	O
over	O
we	O
rowed	O
in	O
for	O
the	O
shore	O
and	O
entered	O
the	O
harbour	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
:	O
the	O
creek	O
which	O
leads	O
towards	O
Leon	O
lies	O
on	O
the	O
south-east	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
harbour	O
.	O

Our	O
pilot	O
,	O
being	O
very	O
well	O
acquainted	O
here	O
,	O
carried	O
us	O
into	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
carry	O
us	O
no	O
farther	O
till	O
day	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
but	O
a	O
small	O
creek	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
are	O
other	O
creeks	O
like	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
light	O
we	O
rowed	O
into	O
the	O
creek	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
very	O
narrow	O
;	O
the	O
land	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
lying	O
so	O
low	O
that	O
every	O
tide	O
it	O
is	O
overflown	O
with	O
the	O
sea	O
.	O

This	O
sort	O
of	O
land	O
produces	O
red	O
mangrove-trees	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
here	O
so	O
plentiful	O
and	O
thick	O
that	O
there	O
is	O

firm	O

close	O
by	O
the	O

a	O
breast-work	O

purposely	O
to	O
hinder	O

enemy	O
from	O
the	O
landing	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
in	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
breast-work	O
we	O
rowed	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
to	O
get	O
ashore	O
:	O
the	O
noise	O

the	O
city	O

give	O
notice	O
of	O
our	O

We	O
landed	O
as	O

as	O
we	O
could	O
and	O
marched	O
after	O
them	O
:	O
470	O

were	O
drawn	O
out	O
to	O

I	O
was	O

The	O
city	O
of	O
Leon	PNM
is	O
20	O
mile	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
country	O

to	O
it	O

country	O
of	O
long	O
grassy	O

of	O

About	O
five	O

there	O
is	O

which	O
there	O

the	O

till	O
you	O
come	O
to	O
an	O

town	O
which	O
is	O
two	O
miles	O
before	O
you	O

to	O
the	O
city	O

and	O
from	O
thence	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
pleasant	O
straight	O
sandy	O
way	O
to	O
Leon	PNM
.	O

This	O
city	O
stands	O
in	O
a	O
plain	O
not	O
far	O
from	O
a	O
high	O
peaked	O
mountain	O
which	O
oftentimes	O
casts	O
forth	O
fire	O
and	O
smoke	O
from	O
its	O
top	O
.	O

It	O
may	O
be	O
seen	O
at	O
sea	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
called	O
the	O
volcano	O
of	O
Leon	PNM

The	O
houses	O
of	O
Leon	PNM
are	O
not	O
high	O
built	O
but	O
strong	O
and	O
large	O
,	O
with	O
gardens	O
about	O
them	O

The	O
walls	O
are	O

there	O
are	O
three	O

Our	O
countryman	O
Mr.	O
Gage	O
,	O
who	O
travelled	O
in	O
these	O

recommends	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
world	O
as	O
the	O
pleasantest	O
place	O
in	O
all	O
America	O
,	O
and	O
calls	O
it	O
the	O
Paradise	O
of	O
the	O
Indies	O
.	O

Indeed	O
if	O
we	O
consider	O
the	O
advantage	O
of	O
its	O
situation	O
we	O
may	O
find	O
it	O
surpassing	O
most	O
places	O
for	O
health	O
and	O
pleasure	O
in	O
America	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
country	O
about	O
it	O

of	O
a	O
sandy	O
soil	O
which	O
soon	O
drinks	O
up	O

the	O

that	O

to	O
which	O
these	O
parts	O
are	O
much	O
subject	O

It	O
is	O
encompassed	O
with	O
savannahs	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
the	O
benefit	O
of	O
the	O
breezes	O
coming	O
from	O
any	O
quarter	O
;	O
all	O
which	O
makes	O
it	O
a	O
very	O
healthy	O
place	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
place	O
of	O
no	O
great	O
trade	O
and	O
therefore	O
not	O
rich	O
in	O
money	O

Their	O
wealth	O
lies	O
in	O
their	O
pastures	O
,	O
and	O
cattle	O
,	O
and	O
plantations	O
of	O

It	O
is	O
said	O
that	O
they	O

came	O
in	O
about	O
six	O

he	O
left	O
many	O

on	O
the	O
road	O
;	O
these	O

as	O
is	O

a	O

as	O
they	O
were	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
killed	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
tired	O
men	O
;	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
stout	O
old	O
grey-headed	O
man	O
,	O
aged	O
about	O
84	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
served	O
under	O
Oliver	O
in	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
the	O
Irish	O
rebellion	O
;	O
after	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
at	O
Jamaica	PNM
,	O
and	O
had	O
followed	O
privateering	O
ever	O
since	O

He	O
would	O
not	O
accept	O
of	O
the	O
offer	O
our	O
men	O
made	O
him	O
to	O
tarry	O
ashore	O
but	O
said	O
he	O
would	O
venture	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
them	O
:	O
and	O
when	O
surrounded	O
by	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
he	O
refused	O
to	O
take	O
quarter	O
,	O
but	O
discharged	O
his	O
gun	O
amongst	O
them	O
,	O
keeping	O
a	O
pistol	O
still	O
charged	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
shot	O
him	O
dead	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O

His	O
name	O
was	O
Swan	O
;	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
merry	O
hearty	O
old	O
man	O
and	O
always	O
used	O
to	O
declare	O
he	O
would	O
never	O
take	O
quarter	O
:	O
but	O
they	O
took	O
Mr.	O
Smith	O
who	O
was	O
tired	O
also	O
;	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
merchant	O
belonging	O
to	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
and	O
,	O
being	O
carried	O
before	O
the	O
governor	O
of	O
Leon	PNM
,	O
was	O
known	O
by	O
a	O
Mulatta	O
woman	O
that	O
waited	O
on	O
him	O
.	O

Mr.	O
Smith	O
had	O
lived	O
many	O
years	O
in	O
the	O
Canaries	O
and	O
could	O
speak	O
and	O
write	O
very	O
good	O
Spanish	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
there	O
this	O
Mulatta	O
woman	O
remembered	O
him	O
.	O

He	O
being	O
examined	O
how	O
many	O
men	O
we	O
were	O
said	O
1000	O
at	O
the	O
city	O
,	O
and	O
500	O
at	O
the	O
Canoas	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
well	O
for	O
us	O
at	O
the	O
Canoas	O
,	O
who	O
straggling	O
about	O
every	O
day	O
might	O
easily	O
have	O
been	O
destroyed	O
.	O

But	O
this	O
so	O
daunted	O
the	O
governor	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
never	O
offer	O
to	O
molest	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
although	O
he	O
had	O
with	O
him	O
above	O
1000	O
men	O
,	O
as	O
Mr.	O
Smith	O
guessed	O
.	O

He	O
sent	O
in	O
a	O
flag	O
of	O
truce	O
about	O
noon	O
,	O
pretending	O
to	O
ransom	O
the	O
town	O
rather	O
than	O
let	O
it	O
be	O
burnt	O
,	O
but	O
our	O
captains	O
demanded	O
300,000	O
pieces-of-eight	O
for	O
its	O
ransom	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
much	O
provision	O
as	O
would	O
victual	O
1000	O
men	O
four	O
months	O
,	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Smith	O
to	O
be	O
ransomed	O
for	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
prisoners	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
did	O
not	O
intend	O
to	O
ransom	O
the	O
town	O
,	O
but	O
only	O
capitulated	O
day	O
after	O
day	O
to	O
prolong	O
time	O
,	O
till	O
they	O
had	O
got	O
more	O
men	O
.	O

Our	O
captains	O
therefore	O
,	O
considering	O
the	O
distance	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
from	O
the	O
Canoas	O
,	O
resolved	O
to	O
be	O
marching	O
down	O
.	O

The	O
14th	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
they	O
ordered	O
the	O
city	O
to	O
be	O
set	O
on	O
fire	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
presently	O
done	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
they	O
came	O
away	O
:	O
but	O
they	O
took	O
more	O
time	O
in	O
coming	O
down	O
than	O
in	O
going	O
up	O
.	O

The	O
15th	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
sent	O
in	O
Mr.	O
Smith	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
gentlewoman	O
in	O
exchange	O
.	O

Then	O
our	O
captains	O
sent	O
a	O
letter	O
to	O
the	O
governor	O
to	O
acquaint	O
him	O
that	O
they	O
intended	O
next	O
to	O
visit	O
Ria	PNM
Lexa	PNM
,	O
and	O
desired	O
to	O
meet	O
him	O
there	O
:	O
they	O
also	O
released	O
a	O
gentleman	O
on	O
his	O
promise	O
of	O
paying	O
150	O
beefs	O
for	O
his	O
ransom	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
deliver	O
them	O
to	O
us	O
at	O
Ria	PNM

;	O
and	O
the	O
same	O
day	O
our	O
men	O
came	O
to	O
their	O
Canoas	O
:	O
where	O
,	O
having	O
stayed	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
we	O
all	O
entered	O
our	O
Canoas	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
harbour	O
of	O
Ria	PNM
Lexa	PNM
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
our	O
ships	O
came	O
thither	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
.	O

The	O
creek	O
that	O
leads	O
to	O
Ria	PNM

lies	O
from	O
the	O
north-west	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
harbour	O
and	O
it	O
runs	O
in	O
northerly	O

It	O
is	O
about	O
two	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
island	O
in	O
the	O
harbour	O
's	O
mouth	O
to	O
the	O
town	O
;	O
two	O
thirds	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
it	O
is	O
broad	O
,	O
then	O
you	O
enter	O
a	O
narrow	O
deep	O
creek	O
,	O
bordered	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
with	O
red	O
mangrove	O
trees	O
whose	O
limbs	O
reach	O
almost	O
from	O
one	O
side	O
to	O
the	O
other	O

A	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
creek	O
it	O
turns	O
away	O
west	O
.	O

There	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
have	O
made	O
a	O
very	O
strong	O
breast-work	O
fronting	O
towards	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
creek	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
were	O
placed	O
100	O
soldiers	O
to	O
hinder	O
us	O
from	O
landing	O
:	O
and	O
20	O
yards	O
below	O
that	O
breast-work	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
chain	O
of	O
great	O
trees	O
placed	O
cross	O
the	O
creek	O
so	O
that	O
10	O
men	O
could	O
have	O
kept	O
off	O
500	O
or	O
1000	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
in	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
breast-work	O
we	O
fired	O
but	O
two	O
guns	O
and	O
they	O
all	O
ran	O
away	O
:	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
afterwards	O
near	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
cutting	O
the	O
boom	O
or	O
chain	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
landed	O
and	O
marched	O
to	O
the	O
town	O
of	O
Ria	PNM
Lexa	PNM
,	O
or	O
Rea	O
Lejo	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O

This	O
town	O
stands	O
on	O
a	O
plain	O
by	O
a	O
small	O
river	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
pretty	O
large	O
town	O
with	O
three	O
churches	O
and	O
a	O
hospital	O
that	O
has	O
a	O
fine	O
garden	O
belonging	O
to	O
it	O
:	O
besides	O
many	O
large	O
fair	O
houses	O

they	O
all	O
stand	O
at	O
a	O
good	O
distance	O
one	O
from	O
another	O
,	O
with	O
yards	O
about	O
them	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
sickly	O
place	O
and	O
I	O
believe	O
has	O
need	O
enough	O
of	O
a	O
hospital	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
is	O
seated	O
so	O
nigh	O
the	O
creeks	O
and	O
swamps	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
never	O
free	O
from	O
a	O
noisome	O
smell	O

The	O
land	O
about	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
strong	O
yellow	O
clay	O

yet	O
where	O
the	O
town	O
stands	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O

I	O

It	O
was	O
not	O

The	O
27th	O

in	O

was	O
the	O
badness	O
of	O

the	O

of	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

it	O
was	O
a	O
distemper	O

at	O

this	O

over	O

their	O

communicate	O
the	O

I	O
the	O
rather	O
believe	O
this	O
because	O
it	O

The	O

in	O
a	O
fruit	O

the	O

comes	O
the	O

These	O
trees	O
grow	O
wild	O
;	O

eight	O

The	O
silvester	O
gives	O
a	O
colour	O
almost	O

the	O

it	O
is	O

I	O
often	O
made	O

how	O
the	O
silvester	O
grows	O

of	O
the	O

was	O
never	O
fully	O
satisfied	O

I	O
met	O

He	O
was	O

the	O

Guatimala	PNM
we	O
were	O
by	O
judgment	O
25	O

As	O
we	O
came	O
nearer	O
the	O

it	O
appeared	O

we	O

no	O

a	O

The	O

The	O

for	O
about	O
eight	O

Then	O
Captain	O

took	O
with	O
him	O
106	O

our	O

The	O
26th	O

we	O

again	O

coasting	O
to	O
the	O

,	O
having	O
the	O

We	O
ran	O
along	O

a	O
tract	O
of	O
very	O
high	O
land	O
which	O
came	O
from	O
the	O
eastward	O
,	O
more	O

than	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
;	O
after	O
we	O
fell	O
in	O
with	O
it	O
it	O
bore	O
us	O
company	O
for	O
about	O
10	O
leagues	O
,	O
and	O
ended	O
with	O
a	O
pretty	O
gentle	O
descent	O
towards	O
the	O
west	O

There	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
perfect	O
view	O

country	O
which	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
rich	O

plentifully	O

mixed	O
among	O
the	O

here	O
the	O

making	O
the	O
land	O
wholly	O

so	O
we	O

,	O
eight	O

The	O
2nd	O

Captain	O

he	O

seeking	O
for	O
an	O

had	O
one	O

their	O

and	O
some	O
of	O

up	O
their	O

all	O
their	O

Captain	O
Townley	O
with	O
much	O
ado	O
got	O
ashore	O
and	O
dragged	O
the	O
Canoas	O
up	O
dry	O
on	O
the	O
bay	O
;	O
then	O
every	O
man	O
searched	O
his	O
cartouche	O
box	O
and	O
drew	O
the	O
wet	O
powder	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
gun	O
,	O
and	O
provided	O
to	O
march	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
but	O
,	O
finding	O
it	O
full	O
of	O
great	O
creeks	O
which	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
ford	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
return	O
again	O
to	O
their	O
Canoas	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
night	O
they	O
made	O
good	O
fires	O
to	O
keep	O
themselves	O
warm	O
;	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
200	O
Spaniards	O
and	O
Indians	O
fell	O
on	O
them	O
but	O
were	O
immediately	O
repulsed	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
greater	O
speed	O
back	O
than	O
they	O
had	O
done	O
forward	O
.	O

Captain	O
Townley	O
followed	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
far	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
his	O
Canoas	O
.	O

These	O
men	O
came	O
from	O
Tehuantapec	PNM
,	O
a	O
town	O
that	O
Captain	O
Townley	O
went	O
chiefly	O
to	O
seek	O
because	O
the	O
Spanish	O
books	O
make	O
mention	O
of	O
a	O
large	O
river	O
there	O
;	O
but	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
run	O
away	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
Captain	O
Townley	O
and	O
his	O
men	O
were	O
short-sighted	O
,	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
find	O
it	O
.	O

Upon	O
his	O
return	O
we	O
presently	O
made	O
sail	O
,	O
coasting	O
still	O
westward	O
,	O
having	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
east-north-east	O
fair	O
weather	O
and	O
a	O
fresh	O
gale	O

We	O
kept	O
within	O
two	O
mile	O
of	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
sounding	O
all	O
the	O

We	O
saw	O
no	O
opening	O
nor	O
sign	O
of	O
any	O
place	O
to	O
land	O
at	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
sailed	O
about	O
20	O
leagues	O
farther	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
small	O
high	O
island	O
called	O
Tangola	PNM
,	O
where	O
there	O
is	O
good	O

two	O

We	O
coasted	O
a	O
league	O
farther	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
Guatulco	PNM

This	O
port	O
is	O
in	O

on	O
the	O

which	O
by	O
the	O
continual	O
working	O
of	O

makes	O
a	O
great	O

which	O
may	O
be	O

a	O

Every	O

forces	O
the	O
water	O
out	O
of	O
a	O
little	O

as	O
out	O

from	O
whence	O
it	O
flies	O
out	O
just	O

to	O

Captain	O

He	O
marched	O
away	O

There	O
two	O
of	O
his	O

swam	O
over	O
the	O

took	O
three	O

yet	O
our	O

by	O

vinello	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
cod	O
full	O
of	O
small	O
black	O
seeds	O
;	O
it	O
is	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
inches	O
long	O
,	O
about	O
the	O
bigness	O
of	O
the	O
stem	O
of	O
a	O
tobacco	O
leaf	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
dried	O
much	O
resembling	O
it	O
:	O
so	O
that	O
our	O
privateers	O
at	O
first	O
have	O
often	O
thrown	O
them	O
away	O
when	O
they	O
took	O
any	O
,	O
wondering	O
why	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
should	O
lay	O
up	O
tobacco	O
stems	O
.	O

This	O
cod	O
grows	O
on	O
a	O
small	O
vine	O
which	O
climbs	O
about	O
and	O
supports	O
itself	O
by	O
the	O
neighbouring	O
trees	O
:	O
it	O
first	O
bears	O
a	O
yellow	O
flower	O
from	O
whence	O
the	O
cod	O
afterwards	O
proceeds	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
first	O
green	O
,	O
but	O
when	O
ripe	O
it	O
turns	O
yellow	O
;	O
then	O
the	O
Indians	O
-LRB-	O
whose	O
manufacture	O
it	O
is	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
sell	O
it	O
cheap	O
to	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
-RRB-	O
gather	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
lay	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
which	O
makes	O
it	O
soft	O
;	O
then	O
it	O
changes	O
to	O
a	O
chestnut-colour	O
.	O

Then	O
they	O
frequently	O
press	O
it	O
between	O
their	O
fingers	O
,	O
which	O
makes	O
it	O
flat	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
Indians	O
do	O
anything	O
to	O
them	O
beside	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
have	O
seen	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
sleek	O
them	O
with	O
oil	O
.	O

These	O
vines	O
grow	O
plentifully	O
at	O
Boca	PNM
Toro	PNM
,	O
where	O
I	O
have	O
gathered	O
and	O
tried	O
to	O
cure	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
not	O
:	O
which	O
makes	O
me	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
Indians	O
have	O
some	O
secret	O
that	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
of	O
to	O
cure	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
often	O
asked	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
how	O
they	O
were	O
cured	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
never	O
could	O
meet	O
with	O
any	O
could	O

upon	O
all	O
his	O

any	O

Could	O

The	O

little	O

was	O
the	O
12th	O
of	O
October	O
1685	O
when	O
we	O
set	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
harbour	O
of	O
Guatulco	PNM
with	O
our	O
ships	O
.	O

The	O
land	O
here	O
lies	O
along	O
west	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
southerly	O
for	O
about	O
20	O
or	O
30	O
leagues	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sea-winds	O
are	O

at	O
west-south-west	O
,	O
sometimes	O
at	O
south-west	O
,	O
the	O
land-winds	O
at	O
north	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
now	O
fair	O
weather	O
and	O
but	O
little	O
wind	O
.	O

We	O
coasted	O
along	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
,	O
keeping	O
as	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
for	O
the	O
benefit	O
of	O
the	O
land-winds	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
sea-winds	O
were	O
right	O
against	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
current	O
setting	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
which	O
kept	O
us	O
back	O
and	O
obliged	O
us	O
to	O
anchor	O
at	O
the	O
island	O
Sacrificio	PNM
,	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
small	O
green	O
island	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
long	O
.	O

It	O
lies	O
about	O
a	O
league	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
of	O
Guatulco	PNM
and	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
Main	O
.	O

There	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
fine	O
bay	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
full	O
of	O
rocks	O
.	O

The	O
best	O
riding	O
is	O
between	O
the	O
island	O
and	O
the	O
Main	O
:	O
there	O
you	O
will	O
have	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
fathom	O
water	O
.	O

Here	O
runs	O
a	O
pretty	O
strong	O
tide	O
;	O
the	O
sea	O
rises	O
and	O
falls	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
foot	O
up	O
and	O
down	O
.	O

The	O
18th	O
day	O
we	O
sailed	O
from	O
hence	O
,	O
coasting	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
after	O
our	O
Canoas	O
.	O

We	O
kept	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
all	O
sandy	O
bays	O
,	O
the	O
country	O
pretty	O
high	O
and	O
woody	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
sea	O
tumbling	O
in	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

The	O
22nd	O
day	O
two	O
of	O
our	O
Canoas	O
came	O
aboard	O
and	O
told	O
us	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
not	O
find	O
Port	PNM
Angels	PNM
.	O

They	O
had	O
attempted	O
to	O
land	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
at	O
a	O
place	O
where	O
they	O
saw	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
bulls	O
and	O
cows	O
feeding	O
,	O
in	O
hopes	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
sea	O
ran	O
so	O
high	O
that	O
they	O
overset	O
both	O
Canoas	O
,	O
and	O
wet	O
all	O
their	O
arms	O
,	O
and	O
lost	O
four	O
guns	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
one	O
man	O
drowned	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
much	O
ado	O
got	O
off	O
again	O
.	O

They	O
could	O
give	O
no	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
Canoas	O
for	O
they	O
lost	O
company	O
the	O
first	O
night	O
that	O
they	O
went	O
from	O
Guatulco	PNM
and	O
had	O
not	O
seen	O
them	O
since	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
now	O
abreast	O
of	O
Port	PNM
Angels	PNM
,	O
though	O
our	O
men	O
in	O
the	O
Canoas	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
it	O
;	O
therefore	O
we	O
went	O
in	O
and	O
anchored	O
there	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
broad	O
open	O
bay	O
with	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
rocks	O
at	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
.	O

Here	O
is	O
good	O
anchoring	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
bay	O
in	O
30	O
or	O
20	O
or	O
12	O
fathom	O
water	O
;	O
but	O
you	O
must	O
ride	O
open	O
to	O
all	O
winds	O
except	O
the	O
land-winds	O
till	O
you	O
come	O
into	O
12	O
or	O
13	O
fathom	O
water	O
;	O
then	O
you	O
are	O
sheltered	O
from	O
the	O
west-south-west	O
which	O
are	O
the	O
common	O
trade	O
winds	O
.	O

The	O
tide	O
rises	O
here	O
about	O
five	O
foot	O
;	O
the	O
flood	O
sets	O
to	O
the	O
north-east	O
and	O
the	O
ebb	O
to	O
the	O
south-west	O
.	O

The	O
landing	O
in	O
this	O
bay	O
is	O
bad	O
;	O
the	O
place	O
of	O
landing	O
is	O
close	O
by	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
behind	O
a	O
few	O
rocks	O
;	O
here	O
always	O
goes	O
a	O
great	O
swell	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
compare	O
this	O
harbour	O
for	O
goodness	O
to	O
Guatulco	PNM
,	O
but	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
difference	O
between	O
them	O
.	O

For	O
Guatulco	PNM
is	O
almost	O
landlocked	O
and	O
this	O
an	O
open	O
road	O
,	O
and	O
no	O
one	O
would	O
easily	O
know	O
it	O
by	O
their	O
character	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
by	O
its	O
marks	O
and	O
its	O
latitude	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
15	O
degrees	O
north	O
.	O

For	O
this	O
reason	O
our	O
Canoas	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
sent	O
from	O
Guatulco	PNM
and	O
ordered	O
to	O
tarry	O
here	O
for	O
us	O
,	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
it	O
-LRB-	O
not	O
thinking	O
this	O
to	O
be	O
that	O

two	O

as	O
I	O

again	O

but	O
the	O

were	O
not	O

The	O

the	O

The	O

Two	O

The	O
23rd	O
day	O
we	O
landed	O
about	O
100	O
men	O
and	O
marched	O
thither	O
where	O
we	O
found	O
plenty	O
of	O
fat	O
bulls	O
and	O
cows	O
feeding	O
in	O
the	O
savannahs	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
house	O
good	O
store	O
of	O
salt	O
and	O
maize	O
;	O
and	O
some	O
hogs	O
,	O
and	O
cocks	O
and	O
hens	O
:	O
but	O
the	O
owners	O
or	O
overseers	O
were	O
gone	O
.	O

We	O
lay	O
here	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
feasting	O
on	O
fresh	O
provision	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
not	O
contrive	O
to	O
carry	O
any	O
quantity	O
aboard	O
because	O
the	O
way	O
was	O
so	O
long	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
but	O
weak	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
wide	O
river	O
to	O
ford	O
.	O

Therefore	O
we	O
returned	O
again	O
from	O
thence	O
the	O
26th	O
day	O
and	O
brought	O
everyone	O
a	O
little	O
beef	O
or	O
pork	O
for	O
the	O
men	O
that	O
stayed	O
aboard	O
.	O

The	O
two	O
nights	O
that	O
we	O
stayed	O
ashore	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
we	O
heard	O
great	O
droves	O
of	O
jackals	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
supposed	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
,	O
barking	O
all	O
night	O
long	O
not	O
far	O
from	O
us	O
.	O

None	O
of	O
us	O
saw	O
these	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
do	O
verily	O
believe	O
they	O
were	O
jackals	O
;	O
though	O
I	O
did	O
never	O
see	O
these	O
creatures	O
in	O
America	PNM
,	O
nor	O
hear	O
any	O
but	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
.	O

We	O
could	O
not	O
think	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
less	O
than	O
30	O
or	O
40	O
in	O
a	O
company	O
.	O

We	O
got	O
aboard	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
;	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
yet	O
hear	O
any	O
news	O
of	O
our	O
two	O
Canoas	O
.	O

The	O
27th	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
we	O
sailed	O
from	O
hence	O
with	O
the	O
land-wind	O
at	O
north	O
by	O
W	O
.	O

The	O
sea-wind	O
came	O
about	O
noon	O
at	O
west-south-west	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
we	O
anchored	O
in	O
16	O
fathom	O
water	O
by	O
a	O
small	O
rocky	O
island	O
which	O
lies	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
Main	O
and	O
six	O
leagues	O
westward	O
from	O
Port	PNM
Angels	PNM
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
give	O
no	O
account	O
of	O
this	O
island	O
in	O
their	O
pilot-book	O
.	O

The	O
28th	O
day	O
we	O
sailed	O
again	O
with	O
the	O
land-wind	O
:	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
the	O
sea-breeze	O
blew	O
hard	O
and	O
we	O
sprung	O
our	O
main-top-mast	O
.	O

This	O
coast	O
is	O
full	O
of	O
small	O
hills	O
and	O
valleys	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
sea	O
falls	O
in	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
night	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
of	O
our	O
Canoas	O
that	O
went	O
from	O
us	O
at	O
Guatulco	PNM
.	O

They	O
had	O
been	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
Acapulco	PNM
to	O
seek	O
Port	PNM
Angels	PNM
.	O

Coming	O
back	O
from	O
thence	O
they	O
went	O
into	O
a	O
river	O
to	O
get	O
water	O
and	O
were	O
encountered	O
by	O
150	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
yet	O
they	O
filled	O
their	O
water	O
in	O
spite	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
had	O
one	O
man	O
shot	O
through	O
the	O
thigh	O
.	O

Afterward	O
they	O
went	O
into	O
a	O
lagoon	O
,	O
or	O
lake	O
of	O
salt	O
water	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
found	O
much	O
dried	O
fish	O
and	O
brought	O
some	O
aboard	O
.	O

We	O
being	O
now	O
abreast	O
of	O
that	O
place	O
sent	O
in	O
a	O
canoa	O
manned	O
with	O
twelve	O
men	O
for	O
more	O
fish	O
.	O

The	O
mouth	O
of	O
this	O
lagoon	O
is	O
not	O
pistol-shot	O
wide	O
,	O
and	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
are	O
pretty	O
high	O
rocks	O
,	O
so	O
conveniently	O
placed	O
by	O
nature	O
that	O
many	O
men	O
may	O
abscond	O
behind	O
;	O
and	O
within	O
the	O
rocks	O
and	O
lagoon	O
opens	O
wide	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
being	O
alarmed	O
by	O
our	O
two	O
Canoas	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
there	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
before	O
,	O
came	O
armed	O
to	O
this	O
place	O
to	O
secure	O
their	O
fish	O
;	O
and	O
seeing	O
our	O
canoa	O
coming	O
,	O
they	O
lay	O
snug	O
behind	O
the	O
rocks	O
,	O
and	O
suffered	O
the	O
canoa	O
to	O
pass	O
in	O
,	O
then	O
they	O
fired	O
their	O
volley	O
and	O
wounded	O
five	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
.	O

Our	O
people	O
were	O
a	O
little	O
surprised	O
at	O
this	O
sudden	O
adventure	O
,	O
yet	O
fired	O
their	O
guns	O
and	O
rowed	O
farther	O
into	O
the	O
lagoon	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
durst	O
not	O
adventure	O
to	O
come	O
out	O
again	O
through	O
the	O
narrow	O
entrance	O
which	O
was	O
near	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
in	O
length	O
.	O

Therefore	O
they	O
rowed	O
into	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
lagoon	O
where	O
they	O
lay	O
out	O
of	O
gun-shot	O
and	O
looked	O
about	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
another	O
passage	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
at	O
,	O
broader	O
than	O
that	O
by	O
which	O
they	O
entered	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
see	O
none	O
.	O

So	O
they	O
lay	O
still	O
two	O
days	O
and	O
three	O
nights	O
,	O
in	O
hopes	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
come	O
to	O
seek	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
lay	O
off	O
at	O
sea	O
about	O
three	O
leagues	O
distant	O
,	O
waiting	O
for	O
their	O
return	O
,	O
supposing	O
by	O
their	O
long	O
absence	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
made	O
some	O
greater	O
discovery	O
and	O
were	O
gone	O
farther	O
than	O
the	O
fish-range	O
;	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
usual	O
with	O
privateers	O
when	O
they	O
enter	O
upon	O
such	O
designs	O
to	O
search	O
farther	O
than	O
they	O
proposed	O
if	O
they	O
meet	O
any	O
encouragement	O
.	O

But	O
Captain	O
Townley	O
and	O
his	O
bark	O
being	O
nearer	O
the	O
shore	O
heard	O
some	O
guns	O
fired	O
in	O
the	O
lagoon	O
.	O

So	O
he	O
manned	O
his	O
canoa	O
and	O
went	O
towards	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
beating	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
rocks	O
,	O
made	O
a	O
free	O
passage	O
for	O
our	O
men	O
to	O
come	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
pound	O
,	O
where	O
else	O
they	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
starved	O
or	O
knocked	O
on	O
the	O
head	O
by	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
.	O

They	O
came	O
aboard	O
their	O
ships	O
again	O
the	O
31st	O
of	O
October	O
.	O

This	O
lagoon	O
is	O
about	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
16	O
degrees	O
40	O
minutes	O
north	O
.	O

From	O
hence	O
we	O
made	O
sail	O
again	O
,	O
coasting	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
,	O
having	O
fair	O
weather	O
and	O
a	O
current	O
setting	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
.	O

The	O
second	O
day	O
of	O
November	O
we	O
passed	O
by	O
a	O
rock	O
called	O
by	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
the	O
Algatross	O
.	O

The	O
land	O
hereabout	O
is	O
of	O
an	O
indifferent	O
height	O
and	O
woody	O
,	O
and	O
more	O
within	O
the	O
country	O
mountainous	O
.	O

Here	O
are	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
white	O
cliffs	O
by	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
very	O
remarkable	O
because	O
there	O
are	O
none	O
so	O
white	O
and	O
so	O
thick	O
together	O
on	O
all	O
the	O
coast	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
mile	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
of	O
the	O
Algatross	O
Rock	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
a	O
dangerous	O
shoal	O
lies	O
south	O
by	O
W.	O
from	O
these	O
cliffs	O
,	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
mile	O
off	O
at	O
sea	O
.	O

Two	O
leagues	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
of	O
these	O
cliffs	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
pretty	O
large	O
river	O
which	O
forms	O
a	O
small	O
island	O
at	O
its	O
mouth	O
.	O

The	O
channel	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
is	O
but	O
shoal	O
and	O
sandy	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
west	O
channel	O
is	O
deep	O
enough	O
for	O
Canoas	O
to	O
enter	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
banks	O
of	O
this	O
channel	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
have	O
made	O
a	O
breast-work	O
to	O
hinder	O
an	O
enemy	O
from	O
landing	O
or	O
filling	O
water	O
.	O

The	O
3rd	O
day	O
we	O
anchored	O
abreast	O
of	O
this	O
river	O
in	O
14	O
fathom	O
water	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
off	O
shore	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
we	O
manned	O
our	O
Canoas	O
and	O
went	O
ashore	O
to	O
the	O
breast-work	O
with	O
little	O
resistance	O
,	O
although	O
there	O
were	O
about	O
200	O
men	O
to	O
keep	O
us	O
off	O
.	O

They	O
fired	O
about	O
twenty	O
or	O
thirty	O
guns	O
at	O
us	O
but	O
seeing	O
we	O
were	O
resolved	O
to	O
land	O
they	O
quitted	O
the	O
place	O
;	O
one	O
chief	O
reason	O
why	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
are	O
so	O
frequently	O
routed	O
by	O
us	O
,	O
although	O
many	O
times	O
much	O
our	O
superiors	O
in	O
numbers	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
many	O
places	O
fortified	O
with	O
breast-works	O
,	O
is	O
their	O
want	O
of	O
small	O
firearms	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
have	O
but	O
few	O
on	O
all	O
the	O
sea	O
coasts	O
unless	O
near	O
their	O
larger	O
garrisons	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
salt	O
,	O
brought	O
hither	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
judge	O
,	O
for	O
to	O
salt	O
fish	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
take	O
in	O
the	O
lagoons	O
.	O

The	O
fish	O
I	O
observed	O
here	O
mostly	O
were	O
what	O
we	O
call	O
snook	O
,	O
neither	O
a	O
sea-fish	O
nor	O
fresh	O
water-fish	O
,	O
but	O
very	O
numerous	O
in	O
these	O
salt	O
lakes	O
.	O

This	O
fish	O
is	O
about	O
a	O
foot	O
long	O
,	O
and	O
round	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
thick	O
as	O
the	O
small	O
of	O
a	O
man	O
's	O
leg	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
pretty	O
long	O
head	O
:	O
it	O
has	O
scales	O
of	O
a	O
whitish	O
colour	O
and	O
is	O
good	O
meat	O
.	O

How	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
take	O
them	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
never	O
found	O
any	O
nets	O
,	O
hooks	O
or	O
lines	O
;	O
neither	O
yet	O
any	O
bark	O
,	O
boat	O
,	O
or	O
canoa	O
among	O
them	O
on	O
all	O
this	O
coast	O
,	O
except	O
the	O
ship	O
I	O
shall	O
mention	O
at	O
Acapulco	PNM
.	O

We	O
marched	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
leagues	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
and	O
met	O
with	O
but	O
one	O
house	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
took	O
a	O
Mulatto	O
prisoner	O
who	O
informed	O
us	O
of	O
a	O
ship	O
that	O
was	O
lately	O
arrived	O
at	O
Acapulco	PNM
;	O
she	O
came	O
from	O
Lima	PNM
.	O

Captain	O
Townley	O
,	O
wanting	O
a	O
good	O
ship	O
,	O
thought	O
now	O
he	O
had	O
an	O
opportunity	O
of	O
getting	O
one	O
if	O
he	O
could	O
persuade	O
his	O
men	O
to	O
venture	O
with	O
him	O
into	O
the	O
harbour	O
of	O
Acapulco	PNM
and	O
fetch	O
this	O
Lima	O
ship	O
out	O
.	O

Therefore	O
he	O
immediately	O
proposed	O
it	O
and	O
found	O
not	O
only	O
all	O
his	O
own	O
men	O
willing	O
to	O
assist	O
him	O
but	O
many	O
of	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
's	O
men	O
also	O
.	O

Captain	O
Swan	O
opposed	O
it	O
because	O
,	O
provision	O
being	O
scarce	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
he	O
thought	O
our	O
time	O
might	O
be	O
much	O
better	O
employed	O
in	O
first	O
providing	O
ourselves	O
with	O
food	O
,	O
and	O
here	O
was	O
plenty	O
of	O
maize	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
where	O
we	O
now	O
were	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
informed	O
by	O
the	O
same	O
prisoner	O
who	O
offered	O
to	O
conduct	O
us	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
.	O

But	O
neither	O
the	O
present	O
necessity	O
nor	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
's	O
persuasion	O
availed	O
anything	O
,	O
no	O
nor	O
yet	O
their	O
own	O
interest	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
great	O
design	O
we	O
had	O
then	O
in	O
hand	O
was	O
to	O
lie	O
and	O
wait	O
for	O
a	O
rich	O
ship	O
which	O
comes	O
to	O
Acapulco	PNM
every	O
year	O
richly	O
laden	O
from	O
the	O
Philippine	PNM
Islands	PNM
.	O

But	O
it	O
was	O
necessary	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
well	O
stored	O
with	O
provisions	O
to	O
enable	O
us	O
to	O
cruise	O
about	O
and	O
wait	O
the	O
time	O

we	O
only	O
filled	O
our	O
water	O
here	O

So	O
the	O
5th	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
we	O
sailed	O
again	O

coasting	O
to	O

The	O
7th	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
being	O
about	O
twelve	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
high	O
land	O
of	O
Acapulco	PNM
,	O
which	O
is	O
very	O
remarkable	O
:	O
for	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
round	O
hill	O
standing	O
between	O
two	O
other	O
hills	O
;	O
the	O
westermost	O
of	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
biggest	O
and	O
highest	O
,	O
and	O
has	O
two	O
hillocks	O
like	O
two	O
paps	O
on	O
its	O
top	O
:	O
the	O
eastermost	O
hill	O
is	O
higher	O
and	O
sharper	O
than	O
the	O
middlemost	O
.	O

From	O
the	O
middle	O
hill	O
the	O
land	O
declines	O
toward	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
ending	O
in	O
a	O
high	O
round	O
point	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
no	O
land	O
shaped	O
like	O
this	O
on	O
all	O
the	O
coast	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
Captain	O
Townley	O
went	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
ships	O
with	O
140	O
men	O
in	O
twelve	O
Canoas	O
to	O
try	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
Lima	O
ship	O
out	O
of	O
Acapulco	PNM
Harbour	PNM

Acapulco	O
is	O
a	O
pretty	O
large	O
town	O
,	O
17	O
degrees	O
north	O
of	O
the	O
Equator	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
the	O
sea-port	O
for	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Mexico	PNM
on	O
the	O

as	O
I	O

by	O
the	O
intercourse	O
between	O

The	O

hither	O
are	O
only	O
three	O

two	O
that	O
constantly	O

This	O

;	O
she	O
brings	O
them	O
quicksilver	O

Cacoa	PNM

Here	O
she	O
stays	O
till	O
the	O
Manila	PNM

This	O
is	O

a	O

in	O
about	O
sixty	O

gets	O
a	O

She	O
falls	O
in	O

Sir	O
John	O
Narborough	O
therefore	O
was	O
imposed	O

The	O
Port	O
of	O
Acapulco	PNM
is	O
very	O
commodious	O
for	O
the	O
reception	O
of	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
large	O
that	O
some	O
hundreds	O
may	O
safely	O
ride	O
there	O
without	O
damnifying	O
each	O

There	O
is	O
a	O
small	O
low	O
island	O
crossing	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O

;	O
it	O

half	O
a	O

It	O
leaves	O
a	O
good	O
wide	O

channel	O
at	O
each	O

where	O
ships	O
may	O
safely	O
go	O

or	O
come	O
out	O
,	O
taking	O
the	O
advantage	O
of	O
the	O
winds	O
;	O
they	O
must	O
enter	O
with	O
the	O
sea-wind	O
,	O
and	O
go	O
out	O
with	O
the	O
land-wind	O
,	O
for	O
these	O
winds	O
seldom	O

in	O
their	O
proper	O
season	O
of	O
the	O
day	O

The	O
westermost	O

is	O
the	O
narrowest	O

there	O
is	O
no	O

for	O
on	O
a	O

they	O
were	O

had	O

to	O

but	O
they	O
escaped	O
that	O
danger	O
and	O
the	O
second	O
night	O
got	O
safe	O
into	O
Port	PNM

very	O
good	O
harbour	O
a	O
league	O
to	O
the	O

of	O
Acapulco	PNM

Here	O
they	O
stayed	O
all	O
the	O
next	O

to	O
dry	O
themselves	O

their	O
clothes	O
,	O
their	O
arms	O
and	O
ammunition	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
night	O
they	O
rowed	O
softly	O
into	O
Acapulco	PNM
Harbour	PNM
;	O
and	O
because	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
heard	O
they	O
hauled	O
in	O
their	O
oars	O
,	O
and	O
paddled	O
as	O
softly	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
seeking	O
manatee	O

They	O
paddled	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
castle	O
;	O
then	O
struck	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
town	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
the	O
ship	O
riding	O
between	O
the	O
breast-work	O
and	O
the	O
fort	O
,	O
within	O
about	O
a	O
hundred	O
yards	O
of	O
each	O

When	O
they	O
had	O
well	O
viewed	O
her	O
and	O
considered	O
the	O
danger	O
of	O
the	O
design	O
they	O
thought	O
it	O
not	O
possible	O
to	O
accomplish	O
it	O
;	O
therefore	O
they	O
paddled	O
softly	O
back	O
again	O
till	O
they	O
were	O
out	O
of	O
command	O
of	O
the	O
forts	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
they	O
went	O
to	O
land	O
,	O
and	O
fell	O
in	O
among	O
a	O
company	O
of	O
Spanish	O
soldiers	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
having	O
seen	O
them	O
the	O
day	O
before	O

had	O
set	O
guards	O
along	O
the	O

-RRB-	O
who	O
immediately	O
fired	O
at	O
them	O
but	O
did	O
them	O
no	O
damage	O
,	O
only	O
made	O
them	O
retire	O
farther	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O

They	O
lay	O
afterwards	O
at	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
harbour	O
till	O
it	O
was	O
day	O
to	O
take	O
a	O

being	O
tired	O

hungry	O
,	O
and	O
sorry	O
for	O
their	O
disappointment	O
.	O

The	O
11th	O
day	O
we	O
made	O
sail	O
again	O
further	O
on	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
with	O
the	O
land-wind	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
commonly	O
at	O
north-east	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
sea-winds	O
are	O
at	O
south-west	O
.	O

We	O
passed	O
by	O
a	O
long	O
sandy	O
bay	O
of	O
above	O
twenty	O
leagues	O

All	O
the	O
way	O
along	O
it	O
the	O

with	O
such	O

it	O
is	O
impossible	O
to	O

two	O
from	O
the	O

The	O
land	O
by	O

The	O

the	O

where	O
we	O

eleven	O

We	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
on	O
the	O
north-west	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
and	O
went	O
ashore	O

about	O
170	O

of	O
us	O

and	O
marched	O
into	O
the	O

twelve	O

There	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
a	O

village	O
that	O
did	O
not	O
afford	O
us	O
a	O

The	O

only	O
a	O

three	O

who	O
were	O

She	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
a	O
carrier	O
-LRB-	O
one	O
who	O
drives	O
a	O
caravan	O
of	O

-RRB-	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
Acapulco	PNM

laden	O
with	O

stopped	O
in	O

fear	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
a	O
little	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
of	O
this	O

-LRB-	O
for	O
he	O
had	O
heard	O
of	O
our	O
being	O
on	O
this	O
coast	O
-RRB-	O
and	O
she	O
thought	O
he	O
still	O
remained	O
there	O
:	O
and	O
therefore	O
it	O
was	O
we	O
kept	O
the	O
woman	O
to	O
be	O
our	O

At	O
this	O

our	O
Moskito	O

struck	O
some	O
small	O

many	O

jewfish	O

The	O
jew-fish	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
fish	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
judge	O
so	O
called	O
by	O
the	O
English	O
because	O
it	O
has	O
scales	O
and	O
fins	O
,	O
therefore	O
a	O
clean	O
fish	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
Levitical	O
law	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Jews	O
at	O
Jamaica	PNM
buy	O
them	O
and	O
eat	O
them	O
very	O
freely	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
large	O
fish	O
,	O
shaped	O
much	O
like	O
a	O
cod	O
but	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
bigger	O
;	O
one	O
will	O
weigh	O
three	O
,	O
or	O
four	O
,	O
or	O
five	O
hundredweight	O

It	O
has	O
a	O
large	O
head	O
,	O
with	O
great	O
fins	O
and	O
scales	O
,	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
an	O
half-crown	O
,	O
answerable	O
to	O
the	O
bigness	O
of	O
his	O
body	O

It	O
is	O
very	O
sweet	O
meat	O
,	O
and	O
commonly	O
fat	O

This	O
fish	O
lives	O
among	O
the	O

there	O
are	O

of	O
them	O
in	O

The	O
14th	O
day	O
in	O
the	O

we	O
went	O
with	O
95	O
men	O
in	O
six	O

seek	O
for	O
the	O

taking	O
the	O

but	O
Captain	O
Townley	O
would	O
not	O
go	O
with	O
us	O

Before	O

we	O
landed	O
at	O
a	O
place	O
called	O
Estapa	PNM
,	O
a	O
league	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
of	O
Chequetan	PNM

The	O
woman	O
was	O
well	O
acquainted	O
here	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
often	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
for	O
mussels	O
as	O
she	O
told	O
us	O
;	O
for	O
here	O
are	O
great	O

of	O
them	O

They	O
seem	O
in	O
all	O

like	O
our	O

She	O
carried	O
us	O
through	O
the	O

wood	O
by	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
a	O
river	O
for	O
about	O
a	O
league	O
:	O
then	O
we	O
came	O
into	O
a	O
savannah	O
full	O
of	O
bulls	O
and	O
cows	O
;	O
and	O
here	O
the	O
carrier	O
before	O
mentioned	O
was	O
lying	O
at	O
the	O
estancia-house	O
with	O
his	O
mules	O
,	O
not	O
having	O
dared	O
to	O
advance	O
all	O
this	O
while	O
,	O
as	O
not	O
knowing	O
where	O
we	O
lay	O
;	O
so	O
his	O
own	O
fear	O
made	O
him	O
,	O
his	O
mules	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
his	O
goods	O
,	O
become	O
a	O
prey	O
to	O
us	O

He	O
had	O
40	O
packs	O
of	O
flour	O

some	O

,	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
small	O

and	O
abundance	O
of	O
earthenware	O

The	O
eatables	O
we	O
brought	O
away	O

but	O
the	O
earthen	O
vessels	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
occasion	O
for	O
and	O
therefore	O
left	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
mules	O
were	O
about	O
60	O
:	O
we	O
brought	O
our	O
prize	O
with	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
turned	O
them	O
away	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
also	O
killed	O
some	O
cows	O
and	O
brought	O
with	O
us	O
to	O
our	O
Canoas	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
our	O
ships	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
landed	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
went	O
aboard	O

Captain	O
Townley	O
,	O
seeing	O
our	O
good	O
success	O
,	O
went	O
ashore	O
with	O
his	O
men	O
to	O
kill	O
some	O
cows	O
;	O
for	O
here	O
were	O
no	O
inhabitants	O
near	O

The	O

yet	O
it	O
has	O
but	O
few	O
inhabitants	O
near	O
the	O
sea	O

Captain	O
Townley	O
killed	O
18	O
beefs	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
he	O
came	O
aboard	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
contrary	O
to	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
's	O
inclination	O
,	O
gave	O
Captain	O
Townley	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
flour	O
which	O
we	O
took	O
ashore	O
.	O

Afterwards	O
we	O
gave	O
the	O
woman	O
some	O
clothes	O
for	O
her	O
and	O
her	O
children	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
her	O

two	O
of	O
them	O
ashore	O
;	O
but	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
a	O
very	O
pretty	O

about	O
seven	O

eight	O
years	O

Captain	O

kept	O

The	O
woman	O
cried	O
and	O
begged	O
hard	O
to	O
have	O
him	O
;	O
but	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
would	O
not	O
,	O
but	O
promised	O
to	O
make	O
much	O
of	O
him	O
and	O
was	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
his	O
word	O

He	O
proved	O
afterwards	O
a	O
very	O
fine	O
boy	O
for	O
wit	O
,	O
courage	O
,	O
and	O
dexterity	O
;	O
I	O
have	O
often	O
wondered	O
at	O
his	O
expressions	O
and	O
actions	O
.	O

The	O
21st	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
we	O
sailed	O
hence	O
with	O
the	O
land-wind	O

The	O
land-winds	O
on	O

the	O

are	O
at	O
north	O
and	O
the	O
sea-winds	O
at	O
west-south-west	O

We	O
had	O
fair	O
weather	O
and	O
coasted	O
along	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O

The	O
land	O
is	O
high	O

full	O

hills	O
the	O
land	O

many	O
pleasant	O

fruitful	O
valleys	O
among	O
the	O
mountains	O

The	O
25th	O
day	O
we	O
were	O
abreast	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
remarkable	O
hill	O
which	O
,	O
towering	O
above	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
his	O

is	O
divided	O
in	O
the	O

It	O
is	O
in	O
latitude	O
18	O
degrees	O
8	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
make	O
mention	O
of	O
a	O
town	O
called	O
Thelupan	O
near	O
this	O
hill	O

which	O
we	O
would	O
have	O
visited	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
have	O
found	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
it	O

The	O
26th	O
day	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
and	O
Captain	O
Townley	O
with	O
200	O
men	O
,	O
of	O
whom	O
I	O
was	O
one	O
,	O
went	O
in	O
our	O
Canoas	O
to	O
seek	O
for	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Colima	PNM
,	O
a	O
rich	O
place	O
by	O
report	O
,	O
but	O
how	O
far	O
within	O
land	O
I	O
could	O
never	O
learn	O
:	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
before	O
,	O
here	O
is	O
no	O
trade	O
by	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
we	O
could	O
never	O
get	O
guides	O
to	O
inform	O
us	O
or	O
conduct	O
us	O
to	O
any	O
town	O
but	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
on	O
this	O
coast	O
:	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
never	O
a	O
town	O
that	O
lies	O
open	O
to	O
the	O
sea	O
but	O
Acapulco	PNM
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
our	O
search	O
was	O
commonly	O
fruitless	O
,	O
as	O
now	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
rowed	O
above	O
20	O
leagues	O
along	O
shore	O
and	O
found	O
it	O
a	O
very	O
bad	O
coast	O
to	O
land	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
no	O
house	O
nor	O
sign	O
of	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
although	O
we	O
passed	O
by	O
a	O
fine	O
valley	O
called	O
the	O
valley	O
of	O
Maguella	PNM
;	O
only	O
at	O
two	O
places	O
,	O
the	O
one	O
at	O
our	O
first	O

out	O

this	O
expedition	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
horseman	O
set	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
supposed	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
sentinel	O
to	O
watch	O
us	O
.	O

At	O
both	O
places	O
we	O
landed	O
with	O
difficulty	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
each	O
place	O
we	O
followed	O
the	O
track	O
of	O
the	O
horse	O
on	O
the	O
sandy	O
bay	O
;	O
but	O
where	O
they	O
entered	O
the	O
woods	O
we	O
lost	O
the	O
track	O
and	O
,	O
although	O
we	O
diligently	O
searched	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
could	O
find	O
it	O
no	O
more	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
were	O
perfectly	O
at	O
a	O
loss	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
the	O
houses	O
or	O
town	O
they	O
came	O
from	O

The	O
28th	O
day	O
,	O
being	O
tired	O
and	O
hopeless	O
to	O
find	O
any	O
town	O

we	O
went	O
aboard	O

Spaniards	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
agreed	O
between	O
them	O
and	O
their	O
companions	O
on	O
board	O
to	O
make	O
two	O
great	O
smokes	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
from	O
each	O
other	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
town	O
should	O
be	O
taken	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
signal	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
that	O
it	O
might	O
safely	O
enter	O
the	O
harbour	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
made	O
these	O
smokes	O
presently	O
:	O
I	O
was	O
then	O
among	O
those	O
who	O
stayed	O
on	O
board	O
;	O
and	O
whether	O
the	O
signal	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
exactly	O
made	O
or	O
some	O
other	O
discouragement	O
happened	O
I	O
remember	O
not	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
forbore	O
going	O
in	O
till	O
we	O
saw	O
our	O
scattered	O
crew	O
coming	O
off	O
in	O
their	O
Canoas	O
.	O

Had	O
we	O
entered	O
the	O
port	O
upon	O
the	O
false	O
signal	O
we	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
taken	O
or	O
sunk	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
must	O
have	O
passed	O
close	O
by	O
the	O
fort	O
and	O
could	O
have	O
had	O
no	O
wind	O
to	O
bring	O
us	O
out	O
till	O
the	O

should	O
rise	O
in	O

But	O
to	O
our	O
present	O
voyage	O
:	O
after	O
we	O
came	O
aboard	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
volcano	PNM
of	PNM
Colima	PNM
.	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
high	O
mountain	O
in	O
about	O
18	O
degrees	O
36	O
minutes	O
north	O
,	O
standing	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
sea	O
in	O
the	O
midst	O
of	O
a	O
pleasant	O
valley	O
.	O

It	O
appears	O
with	O
two	O
sharp	O
peaks	O
,	O
from	O
each	O
of	O
which	O
there	O
do	O
always	O
issue	O
flames	O
of	O
fire	O
or	O
smoke	O
.	O

The	O
valley	O
in	O
which	O
this	O
volcano	O
stands	O
is	O
called	O
the	O
valley	O
of	O
Colima	PNM
from	O
the	O
town	O
itself	O
which	O
stands	O
there	O
not	O
far	O
from	O
the	O
volcano	O
.	O

The	O
town	O
is	O
said	O
to	O
be	O
great	O
and	O
rich	O
,	O
the	O
chief	O
of	O
all	O
its	O
neighbourhood	O
:	O
and	O
the	O
valley	O
in	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
seated	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
relation	O
which	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
give	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
pleasant	O
and	O
fruitful	O
valley	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
kingdom	O
of	O
Mexico	PNM
.	O

This	O
valley	O
is	O
about	O
ten	O
or	O
twelve	O
leagues	O
wide	O
by	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
where	O
it	O
makes	O
a	O
small	O
bay	O
:	O
but	O
how	O
far	O
the	O
vale	O
runs	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
said	O
to	O
be	O
full	O
of	O
Cacoa-gardens	PNM
,	O
fields	O
of	O
corn	O
,	O
wheat	O
,	O
and	O
plantain-walks	O
.	O

The	O
neighbouring	O
sea	O
is	O
bounded	O
with	O
a	O
sandy	O
shore	O
;	O
but	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
going	O
ashore	O
for	O
the	O
violence	O
of	O
the	O
waves	O
.	O

The	O
land	O
within	O
it	O
is	O
low	O
all	O
along	O
and	O
woody	O
for	O
about	O
two	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
;	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
woods	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
deep	O
river	O
runs	O
out	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
has	O
such	O
a	O
great	O
bar	O
,	O
or	O
sandy	O
shoal	O
,	O
that	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
here	O
no	O
boat	O
or	O
canoa	O
could	O
possibly	O
enter	O
,	O
the	O
sea	O
running	O
so	O
high	O
upon	O
the	O
bar	O
:	O
otherwise	O
,	O
I	O
judge	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
made	O
some	O
farther	O
discovery	O
into	O
this	O
pleasant	O
valley	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
the	O
savannah-land	O
begins	O
and	O
runs	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
valley	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
but	O
little	O
wind	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
aboard	O
,	O
therefore	O
we	O
lay	O
off	O
this	O
bay	O
that	O
afternoon	O
and	O
the	O
night	O
ensuing	O
.	O

The	O
29th	O
day	O
our	O
captains	O
went	O
away	O
from	O
our	O
ships	O
with	O
200	O
men	O
,	O
intending	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
convenient	O
place	O
to	O
land	O
and	O
search	O
about	O
for	O
a	O
path	O
:	O
for	O
the	O
Spanish	O
books	O
make	O
mention	O
of	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
other	O
towns	O
hereabouts	O
,	O
especially	O
one	O
called	O
Sallagua	PNM
,	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
of	O
this	O
bay	O
.	O

Our	O
Canoas	O
rowed	O
along	O
as	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
sea	O
went	O
so	O
high	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
land	O
.	O

About	O
10	O
or	O
11	O
a	O
clock	O
two	O
horsemen	O
came	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
took	O
a	O
bottle	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
pocket	O
and	O
drank	O
to	O
our	O
men	O
.	O

While	O
he	O
was	O
drinking	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
snatched	O
up	O
his	O
gun	O
and	O
let	O
drive	O
at	O
him	O
and	O
killed	O
his	O
horse	O
:	O
so	O
his	O
consort	O
immediately	O
set	O
spurs	O
to	O
his	O
horse	O
and	O
rode	O
away	O
,	O
leaving	O
the	O
other	O
to	O
come	O
after	O
a-foot	O
.	O

But	O
he	O
being	O
booted	O
made	O
but	O
slow	O
haste	O
;	O
therefore	O
two	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
stripped	O
themselves	O
and	O
swam	O
ashore	O
to	O
take	O
him	O
.	O

But	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
machete	O
,	O
or	O
long	O
knife	O
,	O
wherewith	O
he	O
kept	O
them	O
both	O
from	O
seizing	O
him	O
,	O
they	O
having	O
nothing	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O
wherewith	O
to	O
defend	O
themselves	O
or	O
offend	O
him	O
.	O

The	O
30th	O
day	O
our	O
men	O
came	O
all	O
aboard	O
again	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
find	O
any	O
place	O
to	O
land	O
in	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
day	O
of	O
December	O
we	O
passed	O
by	O
the	O
Port	PNM
of	PNM
Sallagua	PNM
.	O

This	O
port	O
is	O
in	O
latitude	O
18	O
degrees	O
52	O
minutes	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
only	O
a	O
pretty	O
deep	O
bay	O
,	O
divided	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
with	O
a	O
rocky	O
point	O
,	O
which	O
makes	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
two	O
harbours	O
.	O

Ships	O
may	O
ride	O
securely	O
in	O
either	O
but	O
the	O
west	O
harbour	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
:	O
there	O
is	O
good	O
anchoring	O
anywhere	O
in	O
10	O
or	O
12	O
fathom	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
brook	O
of	O
fresh	O
water	O
runs	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
great	O
new	O
thatched	O
house	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
Spaniards	O
both	O
horse	O
and	O
foot	O
,	O
with	O
drums	O
beating	O
and	O
colours	O
flying	O
in	O
defiance	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
thought	O
.	O

We	O
took	O
no	O
notice	O
of	O
them	O
till	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
landed	O
about	O
200	O
men	O
to	O
try	O
their	O
courage	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
presently	O
withdrew	O
.	O

The	O
foot	O
never	O
stayed	O
to	O
exchange	O
one	O
shot	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
horsemen	O
stayed	O
till	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
were	O
knocked	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
they	O
drew	O
off	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
pursuing	O
them	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
two	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
took	O
two	O
horses	O
that	O
had	O
lost	O
their	O
riders	O
and	O
,	O
mounting	O
them	O
,	O
rode	O
after	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
full	O
drive	O
till	O
they	O
came	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
thinking	O
to	O
have	O
taken	O
a	O
prisoner	O
for	O
intelligence	O
,	O
but	O
had	O
like	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
taken	O
themselves	O
:	O
for	O
four	O
Spaniards	O
surrounded	O
them	O
,	O
after	O
they	O
had	O
discharged	O
their	O
pistols	O
,	O
and	O
unhorsed	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
best	O
footmen	O
had	O
not	O
come	O
to	O
their	O
rescue	O
they	O
must	O
have	O
yielded	O
or	O
have	O
been	O
killed	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
both	O
cut	O
in	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
places	O
but	O
their	O
wounds	O
were	O
not	O
mortal	O
.	O

The	O
four	O
Spaniards	O
got	O
away	O
before	O
our	O
men	O
could	O
hurt	O
them	O
and	O
,	O
mounting	O
their	O
horses	O
,	O
speeded	O
after	O
their	O
consorts	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
marched	O
away	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
,	O
finding	O
a	O
broad	O
road	O
leading	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
followed	O
it	O
about	O
four	O
leagues	O
in	O
a	O
dry	O
stony	O
country	O
,	O
full	O
of	O
short	O
wood	O
;	O
but	O
finding	O
no	O
sign	O
of	O
inhabitants	O
they	O
returned	O
again	O
.	O

In	O
their	O
way	O
back	O
they	O
took	O
two	O
Mulattos	O
who	O
were	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
march	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
their	O
consorts	O
;	O
therefore	O
they	O
had	O
skulked	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
and	O
by	O
that	O
means	O
thought	O
to	O
have	O
escaped	O
our	O
men	O
.	O

These	O
prisoners	O
informed	O
us	O
that	O
this	O
great	O
road	O
did	O
lead	O
to	O
a	O
great	O
city	O
called	O
Oarrha	PNM
,	O
from	O
whence	O
many	O
of	O
those	O
horsemen	O
before	O
spoken	O
of	O
came	O
:	O
that	O
this	O
city	O
was	O
distant	O
from	O
hence	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
a	O
horse	O
will	O
go	O
in	O
four	O
days	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
place	O
of	O
consequence	O
nearer	O
:	O
that	O
the	O
country	O
is	O
very	O
poor	O
and	O
thinly	O
inhabited	O
.	O

They	O
said	O
also	O
that	O
these	O
men	O
came	O
to	O
assist	O
the	O
Philippine	O
ship	O
that	O
was	O
every	O
day	O
expected	O
here	O
to	O
put	O
ashore	O
passengers	O
for	O
Mexico	PNM
.	O

The	O
Spanish	O
pilot-books	O
mention	O
a	O
town	O
also	O
called	O
Sallagua	PNM
hereabouts	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
find	O
it	O
,	O
nor	O
hear	O
anything	O
of	O
it	O
by	O
our	O
prisoners	O
.	O

We	O
now	O
intended	O
to	O
cruise	O
off	O
Cape	PNM
Corrientes	PNM
to	O
wait	O
for	O
the	O
Philippine	O
ship	O
.	O

So	O
the	O
6th	O
day	O
of	O
December	O
we	O
set	O
sail	O
,	O
coasting	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
towards	O
Cape	PNM
Corrientes	PNM
.	O

We	O
had	O
fair	O
weather	O
and	O
but	O
little	O
wind	O
;	O
the	O
sea-breezes	O
at	O
north-west	O
and	O
the	O
land-wind	O
at	O
north	O
.	O

The	O
land	O
is	O
of	O
an	O
indifferent	O
height	O
,	O
full	O
of	O
ragged	O
points	O
which	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
appear	O
like	O
islands	O
:	O
the	O
country	O
is	O
very	O
woody	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
trees	O
are	O
not	O
high	O
,	O
nor	O
very	O
big	O
.	O

Here	O
I	O
was	O
taken	O
sick	O
of	O
a	O
fever	O
and	O
ague	O
that	O
afterwards	O
turned	O
to	O
a	O
dropsy	O
which	O
I	O
laboured	O
under	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
after	O
;	O
and	O
many	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
died	O
of	O
this	O
distemper	O
,	O
though	O
our	O
surgeons	O
used	O
their	O
greatest	O
skill	O
to	O
preserve	O
their	O
lives	O

The	O
dropsy	O
is	O
a	O
general	O
distemper	O
on	O
this	O
coast	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
natives	O
say	O
that	O
the	O
best	O
remedy	O
they	O
can	O
find	O
for	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
stone	O
or	O
cod	O
of	O
an	O
alligator	O
-LRB-	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
have	O
four	O

one	O
near	O

the	O
flesh	O
-RRB-	O
pulverized	O
and	O
drunk	O
in	O
water	O

this	O
recipe	O
we	O
also	O
found	O
mentioned	O
in	O
an	O
almanac	O
made	O
at	O
Mexico	PNM
:	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
tried	O
it	O
but	O
we	O
found	O
no	O
alligators	O
here	O
though	O
there	O
are	O
several	O

There	O
are	O
many	O
good	O
harbours	O
between	O
Sallagua	PNM
and	O
Cape	PNM
Corrientes	PNM
but	O
we	O
passed	O
by	O
them	O
all	O

As	O
we	O
drew	O
near	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
the	O
land	O

This	O

lies	O
in	O
20	O

I	O

I	O

according	O
to	O

and	O
according	O
to	O

Here	O
we	O
had	O
resolved	O
to	O
cruise	O
for	O
the	O
Philippine	O
ship	O
because	O
she	O
always	O
makes	O
this	O
cape	O
in	O
her	O
voyage	O
homeward	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
-RRB-	O
four	O
ships	O
in	O
company	O
;	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
and	O
his	O
tender	O
;	O
Captain	O
Townley	O
and	O
his	O
tender	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
so	O
ordered	O
that	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
should	O
lie	O
eight	O
or	O
ten	O
leagues	O
off	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
rest	O
about	O
a	O
league	O
distant	O
each	O
from	O
other	O
,	O
between	O
him	O
and	O
the	O
cape	O
,	O
that	O
so	O
we	O
might	O
not	O
miss	O
the	O
Philippine	O
ship	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
wanted	O
provision	O
and	O
therefore	O
we	O
sent	O
Captain	O
Townley	O
's	O
bark	O
with	O
50	O
or	O
60	O
men	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
of	O
the	O
cape	O
to	O
search	O
about	O
for	O
some	O
town	O
or	O
plantations	O
where	O
we	O
might	O
get	O
provision	O
of	O
any	O
sort	O
.	O

The	O
rest	O
of	O
us	O
in	O
the	O
meantime	O
cruising	O
in	O
our	O
stations	O
.	O

The	O
17th	O
day	O
the	O
bark	O
came	O
to	O
us	O
again	O
but	O
had	O
got	O
nothing	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
about	O
the	O
cape	O
because	O
the	O
wind	O
on	O
this	O
coast	O
is	O
commonly	O
between	O
the	O
north-west	O
and	O
the	O
south-west	O
,	O
which	O
makes	O
it	O
very	O
difficult	O
getting	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
left	O
four	O
Canoas	O
with	O
46	O
men	O
at	O
the	O
cape	O
,	O
who	O
resolved	O
to	O
row	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
.	O

The	O
18th	O
day	O
we	O
sailed	O
to	O
the	O
keys	O
of	O
Chametly	O
to	O
fill	O
our	O
water	O
.	O

The	O
keys	O
or	O
islands	O
of	O
Chametly	O
are	O
about	O
16	O
or	O
18	O
leagues	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
of	O
Cape	PNM
Corrientes	PNM
.	O

They	O
are	O
small	O
,	O
low	O
,	O
and	O
woody	O
,	O
environed	O
with	O
rocks	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
five	O
of	O
them	O
lying	O
in	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
a	O
half	O
moon	O
,	O
not	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
between	O
them	O
and	O
the	O
Main	O
is	O
very	O
good	O
riding	O
,	O
secure	O
from	O
any	O
wind	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
do	O
report	O
that	O
here	O
live	O
fishermen	O
,	O
to	O
fish	O
for	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
of	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Purification	O

This	O
is	O
said	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
large	O
town	O
,	O
the	O
best	O
hereabouts	O
;	O
but	O
is	O
14	O
leagues	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
.	O

The	O
20th	O
instant	O
we	O
entered	O
within	O
these	O
islands	O
,	O
passing	O
in	O
on	O
the	O
south-east	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
anchored	O
between	O
the	O
islands	O
and	O
the	O
Main	O
in	O
five	O
fathom	O
clean	O
sand	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
found	O
good	O
fresh	O
water	O
and	O
wood	O
,	O
and	O
caught	O
plenty	O
of	O
rock-fish	O
with	O
hook	O
and	O
line	O
,	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
fish	O
I	O
described	O
at	O
the	O
isle	O
of	O
John	PNM
Fernando	PNM
,	O
but	O
we	O
saw	O
no	O
sign	O
of	O
inhabitants	O
besides	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
old	O
huts	O
;	O
therefore	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O
Spanish	O
or	O
Indian	O
fishermen	O
come	O
hither	O
only	O
at	O
Lent	PNM
,	O
or	O
some	O
other	O
such	O
season	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
live	O
here	O
constantly	O

The	O
21st	O
day	O
Captain	O
Townley	O
went	O
away	O
with	O
about	O
60	O
men	O
to	O
take	O
an	O

village	O
seven	O

eight	O

to	O
the	O
westward	O

towards	O
the	O

and	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
we	O
went	O
to	O
cruise	O
off	O
the	O
cape	O
,	O
where	O
Captain	O
Townley	O
was	O
to	O
meet	O
us	O

The	O
24th	O
day	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
cruising	O
off	O
the	O
cape	O
,	O
the	O
four	O
Canoas	O
before	O

,	O
which	O
Captain	O
Townley	O
's	O
bark	O
left	O
at	O
the	O
cape	O
,	O
came	O
off	O
to	O
us	O
.	O

They	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
bark	O
left	O
them	O
,	O
passed	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
of	O
the	O
cape	O
and	O
rowed	O
into	O
the	O
valley	O
Valderas	O
,	O
or	O
perhaps	O
Val	O
d'Iris	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
signifies	O
the	O
valley	O
of	O
Flags	O
.	O

This	O
valley	O
lies	O
in	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
a	O
pretty	O
deep	O
bay	O
that	O
runs	O
in	O
between	O
Cape	PNM

on	O
the	O
south-east	O
and	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
Pontique	PNM
on	O
the	O
north-west	O
,	O
which	O
two	O
places	O
are	O
about	O
10	O
leagues	O
asunder	O
.	O

The	O
valley	O
is	O
about	O
three	O
leagues	O
wide	O
;	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
level	O
sandy	O
bay	O
against	O
the	O
sea	O
and	O
good	O
smooth	O
landing	O

In	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
bay	O
is	O
a	O
fine	O
river	O
whereinto	O
boats	O
may	O
enter	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
brackish	O
at	O
the	O
latter	O
end	O
of	O
the	O

which	O
is	O
in	O
February	O

This	O
valley	O
is	O
bounded	O
within	O
land	O
with	O
a	O
small	O
green	O
hill	O
that	O
makes	O
a	O
very	O
gentle	O
descent	O
into	O
the	O
valley	O
and	O
affords	O
a	O
very	O
pleasant	O
prospect	O
to	O
seaward	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
enriched	O
with	O
fruitful	O
savannahs	O
,	O
mixed	O
with	O
groves	O
of	O
trees	O
fit	O
for	O
any	O
uses	O
,	O
beside	O
fruit-trees	O
in	O
abundance	O
,	O
as	O
guavas	O
,	O
oranges	O
and	O
limes	O
,	O
which	O
here	O
grow	O
wild	O
in	O
such	O
plenty	O
as	O
if	O
nature	O
had	O
designed	O
it	O
only	O
for	O
a	O
garden	O
.	O

The	O
savannahs	O
are	O
full	O
of	O
fat	O
bulls	O
and	O
cows	O
and	O
some	O
horses	O
,	O
but	O
no	O
house	O
in	O
sight	O
.	O

When	O
our	O
Canoas	O
came	O
to	O
this	O
pleasant	O
valley	O
they	O
landed	O
37	O
men	O
and	O
marched	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
seeking	O
for	O
some	O
houses	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
not	O
gone	O
passed	O
three	O
mile	O
before	O
they	O
were	O
attacked	O
by	O
150	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
horse	O
and	O
foot	O
:	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
small	O
thin	O
wood	O
close	O
by	O
them	O
,	O
into	O
which	O
our	O
men	O
retreated	O
to	O
secure	O
themselves	O
from	O
the	O
fury	O
of	O
the	O
horse	O
:	O
yet	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
rode	O
in	O
among	O
them	O
and	O
attacked	O
them	O
very	O
furiously	O
till	O
the	O
Spanish	O
captain	O
and	O
17	O
more	O
tumbled	O
dead	O
off	O
their	O
horses	O
:	O
then	O
the	O
rest	O
retreated	O
,	O
being	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
wounded	O
.	O

We	O
lost	O
four	O
men	O
and	O
had	O
two	O
desperately	O
wounded	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
action	O
the	O
foot	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
armed	O
with	O
lances	O
and	O
swords	O
and	O
were	O
the	O
greatest	O
number	O
,	O
never	O
made	O
any	O
attack	O
;	O
the	O
horsemen	O
had	O
each	O
a	O
brace	O
of	O
pistols	O
and	O
some	O
short	O
guns	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
foot	O
had	O
come	O
in	O
they	O
had	O
certainly	O
destroyed	O
all	O
our	O
men	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
skirmish	O
was	O
over	O
our	O
men	O
placed	O
the	O
two	O
wounded	O
men	O
on	O
horses	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
their	O
Canoas	O
.	O

There	O
they	O
killed	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
horses	O
and	O
dressed	O
it	O
,	O
being	O
afraid	O
to	O
venture	O
into	O
the	O
savannah	O
to	O
kill	O
a	O
bullock	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
there	O
was	O
store	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
had	O
eaten	O
and	O
satisfied	O
themselves	O
they	O
returned	O
aboard	O
.	O

The	O
25th	O
day	O
,	O
being	O
Christmas	O
,	O
we	O
cruised	O
in	O
pretty	O
near	O
the	O
cape	O
and	O
sent	O
in	O
three	O
Canoas	O
with	O
the	O
strikers	O
to	O
get	O
fish	O
,	O
being	O
desirous	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
Christmas	O
dinner	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
they	O
returned	O
aboard	O
with	O
three	O
great	O
jew-fish	O
which	O
feasted	O
us	O
all	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
we	O
sent	O
ashore	O
our	O
Canoas	O
again	O
and	O
got	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
more	O
.	O

Captain	O
Townley	O
,	O
who	O
went	O
from	O
us	O
at	O
Chametly	O
,	O
came	O
aboard	O
the	O
28th	O
day	O
and	O
brought	O
about	O
40	O
bushels	O
of	O
maize	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
landed	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
of	O
Cape	PNM
Corrientes	PNM
and	O
marched	O
to	O
an	O
Indian	O
village	O
that	O
is	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
leagues	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
.	O

The	O
Indians	O
,	O
seeing	O
him	O
coming	O
,	O
set	O
two	O
houses	O
on	O
fire	O
that	O
were	O
full	O
of	O
maize	O
and	O
ran	O
away	O
;	O
yet	O
he	O
and	O
his	O
men	O
got	O
in	O
other	O
houses	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
bring	O
down	O
on	O
their	O
backs	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
brought	O
aboard	O
.	O

1686	O
We	O
cruised	O
off	O
the	O
cape	O
till	O
the	O
first	O
day	O
of	O
January	O
1686	O
and	O
then	O
made	O
towards	O
the	O
valley	O
Valderas	O
to	O
hunt	O
for	O
beef	O
,	O
and	O
before	O
night	O
we	O
anchored	O
in	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
in	O
60	O
fathom	O
water	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
stayed	O
hunting	O
till	O
the	O
7th	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
and	O
Captain	O
Townley	O
went	O
ashore	O
every	O
morning	O
with	O
about	O
240	O
men	O
and	O
marched	O
to	O
a	O
small	O
hill	O
;	O
where	O
they	O
remained	O
with	O
50	O
or	O
60	O
men	O
to	O
watch	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
who	O
appeared	O
in	O
great	O
companies	O
on	O
other	O
hills	O
not	O
far	O
distant	O
but	O
did	O
never	O
attempt	O
anything	O
against	O
our	O
men	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
killed	O
and	O
salted	O
above	O
two	O
months	O
'	O
meat	O
besides	O
what	O
we	O
spent	O
fresh	O
;	O
and	O
might	O
have	O
killed	O
as	O
much	O
more	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
better	O
stored	O
with	O
salt	O
.	O

Our	O
hopes	O
of	O
meeting	O
the	O
Philippine	O
ship	O
were	O
now	O
over	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
did	O
all	O
conclude	O
that	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
necessitated	O
to	O
hunt	O
here	O
for	O
provisions	O
she	O
was	O
passed	O
by	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
,	O
as	O
indeed	O
she	O
was	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
did	O
understand	O
afterwards	O
by	O
prisoners	O
.	O

So	O
this	O
design	O
failed	O
through	O
Captain	O
Townley	O
's	O
eagerness	O
after	O
the	O
Lima	O
ship	O
which	O
he	O
attempted	O
in	O
Acapulco	PNM
Harbour	PNM
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
related	O
.	O

For	O
though	O
we	O
took	O
a	O
little	O
flour	O
hard	O
by	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
same	O
guide	O
which	O
told	O
us	O
of	O
that	O
ship	O
would	O
have	O
conducted	O
us	O
where	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
had	O
store	O
of	O
beef	O
and	O
maize	O
:	O
but	O
instead	O
thereof	O
we	O
lost	O
both	O
our	O
time	O
and	O
the	O
opportunity	O
of	O
providing	O
ourselves	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
we	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
be	O
victualling	O
when	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
cruising	O
off	O
Cape	PNM
Corrientes	PNM
in	O
expectation	O
of	O
the	O
Manila	PNM
ship	O
.	O

Hitherto	O
we	O
had	O
coasted	O
along	O
here	O
with	O
two	O
different	O
designs	O
;	O
the	O
one	O
was	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
Manila	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
have	O
enriched	O
us	O
beyond	O
measure	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
Captain	O
Townley	O
was	O
most	O
for	O

Sir	O
Thomas	O

took	O
the	O

off	O

in	O

-LRB-	O
where	O
we	O
also	O
would	O

which	O
Captain	O

In	O
all	O
this	O

in	O
the	O

when	O
we	O

The	O
14th	O
day	O
we	O
had	O
sight	O
of	O
a	O
small	O
white	O
rock	O
,	O
which	O
appears	O
very	O

On	O
the	O

is	O
an	O
house	O
and	O
an	O
estancia	O
,	O
or	O
farm	O
of	O
large	O

Our	O
men	O
went	O
into	O
the	O
lake	O
and	O
landed	O
and	O
,	O
coming	O
to	O
the	O
house	O
,	O
found	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
bushels	O
of	O
maize	O
:	O
but	O
the	O
cattle	O
were	O
driven	O
away	O
by	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
yet	O
there	O
our	O
men	O
took	O
the	O
owner	O
of	O
the	O
estancia	O
and	O
brought	O
him	O
aboard	O

He	O
said	O
that	O
the	O
beefs	O
were	O
driven	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
for	O
fear	O
we	O
should	O
kill	O
them	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
lay	O
here	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
went	O
into	O
this	O
lake	O
again	O
and	O
landed	O
150	O
men	O
on	O
the	O
north-east	O
side	O
and	O
marched	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
:	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
landing-place	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
entering	O
a	O
dry	O
salina	O
,	O
or	O
salt-pond	O
,	O
they	O
fired	O
at	O
two	O
Indians	O
that	O
crossed	O
the	O
way	O
before	O
them	O
;	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
being	O
wounded	O
in	O
the	O
thigh	O
,	O
fell	O
down	O
and	O
,	O
being	O
examined	O
,	O
he	O
told	O
our	O
men	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
an	O
Indian	O
town	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
leagues	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
way	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
going	O
would	O
bring	O
them	O
thither	O
.	O

While	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
discourse	O
with	O
the	O
Indian	O
they	O
were	O
attacked	O
by	O
100	O
Spanish	O
horsemen	O
who	O
came	O
with	O
a	O
design	O
to	O
scare	O
them	O
back	O
but	O
wanted	O
both	O
arms	O
and	O
hearts	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
passed	O
on	O
from	O
hence	O
and	O
in	O
their	O
way	O
marched	O
through	O
a	O
savannah	O
of	O
long	O
dry	O
grass	O
.	O

This	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
set	O
on	O
fire	O
,	O
thinking	O
to	O
burn	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
did	O
not	O
hinder	O
our	O
men	O
from	O
marching	O
forward	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
did	O
trouble	O
them	O
a	O
little	O
.	O

They	O
rambled	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
guides	O
all	O
this	O
day	O
and	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
next	O
before	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
town	O
the	O
Indian	O
spoke	O
of	O
.	O

There	O
they	O
found	O
a	O
company	O
of	O
Spaniards	O
and	O
Indians	O
who	O
made	O
head	O
against	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
driven	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
town	O
after	O
a	O
short	O
dispute	O
.	O

Here	O
our	O
surgeon	O
and	O
one	O
man	O
more	O
were	O
wounded	O
with	O
arrows	O
but	O
none	O
of	O
the	O
rest	O
were	O
hurt	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
town	O
they	O
found	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
Indians	O
wounded	O
who	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
the	O
town	O
was	O
Massaclan	O
;	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
a	O
few	O
Spaniards	O
living	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
rest	O
were	O
Indians	O
;	O
that	O
five	O
leagues	O
from	O
this	O
town	O
there	O
were	O
two	O
rich	O
gold-mines	O
where	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
of	O
Compostella	PNM
,	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
chiefest	O
town	O
in	O
these	O
parts	O
,	O
kept	O
many	O
slaves	O
and	O
Indians	O
at	O
work	O
for	O
gold	O
.	O

Here	O
our	O
men	O
lay	O
that	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
packed	O
up	O
all	O
the	O
maize	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
find	O
and	O
brought	O
it	O
on	O
their	O
backs	O
to	O
the	O
Canoas	O
and	O
came	O
aboard	O
.	O

We	O
lay	O
here	O
till	O
the	O
2nd	O
of	O
February	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
went	O
away	O
with	O
about	O
80	O
men	O
to	O
the	O
river	O
Rosario	PNM
;	O
where	O
they	O
landed	O
and	O
marched	O
to	O
an	O
Indian	O
town	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
name	O
.	O

They	O
found	O
it	O
about	O
nine	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
it	O
fair	O
and	O
even	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
fine	O
little	O
town	O
of	O
about	O
60	O
or	O
70	O
houses	O
with	O
a	O
fair	O
church	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
chiefly	O
inhabited	O
with	O
Indians	O
,	O
they	O
took	O
prisoners	O
there	O
,	O
which	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
the	O
river	O
Rosario	PNM
is	O
rich	O
in	O
gold	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
mines	O
are	O
not	O
above	O
two	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
town	O
.	O

Captain	O
Swan	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
it	O
convenient	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
mines	O
but	O
made	O
haste	O
aboard	O
with	O
the	O
maize	O
which	O
he	O
took	O
there	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
quantity	O
of	O
about	O
80	O
or	O
90	O
bushels	O
;	O
and	O
which	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
scarcity	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
of	O
provisions	O
,	O
was	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
more	O
valuable	O
than	O
all	O
the	O
gold	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
;	O
and	O
had	O
he	O
gone	O
to	O
the	O
mines	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
would	O
probably	O
have	O
destroyed	O
the	O
corn	O
before	O
his	O
return	O
.	O

The	O
3rd	O
of	O
February	O
we	O
went	O
with	O
our	O
ships	O
also	O
towards	O
the	O
river	O
Rosario	PNM
and	O
anchored	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
against	O
the	O
river	O
's	O
mouth	O
,	O
seven	O
fathom	O
,	O

This	O
river	O
is	O
in	O
latitude	O
22	O

When	O
you	O
are	O
at	O
an	O
anchor	O
against	O
this	O
river	O
you	O
will	O
see	O
a	O
round	O
hill	O

like	O
a	O

a	O
little	O

To	O
the	O

by	O
the	O

The	O
7th	O
day	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
came	O
aboard	O
with	O
the	O
maize	O
which	O
he	O
got	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
but	O
a	O
small	O
quantity	O
for	O
so	O
many	O
men	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
especially	O
considering	O
the	O
place	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
,	O
being	O
strangers	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
no	O
pilots	O
to	O
direct	O
or	O
guide	O
us	O
into	O
any	O
river	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
being	O
without	O
all	O
sort	O
of	O
provision	O
,	O
but	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
get	O
in	O
this	O
manner	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

And	O
though	O
our	O
pilot-book	O
directed	O
us	O
well	O
enough	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
rivers	O
,	O
yet	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
guides	O
to	O
carry	O
us	O
to	O
the	O
settlements	O
we	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
search	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
before	O
we	O
could	O
find	O
a	O
place	O
to	O
land	O
:	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
before	O
,	O
besides	O
the	O
seas	O
being	O
too	O
rough	O
for	O
landing	O
in	O
many	O
places	O
they	O
have	O
neither	O
boat	O

,	O
nor	O
canoa	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
ever	O
see	O

of	O
:	O
and	O
therefore	O
as	O
there	O
are	O
no	O
such	O
landing-places	O
in	O
these	O
rivers	O
as	O
there	O
are	O
in	O
the	O
North	O
Seas	O
so	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
landed	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
which	O
way	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
any	O
town	O
except	O
we	O
accidentally	O
met	O
with	O
a	O
path	O
.	O

Indeed	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
and	O
Indians	O
whom	O
we	O
had	O
aboard	O
knew	O
the	O
names	O
of	O
several	O
rivers	O
and	O
towns	O
near	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
knew	O
the	O

they	O
knew	O
not	O
the	O
way	O

go	O
to	O
them	O
from	O
the	O
sea	O

The	O
8th	O
day	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
sent	O
about	O
40	O
men	O
to	O
seek	O
for	O
the	O
river	O
Oletta	PNM
which	O
is	O
to	O
the	O

The	O
next	O

the	O

having	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
west-north-west	O
and	O
fair	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
our	O
Canoas	O

again	O
to	O
us	O
for	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
find	O
the	O

to	O
the	O
eastward	O

The	O
11th	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
we	O
anchored	O
against	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

The	O
11th	O

Captain	O

sent	O
70	O

in	O
four	O

into	O

the	O

they	O
would	O
find	O
inhabitants	O
before	O
they	O

They	O
spent	O
two	O
days	O
in	O
rowing	O
up	O
and	O
down	O
the	O
creeks	O
and	O
rivers	O
;	O
at	O
last	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
large	O
field	O
of	O
maize	O
which	O
was	O
almost	O
ripe	O
:	O
they	O
immediately	O
fell	O
to	O
gathering	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
and	O
intended	O
to	O
lade	O
the	O
Canoas	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
seeing	O
an	O
Indian	O
that	O
was	O
set	O
to	O
watch	O
the	O
corn	O
,	O
they	O
quitted	O
that	O
troublesome	O

tedious	O
work	O

and	O
seized	O
him	O

brought	O
him	O

He	O
being	O

that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O

four	O

the	O

he	O
was	O

that	O
if	O
we	O

he	O
would	O

Captain	O
Swan	O
immediately	O
ordered	O
his	O

went	O
away	O
with	O
eight	O
Canoas	O
and	O
140	O
men	O
,	O
taking	O
the	O
Indian	O
for	O
their	O

He	O
rowed	O
about	O
five	O

up	O
the	O
river	O

landed	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O

The	O

Captain	O

Captain	O

,	O
fearing	O
the	O

consequence	O
of	O

was	O

the	O

therefore	O
he	O

that	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
being	O
the	O
19th	O
day	O
of	O
February	O
1686	O
,	O
Captain	O

called	O
out	O
his	O

betimes	O
to	O
be	O
gone	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
refused	O
to	O
go	O

said	O
that	O

not	O
leave	O
the	O
town	O
till	O
all	O
the	O
provision	O
was	O
in	O

therefore	O
he	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
yield	O
to	O
them	O
and	O
suffered	O
half	O
the	O
company	O
to	O
go	O
as	O
before	O
:	O
they	O
had	O
now	O
54	O
horses	O
laden	O
,	O
which	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
ordered	O
to	O
be	O
tied	O
one	O
to	O

and	O
the	O
men	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
two	O

,	O
25	O
before	O

and	O
as	O

the	O

would	O
go	O
at	O
their	O
own	O
rate	O
,	O
every	O
man	O
leading	O
his	O
horse	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
observing	O
their	O
manner	O
of	O
marching	O
,	O
had	O
laid	O
an	O
ambush	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
town	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
managed	O
with	O
such	O
success	O
that	O
,	O
falling	O
on	O
our	O
body	O
of	O
men	O
who	O
were	O
guarding	O
the	O
corn	O
to	O
the	O
Canoas	O
,	O
they	O
killed	O
them	O

Captain	O
Swan	O
,	O
hearing	O
the	O
report	O
of	O
their	O
guns	O
,	O
ordered	O
his	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
then	O
in	O
the	O
town	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
to	O
march	O
out	O
to	O
their	O
assistance	O
;	O
but	O
some	O
opposed	O
him	O
,	O
despising	O
their	O
enemies	O
,	O
till	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
'	O
horses	O
that	O
had	O
lost	O
their	O
riders	O
came	O
galloping	O
into	O
the	O
town	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
fright	O
,	O
both	O
bridled	O
and	O
saddled	O
,	O
with	O
each	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
holsters	O
by	O
their	O
sides	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
had	O
a	O
carbine	O
newly	O
discharged	O
;	O
which	O
was	O
an	O
apparent	O
token	O
that	O
our	O
men	O
had	O
been	O
engaged	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
by	O
men	O
better	O
armed	O
than	O
they	O
imagined	O
they	O
should	O
meet	O
with	O
.	O

Therefore	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
immediately	O
marched	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
town	O
and	O
his	O
men	O
all	O
followed	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
the	O
engagement	O
had	O
been	O
he	O
saw	O
all	O
his	O
men	O
that	O
went	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
lying	O
dead	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
stripped	O
and	O
so	O
cut	O
and	O
mangled	O
that	O
he	O
scarce	O
knew	O
one	O
man	O
.	O

Captain	O
Swan	O
had	O
not	O
more	O
men	O
then	O
with	O
him	O
than	O
those	O
were	O
who	O
lay	O
dead	O
before	O
him	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
never	O
came	O
to	O
oppose	O
him	O
but	O
kept	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
is	O
probable	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
had	O
not	O
cut	O
off	O
so	O
many	O
men	O
of	O
ours	O
,	O
but	O
with	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
.	O

So	O
he	O
marched	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
Canoas	O
and	O
came	O
aboard	O
the	O
ship	O
with	O
the	O
maize	O
that	O
was	O
already	O
in	O
the	O
Canoas	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
about	O
50	O
men	O
killed	O
,	O
and	O
among	O
the	O
rest	O
my	O
ingenious	O
friend	O
Mr.	O
Ringrose	O
was	O
one	O
,	O
who	O
wrote	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
History	O
of	O
the	O
Buccaneers	O
which	O
relates	O
to	O
Captain	O
Sharp	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
cape-merchant	O
,	O
or	O
supercargo	O
of	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
's	O
ship	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
no	O
mind	O
to	O
this	O
voyage	O
;	O
but	O
was	O
necessitated	O
to	O
engage	O
in	O
it	O
or	O
starve	O
.	O

This	O
loss	O
discouraged	O
us	O
from	O
attempting	O
anything	O
more	O
hereabouts	O
.	O

Therefore	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
proposed	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Cape	PNM
San	PNM
Lucas	PNM
on	O
California	PNM
to	O
careen	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
two	O
reasons	O
for	O
this	O
:	O
first	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
thought	O
he	O
could	O
lie	O
there	O
secure	O
from	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
and	O
next	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
could	O
get	O
a	O
commerce	O
with	O
the	O
Indians	O
there	O
he	O
might	O
make	O
a	O
discovery	O
in	O
the	O
Lake	O
of	O
California	PNM
,	O
and	O
by	O
their	O
assistance	O
try	O
for	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
plate	O
of	O
New	PNM
Mexico	PNM
.	O

This	O
Lake	O
of	O
California	PNM
-LRB-	O
for	O
so	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
channel	O
or	O
strait	O
,	O
between	O
that	O
and	O
the	O
continent	O
,	O
is	O
called	O
-RRB-	O
is	O
but	O
little	O
known	O
to	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
by	O
what	O
I	O
could	O
ever	O
learn	O
;	O
for	O
their	O
charts	O
do	O
not	O
agree	O
about	O
it	O
.	O

Some	O
of	O
them	O
do	O
make	O
California	PNM
an	O
island	O
,	O
but	O
give	O
no	O
manner	O
of	O
account	O
of	O

Some	O

make	O
California	PNM
to	O

I	O
do	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
do	O
not	O
care	O
to	O
have	O
this	O
lake	O
discovered	O
for	O
fear	O
lest	O

by	O
that	O

We	O
heard	O
that	O
not	O
long	O
before	O
our	O
arrival	O
here	O
the	O
Indians	O
in	O
the	O
province	O
of	O
New	PNM
Mexico	PNM
made	O
an	O
insurrection	O
and	O
destroyed	O
most	O

the	O

there	O

but	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
flying	O
towards	O
the	O
Gulf	O
or	O
Lake	PNM
of	PNM
California	PNM
,	O
made	O
Canoas	O
in	O
that	O

and	O
got	O
safe	O
away	O
;	O
though	O
the	O

seem	O
to	O
be	O
at	O

We	O
had	O
an	O

the	O

this	O

in	O

without	O

have	O
more	O
than	O
they	O
can	O
well	O
manage	O
.	O

I	O
know	O
yet	O
they	O
would	O
lie	O
like	O
the	O
dog	O
in	O
the	O
manger	O
;	O
although	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
eat	O
themselves	O
yet	O
they	O
would	O
endeavour	O
to	O
hinder	O
others	O

But	O
the	O
voyage	O
thither	O
being	O
so	O
far	O
I	O
take	O
that	O
to	O
be	O
one	O
reason	O
that	O
has	O
hindered	O
the	O
discoveries	O
of	O
these	O

it	O
is	O
possible	O
that	O
a	O

may	O
find	O
a	O
nearer	O

hither	O
than	O
we	O
came	O
;	O
I	O
mean	O
by	O
the	O
north-west	O

I	O
know	O
there	O
have	O

divers	O
attempts	O

about	O
a	O
north-west	O
passage	O

all	O
unsuccessful	O
:	O
yet	O
I	O
am	O
of	O
opinion	O
that	O
such	O
a	O
passage	O
may	O
be	O

All	O
our	O

that	O

along	O

But	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
to	O

on	O
this	O

I	O
would	O
go	O

that	O

seek	O
a	O

For	O

of	O

I	O

Captain	O
Wood	O
indeed	O
says	O
this	O
north-east	O
passage	O
is	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
for	O
ice	O
:	O
but	O
how	O
often	O
do	O
we	O
see	O
that	O

over	O
as	O

at	O

those	O

The	O
next	O

after	O
that	O
fatal	O
skirmish	O
near	O
Santa	O
Pecaque	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
ordered	O
all	O
our	O

to	O
be	O
filled	O
and	O
to	O
get	O
ready	O
to	O
sail	O
.	O

The	O
21st	O
day	O
we	O
sailed	O
from	O
hence	O
,	O
directing	O
our	O
course	O
towards	O
California	PNM
:	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
north-west	O
and	O
west-north-west	O
a	O
small	O
gale	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
sea	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
west	O

We	O
passed	O
by	O
three	O
islands	O
called	O
the	O
Marias	PNM
.	O

After	O
we	O
passed	O
these	O
islands	O
we	O
had	O
much	O
wind	O
at	O
north-north-west	O
and	O
north-west	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
north	O
with	O
thick	O

We	O
beat	O
till	O
the	O
6th	O
day	O
of	O
February	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
against	O
a	O
brisk	O
wind	O
and	O
proved	O
labour	O
in	O
vain	O

For	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
within	O
reach	O
of	O
the	O
land	O
trade-wind	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
opposite	O

us	O

but	O
would	O
we	O
go	O
to	O
California	PNM
upon	O
the	O
discovery	O
or	O
otherwise	O
we	O
should	O
bear	O
sixty	O
or	O
seventy	O
leagues	O
off	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
where	O
we	O
should	O
avoid	O
the	O
land-winds	O
and	O
have	O
the	O
benefit	O
of	O
the	O
true	O
easterly	O

therefore	O
that	O
we	O

for	O
the	O

those	O

All	O
round	O

it	O

This	O

baked	O

such	O
was	O
their	O

that	O
he	O
would	O

them	O
out	O

the	O

;	O
for	O
about	O
two-thirds	O

at	O

he	O
gained	O
their	O
consents	O

At	O
our	O
first	O
coming	O
hither	O
we	O
did	O
eat	O
nothing	O

;	O
but	O
after	O
the	O
first	O
two	O

three	O

our	O

saved	O
our	O

Here	O
also	O
we	O

about	O
eighty	O

I	O

my	O
head	O
in	O

I	O
endured	O

half	O

then	O
was	O
taken	O
out	O

laid	O

I	O
did	O
sweat	O
exceedingly	O
while	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
the	O

,	O
and	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
it	O
did	O
me	O
much	O
good	O
for	O
I	O
grew	O
well	O
soon	O

We	O
stayed	O
here	O

the	O
26th	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
both	O
vessels	O
being	O
clean	O
,	O
we	O
sailed	O
to	O
the	O
valley	O
of	O

to	O
water	O

for	O
we	O
could	O
not	O

it	O
here	O
now	O

In	O
the	O
wet	O

indeed	O
here	O
is	O
water	O
enough	O

for	O
the	O
brooks	O
then	O
run	O
down	O
plentifully	O

but	O
now	O
,	O
though	O
there	O
was	O
water	O

yet	O
it	O
was	O
bad	O

it	O

a	O

it	O
from	O
the	O

The	O
28th	O
day	O
we	O
anchored	O
in	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
in	O
the	O
valley	O

but	O
this	O
river	O
was	O
brackish	O
now	O
in	O
the	O
dry	O
season	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
we	O
went	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
leagues	O
nearer	O
Cape	PNM
Corrientes	PNM
and	O
anchored	O
by	O
a	O
small	O

not	O
half	O
a	O

Here	O
our	O

struck	O
nine	O

some	O
we	O
did	O
eat	O

and	O
the	O

and	O
the	O
29th	O
day	O
we	O
filled	O
thirty-two	O
tuns	O
of	O
very	O
good	O
water	O

Having	O
thus	O

of	O
some	O
better	O
success	O
there	O
than	O
we	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
on	O
this	O
little-frequented	O
coast	O
.	O

We	O
came	O
on	O
it	O
full	O
of	O
expectations	O
;	O
for	O
besides	O
the	O
richness	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
and	O
the	O
probability	O
of	O
finding	O
some	O
sea	O
ports	O
worth	O
visiting	O
,	O
we	O
persuaded	O
ourselves	O
that	O
there	O
must	O
needs	O
be	O
shipping	O
and	O
trade	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
Acapulco	PNM
and	O
La	O
Vera	O
Cruz	O
were	O
to	O
the	O
kingdom	O
of	O
Mexico	PNM
what	O
Panama	PNM
and	O
Portobello	PNM
are	O
to	O
that	O
of	O
Peru	PNM
,	O
namely	O
,	O
marts	O
for	O
carrying	O
on	O
a	O
constant	O
commerce	O
between	O
the	O
South	O
and	O
North	PNM
Seas	PNM
,	O
as	O
indeed	O
they	O
are	O
.	O

But	O
whereas	O
we	O
expected	O
that	O
this	O
commerce	O
should	O
be	O
managed	O
by	O
sea	O
we	O
found	O
ourselves	O
mistaken	O
:	O
that	O
of	O
Mexico	PNM
being	O
almost	O
wholly	O
a	O
land	O
trade	O
,	O
and	O
managed	O
more	O
by	O
mules	O
than	O
by	O
ships	O
:	O
so	O
that	O
instead	O
of	O
profit	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
little	O
on	O
this	O
coast	O
besides	O
fatigues	O
,	O
hardships	O
and	O
losses	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
were	O
the	O
more	O
easily	O
induced	O
to	O
try	O
what	O
better	O
fortune	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
in	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
.	O

But	O
to	O
do	O
right	O
to	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
intention	O
to	O
be	O
as	O
a	O
privateer	O
in	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
has	O
often	O
assured	O
me	O
with	O
his	O
own	O
mouth	O
,	O
he	O
resolved	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
first	O
opportunity	O
of	O
returning	O
to	O
England	PNM
:	O
so	O
that	O
he	O
feigned	O
a	O
compliance	O
with	O
some	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
who	O
were	O
bent	O
upon	O
going	O
to	O
cruise	O
at	O
Manila	PNM
,	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
leisure	O
to	O

also	O

most	O

were	O
almost	O

at	O
the	O
thoughts	O

it	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
sixty	O

at	O
a	O

half	O

and	O
no	O

except	O
three	O

and	O
we	O
had	O
a	O

:	O
which	O
is	O
variously	O
set	O
down	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
who	O
have	O
the	O
greatest	O
reason	O
to	O
know	O
best	O
,	O
make	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
between	O
2300	O
and	O
2400	O
leagues	O
;	O
our	O
books	O
also	O
reckon	O
it	O
differently	O
,	O
between	O
90	O
and	O
100	O
degrees	O
,	O
which	O
all	O
comes	O
short	O
indeed	O
of	O
2000	O
leagues	O
;	O
but	O
even	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
voyage	O
enough	O
to	O
frighten	O
us	O
,	O
considering	O
our	O
scanty	O
provisions	O
.	O

Captain	O
Swan	O
,	O
to	O
encourage	O
his	O
men	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
persuaded	O
them	O
that	O
the	O
English	O
books	O
did	O
give	O
the	O
best	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
distance	O
;	O
his	O
reasons	O
were	O
many	O
,	O
although	O
but	O
weak	O
.	O

He	O
urged	O
among	O
the	O
rest	O
that	O
Sir	O
Thomas	O
Cavendish	O
and	O
Sir	O
Francis	O
Drake	O
did	O
run	O
it	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
fifty	O
days	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
question	O
but	O
that	O
our	O
ships	O
were	O
better	O
sailers	O
than	O
those	O
which	O
were	O
built	O
in	O
that	O
age	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
doubt	O
to	O
get	O
there	O
in	O
little	O
more	O
than	O
forty	O
days	O
:	O
this	O
being	O
the	O
best	O
time	O
in	O
the	O
year	O
for	O
breezes	O
,	O
which	O
undoubtedly	O
is	O
the	O
reason	O
that	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
set	O
out	O
from	O
Acapulco	PNM
about	O
this	O
time	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
although	O
they	O
are	O
sixty	O
days	O
in	O
their	O
voyage	O
it	O
is	O
because	O
they	O
are	O
great	O
ships	O
deep	O
laden	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
heavy	O
sailers	O
;	O
besides	O
,	O
they	O
wanting	O
nothing	O
,	O
are	O
in	O
no	O
great	O
haste	O
in	O
their	O
way	O
,	O
but	O
sail	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
their	O
usual	O
caution	O
.	O

And	O
when	O
they	O
come	O
near	O
the	O
island	O
Guam	O
they	O
lie	O
by	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
for	O
a	O
week	O
before	O
they	O
make	O
land	O
.	O

In	O
prudence	O
we	O
also	O
should	O
have	O
contrived	O
to	O
lie	O
by	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
near	O
land	O
,	O
for	O
otherwise	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
run	O
ashore	O
,	O
or	O
have	O
out-sailed	O
the	O
islands	O
and	O
lost	O
sight	O
of	O
them	O
before	O
morning	O
.	O

But	O
our	O
bold	O
adventurers	O
seldom	O
proceed	O
with	O
such	O
wariness	O
when	O
in	O
any	O
straits	O
.	O

But	O
of	O
all	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
's	O
arguments	O
that	O
which	O
prevailed	O
most	O
with	O
them	O
was	O
his	O
promising	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
to	O
cruise	O
off	O
the	O
Manilas	O
.	O

So	O
he	O
and	O
his	O
men	O
being	O
now	O
agreed	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
encouraged	O
with	O
the	O
hope	O
of	O
gain	O
,	O
which	O
works	O
its	O
way	O
through	O
all	O
difficulties	O
,	O
we	O
set	O
out	O
from	O
Cape	PNM
Corrientes	PNM
March	O
the	O
31st	O
1686	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
two	O
ships	O
in	O
company	O
,	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
's	O
ship	O
and	O
a	O
bark	O
commanded	O
under	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
by	O
Captain	O
Teat	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
150	O
men	O
,	O
100	O
aboard	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
50	O
aboard	O
the	O
bark	O
,	O
besides	O
slaves	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
small	O
land-wind	O
at	O
east-north-east	O
which	O
carried	O
us	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
leagues	O
,	O
then	O
the	O
sea-wind	O
came	O
at	O
west-north-west	O
a	O
fresh	O
gale	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
steered	O
away	O
south-west	O
.	O

By	O
six	O
a	O
clock	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
we	O
were	O
about	O
nine	O
leagues	O
south-west	O
from	O
the	O
cape	O
,	O
then	O
we	O
met	O
a	O
land-wind	O
which	O
blew	O
fresh	O
all	O
night	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
about	O
10	O
a	O
clock	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
sea-breeze	O
at	O
north-north-east	O
so	O
that	O
at	O
noon	O
we	O
were	O
thirty	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
cape	O
.	O

It	O
blew	O
a	O
fresh	O
gale	O
of	O
wind	O
which	O
carried	O
us	O
off	O
into	O
the	O
true	O
trade-wind	O
-LRB-	O
of	O
the	O
difference	O
of	O
which	O
trade-winds	O
I	O
shall	O
speak	O
in	O
the	O
Chapter	O
of	O
Winds	O
in	O
the	O
Appendix	O
-RRB-	O
for	O
although	O
the	O
constant	O
sea-breeze	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
is	O
at	O
west-north-west	O
yet	O
the	O
true	O
trade	O
off	O
at	O
sea	O

when	O
you	O
are	O
clear	O
of	O
the	O
land-winds	O
,	O
is	O
at	O
east-north-east	O
.	O

At	O
first	O
we	O
had	O
it	O
at	O
north-north-east	O
so	O
it	O
came	O
about	O
northerly	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
to	O
the	O
east	O
as	O
we	O
ran	O
off	O
.	O

At	O
250	O
leagues	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
we	O
had	O
it	O
at	O
east-north-east	O
and	O
there	O
it	O
stood	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
within	O
forty	O
leagues	O
of	O
Guam	PNM
.	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
eaten	O
up	O
our	O
three	O
meals	O
of	O
salted	O
jew-fish	O
in	O
so	O
many	O
days	O
time	O
we	O
had	O
nothing	O
but	O
our	O
small	O
allowance	O
of	O
maize	O
.	O

After	O
the	O
31st	O
day	O
of	O
March	O
we	O
made	O
great	O
runs	O
every	O
day	O
,	O
having	O
very	O
fair	O
clear	O
weather	O
and	O
a	O
fresh	O
trade-wind	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
made	O
use	O
of	O
with	O
all	O
our	O
sails	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
made	O
many	O
good	O
observations	O
of	O
the	O
sun	O
.	O

At	O
our	O
first	O
setting	O
out	O
we	O
steered	O
into	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
13	O
degrees	O
which	O
is	O
near	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
Guam	PNM
;	O
then	O
we	O
steered	O
west	O
,	O
keeping	O
in	O
that	O
latitude	O
.	O

By	O
that	O
time	O
we	O
had	O
sailed	O
twenty	O
days	O
,	O
our	O

such	O
great	O
runs	O

and	O
the	O
wind	O
like	O
to	O
continue	O

repined	O
because	O
they	O
were	O
kept	O
at	O
such	O
short	O
allowance	O

Captain	O
Swan	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
persuade	O
them	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
little	O
patience	O
;	O
yet	O
nothing	O
but	O
an	O
augmentation	O
of	O
their	O
daily	O
allowance	O
would	O
appease	O
them	O
.	O

Captain	O

,	O
though	O
with	O
much	O
reluctance	O

gave	O
way	O
to	O
a	O
small	O
enlargement	O
of	O
our	O
commons	O

for	O

we	O

once	O
a	O

before	O
we	O
had	O

eight	O
:	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
that	O
this	O
short	O
allowance	O
did	O
me	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
good	O
,	O
though	O
others	O
were	O
weakened	O
by	O
it	O

I	O
found	O
that	O
my	O
strength	O
increased	O

my	O

Yet	O
I	O
drank	O
three	O

every	O
twenty-four	O

;	O
but	O
many	O
of	O
our	O

nine	O

boobies	O
which	O

were	O

of	O

not	O

had	O
run	O
the	O
1900	O
leagues	O
by	O
our	O
reckoning	O
which	O
made	O
the	O
English	O
account	O

the	O
men	O
began	O
to	O
murmur	O
against	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
for	O
persuading	O
them	O
to	O
come	O
this	O
voyage	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
gave	O
them	O
fair	O
words	O
and	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
the	O
Spanish	O
account	O
might	O
probably	O
be	O
the	O
truest	O
and	O
,	O
seeing	O
the	O
gale	O
was	O
likely	O
to	O
continue	O
,	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
longer	O
would	O
end	O
our	O
troubles	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
drew	O
nigh	O
the	O
island	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
some	O
small	O
rain	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
clouds	O
settling	O
in	O
the	O
west	O
were	O
an	O
apparent	O
token	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
far	O
from	O
land	O
;	O
for	O
in	O
these	O
climates	O
,	O
between	O
or	O
near	O
the	O
tropics	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
trade-wind	O
blows	O
constantly	O
,	O
the	O
clouds	O
which	O
fly	O
swift	O
overhead	O
,	O
yet	O
seem	O
near	O
the	O
limb	O
of	O
the	O
horizon	O
to	O
hang	O
without	O
much	O
motion	O
or	O
alteration	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
land	O
is	O
near	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
often	O
taken	O
notice	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
especially	O
if	O
it	O
is	O
high	O
land	O
,	O
for	O
you	O

then	O
have	O
the	O

about	O

The	O
20th	O
day	O
of	O
May	O
,	O
our	O
bark	O
being	O
about	O
three	O
leagues	O
ahead	O
of	O
our	O
ship	O
,	O
sailed	O
over	O
a	O
rocky	O
shoal	O
on	O
which	O
there	O
was	O
but	O
four	O
fathom	O
water	O
and	O
abundance	O
of	O
fish	O
swimming	O
about	O
the	O
rocks	O
.	O

They	O
imagined	O
by	O
this	O
that	O
the	O
land	O
was	O
not	O
far	O
off	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
clapped	O
on	O
a	O
wind	O
with	O
the	O
bark	O
's	O
head	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
and	O
,	O
being	O
past	O
the	O
shoal	O
,	O
lay	O
by	O
for	O
us	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
up	O
with	O
them	O
Captain	O
Teat	O
came	O
aboard	O
us	O
and	O
related	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
seen	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
then	O
in	O
latitude	O
12	O
degrees	O
55	O
minutes	O
steering	O
west	O
.	O

The	O
island	O
Guam	O
is	O
laid	O
down	O
in	O
latitude	O
13	O
degrees	O
north	O
by	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
who	O
are	O
masters	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
keeping	O
it	O
as	O
a	O
baiting-place	O
as	O
they	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
Philippine	PNM
Islands	PNM
.	O

Therefore	O
we	O
clapped	O
on	O
a	O
wind	O
and	O
stood	O
to	O
northward	O
,	O
being	O
somewhat	O
troubled	O
and	O
doubtful	O
whether	O
we	O
were	O
right	O
,	O
because	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
shoal	O
laid	O
down	O
in	O
the	O
Spanish	O
charts	O
about	O
the	O
island	O
Guam	O
.	O

At	O
four	O
a	O
clock	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
joy	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
island	O
Guam	O
at	O
about	O
eight	O
leagues	O
distance	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
well	O
for	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
that	O
we	O
got	O
sight	O
of	O
it	O
before	O
our	O
provision	O
was	O
spent	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
but	O
enough	O
for	O
three	O
days	O
more	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
afterwards	O
informed	O
,	O
the	O
men	O
had	O
contrived	O
first	O
to	O
kill	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
and	O
eat	O
him	O
when	O
the	O
victuals	O
was	O
gone	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
him	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
who	O
were	O
accessory	O
in	O
promoting	O
the	O
undertaking	O
this	O
voyage	O
.	O

This	O
made	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
say	O
to	O
me	O
after	O
our	O
arrival	O
at	O
Guam	PNM
,	O
``	O
Ah	O

I	O

wind	O
was	O
at	O
east-north-east	O
and	O
the	O
land	O
bore	O
at	O

Therefore	O
we	O
stood	O
to	O

we	O

but	O
as	O
the	O
nut	O
grows	O
towards	O
its	O

the	O

begins	O
to	O
gather	O
and	O
settle	O
round	O
on	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

and	O
is	O
soft	O

as	O
the	O
nut	O
ripens	O
it	O
increases	O
in	O

The	O

is	O
sweet	O

while	O
it	O
is	O
young	O

will	O
eat	O
it	O

the	O

When	O
these	O

the	O
outside	O

so	O
that	O
one	O
would	O
think	O
that	O
they	O

yet	O
they	O
will	O
sprout	O

By	O
this	O

the	O
nut	O
that	O
was	O
hard	O
begins	O
to	O
grow	O
oily	O

thereby	O
giving	O
passage	O
to	O
the	O
sprout	O
that	O
springs	O
from	O
the	O
apple	O

which	O
nature	O
has	O
so	O
contrived	O
that	O
it	O

You	O
may	O

a	O
half	O

Beside	O
the	O

also	O
a	O
sort	O

Those	O
that	O

a	O
spirit	O
from	O
the	O

Arak	O
is	O
distilled	O

from	O
rice	O

other	O
things	O
in	O
the	O

;	O
but	O
none	O
is	O
so	O

esteemed	O
for	O
making	O

or	O
the	O

but	O
it	O
must	O
have	O
a	O
dash	O
of	O

This	O

The	O
way	O
of	O
drawing	O
the	O
toddy	O
from	O
the	O
tree	O
is	O
by	O
cutting	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
a	O
branch	O
that	O
would	O
bear	O
nuts	O
but	O
before	O
it	O

;	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
the	O
liquor	O
which	O
was	O
to	O
feed	O
its	O
fruit	O
distils	O
into	O
the	O
hole	O
of	O
a	O
calabash	O
that	O
is	O
hung	O
upon	O
it	O

This	O
branch	O
continues	O
running	O
almost	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
the	O
fruit	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
growing	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
it	O
dries	O
away	O
.	O

The	O
tree	O
has	O
usually	O
three	O
fruitful	O
branches	O
which	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
be	O
all	O
tapped	O
thus	O
,	O
then	O
the	O
tree	O
bears	O
no	O
fruit	O
that	O
year	O
;	O
but	O
if	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
only	O
be	O
tapped	O
the	O

will	O
bear	O
fruit	O
all	O
the	O

The	O
liquor	O
which	O
is	O
thus	O
drawn	O
is	O
emptied	O
out	O

the	O
calabash	O
duly	O
morning	O

in	O

,	O
and	O
great	O
gain	O
is	O
produced	O
from	O
it	O
even	O
this	O
way	O
;	O
but	O
those	O
that	O

it	O
and	O
make	O
arak	O
reap	O
the	O
greatest	O
profit	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
also	O
great	O
profit	O
made	O
of	O
the	O

both	O
of	O
the	O

The	O
kernel	O
is	O
much	O
used	O
in	O
making	O

When	O
the	O

dry	O
they	O
take	O
off	O
the	O
husk	O

giving	O
two	O

letting	O
the	O

But	O
the	O

to	O
make	O
oil	O

but	O
the	O
nuts	O
that	O

ought	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
long	O

gathered	O
so	O
as	O
that	O
the	O

may	O
be	O
turning	O
soft	O

I	O

I	O
have	O
been	O

a	O

The	O
bread-fruit	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
we	O
call	O
it	O
-RRB-	O
grows	O
on	O
a	O
large	O

It	O
has	O
a	O
spreading	O
head	O
full	O
of	O
branches	O

and	O
dark	O

The	O
fruit	O
grows	O
on	O
the	O
boughs	O
like	O
apples	O
:	O
it	O
is	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
a	O
penny	O
loaf	O
when	O
wheat	O
is	O
at	O
five	O
shillings	O

It	O
is	O
of	O
a	O
round	O
shape	O

has	O
a	O
thick	O

When	O
the	O
fruit	O
is	O
ripe	O
it	O
is	O
yellow	O
and	O
soft	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
taste	O
is	O
sweet	O
and	O
pleasant	O

The	O
natives	O
of	O
this	O
island	O
use	O
it	O
for	O
bread	O
:	O
they	O
gather	O
it	O
when	O
full	O
grown	O
while	O
it	O
is	O
green	O
and	O
hard	O
;	O
then	O
they	O
bake	O
it	O
in	O
an	O
oven	O
,	O
which	O
scorches	O
the	O
rind	O
and	O
makes	O
it	O
black	O
:	O
but	O
they	O
scrape	O
off	O
the	O
outside	O
black	O
crust	O
and	O
there	O
remains	O
a	O
tender	O
thin	O
crust	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
inside	O
is	O
soft	O
,	O
tender	O
,	O
and	O
white	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
crumb	O
of	O
a	O
penny	O
loaf	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
neither	O
seed	O
nor	O
stone	O
in	O
the	O
inside	O
,	O
but	O
all	O
is	O
of	O
a	O
pure	O
substance	O
like	O
bread	O
:	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
eaten	O
new	O
for	O
if	O
it	O
is	O
kept	O
above	O
24	O
hours	O
it	O
becomes	O
dry	O
and	O
eats	O
harsh	O
and	O
choky	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
pleasant	O
before	O
it	O
is	O
too	O
stale	O
.	O

This	O
fruit	O
lasts	O
in	O
season	O
eight	O
months	O
in	O
the	O
year	O
during	O
which	O
time	O
the	O

eat	O
no	O

I	O
did	O
never	O

of	O
this	O
fruit	O
anywhere	O
but	O
here	O
.	O

The	O
natives	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
there	O

on	O
the	O

,	O
the	O
island	O

of	O
a	O

therefore	O
not	O
very	O

them	O
is	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
great	O
boat	O
upright	O
from	O
oversetting	O
;	O
because	O
the	O
wind	O
here	O
being	O
in	O
a	O
manner	O
constantly	O
east	O
-LRB-	O
or	O
if	O
it	O
were	O
at	O
west	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
-RRB-	O
and	O
the	O
range	O
of	O
these	O
islands	O
,	O
where	O
their	O
business	O
lies	O
to	O
and	O
fro	O
,	O
being	O
mostly	O
north	O
and	O
south	O
,	O
they	O
turn	O
the	O
flat	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
against	O
the	O
wind	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
they	O
sail	O

and	O
the	O
belly-side	O
,	O
consequently	O
with	O
its	O
little	O
boat	O

is	O
upon	O

and	O
the	O
vessel	O
having	O
a	O
head	O
at	O
each	O
end	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
sail	O
with	O
either	O
of	O
them	O
foremost	O
-LRB-	O
indifferently	O
-RRB-	O
they	O
need	O
not	O
tack	O
or	O
go	O
about	O
,	O
as	O
all	O
our	O
vessels	O
do	O
,	O
but	O
each	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
serves	O
either	O
for	O
head	O
or	O
stern	O
as	O
they	O
please	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
ply	O
to	O
windward	O
and	O
are	O
minded	O
to	O
go	O
about	O
he	O
that	O
steers	O
bears	O
away	O
a	O
little	O
from	O
the	O
wind	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
means	O
the	O
stern	O
comes	O
to	O
the	O
wind	O
;	O
which	O
is	O
now	O
become	O
the	O
head	O
,	O
only	O
by	O
shifting	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
yard	O

This	O
boat	O
is	O
steered	O
with	O
a	O
broad	O
paddle	O
instead	O
of	O
a	O
rudder	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
the	O
more	O
particular	O
in	O
describing	O
these	O
boats	O
because	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
they	O
sail	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
any	O
boats	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

I	O
did	O
here	O
for	O
my	O
own	O
satisfaction	O
try	O
the	O
swiftness	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
sailing	O
by	O
our	O
log	O
we	O
had	O
12	O
knots	O
on	O
our	O
reel	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
run	O
it	O
all	O
out	O
before	O
the	O
half	O
minute-glass	O
was	O
half	O
out	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
no	O
more	O
,	O
is	O
after	O
the	O
rate	O
of	O
12	O
mile	O
an	O
hour	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
she	O
would	O
have	O
run	O
24	O
mile	O
an	O
hour	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
very	O
pleasant	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
little	O
boat	O
running	O
along	O
so	O
swift	O
by	O
the	O
other	O
's	O
side	O
.	O

The	O
native	O
Indians	O
are	O
no	O
less	O
dextrous	O
in	O
managing	O
than	O
in	O
building	O
these	O
boats	O
.	O

By	O
report	O
they	O
will	O
go	O
from	O
hence	O
to	O
another	O
of	O
the	O
Ladrone	PNM
Islands	PNM
about	O
30	O
leagues	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
do	O
their	O
business	O
and	O
return	O
again	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
12	O
hours	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
told	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
boats	O
was	O
sent	O
express	O
to	O
Manila	PNM
,	O
which	O
is	O
above	O
400	O
leagues	O
,	O
and	O
performed	O
the	O
voyage	O
in	O
four	O
days	O
'	O
time	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
of	O
these	O
proas	O
or	O
boats	O
used	O
in	O
many	O
places	O
of	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
but	O
with	O
a	O
belly	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
boat	O
on	O
each	O
side	O
.	O

Only	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM
I	O
saw	O
one	O
like	O
these	O
with	O
the	O
belly	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
boat	O
only	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
flat	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
so	O
neatly	O
built	O
.	O

The	O
Indians	O
of	O
Guam	O
have	O
neat	O
little	O
houses	O
,	O
very	O
handsomely	O
thatched	O
with	O
palmetto-thatch	O
.	O

They	O
inhabit	O
together	O
in	O
villages	O
built	O
by	O
the	O
sea	O
on	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
have	O
Spanish	O
priests	O
to	O
instruct	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
Christian	O
religion	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
have	O
a	O
small	O
fort	O
on	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
near	O
the	O
south	O
end	O
,	O
with	O
six	O
guns	O
in	O
it	O

There	O
is	O
a	O
governor	O
,	O
and	O
20	O
or	O
30	O
Spanish	O
soldiers	O

There	O
are	O
no	O
more	O
Spaniards	O
on	O
this	O
island	O
beside	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
priests	O
.	O

Not	O
long	O
before	O
we	O
arrived	O
here	O
the	O
natives	O
rose	O
on	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
to	O
destroy	O
them	O
and	O
did	O
kill	O
many	O
:	O
but	O
the	O
governor	O
with	O
his	O
soldiers	O
at	O
length	O
prevailed	O
and	O
drove	O
them	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
fort	O
:	O
so	O
when	O
they	O
found	O
themselves	O
disappointed	O
of	O
their	O
intent	O
they	O
destroyed	O
the	O
plantations	O
and	O
stock	O
and	O
then	O
went	O
away	O
to	O
other	O
islands	O
:	O
there	O
were	O
then	O
three	O
or	O
400	O
Indians	O
on	O
this	O
island	O
;	O
but	O
now	O
there	O
are	O
not	O
above	O
100	O
;	O
for	O
all	O
that	O
were	O
in	O
this	O
conspiracy	O
went	O
away	O
.	O

As	O
for	O
these	O
who	O
yet	O
remain	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
actually	O
concerned	O
in	O
that	O
broil	O
yet	O
their	O
hearts	O
also	O
are	O
bent	O
against	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
:	O
for	O
they	O
offered	O
to	O
carry	O
us	O
to	O
the	O
fort	O
and	O
assist	O
us	O
in	O
the	O
conquest	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
but	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
was	O
not	O
for	O
molesting	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
here	O
.	O

Before	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
here	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
priests	O
came	O
aboard	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
with	O
three	O
Indians	O
.	O

They	O
first	O
hailed	O
us	O
to	O
know	O
from	O
whence	O
we	O
came	O
and	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
:	O
to	O
whom	O
answer	O
was	O
made	O
in	O
Spanish	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
Spaniards	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
came	O
from	O
Acapulco	PNM
.	O

It	O
being	O
dark	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
see	O
the	O
make	O
of	O
our	O
ship	O
nor	O
very	O
well	O
discern	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
:	O
therefore	O
we	O
came	O
aboard	O
but	O
,	O
perceiving	O
the	O
mistake	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
in	O
taking	O
us	O
for	O
a	O
Spanish	O
ship	O
they	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
get	O
from	O
us	O
again	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
held	O
their	O
boat	O
fast	O
and	O
made	O
them	O
come	O
in	O
.	O

Captain	O
Swan	O
received	O
the	O
priest	O
with	O
much	O
civility	O
and	O
,	O
conducting	O
him	O
into	O
the	O
great	O
cabin	O
,	O
declared	O
that	O
the	O
reason	O
of	O
our	O
coming	O
to	O
this	O
island	O
was	O
want	O
of	O
provision	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
came	O
not	O
in	O
any	O
hostile	O
manner	O
but	O
as	O
a	O
friend	O
to	O
purchase	O
with	O
his	O
money	O
what	O
he	O
wanted	O
:	O
and	O
therefore	O
desired	O
the	O
priest	O
to	O
write	O
a	O
letter	O
to	O
the	O
governor	O
to	O
inform	O
him	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
and	O
on	O
what	O
account	O
we	O
came	O
.	O

For	O
,	O
having	O
him	O
now	O
aboard	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
was	O
willing	O
to	O
detain	O
him	O
as	O
an	O
hostage	O
till	O
we	O
had	O
provision	O
.	O

The	O
padre	O
told	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
that	O
provision	O
was	O
now	O
scarce	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
but	O
he	O
would	O
engage	O
that	O
the	O
governor	O
would	O
do	O
his	O
utmost	O
to	O
furnish	O
us	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
morning	O
the	O
Indians	O
in	O
whose	O
boat	O
or	O
proa	O
the	O
friar	O
came	O
aboard	O
were	O
sent	O
to	O
the	O
governor	O
with	O
two	O
letters	O
;	O
one	O
from	O
the	O
friar	O
,	O
and	O
another	O
very	O
obliging	O
one	O
from	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
present	O
of	O
four	O
yards	O
of	O
scarlet	O
cloth	O
and	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
broad	O
silver	O
and	O
gold	O
lace	O
.	O

The	O
governor	O
lives	O
near	O
the	O
south	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
on	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
;	O
which	O
was	O
about	O
five	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
;	O
therefore	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
expect	O
an	O
answer	O
till	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
not	O
knowing	O
then	O
how	O
nimble	O
they	O
were	O
.	O

Therefore	O
when	O
the	O
Indian	O
canoa	O
was	O
dispatched	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
governor	O
we	O
hoisted	O
out	O
two	O
of	O
our	O
Canoas	O
,	O
and	O
sent	O
one	O
a-fishing	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
ashore	O
for	O
coconuts	O
.	O

Our	O
fishing	O
canoa	O
got	O
nothing	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
men	O
that	O
went	O
ashore	O
for	O
coconuts	O
came	O
off	O
laden	O
.	O

About	O
11	O
a	O
clock	O
that	O
same	O
morning	O
the	O
governor	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
sent	O
a	O
letter	O
to	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
,	O
complimenting	O
him	O
for	O
his	O
present	O
and	O
promising	O
to	O
support	O
us	O
with	O
as	O
much	O
provision	O
as	O
he	O
could	O
possibly	O
spare	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
a	O
token	O
of	O
his	O
gratitude	O
he	O
sent	O
a	O
present	O
of	O
six	O
hogs	O
,	O
of	O
a	O
small	O
sort	O
,	O
most	O
excellent	O
meat	O
,	O
the	O
best	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
that	O
ever	O
I	O
ate	O
:	O
they	O
are	O
fed	O
with	O
coconuts	O
and	O
their	O
flesh	O
is	O
as	O
hard	O
as	O
brisket-beef	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
doubtless	O
of	O
that	O
breed	O
in	O
America	O
which	O
came	O
originally	O
from	O
Spain	PNM
.	O

He	O
sent	O
also	O
12	O
musk-melons	O
,	O
larger	O
than	O
ours	O
in	O
England	PNM
,	O
and	O
as	O
many	O
watermelons	O
,	O
both	O
sorts	O
here	O
being	O
a	O
very	O
excellent	O
fruit	O
;	O
and	O
sent	O
an	O
order	O
to	O
the	O
Indians	O
that	O
lived	O
in	O
a	O
village	O
not	O
far	O
from	O
our	O
ship	O
to	O
bake	O
every	O
day	O
as	O
much	O
of	O
the	O
bread-fruit	O
as	O
we	O
did	O
desire	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
assist	O
us	O
in	O
getting	O
as	O
many	O
dry	O
coconuts	O
as	O
we	O
would	O
have	O
;	O
which	O
they	O
accordingly	O
did	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
off	O
the	O
bread-fruit	O
every	O
day	O
hot	O
,	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
eat	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
the	O
governor	O
sent	O
every	O
day	O
a	O
canoa	O
or	O
two	O
with	O
hogs	O
and	O
fruit	O
and	O
desired	O
for	O
the	O
same	O
powder	O
,	O
shot	O
,	O
and	O
arms	O
;	O
which	O
were	O
sent	O
according	O
to	O
his	O
request	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
delicate	O
large	O
English	O
dog	O
which	O
the	O
governor	O
did	O
desire	O
and	O
had	O
it	O
given	O
him	O
very	O
freely	O
by	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
though	O
much	O
against	O
the	O
grain	O
of	O
many	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
value	O
for	O
that	O
dog	O
.	O

Captain	O
Swan	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
get	O
this	O
governor	O
's	O
letter	O
of	O
recommendation	O
to	O
some	O
merchants	O
at	O
Manila	PNM
,	O
for	O
he	O
had	O
then	O
a	O
design	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Fort	PNM
St.	PNM
George	PNM
,	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
intended	O
to	O
trade	O
to	O
Manila	PNM
:	O
but	O
this	O
his	O
design	O
was	O
concealed	O
from	O
the	O
company	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
lay	O
here	O
the	O
Acapulco	O
ship	O
arrived	O
in	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
come	O
in	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
us	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
governor	O
sent	O
an	O
Indian	O
proa	O
with	O
advice	O
of	O
our	O
being	O
here	O
.	O

Therefore	O
she	O
stood	O
off	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
and	O
,	O
coming	O
foul	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
shoal	O
that	O
our	O
bark	O
had	O
run	O
over	O
before	O
,	O
was	O
in	O
great	O
danger	O
of	O
being	O
lost	O
there	O
,	O
for	O
she	O
struck	O
off	O
her	O
rudder	O
and	O
with	O
much	O
ado	O
got	O
clear	O
;	O
but	O
not	O
till	O
after	O
three	O
days	O

For	O
though	O
the	O
shoal	O

so	O
near	O
the	O

This	O
their	O

were	O
on	O

that	O
the	O

took	O
his	O

the	O

While	O
we	O
lay	O
at	O

we	O
took	O
up	O
a	O
resolution	O
of	O
going	O
to	O
Mindanao	PNM
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Philippine	O
Islands	O
,	O
being	O
told	O
by	O
the	O
friar	O
and	O
others	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
exceedingly	O
well	O
stored	O
with	O
provisions	O
;	O
that	O
the	O
natives	O
were	O
Mohammedans	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
formerly	O
a	O
commerce	O
with	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
now	O
they	O
were	O
at	O
wars	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

This	O
island	O
was	O
therefore	O
thought	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
convenient	O
place	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
go	O
;	O
for	O
besides	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
our	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
,	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
resolved	O
to	O
visit	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
westerly	O
monsoon	O
was	O
at	O
hand	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
oblige	O
us	O
to	O
shelter	O
somewhere	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
expect	O
good	O
harbours	O
in	O
a	O
better	O
place	O
than	O
in	O
so	O
large	O
an	O
island	O
as	O
Mindanao	PNM
:	O
besides	O
all	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
of	O
Mindanao	PNM
being	O
then	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
told	O
-LRB-	O
though	O
falsely	O
-RRB-	O
at	O
wars	O
with	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
it	O
should	O
seem	O
were	O
very	O
squeamish	O
of	O
plundering	O
without	O
licence	O
,	O
derived	O
hopes	O
from	O
thence	O
of	O
getting	O
a	O
commission	O
there	O
from	O
the	O
prince	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
to	O
plunder	O
the	O
Spanish	O
ships	O
about	O
Manila	PNM
,	O
and	O
so	O
to	O
make	O
Mindanao	O
their	O
common	O
rendezvous	O
.	O

And	O
if	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
was	O
minded	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
an	O
English	O
port	O
yet	O
his	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
thought	O
he	O
intended	O
to	O
leave	O
them	O
,	O
hoped	O
to	O
get	O
vessels	O
and	O
pilots	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM
fit	O
for	O
their	O
turn	O
,	O
to	O
cruise	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Manila	PNM
.	O

As	O
for	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
he	O
was	O
willing	O
enough	O
to	O
go	O
thither	O
as	O
best	O
suiting	O
his	O
own	O
design	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
this	O
voyage	O
was	O
concluded	O
on	O
by	O
general	O
consent	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
June	O
2nd	O
1686	O
we	O
left	O
Guam	O
bound	O
for	O
Mindanao	PNM
.	O

We	O
had	O
fair	O
weather	O
and	O
a	O
pretty	O
smart	O
gale	O
of	O
wind	O
at	O
east	O
for	O
3	O
or	O
4	O
days	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
it	O
shifted	O
to	O
the	O
south-west	O
being	O
rainy	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
soon	O
came	O
about	O
again	O
to	O
the	O
east	O
and	O
blew	O
a	O
gentle	O
gale	O
;	O
yet	O
it	O
often	O
shuffled	O
about	O
to	O
the	O
south-east	O
.	O

For	O
though	O
in	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
the	O
winds	O
shift	O
in	O
April	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
found	O
this	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
shifting	O
season	O
for	O
the	O
winds	O
here	O
;	O
the	O
other	O

season	O
being	O
in	O
October	O
,	O
sooner	O
or	O
later	O
,	O
all	O
over	O
India	O
.	O

As	O
to	O
our	O
course	O
from	O
Guam	PNM
to	O
the	O
Philippine	O
Islands	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
I	O
intimated	O
before	O
-RRB-	O
agreeable	O
enough	O
with	O
the	O
account	O
of	O
our	O
common	O
charts	O
.	O

The	O
21st	O
day	O
of	O
June	O
we	O
arrived	O
at	O
the	O
island	O
St.	PNM
John	PNM
,	O
which	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Philippine	PNM
Islands	PNM
.	O

The	O
Philippines	O
are	O
a	O
great	O
company	O
of	O
large	O
islands	O
,	O
taking	O
up	O
about	O
13	O
degrees	O
of	O
latitude	O
in	O
length	O
,	O
reaching	O
near	O
upon	O
from	O
3	O
degrees	O
of	O
north	O
latitude	O
to	O
the	O
19th	O
degree	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
breadth	O
about	O
6	O
degrees	O
of	O
longitude	O
.	O

They	O
derive	O
this	O
name	O
from	O
Phillip	O
II	O
,	O
King	O
of	O
Spain	PNM
;	O
and	O
even	O
now	O
do	O
they	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
belong	O
to	O
that	O
crown	O
.	O

The	O
chiefest	O
island	O
in	O
this	O
range	O
is	O
Luconia	PNM
,	O
which	O
lies	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
of	O
them	O
all	O
.	O

At	O
this	O
island	O
Magellan	O
died	O
on	O
the	O
voyage	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
making	O
round	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

For	O
after	O
he	O
had	O
passed	O
those	O
straits	O
between	O
the	O
south	O
end	O
of	O
America	PNM
and	O
Tierra	PNM
del	PNM
Fuego	PNM
which	O
now	O
bear	O
his	O
name	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
ranged	O
down	O
in	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
on	O
the	O
back	O
of	O
America	PNM
;	O
from	O
thence	O
stretching	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
,	O
he	O
fell	O
in	O
with	O
the	O
Ladrone	O
Islands	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
,	O
steering	O
east	O
still	O
,	O
he	O
fell	O
in	O
with	O
these	O
Philippine	O
Islands	O
and	O
anchored	O
at	O
Luconia	PNM
;	O
where	O
he	O
warred	O
with	O
the	O
native	O
Indians	O
to	O
bring	O
them	O
in	O
obedience	O
to	O
his	O
master	O
the	O
king	O
of	O
Spain	PNM
,	O
and	O
was	O
by	O
them	O
killed	O
with	O
a	O
poisoned	O
arrow	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
now	O
wholly	O
under	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
who	O
have	O
several	O
towns	O
there	O
.	O

The	O
chief	O
is	O
Manila	PNM
,	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
large	O
sea-port	O
town	O
near	O
the	O
south-east	O
end	O
,	O
opposite	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
Mindoro	PNM
.	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
place	O
of	O
great	O
strength	O
and	O
trade	O
:	O
the	O
two	O
great	O
Acapulco	O
ships	O
before	O
mentioned	O
fetching	O
from	O
hence	O
all	O
sorts	O
of	O
East	PNM
India	PNM
commodities	O
which	O
are	O
brought	O
hither	O
by	O
foreigners	O
,	O
especially	O
by	O
the	O
Chinese	O
and	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
.	O

Sometimes	O
the	O
English	O
merchants	O
of	O
Fort	PNM
St.	PNM
George	PNM
send	O
their	O
ships	O
hither	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
by	O
stealth	O
under	O
the	O
charge	O
of	O
Portuguese	O
pilots	O
and	O
mariners	O
:	O
for	O
as	O
yet	O
we	O
can	O
not	O
get	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
there	O
to	O
a	O
commerce	O
with	O
us	O
or	O
the	O
Dutch	O
,	O
although	O
they	O
have	O
but	O
few	O
ships	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
.	O

This	O
seems	O
to	O
arise	O
from	O
a	O
jealousy	O
or	O
fear	O
of	O
discovering	O
the	O
riches	O
of	O
these	O
islands	O
,	O
for	O
most	O
if	O
not	O
all	O
the	O
Philippine	O
Islands	O
are	O
rich	O
in	O
gold	O
:	O
and	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
have	O
no	O
place	O
of	O
much	O
strength	O
in	O
all	O
these	O
islands	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
ever	O
hear	O
of	O
besides	O
Manila	PNM
itself	O
.	O

Yet	O
they	O
have	O
villages	O
and	O
towns	O
on	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
islands	O
,	O
and	O
padres	O
or	O
priests	O
to	O
instruct	O
the	O
native	O
Indians	O
from	O
whom	O
they	O
get	O
their	O
gold	O
.	O

The	O
Spanish	O
inhabitants	O
of	O
the	O
smaller	O
islands	O
especially	O
would	O
willingly	O
trade	O
with	O
us	O
if	O
the	O
government	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
severe	O
against	O
it	O
:	O
for	O
they	O
have	O
no	O
goods	O
but	O
what	O
are	O
brought	O
from	O
Manila	PNM
at	O
an	O
extraordinary	O
dear	O
rate	O
.	O

I	O
am	O
of	O
the	O
opinion	O
that	O
if	O
any	O
of	O
our	O
nations	O
will	O
seek	O
a	O
trade	O
with	O
them	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
lose	O
their	O
labour	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
can	O
and	O
will	O
smuggle	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
our	O
seamen	O
call	O
trading	O
by	O
stealth	O
-RRB-	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
any	O
nation	O
that	O
I	O
know	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
Jamaicans	O
are	O
to	O
their	O
profit	O
sensible	O
enough	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

And	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
informed	O
that	O
Captain	O
Goodlud	O
of	O
London	PNM
,	O
in	O
a	O
voyage	O
which	O
he	O
made	O
from	O
Mindanao	PNM
to	O
China	PNM
,	O
touched	O
at	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
islands	O
and	O
was	O
civilly	O
treated	O
by	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
who	O
bought	O
some	O
of	O
his	O
commodities	O
,	O
giving	O
him	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
price	O
for	O
the	O
same	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
about	O
12	O
or	O
14	O
more	O
large	O
islands	O
lying	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
of	O
Luconia	PNM
;	O
most	O
of	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
before	O

are	O
inhabited	O

there	O
are	O

even	O
the	O

I	O
find	O

As	O
we	O
were	O
passing	O
by	O
the	O

we	O
saw	O
a	O
canoa	O
of	O
the	O

under	O

therefore	O
one	O
of	O

went	O

spoken	O
with	O

she	O
ran	O
away	O
from	O
us	O

seeing	O
themselves	O
chased	O

put	O
their	O

ashore	O

leaving	O
her	O

fled	O
into	O
the	O

would	O
be	O

we	O
did	O
what	O
we	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
aboard	O

we	O
steered	O
away	O
for	O
the	O
island	O
Mindanao	PNM

which	O
was	O

The	O
22nd	O
day	O
we	O
came	O
within	O
a	O
league	O
of	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
Mindanao	PNM
and	O
having	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
south-east	O
we	O
steered	O
toward	O
the	O
north	O
end	O
,	O
keeping	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
7	O
degrees	O
40	O
minutes	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
we	O
anchored	O
in	O
a	O
small	O
bay	O
,	O
about	O
a	O

from	O
the	O

Some	O
of	O
our	O

gave	O
us	O
an	O
account	O
that	O
Mindanao	O
City	O
and	O
Isle	O
lies	O
in	O
7	O
degrees	O
40	O
minutes	O

We	O
guessed	O
that	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
might	O
lie	O
in	O
this	O
latitude	O
but	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
loss	O

to	O
find	O
the	O
city	O
,	O
whether	O
on	O
the	O
east	O

Indeed	O
,	O
had	O
it	O
been	O
a	O
small	O
island	O
lying	O
open	O
in	O
the	O
eastern	O
wind	O
we	O
might	O
probably	O
have	O
searched	O
first	O
on	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
;	O
for	O
commonly	O
the	O
islands	O
within	O
the	O

,	O
or	O
within	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

have	O
their	O

on	O
the	O

the	O

being	O
guarded	O
on	O
the	O
east	O

by	O
St.	PNM

we	O
might	O

to	O
find	O
the	O

,	O
coming	O
into	O

we	O
judged	O
the	O
city	O
might	O
be	O

found	O
no	O
Canoas	O

This	O

Captain	O
Rofy	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
while	O
he	O
lived	O
with	O
the	O
Dutch	O
he	O
was	O
sent	O
with	O
other	O
men	O
to	O
cut	O
down	O
the	O
spice-trees	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
himself	O
did	O
at	O
several	O
times	O
cut	O
down	O
7	O

800	O
trees	O

Yet	O
although	O
the	O
Dutch	O
take	O
such	O
care	O
to	O
destroy	O
them	O
there	O
are	O
many	O
uninhabited	O
islands	O
that	O
have	O
great	O
plenty	O
of	O
spice-trees	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
informed	O
by	O
Dutchmen	O
that	O
have	O
been	O
there	O
,	O
particularly	O
by	O
a	O
captain	O
of	O
a	O
Dutch	O
ship	O
that	O
I	O
met	O
with	O
at	O
Achin	PNM
who	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
near	O
the	O
island	O
Banda	PNM
there	O
is	O
an	O
island	O
where	O
the	O
cloves	O
,	O
falling	O
from	O
the	O
trees	O
,	O
do	O
lie	O
and	O
rot	O
on	O
the	O

and	O
they	O
are	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
when	O
the	O
fruit	O
falls	O
3	O
or	O
4	O
inches	O
thick	O
under	O
the	O
trees	O
.	O

He	O
and	O
some	O
others	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
a	O
hard	O
matter	O
for	O
an	O
English	O
vessel	O
to	O
purchase	O

He	O
was	O
a	O

For	O
by	O

The	O
betel-nut	O
is	O
much	O
esteemed	O
here	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
in	O
most	O
places	O
of	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
.	O

The	O
betel-tree	O
grows	O
like	O
the	O
cabbage-tree	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
so	O
big	O
nor	O
so	O
high	O
.	O

The	O
body	O
grows	O
straight	O
,	O
about	O
12	O
or	O
14	O
foot	O
high	O
without	O
leaf	O
or	O
branch	O
except	O
at	O
the	O

There	O
it	O
spreads	O
forth	O
long	O
branches	O
like	O
other	O
trees	O
of	O
the	O
like	O
nature	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
cabbage-tree	O
,	O
the	O
coconut-tree	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
palm	O

These	O
branches	O
are	O
about	O
10	O
or	O
12	O
foot	O
long	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
stems	O
near	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
a	O
man	O

On	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
among	O
the	O
branches	O
the	O
betel-nut	O
grows	O
on	O
a	O
tough	O
stem	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
a	O
man	O
's	O
finger	O
,	O
in	O

much	O
as	O
the	O
coconuts	O
do	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
grow	O
40	O

50	O
in	O
a	O
cluster	O

This	O
fruit	O
is	O
bigger	O
than	O
a	O
nutmeg	O
and	O
is	O
much	O

it	O

It	O
is	O
much	O
used	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM

Their	O
way	O
is	O
to	O
cut	O
it	O
in	O
four	O
pieces	O
,	O
and	O
wrap	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
up	O
in	O
an	O
arek-leaf	O
which	O
they	O
spread	O
with	O
a	O
soft	O
paste	O
made	O
of	O
lime	O
or	O
plaster	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
chew	O
it	O
altogether	O
.	O

Every	O
man	O
in	O
these	O
parts	O
carries	O
his	O
lime-box	O
by	O
his	O
side	O
and	O
,	O
dipping	O
his	O
finger	O
into	O
it	O
,	O
spreads	O
his	O
betel	O
and	O
arek-leaf	O
with	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
arek	O
is	O
a	O
small	O
tree	O
or	O
shrub	O
,	O
of	O
a	O
green	O
bark	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
leaf	O
is	O
long	O
and	O
broader	O
than	O
a	O
willow	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
packed	O
up	O
to	O
sell	O
into	O
parts	O
that	O
have	O
them	O
not	O
,	O
to	O
chew	O
with	O
the	O
betel	O
.	O

The	O
betel-nut	O
is	O
most	O
esteemed	O
when	O
it	O
is	O
young	O
and	O
before	O
it	O
grows	O
hard	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
they	O
cut	O
it	O
only	O
in	O
two	O
pieces	O
with	O
the	O
green	O
husk	O
or	O
shell	O
on	O
it	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
then	O
exceeding	O
juicy	O
and	O
therefore	O
makes	O
them	O
spit	O
much	O
.	O

It	O
tastes	O
rough	O
in	O
the	O
mouth	O
and	O
dyes	O
the	O
lips	O
red	O
,	O
and	O
makes	O
the	O
teeth	O
black	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
preserves	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
cleanses	O
the	O
gums	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
also	O
accounted	O
very	O
wholesome	O
for	O
the	O
stomach	O
;	O
but	O
sometimes	O
it	O
will	O
cause	O
great	O
giddiness	O
in	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
those	O
that	O
are	O
not	O
used	O
to	O
chew	O
it	O
.	O

But	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
effect	O
only	O
of	O
the	O
old	O
nut	O
for	O
the	O
young	O
nuts	O
will	O
not	O
do	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
speak	O
of	O
my	O
own	O
experience	O
.	O

This	O
island	O
produces	O
also	O
durians	O
and	O
jacks	O
.	O

The	O
trees	O
that	O
bear	O
the	O
durians	O
are	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
apple-trees	O
,	O
full	O
of	O
boughs	O

The	O
rind	O
is	O
thick	O
and	O
rough	O
;	O
the	O
fruit	O
is	O
so	O
large	O
that	O
they	O
grow	O
only	O
about	O
the	O
bodies	O
or	O
on	O
the	O
limbs	O
near	O
the	O
body	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
Cacoa	PNM

The	O
fruit	O
is	O
about	O
the	O
bigness	O
of	O
a	O
large	O
pumpkin	O
,	O
covered	O
with	O
a	O
thick	O
green	O

When	O
it	O
is	O
ripe	O
the	O
rind	O
begins	O
to	O
turn	O
yellow	O

it	O
is	O
not	O
fit	O
to	O
eat	O
till	O
it	O
opens	O
at	O
the	O

Then	O
the	O
fruit	O
in	O
the	O
inside	O
is	O
ripe	O
and	O
sends	O
forth	O
an	O
excellent	O
scent	O

When	O
the	O
rind	O
is	O
opened	O
the	O
fruit	O
may	O
be	O
split	O
into	O
four	O
quarters	O
;	O
each	O
quarter	O
has	O
several	O
small	O
cells	O
that	O
enclose	O
a	O
certain	O
quantity	O
of	O
the	O
fruit	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
bigness	O
of	O
the	O

for	O
some	O
are	O
larger	O

The	O
largest	O

the	O
fruit	O
may	O
be	O
as	O

It	O
is	O

the	O

but	O
those	O
who	O

them	O
will	O
dislike	O
them	O
at	O

because	O
they	O
smell	O

This	O

that	O
are	O

to	O

the	O

The	O

The	O

and	O
very	O
tempestuous	O
weather	O

At	O
the	O
first	O
coming	O
in	O
of	O
these	O

they	O
blow	O
but	O
faintly	O
;	O
but	O
then	O
the	O
tornadoes	O
rise	O
one	O
in	O
a	O
day	O
,	O
sometimes	O
two	O

These	O
are	O
thunder-showers	O
which	O

come	O
against	O
the	O

,	O
bringing	O
with	O
them	O
a	O
contrary	O

to	O
what	O
did	O

before	O

After	O
the	O

over	O
the	O
wind	O
shifts	O
about	O
again	O
and	O
the	O
sky	O
becomes	O

yet	O
then	O
in	O
the	O

the	O

there	O
rises	O
thick	O
fog	O

The	O
tornadoes	O
continue	O
thus	O
for	O
a	O

bringing	O
violent	O
gusts	O
of	O

and	O
terrible	O
claps	O
of	O
thunder	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
they	O
come	O
so	O
fast	O
that	O
the	O
wind	O
remains	O
in	O
the	O
quarter	O
from	O
whence	O
these	O
tornadoes	O
do	O
rise	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
out	O

and	O
there	O
it	O
settles	O
till	O
October	O
or	O
November	O

When	O
these	O
westward	O
winds	O
are	O
thus	O
settled	O
the	O
sky	O
is	O
all	O
in	O
mourning	O
,	O
being	O
covered	O
with	O
black	O
clouds	O
,	O
pouring	O
down	O
excessive	O
rains	O
sometimes	O
mixed	O
with	O
thunder	O

,	O
that	O
nothing	O
can	O
be	O
more	O

The	O

that	O

that	O
the	O

it	O
continues	O

a	O

The	O
fiercest	O
of	O
this	O

is	O
in	O
the	O
latter	O
end	O
of	O
July	O
and	O
in	O

At	O
this	O

The	O

are	O
men	O

small	O

some	O
other	O
Indians	O
,	O
especially	O
the	O

They	O
have	O
a	O
custom	O
to	O
wear	O
their	O
thumb-nails	O
very	O
long	O

that	O

They	O
are	O

to	O
most	O

these	O
people	O
's	O
laziness	O
seems	O
rather	O
to	O
proceed	O

so	O
much	O
from	O
their	O
natural	O
inclinations	O

from	O
the	O

they	O
stand	O
in	O

:	O

walk	O
very	O

They	O
are	O
civil	O

About	O

The	O

They	O
use	O
no	O

their	O
rice	O

every	O
man	O
takes	O
a	O
handful	O
out	O

the	O

,	O
by	O
wetting	O
his	O

They	O

these	O
lumps	O

in	O
taking	O

the	O
biggest	O
lump	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
sometimes	O
they	O
almost	O
choke	O
themselves	O

They	O
always	O
wash	O
after	O
meals	O
or	O
if	O
they	O
touch	O
anything	O
that	O
is	O
unclean	O
;	O
for	O
which	O
reason	O
they	O
spend	O
abundance	O
of	O
water	O
in	O
their	O

This	O
water	O
,	O
with	O
the	O

down	O

are	O
not	O

floored	O
with	O

so	O
that	O
the	O
water	O
presently	O
falls	O
underneath	O
their	O
dwelling	O

where	O
it	O
breeds	O
maggots	O

makes	O
a	O

Besides	O
this	O
filthiness	O
the	O
sick	O
people	O

themselves	O

make	O
water	O
in	O

healthy	O

people	O

themselves	O

make	O
water	O
in	O
the	O

For	O
that	O

you	O

they	O

to	O
it	O
from	O

I	O
do	O
believe	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
wholesome	O
to	O
wash	O
mornings	O
and	O
evenings	O
in	O
these	O
hot	O
countries	O
at	O
least	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
days	O
in	O
the	O
week	O
:	O
for	O
I	O
did	O
use	O
myself	O
to	O
it	O
when	O
I	O
lived	O
afterwards	O
at	O
Bencoolen	PNM
,	O
and	O
found	O
it	O
very	O
refreshing	O
and	O
comfortable	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
very	O
good	O
for	O
those	O
that	O
have	O
fluxes	O
to	O
wash	O
and	O
stand	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
mornings	O
and	O
evenings	O

I	O
speak	O
it	O
experimentally	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
brought	O
very	O
low	O
with	O
that	O
distemper	O
at	O
Achin	PNM
;	O
but	O
by	O
washing	O
constantly	O
mornings	O
and	O
evenings	O
I	O
found	O
great	O
benefit	O
and	O
was	O
quickly	O
cured	O
by	O
it	O

In	O
the	O
city	O
of	O

they	O

two	O

their	O
own	O

the	O

only	O

and	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
words	O
of	O

the	O

Many	O
of	O
the	O
old	O
people	O
both	O
men	O
and	O
women	O
can	O
speak	O
Spanish	O
for	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
were	O
formerly	O
settled	O
among	O
them	O
and	O
had	O
several	O
forts	O
on	O
this	O
island	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
they	O
sent	O
two	O
friars	O
to	O
the	O
city	O
to	O
convert	O
the	O
sultan	O
of	O
Mindanao	PNM
and	O
his	O
people	O
.	O

At	O
that	O
time	O
these	O
people	O
began	O
to	O
learn	O
Spanish	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
encroached	O
on	O
them	O
and	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
bring	O
them	O
into	O
subjection	O
;	O
and	O
probably	O
before	O
this	O
time	O
had	O
brought	O
them	O
all	O
under	O
their	O
yoke	O
if	O
they	O
themselves	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
drawn	O
off	O
from	O
this	O
island	O
to	O
Manila	PNM
to	O
resist	O
the	O
Chinese	O
,	O
who	O
threatened	O
to	O
invade	O
them	O
there	O

When	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
were	O
gone	O
the	O
old	O
sultan	O
of	O
Mindanao	PNM
,	O
father	O
to	O
the	O
present	O
,	O
in	O
whose	O
time	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
razed	O
and	O
demolished	O
their	O
forts	O
,	O
brought	O
away	O
their	O
guns	O
,	O
and	O
sent	O
away	O
the	O
friars	O
;	O
and	O
since	O
that	O
time	O
will	O
not	O
suffer	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
to	O
settle	O
on	O
the	O
islands	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
now	O
most	O
afraid	O
of	O
the	O
Dutch	O
,	O
being	O
sensible	O
how	O
they	O
have	O
enslaved	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
neighbouring	O
islands	O
.	O

For	O
that	O
reason	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
desired	O
the	O
English	O
to	O
settle	O
among	O
them	O
and	O
have	O
offered	O
them	O
any	O
convenient	O
place	O
to	O
build	O
a	O
fort	O
in	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
general	O
himself	O
told	O
us	O
;	O
giving	O
this	O
reason	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
find	O
the	O
English	O
so	O
encroaching	O
as	O
the	O
Dutch	O
or	O
Spanish	PNM
.	O

The	O
Dutch	O
are	O
no	O
less	O
jealous	O
of	O
their	O
admitting	O
the	O
English	O
for	O
they	O
are	O
sensible	O
what	O
detriment	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
to	O
them	O
if	O
the	O
English	O
should	O
settle	O
here	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
but	O
few	O
tradesmen	O
at	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Mindanao	PNM
.	O

The	O
chiefest	O
trades	O
are	O
goldsmiths	O
,	O
blacksmiths	O
,	O
and	O
carpenters	O

There	O
are	O
but	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
goldsmiths	O
;	O
these	O
will	O
work	O
in	O
gold	O
or	O
silver	O

make	O
anything	O
that	O
you	O

but	O
they	O
have	O
no	O
shop	O

ready-made	O
for	O

Here	O
are	O
several	O

who	O
work	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
considering	O
the	O
tools	O
that	O
they	O
work	O
with	O
.	O

Their	O
bellows	O
are	O
much	O
different	O
from	O

They	O
are	O
made	O
of	O
a	O
wooden	O
cylinder	O

the	O
trunk	O
of	O
a	O
tree	O

about	O
three	O

Near	O

two	O

them	O
both	O
at	O

one	O
with	O

They	O
have	O
neither	O
vice	O
nor	O

but	O
a	O
great	O
hard	O
stone	O
or	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
an	O
old	O
gun	O
to	O
hammer	O
upon	O
:	O
yet	O
they	O
will	O
perform	O
their	O
work	O
,	O
making	O
both	O
common	O
utensils	O
and	O
iron-works	O
about	O
ships	O
to	O
admiration	O
.	O

They	O
work	O
altogether	O
with	O
charcoal	O
.	O

Every	O
man	O
almost	O
is	O
a	O
carpenter	O
for	O
they	O
can	O
work	O
with	O
the	O
axe	O
and	O
adze	O
.	O

Their	O
axe	O
is	O
but	O
small	O
and	O
so	O
made	O
that	O
they	O
can	O
take	O
it	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
helve	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
turning	O
it	O
make	O
an	O
adze	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

They	O
have	O
no	O
saws	O
but	O
when	O
they	O
make	O
plank	O
they	O
split	O
the	O
tree	O
in	O
two	O
and	O
make	O
a	O
plank	O
of	O
each	O
part	O
,	O
planing	O
it	O
with	O
the	O
axe	O
and	O
adze	O
.	O

This	O
requires	O
much	O
pains	O
and	O
takes	O
up	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
time	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
work	O
cheap	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
goodness	O
of	O
the	O
plank	O
thus	O
hewed	O
,	O
which	O
has	O
its	O
grain	O
preserved	O
entire	O
,	O
makes	O

for	O
their	O
cost	O

They	O
build	O
good	O

ships	O

for	O
the	O

some	O
for	O

.	O

Their	O
trading	O
vessels	O
they	O
send	O
chiefly	O
to	O
Manila	PNM
.	O

Thither	O
they	O
transport	O
beeswax	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
commodity	O
besides	O
gold	O
that	O
they	O
vend	O
there	O
.	O

The	O
inhabitants	O
of	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Mindanao	PNM
get	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
beeswax	O
themselves	O
:	O
but	O
the	O
greatest	O
quantity	O
they	O
purchase	O
is	O
of	O
the	O
Mountaineers	O
,	O
from	O
whom	O
they	O
also	O
get	O
the	O
gold	O
which	O
they	O
send	O
to	O
Manila	PNM
;	O
and	O
with	O
these	O
they	O
buy	O
their	O
calicoes	O

They	O
send	O
sometimes	O
their	O

what	O
they	O

The	O

come	O
hither	O
in	O

from	O
Ternate	PNM
and	O
Tidore	PNM
and	O
buy	O
rice	O
,	O
beeswax	O
,	O
and	O
tobacco	O
:	O
for	O
here	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
tobacco	O
grows	O
on	O
this	O
island	O
,	O
more	O
than	O
in	O
any	O
island	O

in	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
that	O
I	O
know	O
of	O

Manila	PNM
only	O
excepted	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
an	O
excellent	O
sort	O
of	O
tobacco	O
;	O
but	O
these	O
people	O
have	O
not	O
the	O
art	O
of	O
managing	O
this	O
trade	O
to	O
their	O
best	O
advantage	O
as	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
have	O
at	O
Manila	PNM
.	O

I	O
do	O
believe	O
the	O
seeds	O
were	O
first	O
brought	O
hither	O
from	O
Manila	PNM
by	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
thither	O
,	O
in	O
all	O
probability	O
,	O
from	O
America	PNM
:	O
the	O
difference	O
between	O
the	O
Mindanao	PNM
and	O
Manila	PNM
tobacco	O
is	O
that	O
the	O
Mindanao	O
tobacco	O
is	O
of	O
a	O
darker	O
colour	O
and	O
the	O
leaf	O
larger	O
and	O
grosser	O
than	O
the	O
Manila	PNM
tobacco	O
,	O
being	O
propagated	O
or	O
planted	O
in	O
a	O
fatter	O
soil	O
.	O

The	O
Manila	PNM
tobacco	O
is	O
of	O
a	O
bright	O
yellow	O
colour	O
,	O
of	O
an	O
indifferent	O
size	O
,	O
not	O
strong	O
,	O
but	O
pleasant	O
to	O
smoke	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
at	O
Manila	PNM
are	O
very	O
curious	O
about	O
this	O
tobacco	O
,	O
having	O
a	O
peculiar	O
way	O
of	O
making	O
it	O
up	O
neatly	O
in	O
the	O
leaf	O
.	O

For	O
they	O
take	O
two	O
little	O
sticks	O
,	O
each	O
about	O
a	O
foot	O
long	O
and	O
flat	O
and	O
,	O
placing	O
the	O
stalks	O
of	O
the	O
tobacco	O
leaves	O
in	O
a	O
row	O
,	O
40	O
or	O
50	O
of	O
them	O
between	O
the	O
two	O
sticks	O
,	O
they	O
bind	O
them	O
hard	O
together	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
leaves	O
hang	O
dangling	O
down	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
these	O
bundles	O
is	O
sold	O
for	O
a	O
rial	O
at	O
Fort	PNM
St.	PNM
George	PNM
:	O
but	O
you	O
may	O
have	O
10	O
or	O
12	O
pound	O
of	O
tobacco	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM
for	O
a	O
rial	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
tobacco	O
is	O
as	O
good	O
or	O
rather	O
better	O
than	O
the	O
Manila	PNM
tobacco	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
have	O
not	O
that	O
vent	O
for	O
it	O
as	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
have	O
.	O

The	O
Mindanao	O
people	O
are	O
much	O
troubled	O
with	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
leprosy	O
,	O
the	O
same	O
as	O
we	O
observed	O
at	O
Guam	PNM

This	O
distemper	O
runs	O
with	O
a	O
dry	O
scurf	O
all	O
over	O
their	O
bodies	O
and	O
causes	O
great	O
itching	O
in	O
those	O
that	O
have	O
it	O
,	O
making	O
them	O
frequently	O
scratch	O
and	O
scrub	O
themselves	O
,	O
which	O
raises	O
the	O
outer	O
skin	O
in	O
small	O
whitish	O

of	O
little	O
fish	O
when	O
they	O
are	O
raised	O
on	O

This	O
makes	O
their	O
skin	O
extraordinary	O
rough	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
some	O
you	O
shall	O
see	O
broad	O
white	O
spots	O
in	O
several	O
parts	O
of	O
their	O
body	O
.	O

I	O
judge	O
such	O
have	O
had	O
it	O
but	O
were	O
cured	O
;	O
for	O
their	O
skins	O
were	O
smooth	O
and	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
perceive	O
them	O
to	O
scrub	O
themselves	O
:	O
yet	O
I	O
have	O
learnt	O
from	O
their	O
own	O
mouths	O
that	O
these	O
spots	O
were	O
from	O
this	O
distemper	O
.	O

Whether	O
they	O
use	O
any	O
means	O
to	O
cure	O
themselves	O
or	O
whether	O
it	O
goes	O
away	O
of	O
itself	O
,	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
:	O
but	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
perceive	O
that	O
they	O
made	O
any	O
great	O
matter	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
did	O
never	O
refrain	O
any	O
company	O
for	O
it	O
;	O
none	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
caught	O
it	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
afraid	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
kept	O
off	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
sometimes	O
troubled	O
with	O
the	O
smallpox	O
but	O
their	O
ordinary	O
distempers	O
are	O
fevers	O
,	O
agues	O

fluxes	O

with	O
great	O
pains	O
and	O
gripings	O

The	O

a	O

the	O

The	O

many	O

what	O

are	O
used	O
when	O

There	O
is	O

a	O
great	O

the	O

The	O

a	O
poor	O
prince	O

for	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
mentioned	O
before	O

they	O
have	O

little	O
trade	O
and	O
therefore	O
can	O
not	O

If	O
the	O

understands	O
that	O
any	O
man	O
has	O
money	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
be	O
but	O
20	O
dollars	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
great	O

among	O

borrow	O
so	O
much	O
money	O

pretending	O
urgent	O
occasions	O
for	O
it	O

and	O
they	O
dare	O
not	O
deny	O
him	O

Sometimes	O
he	O
will	O

After	O
this	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
men	O

both	O
in	O
city	O

country	O
being	O
in	O
arms	O
before	O

act	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
were	O

such	O

Only	O

the	O

a	O
great	O
ring	O
of	O
2	O
or	O
300	O
yards	O
round	O
about	O
him	O
.	O

He	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
exercise	O
comes	O
into	O
the	O
ring	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
shriek	O
or	O
two	O
and	O
a	O
horrid	O
look	O
;	O
then	O
he	O
fetches	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
large	O
stately	O
strides	O
and	O
falls	O
to	O
work	O
.	O

He	O
holds	O
his	O
broadsword	O
in	O
one	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
lance	O
in	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
and	O
traverses	O
his	O
ground	O

leaping	O
from	O
one	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
ring	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
menacing	O
posture	O

bids	O
defiance	O
to	O
the	O
enemy	O
whom	O
his	O

to	O
him	O
;	O
for	O
there	O
is	O
nothing	O
but	O
air	O
to	O
oppose	O
him	O
.	O

Then	O
he	O
stamps	O
and	O
shakes	O
his	O
head	O
and	O
,	O
grinning	O
with	O
his	O
teeth	O
,	O
makes	O
many	O
rueful	O
faces	O

Then	O
he	O
throws	O
his	O
lance	O
and	O
nimbly	O
snatches	O
out	O
his	O
cresset	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
he	O
hacks	O
and	O
hews	O
the	O
air	O
like	O
a	O
madman	O

often	O
shrieking	O

At	O
last	O
,	O
being	O
almost	O
tired	O
with	O
motion	O
,	O
he	O
flies	O
to	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
ring	O
,	O
where	O
he	O
seems	O
to	O
have	O
his	O
enemy	O
at	O
his	O
mercy	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
blows	O
cuts	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
was	O
cutting	O
off	O
his	O
enemy	O
's	O
head	O

By	O
this	O
time	O
he	O
is	O
all	O
of	O
a	O
sweat	O
,	O
and	O
withdraws	O
triumphantly	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ring	O
,	O
and	O
presently	O
another	O
enters	O
with	O
the	O
like	O
shrieks	O
and	O
gestures	O

Thus	O
they	O
continue	O
combating	O
their	O
imaginary	O
enemy	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
;	O
towards	O
the	O

the	O

act	O

and	O
at	O

the	O

then	O
the	O

concludes	O
this	O
ceremony	O
:	O
he	O
and	O
the	O
general	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
other	O
great	O
men	O

are	O
in	O
armour	O

but	O
the	O
rest	O
have	O
none	O

After	O
this	O
the	O
sultan	O
returns	O
home	O
,	O
accompanied	O
with	O
abundance	O
of	O
people	O
,	O
who	O
wait	O
on	O
him	O
there	O
till	O
they	O
are	O
dismissed	O

But	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
there	O
there	O
was	O
an	O
after-game	O
to	O
be	O
played	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
the	O
general	O
's	O
son	O
being	O
then	O
circumcised	O
,	O
the	O
sultan	O
intended	O
to	O
give	O
him	O
a	O
second	O
visit	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
all	O
waited	O
to	O
attend	O
him	O
thither	O
.	O

The	O
general	O
also	O
provided	O
to	O
meet	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
best	O
manner	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
desired	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
with	O
his	O
men	O
to	O
attend	O
him	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
ordered	O
us	O
to	O
get	O
our	O
guns	O
and	O
wait	O
at	O
the	O
general	O
's	O
house	O
till	O
further	O
orders	O
.	O

So	O
about	O
40	O
of	O
us	O
waited	O
till	O
eight	O
a	O
clock	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
when	O
the	O
general	O
with	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
and	O
about	O
1000	O
men	O
went	O
to	O
meet	O
the	O
sultan	O
,	O
with	O
abundance	O
of	O
torches	O
that	O
made	O
it	O
as	O
light	O
as	O
day	O
.	O

The	O
manner	O
of	O
the	O
march	O
was	O
thus	O
:	O
first	O
of	O
all	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
pageant	O
,	O
and	O
upon	O
it	O
two	O
dancing	O
women	O
gorgeously	O
apparelled	O
,	O
with	O
coronets	O
on	O
their	O
heads	O
,	O
full	O
of	O
glittering	O
spangles	O
,	O
and	O
pendants	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
hanging	O
down	O
over	O
their	O
breast	O
and	O
shoulders	O
.	O

These	O
are	O
women	O
bred	O
up	O
purposely	O
for	O
dancing	O
:	O
their	O
feet	O
and	O
legs	O
are	O
but	O
little	O
employed	O
except	O
sometimes	O
to	O
turn	O
round	O
very	O
gently	O
;	O
but	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
arms	O
,	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
body	O
are	O
in	O
continual	O
motion	O
,	O
especially	O
their	O
arms	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
turn	O
and	O
twist	O
so	O
strangely	O
that	O
you	O
would	O
think	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
without	O
bones	O
.	O

Besides	O
the	O
two	O
dancing	O
women	O
there	O
were	O
two	O
old	O
women	O
in	O
the	O
pageant	O
holding	O
each	O
a	O
lighted	O
torch	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
close	O
by	O
the	O
two	O
dancing	O
women	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
light	O
the	O
glittering	O
spangles	O
appeared	O
very	O
gloriously	O
.	O

This	O
pageant	O
was	O
carried	O
by	O
six	O
lusty	O
men	O
:	O
then	O
came	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
torches	O
lighting	O
the	O
general	O
and	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
who	O
marched	O
side	O
by	O
side	O
next	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
that	O
attended	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
followed	O
close	O
after	O
,	O
marching	O
in	O
order	O
six	O
and	O
six	O
abreast	O

with	O
each	O
man	O
his	O
gun	O
on	O
his	O
shoulder	O
,	O
and	O
torches	O
on	O
each	O
side	O

After	O
us	O
came	O
twelve	O
of	O
the	O
general	O
's	O
men	O
with	O
old	O
Spanish	O
matchlocks	O
,	O
marching	O
four	O
in	O
a	O
row	O

After	O
them	O
about	O
forty	O
lances	O
,	O
and	O
behind	O
them	O
as	O
many	O
with	O
great	O
swords	O
,	O
marching	O
all	O
in	O
order	O

After	O
them	O
came	O
abundance	O
only	O
with	O
cressets	O
by	O
their	O
sides	O
,	O
who	O
marched	O
up	O
close	O
without	O
any	O
order	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
near	O
the	O
sultan	O
's	O
house	O
the	O
sultan	O
and	O
his	O
men	O
met	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
wheeled	O
off	O
to	O
let	O
them	O
pass	O
.	O

The	O
sultan	O
had	O
three	O
pageants	O
went	O
before	O
him	O
:	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
pageant	O
were	O
four	O
of	O
his	O
sons	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
about	O
ten	O
or	O
eleven	O
years	O
old	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
gotten	O
abundance	O
of	O
small	O
stones	O
which	O
they	O
roguishly	O
threw	O
about	O
on	O
the	O
people	O
's	O
heads	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
next	O
were	O
four	O
young	O
maidens	O
,	O
nieces	O
to	O
the	O
sultan	O
,	O
being	O
his	O
sister	O
's	O
daughters	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
third	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
three	O
of	O
the	O
sultan	O
's	O
children	O
,	O
not	O
above	O
six	O
years	O

The	O
sultan	O
himself	O
followed	O
next	O
,	O
being	O
carried	O
in	O
his	O
couch	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
not	O
like	O
your	O
Indians	O
'	O
palanquins	O
but	O
open	O
and	O
very	O
little	O
and	O
ordinary	O
.	O

A	O
multitude	O
of	O
people	O
came	O
after	O
without	O
any	O
order	O
:	O
but	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
passed	O
by	O
the	O
general	O
and	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
and	O
all	O
our	O
men	O
closed	O
in	O
just	O
behind	O
the	O
sultan	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
all	O
marched	O
together	O
to	O
the	O
general	O
's	O
house	O
.	O

We	O
came	O
thither	O
between	O
10	O
and	O
11	O
a	O
clock	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
biggest	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
company	O
were	O
immediately	O
dismissed	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
sultan	O
and	O
his	O
children	O
and	O
his	O
nieces	O
and	O
some	O
other	O
persons	O
of	O
quality	O
entered	O
the	O
general	O
's	O
house	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
met	O
at	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
the	O
stairs	O
by	O
the	O
general	O
's	O
women	O
,	O
who	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
respect	O
conducted	O
them	O
into	O
the	O
house	O
.	O

Captain	O
Swan	O
and	O
we	O
that	O
were	O
with	O
him	O
followed	O
after	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
long	O
before	O
the	O
general	O
caused	O
his	O
dancing	O
women	O
to	O
enter	O
the	O
room	O
and	O
divert	O
the	O
company	O
with	O
that	O
pastime	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
forgot	O
to	O
tell	O
you	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
none	O
but	O
vocal	O
music	O
here	O
,	O
by	O
what	O
I	O
could	O
learn	O
,	O
except	O
only	O
a	O
row	O
of	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
bells	O
without	O
clappers	O
,	O
16	O
in	O
number	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
weight	O
increasing	O
gradually	O
from	O
about	O
three	O
to	O
ten	O
pound	O
weight	O
.	O

These	O
are	O
set	O
in	O
a	O
row	O
on	O
a	O
table	O
in	O
the	O
general	O
's	O
house	O
,	O
where	O
for	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
days	O
together	O
before	O
the	O
circumcision	O
day	O
they	O
were	O
struck	O
each	O
with	O
a	O
little	O
stick	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
biggest	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
making	O
a	O
great	O
noise	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
ceased	O
that	O
morning	O
.	O

So	O
these	O
dancing	O
women	O
sung	O
themselves	O
and	O
danced	O
to	O
their	O
own	O
music	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
the	O
general	O
's	O
women	O
and	O
the	O
sultan	O
's	O
sons	O
and	O
his	O
nieces	O
danced	O
.	O

Two	O
of	O
the	O
sultan	O
's	O
nieces	O
were	O
about	O
18	O
or	O
19	O
years	O
old	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
were	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
years	O
younger	O
.	O

These	O
young	O
ladies	O
were	O
very	O
richly	O
dressed	O
with	O
loose	O
garments	O
of	O
silk	O
,	O
and	O
small	O
coronets	O
on	O
their	O
heads	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
much	O
fairer	O
than	O
any	O
women	O
I	O
did	O
ever	O
see	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
well	O
featured	O
;	O
and	O
their	O
noses	O
though	O
but	O
small	O
yet	O
higher	O
than	O
the	O
other	O
women	O
's	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
well	O
proportioned	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
ladies	O
had	O
very	O
well	O
diverted	O
themselves	O
and	O
the	O
company	O
with	O
dancing	O
the	O
general	O
caused	O
us	O
to	O
fire	O
some	O
sky-rockets	O
that	O
were	O
made	O
by	O
his	O
and	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
's	O
order	O
,	O
purposely	O
for	O
this	O
night	O
's	O
solemnity	O
;	O
and	O
after	O
that	O
the	O
sultan	O
and	O
his	O
retinue	O
went	O
away	O
with	O
a	O
few	O
attendants	O
and	O
we	O
all	O
broke	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
thus	O
ended	O
this	O
day	O
's	O
solemnity	O
:	O
but	O
the	O
boys	O
being	O
sore	O
with	O
their	O
amputation	O
went	O
straddling	O
for	O
a	O
fortnight	O
after	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
not	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
before	O
,	O
very	O
curious	O
,	O
or	O
strict	O
in	O
observing	O
any	O
days	O
or	O
times	O
of	O
particular	O
devotions	O
except	O
it	O
be	O
Ramdam	O
time	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
call	O
it	O

The	O
Ramdam	O
time	O
was	O
then	O
in	O
August	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
take	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
shortly	O
after	O
our	O
arrival	O
here	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
time	O
they	O
fast	O
all	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
seven	O
a	O
clock	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
they	O
spend	O
near	O
an	O
hour	O
in	O
prayer	O
.	O

Towards	O
the	O
latter	O
end	O
of	O
their	O
prayer	O
they	O
loudly	O
invoke	O
their	O
prophet	O
for	O
about	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
both	O
old	O
and	O
young	O
bawling	O
out	O
very	O
strangely	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
intended	O
to	O
fright	O
him	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
sleepiness	O
or	O
neglect	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

After	O
their	O
prayer	O
is	O
ended	O
,	O
they	O
spend	O
some	O
time	O
in	O
feasting	O
before	O
they	O
take	O
their	O
repose	O

Thus	O
they	O
do	O
every	O
day	O
for	O
a	O
whole	O
month	O
at	O

;	O
for	O
sometimes	O
it	O
is	O
two	O

three	O
days	O

before	O
the	O
Ramdam	O
ends	O
:	O
for	O
it	O
begins	O
at	O
the	O

lasts	O
till	O
they	O

the	O

which	O
sometimes	O
in	O
thick	O

three	O

four	O
days	O

the	O

A	O

They	O
also	O
take	O
great	O
care	O
to	O
keep	O
themselves	O
from	O
being	O
polluted	O
by	O
tasting	O
or	O

anything	O
that	O
is	O
accounted	O
unclean	O
;	O
therefore	O
swine	O
's	O
flesh	O
is	O
very	O
abominable	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
nay	O
,	O
anyone	O
that	O
has	O
either	O
tasted	O
of	O
swine	O

not	O

in	O
many	O

and	O
there	O

nothing	O

more	O
than	O
a	O

Yet	O
there	O
are	O
wild	O
hogs	O
in	O
the	O
islands	O
,	O
and	O
those	O
so	O
plentiful	O
that	O
they	O
will	O

out	O
of	O
the	O

in	O
the	O
night	O

down	O
the	O
filth	O
that	O
they	O

The	O
natives	O
therefore	O
would	O
even	O
desire	O
us	O
to	O
lie	O
in	O
wait	O
for	O
the	O
hogs	O
to	O
destroy	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
frequently	O

by	O

them	O
and	O

them	O
presently	O
on	O

And	O
now	O
I	O
am	O
on	O
this	O
subject	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
omit	O
a	O
story	O
concerning	O
the	O
general	O
.	O

He	O
once	O
desired	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
shoes	O
made	O
after	O
the	O
English	O
fashion	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
did	O
very	O
seldom	O
wear	O
any	O
:	O
so	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
made	O
him	O
a	O
pair	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
general	O
liked	O
very	O
well	O
.	O

Afterwards	O
somebody	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
the	O
thread	O
wherewith	O
the	O
shoes	O
were	O
sowed	O
were	O
pointed	O
with	O
hogs	O
'	O
bristles	O
.	O

This	O
put	O
him	O
into	O
a	O
great	O
passion	O
;	O
so	O
he	O
sent	O
the	O
shoes	O
to	O
the	O
man	O
that	O
made	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
sent	O
him	O
withal	O
more	O
leather	O
to	O
make	O
another	O
pair	O
with	O
threads	O
pointed	O
with	O
some	O
other	O
hair	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
immediately	O
done	O

It	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
bay	O
on	O
the	O
north-east	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
that	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
,	O
as	O
has	O
been	O
said	O
.	O

We	O
lay	O
in	O
this	O
bay	O
but	O
one	O
night	O
and	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
.	O

Yet	O
there	O
we	O
got	O
speech	O
with	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
who	O
by	O
signs	O
made	O
us	O
to	O
understand	O
that	O
the	O
City	O
Mindanao	PNM
was	O
on	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

We	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
persuade	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
us	O
to	O
be	O
our	O
pilot	O
but	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
:	O
therefore	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
we	O
loosed	O
from	O
hence	O
,	O
steering	O
again	O
to	O
the	O
south-east	O
,	O
having	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
south-west	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
south-east	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
Mindanao	PNM
we	O
saw	O
two	O
small	O
islands	O
about	O
three	O
leagues	O
distant	O
from	O
it	O
.	O

We	O
might	O
have	O
passed	O
between	O
them	O
and	O
the	O
main	O
island	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
learnt	O
since	O
;	O
but	O
not	O
knowing	O
them	O
,	O
nor	O
what	O
dangers	O
we	O
might	O
encounter	O
there	O
,	O
we	O
chose	O
rather	O
to	O
sail	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

But	O
meeting	O
very	O
strong	O
westerly	O
winds	O
we	O
got	O
nothing	O
forward	O
in	O
many	O
days	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
time	O
we	O
first	O
saw	O
the	O
islands	O
Meangis	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
about	O
sixteen	O
leagues	O
distant	O
from	O
the	O
Mindanao	PNM
,	O
bearing	O
south-east	O
.	O

I	O
shall	O
have	O
occasion	O
to	O
speak	O
more	O
of	O
them	O
hereafter	O
.	O

The	O
4th	O
day	O
of	O
July	O
we	O
got	O
into	O
a	O
deep	O
bay	O
four	O
leagues	O
north-west	O
from	O
the	O
two	O
small	O
islands	O
before	O
mentioned	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
night	O
before	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
violent	O
tornado	O
,	O
our	O
bark	O
being	O
unable	O
to	O
bear	O
any	O
longer	O
,	O
bore	O
away	O
,	O
which	O
put	O
us	O
in	O
some	O
pain	O
for	O
fear	O
she	O
was	O
overset	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
like	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
ourselves	O
.	O

We	O
anchored	O
on	O
the	O
south-west	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
in	O
fifteen	O
fathom	O
water	O
,	O
about	O
a	O
cable	O
's	O
length	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
shelter	O
ourselves	O
from	O
the	O
violence	O
of	O
the	O
weather	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
so	O
boisterous	O
with	O
rains	O
and	O
tornadoes	O
and	O
a	O
strong	O
westerly	O
wind	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
glad	O
to	O
find	O
this	O
place	O
to	O
anchor	O
in	O
,	O
being	O
the	O
only	O
shelter	O
on	O
this	O
side	O
from	O
the	O
west	O
winds	O
.	O

This	O
bay	O
is	O
not	O
above	O
two	O
miles	O
wide	O
at	O
the	O
mouth	O
,	O
but	O
farther	O
in	O
it	O
is	O
three	O
leagues	O
wide	O
and	O
seven	O
fathom	O
deep	O
;	O
running	O
in	O
north-north-west	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
a	O
good	O
depth	O
of	O
water	O
about	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
leagues	O
in	O
,	O
but	O
rocky	O
foul	O
ground	O
for	O
about	O
two	O
leagues	O
in	O
from	O
the	O
mouth	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
except	O
only	O
in	O
that	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
lay	O
.	O

About	O
three	O
leagues	O
in	O
from	O
the	O
mouth	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
eastern	O
side	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
fair	O
sandy	O
bays	O
and	O
very	O
good	O
anchoring	O
in	O
four	O
,	O
five	O
,	O
and	O
six	O
fathom	O
.	O

The	O
land	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
is	O
high	O
,	O
mountainous	O
and	O
woody	O
,	O
yet	O
very	O
well	O
watered	O
with	O
small	O
brooks	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
one	O
river	O
large	O
enough	O
for	O
Canoas	PNM
to	O
enter	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
the	O
land	O
is	O
of	O
a	O
mean	O
height	O
with	O
a	O
large	O
savannah	O
bordering	O
on	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
stretching	O
from	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O

This	O

abounds	O
with	O
long	O
grass	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
plentifully	O
stocked	O
with	O
deer	O

The	O
adjacent	O

are	O
a	O
covert	O
for	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
heat	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
;	O
but	O
mornings	O
and	O
evenings	O
they	O
feed	O
in	O
the	O
open	O
plains	O
,	O
as	O
thick	O
as	O
in	O
our	O
parks	O
in	O
England	PNM
.	O

I	O
never	O
saw	O
anywhere	O
such	O
plenty	O
of	O
wild	O
deer	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
have	O
met	O
with	O
them	O
in	O
several	O
parts	O
of	O
America	PNM
,	O
both	O
in	O
the	O
North	O

The	O
deer	O
live	O
here	O
pretty	O
peaceably	O
and	O
unmolested	O
;	O
for	O
there	O
are	O
no	O
inhabitants	O
on	O
that	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O

We	O
visited	O
this	O
savannah	O
every	O
morning	O
and	O
killed	O
as	O
many	O
deer	O
as	O
we	O
pleased	O
,	O
sometimes	O
16	O
or	O
18	O
in	O
a	O
day	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
did	O
eat	O
nothing	O
but	O
venison	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
we	O
stayed	O
here	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
plantations	O
by	O
the	O
sides	O
of	O
the	O
mountains	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
went	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
hopes	O
to	O
learn	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
whereabouts	O
the	O
city	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
not	O
over-sail	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
fled	O
from	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
lay	O
here	O
till	O
the	O
12th	O
day	O
before	O
the	O
winds	O
abated	O
of	O
their	O
fury	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
sailed	O
from	O
hence	O
,	O
directing	O
our	O
course	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
morning	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
land-wind	O
at	O
north	O
.	O

At	O
11	O
a	O
clock	O
the	O
sea-breeze	O
came	O
at	O
west	O
,	O
just	O
in	O
our	O
teeth	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
being	O
fair	O
weather	O
we	O
kept	O
on	O
our	O
way	O
,	O
turning	O
and	O
taking	O
the	O
advantage	O
of	O
the	O
land-breezes	O
by	O
night	O

by	O
day	O

Being	O
now	O
past	O
the	O
south-east	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
we	O
coasted	O
down	O
on	O
the	O
south	O

and	O
we	O
saw	O
abundance	O
of	O
Canoas	PNM
a-fishing	O

and	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
a	O
small	O
village	O

by	O

when	O

We	O
anchored	O
right	O
against	O
the	O
river	O
in	O
15	O

clear	O

a	O

lay	O

We	O
fired	O
seven	O

I	O

Raja	O

Mr.	O

-LRB-	O
he	O
who	O
was	O
taken	O
prisoner	O
at	O
Leon	PNM
in	O
Mexico	PNM
-RRB-	O
answered	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
language	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
English	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
out	O
of	O
England	PNM
.	O

They	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
welcome	O
and	O
asked	O
us	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
questions	O
about	O
England	PNM
;	O
especially	O
concerning	O
our	O
East	O
India	PNM
merchants	O
;	O
and	O
whether	O
we	O
were	O
sent	O
by	O
them	O
to	O
settle	O
a	O
factory	O
here	O
?	O

Mr.	O
Smith	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
we	O
came	O
hither	O
only	O
to	O
buy	O
provision	O
.	O

They	O
seemed	O
a	O
little	O
discontented	O
when	O
they	O
understood	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
come	O
to	O
settle	O
among	O
them	O
:	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
heard	O
of	O
our	O
arrival	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
entertained	O
hopes	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
sent	O
purposely	O
out	O
of	O
England	PNM
hither	O
to	O
settle	O
a	O
trade	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
which	O
it	O
should	O
seem	O
they	O
are	O
very	O
desirous	O
of	O
.	O

For	O
Captain	O
Goodlud	O
had	O
been	O
here	O
not	O
long	O
before	O
to	O
treat	O
with	O
them	O
about	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
he	O
went	O
away	O
told	O
them	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
they	O
said	O
-RRB-	O
that	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
they	O
might	O
expect	O
an	O
ambassador	O
from	O
England	PNM
to	O
make	O
a	O
full	O
bargain	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

Indeed	O
upon	O
mature	O
thoughts	O
I	O
should	O
think	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
done	O
better	O
than	O
to	O
have	O
complied	O
with	O
the	O
desire	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
have	O
of	O
our	O
settling	O
here	O
;	O
and	O
to	O
have	O
taken	O
up	O
our	O
quarters	O
among	O
them	O
.	O

For	O
as	O
thereby	O
we	O
might	O
better	O
have	O
consulted	O
our	O
own	O
profit	O
and	O
satisfaction	O
than	O
by	O
the	O
other	O
loose	O
roving	O
way	O
of	O
life	O
;	O
so	O
it	O
might	O
probably	O
have	O
proved	O
of	O
public	O
benefit	O
to	O
our	O
nation	O
and	O
been	O
a	O
means	O
of	O
introducing	O
an	O
English	O
settlement	O
and	O
trade	O
,	O
not	O
only	O
here	O
,	O
but	O
through	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
Spice	O
Islands	O
which	O
lie	O
in	O
its	O
neighbourhood	O
.	O

For	O
the	O
islands	O
Meangis	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
mentioned	O
in	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
this	O
chapter	O
,	O
lie	O
within	O
twenty	O
leagues	O
of	O
Mindanao	PNM
.	O

These	O
are	O
three	O
small	O
islands	O
that	O
abound	O
with	O
gold	O
and	O
cloves	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
may	O
credit	O
my	O
author	O
Prince	O
Jeoly	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
born	O
on	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
and	O
was	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
a	O
slave	O
in	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Mindanao	PNM
.	O

He	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
purchased	O
by	O
us	O
of	O
his	O
master	O
for	O
a	O
small	O
matter	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
afterwards	O
by	O
Mr.	O
Moody	O
-LRB-	O
who	O
came	O
hither	O
to	O
trade	O
and	O
laded	O
a	O
ship	O
with	O
clove-bark	O
-RRB-	O
and	O
by	O
transporting	O
him	O
home	O
to	O
his	O
own	O
country	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
gotten	O
a	O
trade	O
there	O
.	O

But	O
of	O
Prince	O
Jeoly	O
I	O
shall	O
speak	O
more	O
hereafter	O
.	O

These	O
islands	O
are	O
as	O
yet	O
probably	O
unknown	O
to	O
the	O
Dutch	O
who	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
before	O
,	O
endeavour	O
to	O
engross	O
all	O
the	O
spice	O
into	O
their	O
own	O
hands	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
another	O
opportunity	O
offered	O
us	O
here	O
of	O
settling	O
on	O
another	O
Spice	PNM
Island	PNM
that	O
was	O
very	O
well	O
inhabited	O
:	O
for	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
fearing	O
the	O
Dutch	O
and	O
understanding	O
that	O
the	O
English	O
were	O
settling	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM
,	O
their	O
sultan	O
sent	O
his	O
nephew	O
to	O
Mindanao	PNM
while	O
we	O
were	O
there	O
to	O
invite	O
us	O
thither	O
:	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
conferred	O
with	O
him	O
about	O
it	O
divers	O
times	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
he	O
had	O
some	O
inclination	O
to	O
accept	O
the	O
offer	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
were	O
for	O
it	O
:	O
but	O
this	O
never	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
head	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
a	O
true	O
understanding	O
between	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
and	O
his	O
men	O
,	O
as	O
may	O
be	O
declared	O
hereafter	O
.	O

Beside	O
the	O
benefit	O
which	O
might	O
accrue	O
from	O
this	O
trade	O
with	O
Meangis	O
and	O
other	O
the	O
Spice	O
Islands	O
the	O
Philippine	O
Islands	O
themselves	O
,	O
by	O
a	O
little	O
care	O
and	O
industry	O
,	O
might	O
have	O
afforded	O
us	O
a	O
very	O
beneficial	O
trade	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
these	O
trades	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
managed	O
from	O
Mindanao	PNM
by	O
settling	O
there	O
first	O
.	O

For	O
that	O
island	O
lies	O
very	O
convenient	O
for	O
trading	O
either	O
to	O
the	O
Spice	PNM
Islands	PNM
or	O
to	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
Philippine	PNM
Islands	PNM
:	O
since	O
,	O
as	O
its	O
soil	O
is	O
much	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
nature	O
with	O
either	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
so	O
it	O
lies	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
centre	O
of	O
the	O
gold	O
and	O
spice-trade	O
in	O
these	O
parts	O
,	O
the	O
islands	O
north	O
of	O

abounding	O
most	O
in	O
gold	O
,	O
and	O
those	O
south	O
of	O
Meangis	O
in	O
spice	O

As	O
the	O
island	O
Mindanao	O
lies	O
very	O
convenient	O
for	O
trade	O
,	O
so	O
,	O
considering	O
its	O
distance	O
,	O
the	O
way	O
thither	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
over-long	O
and	O
tiresome	O
.	O

The	O
course	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
choose	O
should	O
be	O
to	O
set	O
out	O
of	O
England	PNM
about	O
the	O
latter	O
end	O
of	O
August	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
pass	O
round	O
Tierra	PNM
del	PNM
Fuego	PNM
,	O
and	O
so	O
,	O
stretching	O
over	O
towards	O
New	PNM
Holland	PNM
,	O
coast	O
it	O
along	O
that	O
shore	O
till	O
I	O
came	O
near	O
to	O
Mindanao	PNM
;	O
or	O
first	O
I	O
would	O
coast	O
down	O
near	O
the	O
American	PNM
shore	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
I	O
found	O
convenient	O
and	O
then	O
direct	O
my	O
course	O
accordingly	O
for	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

By	O
this	O
I	O
should	O
avoid	O
coming	O
near	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
Dutch	O
settlements	O
and	O
be	O
sure	O
to	O
meet	O
always	O
with	O
a	O
constant	O
brisk	O
easterly	O
trade-wind	O
after	O
I	O
was	O
once	O
past	O
Tierra	PNM

Whereas	O
in	O
passing	O
about	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
of	PNM
Good	PNM
Hope	PNM
,	O
after	O
you	O
are	O
shot	O
over	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indian	PNM
Ocean	PNM
and	O
are	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
islands	O
,	O
you	O
must	O
pass	O
through	O
the	O
Straits	O
of	O
Malacca	PNM
or	O
Sunda	PNM
,	O
or	O
else	O
some	O
other	O
straits	O
east	O
from	O
Java	PNM
,	O
where	O
you	O
will	O
be	O
sure	O
to	O
meet	O
with	O
country-winds	O
,	O
go	O
on	O
which	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
Equator	O
you	O
please	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
would	O
require	O
ordinarily	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
months	O
for	O
the	O
voyage	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
other	O
I	O
should	O
hope	O
to	O
perform	O
in	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
at	O
most	O
.	O

In	O
your	O
return	O
from	O
thence	O
also	O
you	O
must	O
observe	O
the	O
same	O
rule	O
as	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
do	O
in	O
going	O
from	O
Manila	PNM
to	O
Acapulco	PNM
;	O
only	O
as	O
they	O
run	O
towards	O
the	O
North	O
Pole	O
for	O
variable	O
winds	O
,	O
so	O
you	O
must	O
run	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
till	O
you	O
meet	O
with	O
a	O
wind	O
that	O
will	O
carry	O
you	O
over	O
to	O
Tierra	PNM
del	PNM
Fuego	PNM
.	O

There	O
are	O
places	O
enough	O
to	O
touch	O
at	O
for	O
refreshment	O
,	O
either	O
going	O
or	O
coming	O
.	O

You	O
may	O
touch	O
going	O
thither	O
on	O
either	O
side	O
of	O
Terra	PNM
Patagonia	PNM
,	O
or	O
,	O
if	O
you	O

,	O
at	O
the	O
Gallapagos	PNM
Islands	PNM
,	O
where	O
there	O
is	O
refreshment	O
enough	O
;	O
and	O
returning	O
you	O
may	O
probably	O
touch	O
somewhere	O
on	O
New	PNM
Holland	PNM
,	O
and	O
so	O
make	O
some	O
profitable	O
discovery	O
in	O
these	O
places	O
without	O
going	O
out	O
of	O
your	O
way	O
.	O

And	O
to	O
speak	O
my	O
thoughts	O
freely	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
it	O
is	O
owing	O
to	O
the	O
neglect	O
of	O
this	O
easy	O
way	O
that	O
all	O
that	O
vast	O
tract	O
of	O
Terra	PNM
Australis	O
which	O
bounds	O
the	O
South	PNM

yet	O

those	O
that	O

to	O

some	O

on	O
the	O
Peruvian	O
or	O
Mexican	PNM
coast	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
leaving	O
that	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O

To	O
confirm	O
which	O
I	O
shall	O
add	O
what	O
Captain	O

told	O
me	O
lately	O
that	O

after	O
his	O

from	O

Lexa	PNM
-LRB-	O
as	O
is	O
mentioned	O
in	O
the	O
8th	O

-RRB-	O
he	O
went	O

after	O
several	O
traverses	O

to	O
the	O
Gallapagos	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
standing	O
thence	O
southward	O
for	O

to	O
bring	O
him	O
about	O
Tierra	PNM

in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
27	O
south	O

about	O
500	O
leagues	O
from	O
Copayapo	PNM
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Chile	PNM
,	O
he	O
saw	O
a	O
small	O
sandy	O
island	O
just	O
by	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
saw	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
of	O
it	O
a	O
long	O
tract	O
of	O
pretty	O
high	O
land	O
tending	O
away	O
toward	O
the	O
north-west	O
out	O
of	O

This	O
might	O
probably	O
be	O
the	O

But	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
Mindanao	PNM
;	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
capacity	O
we	O
were	O
then	O
in	O

of	O
settling	O
ourselves	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM
,	O
although	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
sent	O
out	O
of	O
any	O

we	O
were	O
as	O
well	O

or	O
better	O
,	O
considering	O
all	O
circumstances	O
,	O
than	O
if	O
we	O
had	O

For	O
there	O
was	O
scarce	O
any	O
useful	O
trade	O
but	O
some	O
or	O
other	O
of	O
us	O
understood	O
it	O

We	O
had	O
sawyers	O

brick-makers	O
,	O
bricklayers	O
,	O
shoemakers	O

.	O

We	O
only	O
wanted	O
a	O
good	O
smith	O
for	O
great	O
work	O
;	O
which	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
had	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM

We	O
were	O
very	O

We	O
had	O
powder	O

enough	O

very	O
good	O
small	O
arms	O

If	O
we	O
had	O
designed	O
to	O

we	O
could	O
have	O
spared	O
8	O

it	O

any	O

We	O
had	O
also	O
a	O
great	O

and	O
such	O
as	O
would	O

To	O
add	O
one	O
thing	O
more	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
were	O
almost	O
tired	O
and	O
began	O
to	O

and	O
therefore	O
they	O
would	O
gladly	O
have	O
seated	O
themselves	O
anywhere	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
good	O
ship	O
too	O
,	O
and	O
enough	O
of	O
us	O
-LRB-	O
beside	O
what	O

for	O
Captain	O

already	O
five	O

which	O
he	O

received	O

to	O

So	O
much	O
by	O

To	O
proceed	O
therefore	O
with	O
our	O
first	O
reception	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM
,	PNM
Raja	PNM
Laut	PNM
and	O
his	O
nephew	O
sat	O
still	O
in	O
their	O
canoa	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
not	O
come	O

because	O

they	O
said	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
no	O

from	O
the	O

After	O
about	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
's	O
discourse	O
they	O
took	O
their	O
leaves	O
;	O
first	O
inviting	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
ashore	O
and	O
promising	O
to	O
assist	O
him	O
in	O
getting	O
provision	O
;	O
which	O
they	O
said	O
at	O

was	O
scarce	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
three	O

four	O
month	O

time	O
the	O
rice	O
would	O
be	O
gathered	O
in	O

then	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
he	O
pleased	O
:	O
and	O
that	O
in	O
the	O

he	O
might	O
secure	O
his	O
ship	O
in	O
some	O
convenient	O
place	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
the	O
westerly	O
winds	O
which	O
they	O
said	O
would	O
be	O
very	O

at	O
the	O

of	O
this	O
month	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
next	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
found	O
them	O

We	O
did	O
not	O

the	O
quality	O
of	O
these	O
two	O
persons	O
till	O
after	O
they	O
were	O
gone	O
;	O
else	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
fired	O
some	O

at	O
their	O
departure	O
:	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
gone	O
a	O
certain	O
officer	O
under	O
the	O
sultan	O
came	O
aboard	O
and	O
measured	O
our	O

A	O
custom	O
derived	O
from	O
the	O
Chinese	O
,	O
who	O
always	O
measure	O
the	O
length	O
and	O
breadth	O

and	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

of	O

by	O
which	O

they	O
know	O
how	O

each	O
ship	O
will	O
carry	O

But	O
what	O
reason	O
this	O
custom	O
is	O
used	O
either	O
by	O
the	O
Chinese	O

Mindanao	PNM

Captain	O
Swan	O
,	O
considering	O
that	O
the	O
season	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
would	O
oblige	O
us	O
to	O
spend	O
some	O
time	O
at	O
this	O

thought	O
it	O
convenient	O
to	O

what	O

the	O

who	O
might	O
afterwards	O
either	O
obstruct	O
or	O
advance	O
his	O
designs	O

He	O
therefore	O
immediately	O
provided	O
a	O

to	O
send	O
ashore	O

the	O

three	O

to	O

This	O

was	O
carried	O
by	O
Mr.	O
Henry	O

in	O
the	O
evening	O

He	O
was	O
first	O
conducted	O
to	O
Raja	PNM

house	PNM

where	O
he	O
remained	O
till	O
report	O
thereof	O
was	O
made	O
to	O
the	O
sultan	O

who	O
immediately	O
gave	O
order	O
for	O
all	O
things	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
ready	O
to	O

him	O

About	O
nine	O
a	O

at	O
night	O
a	O
messenger	O
came	O
from	O
the	O
sultan	O
to	O
bring	O
the	O
present	O
away	O

Then	O
Mr.	O
More	O
was	O
conducted	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
with	O
torches	O
and	O
armed	O
men	O
till	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
house	O
where	O
the	O
sultan	O
was	O

The	O
sultan	O
with	O
eight	O
or	O
ten	O
men	O
of	O
his	O
council	O
were	O
seated	O
on	O

waiting	O
his	O
coming	O

The	O
present	O
that	O
Mr.	O
More	O
brought	O
was	O
laid	O
down	O
before	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
very	O
kindly	O
accepted	O
by	O
the	O
sultan	O
,	O
who	O
caused	O
Mr.	O
More	O
to	O
sit	O
down	O
by	O
them	O
and	O
asked	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
questions	O
of	O
him	O
.	O

The	O
discourse	O
was	O
in	O
Spanish	O
by	O
an	O
interpreter	O
.	O

This	O
conference	O
lasted	O
about	O
an	O
hour	O
and	O
then	O
he	O
was	O
dismissed	O
and	O
returned	O
again	O
to	O
Raja	PNM
Laut	PNM
's	O
house	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
supper	O
provided	O
for	O
him	O

and	O
the	O
boat	O

crew	O
;	O
after	O
which	O
he	O
returned	O
aboard	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
the	O
sultan	O
sent	O
for	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
:	O
he	O
immediately	O
went	O
ashore	O
with	O
a	O
flag	O
flying	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
's	O
head	O
and	O
two	O
trumpets	O
sounding	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
.	O

When	O
he	O
came	O
ashore	O
he	O
was	O
met	O
at	O
his	O
landing	O
by	O
two	O
principal	O
officers	O
,	O
guarded	O
along	O
with	O
soldiers	O
and	O
abundance	O
of	O
people	O
gazing	O
to	O
see	O
him	O
.	O

The	O
sultan	O
waited	O
for	O
him	O
in	O
his	O
chamber	O
of	O
audience	O
,	O
where	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
was	O
treated	O
with	O
tobacco	O
and	O
betel	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
all	O
his	O
entertainment	O

The	O
sultan	O
sent	O
for	O
two	O
English	O
letters	O
for	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
to	O
read	O
,	O
purposely	O
to	O
let	O
him	O
know	O
that	O
our	O
East	O
India	O
merchants	O
did	O
design	O
to	O
settle	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
already	O
sent	O
a	O

One	O
of	O
these	O

sent	O
to	O
the	O

from	O
England	PNM
by	O
the	O
East	PNM

The	O
chiefest	O
things	O
contained	O
in	O
it	O

as	O
I	O
remember	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
saw	O
it	O
afterwards	O
in	O
the	O
secretary	O
's	O
hand	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
very	O
proud	O
to	O
show	O
it	O
to	O
us	O

was	O
to	O
desire	O
some	O
privileges	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
the	O
building	O
of	O
a	O
fort	O
there	O

This	O
letter	O
was	O
written	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
fair	O
hand	O
;	O
and	O
between	O
each	O
line	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
gold	O
line	O
drawn	O

The	O
other	O
letter	O
was	O
left	O
by	O
Captain	O

,	O
directed	O
to	O
any	O
English-men	O
who	O
should	O
happen	O
to	O
come	O
thither	O
.	O

This	O
related	O
wholly	O
to	O
trade	O

giving	O
an	O
account	O
at	O
what	O
rate	O
he	O
had	O
agreed	O
with	O
them	O

goods	O

account	O
of	O
their	O

their	O

The	O
rate	O
agreed	O
on	O
for	O
Mindanao	PNM
gold	O
was	O
14	O

Captain	O

's	O
letter	O
concludes	O
thus	O

``	O

We	O
understood	O
afterwards	O
that	O
Captain	O
Goodlud	O
was	O
robbed	O
of	O
some	O
goods	O
by	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
general	O

that	O
he	O

the	O
city	O
some	O
time	O
after	O
our	O
arrival	O

,	O
Raja	O

brought	O
him	O
bound	O
to	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
desiring	O
him	O
to	O
punish	O
him	O
for	O
it	O
as	O
he	O
pleased	O
;	O
but	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
excused	O
himself	O
and	O
said	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
belong	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
therefore	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
it	O
.	O

However	O
the	O
General	O
Raja	O
Laut	O
would	O
not	O
pardon	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
punished	O
him	O
according	O
to	O
their	O
own	O
custom	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
did	O
never	O
see	O
but	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
stripped	O
stark	O
naked	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
at	O
sun-rising	O
,	O
and	O
bound	O
to	O
a	O
post	O

so	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
stir	O
hand	O
nor	O
foot	O

as	O
he	O
was	O
moved	O

and	O
was	O
placed	O
with	O
his	O
face	O
eastward	O
against	O
the	O
sun	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
they	O
turned	O
his	O
face	O
towards	O
the	O
west	O
that	O
the	O
sun	O
might	O
still	O
be	O
in	O
his	O
face	O

and	O
thus	O
he	O
stood	O
all	O

parched	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
-LRB-	O
which	O
shines	O
here	O
excessively	O
hot	O
-RRB-	O
and	O
tormented	O
with	O
the	O
mosquitoes	O
or	O
gnats	O
:	O
after	O
this	O
the	O
general	O
would	O
have	O
killed	O
him	O
if	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
had	O
consented	O
to	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
did	O
never	O
see	O
any	O
put	O
to	O
death	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
believe	O
they	O
are	O
barbarous	O
enough	O
in	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
general	O
told	O
us	O
himself	O
that	O
he	O
put	O
two	O
men	O
to	O
death	O
in	O
a	O
town	O
where	O
some	O
of	O
us	O
were	O
with	O
him	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
heard	O
not	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

Their	O
common	O
way	O
of	O
punishing	O
is	O
to	O
strip	O
them	O
in	O
this	O
manner	O
and	O
place	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
;	O
but	O
sometimes	O
they	O
lay	O
them	O
flat	O
on	O
their	O
backs	O
on	O
the	O
sand	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
very	O
hot	O
;	O
where	O
they	O
remain	O
a	O
whole	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
scorching	O
sun	O
with	O
the	O
mosquitoes	O
biting	O
them	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
.	O

This	O
action	O
of	O
the	O
general	O
in	O
offering	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
the	O
punishment	O
of	O
the	O
thief	O
caused	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
afterwards	O
to	O
make	O
him	O
the	O
same	O
offer	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
when	O
any	O
had	O
offended	O
the	O
Mindanao	O
men	O
:	O
but	O
the	O
general	O
left	O
such	O
offenders	O
to	O
be	O
punished	O
by	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
as	O
he	O
thought	O
convenient	O
.	O

So	O
that	O
for	O
the	O
least	O
offence	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
punished	O
his	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
Mindanayans	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
sometimes	O
only	O
for	O
revenge	O
;	O
as	O
he	O
did	O
once	O
punish	O
his	O
chief	O
mate	O
Mr.	O
Teat	O
,	O
he	O
that	O
came	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
bark	O
to	O
Mindanao	PNM
.	O

Indeed	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
had	O
his	O
men	O
as	O
much	O
under	O
command	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
a	O
king	O

and	O
had	O
he	O
known	O
how	O

use	O
his	O
authority	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
led	O
them	O
to	O
any	O

brought	O
them	O
to	O
assist	O

Captain	O
Swan	O
being	O
dismissed	O
from	O
the	O
sultan	O
,	O
with	O
abundance	O
of	O
civility	O
,	O
after	O
about	O
two	O
hours	O
'	O
discourse	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
went	O
thence	O
to	O
Raja	PNM
Laut	PNM
's	O
house	O
.	O

Raja	O
Laut	O
had	O
then	O
some	O
difference	O
with	O
the	O
sultan	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
present	O
at	O
the	O
sultan	O
's	O
reception	O
of	O
our	O
captain	O
but	O
waited	O
his	O
return	O
and	O
treated	O
him	O
and	O
all	O
his	O
men	O
with	O
boiled	O
rice	O
and	O
fowls	O
.	O

He	O
then	O
told	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
urged	O
it	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
best	O
to	O
get	O
his	O
ship	O
into	O
the	O
river	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
could	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
usual	O
tempestuous	O
weather	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
want	O
no	O
assistance	O
to	O
further	O
him	O
in	O
anything	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
him	O
also	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
must	O
of	O
necessity	O
stay	O
here	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
so	O
our	O
men	O
would	O
often	O
come	O
ashore	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
therefore	O
desired	O
him	O
to	O
warn	O
his	O
men	O
to	O
be	O
careful	O
to	O
give	O
no	O
affront	O
to	O
the	O
natives	O
;	O
who	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
were	O
very	O
revengeful	O
.	O

That	O
their	O
customs	O
being	O
different	O
from	O
ours	O
,	O
he	O
feared	O
that	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
's	O
men	O
might	O
some	O
time	O
or	O
other	O
offend	O
them	O
,	O
though	O
ignorantly	O
;	O
that	O
therefore	O
he	O
gave	O
him	O
this	O
friendly	O
warning	O
to	O
prevent	O
it	O
:	O
that	O
his	O
house	O
should	O
always	O
be	O
open	O
to	O
receive	O
him	O
or	O
any	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
,	O
knowing	O
our	O
customs	O
,	O
would	O
never	O
be	O
offended	O
at	O
anything	O
.	O

After	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
such	O
discourse	O
he	O
dismissed	O
the	O
Captain	O
and	O
his	O
company	O
,	O
who	O
took	O
their	O
leave	O
and	O
came	O
aboard	O
.	O

Captain	O
Swan	O
,	O
having	O
seen	O
the	O
two	O
letters	O
,	O
did	O
not	O
doubt	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
English	O
did	O
design	O
to	O
settle	O
a	O
factory	O
here	O
:	O
therefore	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
much	O
scruple	O
the	O
honesty	O
of	O
these	O
people	O
,	O
but	O
immediately	O
ordered	O
us	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
ship	O
into	O
the	O
river	O
.	O

The	O
river	O
upon	O
which	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Mindanao	PNM
stands	O
is	O
but	O
small	O
and	O
has	O
not	O
above	O
10	O
or	O
11	O
foot	O
water	O
on	O
the	O
bar	O
at	O
a	O
spring-tide	O
:	O
therefore	O
we	O
lightened	O
our	O
ship	O
and	O
,	O
the	O
spring	O
coming	O
on	O
,	O
we	O
with	O
much	O
ado	O
got	O
her	O
into	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
being	O
assisted	O
by	O
50	O
or	O
60	O
Mindanayan	O
fishermen	O
who	O
lived	O
at	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
;	O
Raja	O
Laut	O
himself	O
being	O
aboard	O
our	O
ship	O
to	O
direct	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
carried	O
her	O
about	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
up	O
,	O
within	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
moored	O
her	O
head	O
and	O
stern	O
in	O
a	O
hole	O
where	O
we	O
always	O
rode	O
afloat	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
the	O
citizens	O
of	O
Mindanao	O
came	O
frequently	O
aboard	O
to	O
invite	O
our	O
men	O
to	O
their	O
houses	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
offer	O
us	O
pagallies	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
since	O
any	O
of	O
us	O
had	O
received	O
such	O
friendship	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
we	O
were	O
the	O
more	O
easily	O
drawn	O
to	O
accept	O
of	O
their	O
kindnesses	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
short	O
time	O
most	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
got	O
a	O
comrade	O
or	O
two	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
many	O
pagallies	O
;	O
especially	O
such	O
of	O
us	O
as	O
had	O
good	O
clothes	O
and	O
store	O
of	O
gold	O
,	O
as	O
many	O
had	O
who	O
were	O
of	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
those	O
that	O
accompanied	O
Captain	O
Harris	O
over	O
the	O
Isthmus	O
of	O
Darien	O
,	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
us	O
being	O
poor	O
enough	O
.	O

Nay	O
,	O
the	O
very	O
poorest	O
and	O
meanest	O
of	O
us	O
could	O
hardly	O
pass	O
the	O
streets	O
but	O
we	O
were	O
even	O
hauled	O
by	O
force	O
into	O
their	O
houses	O
to	O
be	O
treated	O
by	O
them	O
:	O
although	O
their	O
treats	O
were	O
but	O
mean	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
tobacco	O
,	O
or	O
betel-nut	O
,	O
or	O
a	O
little	O
sweet	O
spiced	O
water	O
;	O
yet	O
their	O
seeming	O
sincerity	O
,	O
simplicity	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
bestowing	O
these	O
gifts	O
made	O
them	O
very	O
acceptable	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
their	O
houses	O
they	O
would	O
always	O
be	O
praising	O
the	O
English	O
,	O
as	O
declaring	O
that	O
the	O
English	O
and	O
Mindanayans	O
were	O
all	O
one	O
.	O

This	O
they	O
expressed	O
by	O
putting	O
their	O
two	O
forefingers	O
close	O
together	O
and	O
saying	O
that	O
the	O
English	O
and	O
Mindanayans	O
were	O
``	O
samo	O
,	O
samo	O
,	O
''	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
all	O
one	O
.	O

Then	O
they	O
would	O
draw	O
their	O
forefingers	O
half	O
a	O
foot	O
asunder	O
and	O
say	O
the	O
Dutch	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
``	O
bugeto	O
,	O
''	O
which	O
signifies	O
so	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
at	O
such	O
distance	O
in	O
point	O
of	O
friendship	O
:	O
and	O
for	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
they	O
would	O
make	O
a	O
greater	O
representation	O
of	O
distance	O
than	O
for	O
the	O
Dutch	O
:	O
fearing	O
these	O
,	O
but	O
having	O
felt	O
and	O
smarted	O
from	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
who	O
had	O
once	O
almost	O
brought	O
them	O
under	O
.	O

Captain	O
Swan	O
did	O
seldom	O
go	O
into	O
any	O
house	O
at	O
first	O
but	O
into	O
Raja	PNM
Laut	PNM
's	PNM
.	O

There	O
he	O
dined	O
commonly	O
every	O
day	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
many	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
as	O
were	O
ashore	O
and	O
had	O
no	O
money	O
to	O
entertain	O
themselves	O
resorted	O
thither	O
about	O
12	O
a	O
clock	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
rice	O
enough	O
boiled	O
and	O
well	O
dressed	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
scraps	O
of	O
fowls	O
,	O
or	O
bits	O
of	O
buffalo	O
,	O
dressed	O
very	O
nastily	O

Captain	O
Swan	O
was	O
served	O
a	O
little	O
better	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
two	O
trumpeters	O
sounded	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
at	O
dinner	O
.	O

After	O
dinner	O
Raja	O
Laut	O
would	O
sit	O
and	O
discourse	O
with	O
him	O
most	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
afternoon	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
now	O
the	O
Ramdam	O
time	O
,	O
therefore	O
the	O
general	O
excused	O
himself	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
entertain	O
our	O
captain	O
with	O
dances	O
and	O
other	O
pastimes	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
intended	O
to	O
do	O
when	O
this	O
solemn	O
time	O
was	O
past	O
;	O
besides	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
very	O
height	O
of	O
the	O
wet	O
season	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
not	O
so	O
proper	O
for	O
pastimes	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
now	O
very	O
tempestuous	O
weather	O
and	O
excessive	O
rains	O
which	O
so	O
swelled	O
the	O
river	O
that	O
it	O
overflowed	O
its	O
banks	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
much	O
ado	O
to	O
keep	O
our	O
ship	O
safe	O
:	O
for	O
every	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
a	O
great	O
tree	O
come	O
floating	O
down	O
the	O
river	O
and	O
sometimes	O
lodge	O
against	O
our	O
bows	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
endangering	O
the	O
breaking	O
our	O
cables	O
,	O
and	O
either	O
the	O
driving	O
us	O
in	O
over	O
the	O
banks	O
or	O
carrying	O
us	O
out	O
to	O
sea	O
;	O
both	O
which	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
dangerous	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
especially	O
being	O
without	O
ballast	O

The	O
city	O

about	O
a	O

on	O
the	O

But	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
it	O
seemed	O
to	O
stand	O
as	O
in	O
a	O
pond	O

and	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
passing	O
from	O
one	O

in	O
Canoas	O

This	O
tempestuous	O

happened	O
the	O

lasted	O
most	O

When	O
the	O

was	O
a	O
little	O
assuaged	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
hired	O
a	O
house	O
to	O

our	O
sails	O

goods	O
in	O
while	O
we	O
careen	O
'd	O
our	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
iron	O

which	O
was	O
brought	O
ashore	O
into	O
this	O

Captain	O

8	O

The	O
Mindanayans	O
are	O
no	O

the	O

that	O

cast	O
up	O
their	O

for	O
them	O

After	O
this	O
Captain	O

bought	O
timber-trees	O

wherewith	O
the	O

After	O

was	O
so	O

against	O

that	O
he	O
could	O
never	O

him	O
afterwards	O

nothing	O

About	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
November	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
work	O
on	O
our	O
ship	O
's	O
bottom	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
very	O
much	O
eaten	O
with	O
the	O
worm	O
:	O
for	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
horrid	O
place	O
for	O
worms	O
.	O

We	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
this	O
till	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
a	O
month	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
found	O
our	O
Canoas	O
'	O
bottoms	O
eaten	O
like	O
honeycombs	O
;	O
our	O
bark	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
single	O
bottom	O
,	O
was	O
eaten	O
through	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
she	O
could	O
not	O
swim	O
.	O

But	O
our	O
ship	O
was	O
sheathed	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
worm	O
came	O
no	O
further	O
than	O
the	O
hair	O
between	O
the	O
sheathing	O
plank	O
and	O
the	O
main	O
plank	O
.	O

We	O
did	O
not	O
mistrust	O
the	O
general	O
's	O
knavery	O
till	O
now	O
:	O
for	O
when	O
he	O
came	O
down	O
to	O
our	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
us	O
ripping	O
off	O
the	O
sheathing	O
plank	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
the	O
firm	O
bottom	O
underneath	O
,	O
he	O
shook	O
his	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
discontented	O
;	O
saying	O
he	O
did	O
never	O
see	O
a	O
ship	O
with	O
two	O
bottoms	O
before	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
told	O
that	O
in	O
this	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
now	O
lay	O
a	O
Dutch	O
ship	O
was	O
eaten	O
up	O
in	O
2	O
months	O
'	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
general	O
had	O
all	O
her	O
guns	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
probable	O
he	O
did	O
expect	O
to	O
have	O
had	O
ours	O
:	O
which	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
was	O
the	O
main	O
reason	O
that	O
made	O
him	O
so	O
forward	O
in	O
assisting	O
us	O
to	O
get	O
our	O
ship	O
into	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
for	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
out	O
again	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
assistance	O
from	O
him	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
no	O
worms	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
this	O
place	O
:	O
for	O
when	O
we	O
careen	O
'd	O
at	O
the	O
Marias	O
the	O
worm	O
had	O
not	O
touched	O
us	O
;	O
nor	O
at	O
Guam	PNM
,	O
for	O
there	O
we	O
scrubbed	O
;	O
nor	O
after	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
Mindanao	PNM
;	O
for	O
at	O
the	O
south-east	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
we	O
heeled	O
and	O
scrubbed	O
also	O
.	O

The	O
Mindanayans	O
are	O
so	O
sensible	O
of	O
these	O
destructive	O
insects	O
that	O
whenever	O
they	O
come	O
from	O
sea	O
they	O
immediately	O
haul	O
their	O
ship	O
into	O
a	O
dry	O
dock	O
,	O
and	O
burn	O
her	O
bottom	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
let	O
her	O
lie	O
dry	O
till	O
they	O
are	O
ready	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
sea	O
again	O
.	O

The	O
Canoas	O
or	O
proas	O
they	O
haul	O
up	O
dry	O
and	O
never	O
suffer	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
long	O
in	O
the	O
water	O

It	O
is	O
reported	O
that	O
those	O
worms	O
which	O
get	O
into	O
a	O
ship	O
's	O
bottom	O
in	O
the	O
salt	O
water	O
will	O
die	O
in	O
the	O
fresh	O
water	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
fresh-water	O
worms	O
will	O
die	O
in	O
salt	O
water	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
brackish	O
water	O
both	O
sorts	O
will	O
increase	O
prodigiously	O
.	O

Now	O
this	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
lay	O
was	O
sometimes	O
brackish	O
water	O
,	O
yet	O
commonly	O
fresh	O
;	O
but	O
what	O
sort	O
of	O
worm	O
this	O
was	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
.	O

Some	O
men	O
are	O
of	O
opinion	O
that	O
these	O
worms	O
breed	O
in	O
the	O
plank	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
am	O
persuaded	O
they	O
breed	O
in	O
the	O
sea	O
:	O
for	O
I	O
have	O
seen	O
millions	O
of	O
them	O
swimming	O
in	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
particularly	O
in	O
the	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM
Panama	PNM
;	O
for	O
there	O
Captain	O
Davis	O
,	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
,	O
and	O
myself	O
and	O
most	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
did	O
take	O
notice	O
of	O
them	O
divers	O
times	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
reason	O
of	O
our	O
cleaning	O
so	O
often	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
there	O
:	O
and	O
these	O
were	O
the	O
largest	O
worms	O
that	O
I	O
did	O
ever	O
see	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
also	O
seen	O
them	O
in	O
Virginia	PNM
and	O
in	O
the	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM
Campeachy	PNM
;	O
in	O
the	O
latter	O
of	O
which	O
places	O
the	O
worms	O
eat	O
prodigiously	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
always	O
in	O
bays	O
,	O
creeks	O
,	O
mouths	O
of	O
rivers	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
places	O
as	O
are	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
being	O
never	O
found	O
far	O
out	O
at	O
sea	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
ever	O
learn	O
:	O
yet	O
a	O
ship	O
will	O
bring	O
them	O
lodged	O
in	O
its	O
plank	O
for	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
.	O

Having	O
thus	O
ripped	O
off	O
all	O
our	O
worm-eaten	O
plank	O
and	O
clapped	O
on	O
new	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
December	O
1686	O
,	O
our	O
ship	O
's	O
bottom	O
was	O
sheathed	O
and	O
tallowed	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
10th	O
day	O
we	O
went	O
over	O
the	O
bar	O
and	O
took	O
aboard	O
the	O
iron	O
and	O
lead	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
sell	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
fill	O
our	O
water	O
and	O
fetch	O
aboard	O
rice	O
for	O
our	O
voyage	O
:	O
but	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
remained	O
ashore	O
still	O
and	O
was	O
not	O
yet	O
determined	O
when	O
to	O
sail	O
or	O
whither	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
am	O
well	O
assured	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
never	O
intend	O
to	O
cruise	O
about	O
Manila	PNM
,	O
as	O
his	O
crew	O
designed	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
did	O
once	O
ask	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
already	O
done	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
he	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
;	O
but	O
now	O
being	O
at	O
liberty	O
he	O
would	O
never	O
more	O
engage	O
in	O
any	O
such	O
design	O
:	O
for	O
,	O
said	O
he	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
prince	O
on	O
Earth	O
is	O
able	O
to	O
wipe	O
off	O
the	O
stain	O
of	O
such	O
actions	O
.	O

What	O
other	O
designs	O
he	O
had	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
was	O
commonly	O
very	O
cross	O
;	O
yet	O
he	O
did	O
never	O
propose	O
doing	O
anything	O
else	O
,	O
but	O
only	O
ordered	O
the	O
provision	O
to	O
be	O
got	O
aboard	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
sail	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
confident	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
made	O
a	O
motion	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
any	O
English	O
factory	O
most	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
would	O
have	O
consented	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
though	O
probably	O
some	O
would	O
have	O
still	O
opposed	O
it	O
.	O

However	O
his	O
authority	O
might	O
soon	O
have	O
over-swayed	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
refractory	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
strange	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
awe	O
that	O
these	O
men	O
were	O
in	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
punished	O
the	O
most	O
stubborn	O
and	O
daring	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
.	O

Yet	O
when	O
we	O
had	O
brought	O
the	O
ship	O
out	O
into	O
the	O
road	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
altogether	O
so	O
submissive	O
as	O
while	O
it	O
lay	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
though	O
even	O
then	O
it	O
was	O
that	O
he	O
punished	O
Captain	O
Teat	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
a-hunting	O
with	O
the	O
general	O
for	O
beef	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
promised	O
us	O
.	O

But	O
now	O
I	O
saw	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
credit	O
to	O
be	O
given	O
to	O
his	O
word	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
week	O
out	O
with	O
him	O
and	O
saw	O
but	O
four	O
cows	O
which	O
were	O
so	O
wild	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
get	O
one	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
more	O
of	O
our	O
company	O
with	O
me	O
;	O
these	O
who	O
were	O
young	O
men	O
and	O
had	O
Delilahs	O
there	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
them	O
fond	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
all	O
agreed	O
with	O
the	O
general	O
to	O
tell	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
beeves	O
enough	O
,	O
only	O
they	O
were	O
wild	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
the	O
truth	O
,	O
and	O
advised	O
him	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
too	O
credulous	O
of	O
the	O
general	O
's	O
promises	O
.	O

He	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
angry	O
,	O
and	O
stormed	O
behind	O
the	O
general	O
's	O
back	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
his	O
presence	O
was	O
very	O
mute	O
,	O
being	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
small	O
courage	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
about	O
the	O
20th	O
day	O
of	O
December	O
when	O
we	O
returned	O
from	O
hunting	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
general	O
designed	O
to	O
go	O
again	O
to	O
another	O
place	O
to	O
hunt	O
for	O
beef	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
stayed	O
till	O
after	O
Christmas	O
Day	O
because	O
some	O
of	O
us	O
designed	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
had	O
desired	O
all	O
his	O
men	O
to	O
be	O
aboard	O
that	O
day	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
keep	O
it	O
solemnly	O
together	O
:	O
and	O
accordingly	O
he	O
sent	O
aboard	O
a	O
buffalo	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
a	O
good	O
dinner	O
.	O

So	O
the	O
25th	O
day	O
about	O
10	O
a	O
clock	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
came	O
aboard	O
and	O
all	O
his	O
men	O
who	O
were	O
ashore	O
:	O
for	O
you	O
must	O
understand	O
that	O
near	O
a	O
third	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
lived	O
constantly	O
ashore	O
with	O
their	O
comrades	O
and	O
pagallies	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
with	O
women-servants	O
whom	O
they	O
hired	O
of	O
their	O
masters	O
for	O
concubines	O
.	O

Some	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
also	O
had	O
houses	O
which	O
they	O
hired	O
or	O
bought	O
,	O
for	O
houses	O
are	O
very	O
cheap	O
,	O
for	O
5	O
or	O
6	O
dollars	O
.	O

For	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
having	O
more	O
money	O
than	O
they	O
knew	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
,	O
eased	O
themselves	O
here	O
of	O
the	O
trouble	O
of	O
telling	O
it	O
,	O
spending	O
it	O
very	O
lavishly	O
,	O
their	O
prodigality	O
making	O
the	O
people	O
impose	O
upon	O
them	O

to	O
the	O

the	O

the	O
dearer	O
for	O
what	O
we	O

and	O

the	O

impositions	O
upon	O
such	O
Englishmen	O
as	O
may	O
come	O
here	O
hereafter	O
.	O

For	O
the	O
Mindanayans	O
knew	O
how	O
to	O
get	O
our	O
squires	O
gold	O
from	O
them	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
silver	O
-RRB-	O
and	O
when	O
our	O
men	O
wanted	O
silver	O
they	O
would	O
change	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
an	O
ounce	O
of	O
gold	O
and	O
could	O
get	O
for	O
it	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
ten	O
or	O
eleven	O
dollars	O
for	O
a	O
Mindanao	O
ounce	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
part	O
with	O
again	O
under	O
eighteen	O
dollars	O
.	O

Yet	O
this	O
and	O
the	O
great	O
prices	O
the	O
Mindanayans	O
set	O
on	O
their	O
goods	O
were	O
not	O
the	O
only	O
way	O
to	O
lessen	O
their	O
stocks	O
;	O
for	O
their	O
pagallies	O
and	O
comrades	O
would	O
often	O
be	O
begging	O
somewhat	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
were	O
generous	O
enough	O
and	O
would	O
bestow	O
half	O
an	O
ounce	O
of	O
gold	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
ring	O
for	O
their	O

or	O
in	O
a	O
silver	O
wrist-band	O

in	O

When	O
we	O
are	O
all	O
aboard	O
on	O
Christmas	O
Day	O
,	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
and	O
his	O
two	O
merchants	O

I	O
did	O

that	O

would	O
have	O
made	O
some	O

he	O
only	O
dined	O

went	O
ashore	O
again	O
without	O

anything	O
of	O

Yet	O
even	O

I	O
do	O
think	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
driving	O
on	O
a	O
design	O
of	O
going	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Spice	PNM
Islands	PNM
to	O
load	O
with	O
Spice	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
young	O
man	O
before	O
mentioned	O
,	O
who	O
I	O
said	O
was	O
sent	O
by	O
his	O
uncle	O
,	O
the	O
sultan	O
of	O
a	O
Spice	O
Island	O
near	O
Ternate	O
,	O
to	O
invite	O
the	O
English	O
to	O
their	O
island	O
,	O
came	O
aboard	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
some	O
private	O
discourse	O
with	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
they	O
both	O
went	O
ashore	O
together	O
.	O

This	O
young	O
man	O
did	O
not	O
care	O
that	O
the	O
Mindanayans	O
should	O
be	O
privy	O
to	O
what	O
he	O
said	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
heard	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
say	O
that	O
he	O
offered	O
to	O
load	O
his	O
ship	O
with	O
spice	O
provided	O
he	O
would	O
build	O
a	O
small	O
fort	O
and	O
leave	O
some	O
men	O
to	O
secure	O
the	O
island	O
from	O
the	O
Dutch	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
am	O
since	O
informed	O
that	O
the	O
Dutch	O
have	O
now	O
got	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
island	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
after	O
Christmas	O
,	O
the	O
general	O
went	O
away	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
5	O
or	O
6	O
Englishmen	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
of	O
whom	O
I	O
was	O
one	O
,	O
under	O
pretence	O
of	O
going	O
a-hunting	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
all	O
went	O
together	O
by	O
water	O
in	O
his	O
proa	O
,	O
together	O
with	O
his	O
women	O
and	O
servants	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
hunting-place	O
.	O

The	O
general	O
always	O
carried	O
his	O
wives	O
and	O
children	O
,	O
his	O
servants	O
,	O
his	O
money	O
and	O
goods	O
with	O
him	O
:	O
so	O
we	O
all	O
embarked	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
and	O
arrived	O
there	O
before	O
night	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
already	O
described	O
the	O
fashion	O
of	O
their	O
proas	O
and	O
the	O
rooms	O
made	O
in	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
entertained	O
in	O
the	O
general	O
's	O
room	O
or	O
cabin	O
.	O

Our	O
voyage	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
far	O
but	O
that	O
we	O
reached	O
our	O
fort	O
before	O
night	O
.	O

At	O
this	O
time	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
general	O
's	O
servants	O
had	O
offended	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
punished	O
in	O
this	O
manner	O
:	O
he	O
was	O
bound	O
fast	O
flat	O
on	O
his	O
belly	O
on	O
a	O
bamboo	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
prow	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
so	O
near	O
the	O
water	O
that	O
by	O
the	O
vessel	O
's	O
motion	O
it	O
frequently	O
delved	O
under	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
man	O
along	O
with	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
sometimes	O
when	O
hoisted	O
up	O
he	O
had	O
scarce	O
time	O
to	O
blow	O
before	O
he	O
would	O
be	O
carried	O
under	O
water	O
again	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
rowed	O
about	O
two	O
leagues	O
we	O
entered	O
a	O
pretty	O
large	O
deep	O
river	O
and	O
rowed	O
up	O
a	O
league	O
further	O
,	O
the	O
water	O
salt	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
pretty	O
large	O
village	O
,	O
the	O
houses	O
built	O
after	O
the	O
country	O
fashion	O
.	O

We	O
landed	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
,	O
where	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
house	O
made	O
ready	O
immediately	O
for	O
us	O
.	O

The	O
general	O
and	O
his	O
women	O
lay	O
at	O
one	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
and	O
we	O
at	O
the	O
other	O
end	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
all	O
the	O
women	O
in	O
the	O
village	O
danced	O
before	O
the	O
general	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
stayed	O
here	O
the	O
general	O
with	O
his	O
men	O
went	O
out	O
every	O
morning	O
betimes	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
return	O
till	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
a	O
clock	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
would	O
often	O
compliment	O
us	O
by	O
telling	O
us	O
what	O
good	O
trust	O
and	O
confidence	O
he	O
had	O
in	O
us	O
,	O
saying	O
that	O
he	O
left	O
his	O
women	O
and	O
goods	O
under	O
our	O
protection	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
thought	O
them	O
as	O
secure	O
with	O
us	O
six	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
all	O
our	O
arms	O
with	O
us	O
-RRB-	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
left	O
109	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
men	O
to	O
guard	O
them	O
.	O

Yet	O
for	O
all	O
this	O
great	O
confidence	O
he	O
always	O
left	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
principal	O
men	O
for	O
fear	O
some	O
of	O
us	O
should	O
be	O
too	O
familiar	O
with	O
his	O
women	O
.	O

They	O
did	O
never	O
stir	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
room	O
when	O
the	O
general	O
was	O
at	O
home	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
gone	O
out	O
they	O
would	O
presently	O
come	O
into	O
our	O
room	O
and	O
sit	O
with	O
us	O
all	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
ask	O
a	O
thousand	O
questions	O
of	O
us	O
concerning	O
our	O
Englishwomen	O
and	O
our	O
customs	O
.	O

You	O
may	O
imagine	O
that	O
before	O
this	O
time	O
some	O
of	O
us	O
had	O
attained	O
so	O
much	O
of	O
their	O
language	O
as	O
to	O
understand	O
them	O
and	O
give	O
them	O
answers	O
to	O
their	O
demands	O
.	O

I	O
remember	O
that	O
one	O
day	O
they	O
asked	O
how	O
many	O
wives	O
the	O
King	O
of	O
England	PNM
had	O
?	O

We	O
told	O
them	O
but	O
one	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
our	O
English	O
laws	O
did	O
not	O
allow	O
of	O
any	O
more	O
.	O

They	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
strange	O
custom	O
that	O
a	O
man	O
should	O
be	O
confined	O
to	O
one	O
woman	O
;	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
bad	O
law	O
,	O
but	O
others	O
again	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
law	O
;	O
so	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
dispute	O
among	O
them	O
about	O
it	O
.	O

But	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
general	O
's	O
women	O
said	O
positively	O
that	O
our	O
law	O
was	O
better	O
than	O
theirs	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
them	O
all	O
silent	O
by	O
the	O
reason	O
which	O
she	O
gave	O
for	O
it	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
War	O
Queen	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
called	O
her	O
,	O
for	O
she	O
did	O
always	O
accompany	O
the	O
general	O
whenever	O
he	O
was	O
called	O
out	O
to	O
engage	O
his	O
enemies	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
rest	O
did	O
not	O
.	O

By	O
this	O
familiarity	O
among	O
the	O
women	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
often	O
discoursing	O
them	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
be	O
acquainted	O
with	O
their	O
customs	O
and	O
privileges	O
.	O

The	O
general	O
lies	O
with	O
his	O
wives	O
by	O
turns	O
;	O
but	O
she	O
by	O
whom	O
he	O
had	O
the	O
first	O
son	O
has	O
a	O
double	O
portion	O
of	O
his	O
company	O
:	O
for	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
her	O
turn	O
she	O
has	O
him	O
two	O
nights	O
,	O
whereas	O
the	O
rest	O
have	O
him	O
but	O
one	O
.	O

She	O
with	O
whom	O
he	O
is	O
to	O
lie	O
at	O
night	O
seems	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
particular	O
respect	O
shown	O
her	O
by	O
the	O

all	O
the	O
precedent	O

and	O
for	O
a	O

wears	O
a	O
striped	O
silk	O
handkerchief	O
about	O
her	O
neck	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
we	O
knew	O
who	O
was	O
queen	O
that	O
day	O
.	O

1687	O
We	O
lay	O
here	O
about	O
5	O
or	O
6	O
days	O
but	O
did	O
never	O
in	O
all	O
that	O
time	O
see	O
the	O
least	O
sign	O
of	O
any	O
beef	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
business	O
we	O
came	O
about	O
,	O
neither	O
were	O
we	O
suffered	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
with	O
the	O
general	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
wild	O
kine	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
wanted	O
for	O
nothing	O
else	O
:	O
however	O
this	O
did	O
not	O
please	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
often	O
importuned	O
him	O
to	O
let	O
us	O
go	O
out	O
among	O
the	O
cattle	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
he	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
provided	O
a	O
jar	O
of	O
rice-drink	O
to	O
be	O
merry	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
go	O
with	O
him	O
.	O

This	O
rice-drink	O
is	O
made	O
of	O
rice	O
boiled	O
and	O
put	O
into	O
a	O
jar	O
,	O
where	O
it	O
remains	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
steeping	O
in	O
water	O
.	O

I	O
know	O
not	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
making	O
it	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
strong	O
pleasant	O
drink	O
.	O

The	O
evening	O
when	O
the	O
general	O
designed	O
to	O
be	O
merry	O
he	O
caused	O
a	O
jar	O
of	O
this	O
drink	O
to	O
be	O
brought	O
into	O
our	O
room	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
drink	O
first	O
himself	O
,	O
then	O
afterwards	O
his	O
men	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
took	O
turns	O
till	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
as	O
drunk	O
as	O
swine	O
before	O
they	O
suffered	O
us	O
to	O
drink	O
.	O

After	O
they	O
had	O
enough	O
then	O
we	O
drank	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
drank	O
no	O
more	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
will	O
not	O
drink	O
after	O
us	O
.	O

The	O
general	O
leapt	O
about	O
our	O
room	O
a	O
little	O
while	O
;	O
but	O
having	O
his	O
load	O
soon	O
went	O
to	O
sleep	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
we	O
went	O
out	O
with	O
the	O
general	O
into	O
the	O
savannah	O
where	O
he	O
had	O
near	O
100	O
men	O
making	O
of	O
a	O
large	O
pen	O
to	O
drive	O
the	O
cattle	O
into	O
.	O

For	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
their	O
hunting	O
,	O
having	O
no	O
dogs	O
,	O
But	O
I	O
saw	O
not	O
above	O
eight	O
or	O
ten	O
cows	O
;	O
and	O
those	O
as	O
wild	O
as	O
deer	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
got	O
none	O
this	O
day	O
:	O
yet	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
some	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
brought	O
in	O
three	O
heifers	O
which	O
they	O
killed	O
in	O
the	O
savannah	O
.	O

With	O
these	O
we	O
returned	O
aboard	O
,	O
they	O
being	O
all	O
that	O
we	O
got	O
there	O
.	O

Captain	O
Swan	O
was	O
much	O
vexed	O
at	O
the	O
general	O
's	O
actions	O
for	O
he	O
promised	O
to	O
supply	O
us	O
with	O
as	O
much	O
beef	O
as	O
we	O
should	O
want	O
,	O
but	O
now	O
either	O
could	O
not	O
or	O
would	O
not	O
make	O
good	O
his	O
promise	O
.	O

Besides	O
,	O
he	O
failed	O
to	O
perform	O
his	O
promise	O
in	O
a	O
bargain	O
of	O
rice	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
have	O
for	O
the	O
iron	O
which	O
we	O
sold	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
put	O
us	O
off	O
still	O
from	O
time	O
to	O
time	O
and	O
would	O
not	O
come	O
to	O
any	O
account	O

Neither	O
were	O
these	O
all	O
his	O
tricks	O
;	O
for	O
a	O
little	O
before	O
his	O
son	O
was	O
circumcised	O
-LRB-	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
spoke	O
in	O
the	O
foregoing	O
chapter	O
-RRB-	O
he	O
pretended	O
a	O
great	O
strait	O
for	O
money	O
to	O
defray	O
the	O
charges	O
of	O
that	O
day	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
desired	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
to	O
lend	O
him	O
about	O
twenty	O
ounces	O
of	O
gold	O
;	O
for	O
he	O
knew	O
that	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
had	O
a	O
considerable	O
quantity	O
of	O
gold	O
in	O
his	O
possession	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
general	O
thought	O
was	O
his	O
own	O
,	O
but	O
indeed	O
he	O
had	O
none	O
but	O
what	O
belonged	O
to	O
the	O
merchants	O
.	O

However	O
he	O
lent	O
it	O
the	O
general	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
account	O
with	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
he	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
usual	O
at	O
such	O
solemn	O
times	O
to	O
make	O
presents	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
received	O
it	O
as	O
a	O
gift	O
.	O

He	O
also	O
demanded	O
payment	O
for	O
the	O
victuals	O
that	O
our	O
captain	O
and	O
his	O
men	O
did	O
eat	O
at	O
his	O
house	O
.	O

These	O
things	O
startled	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
,	O
yet	O
how	O
to	O
help	O
himself	O
he	O
knew	O
not	O
.	O

But	O
all	O
this	O
,	O
with	O
other	O
inward	O
troubles	O
,	O
lay	O
hard	O
on	O
our	O
captain	O

spirits	O
and	O
put	O
him	O
very	O
much	O
out	O
of	O
humour	O
;	O
for	O
his	O

were	O
pressing	O
him	O
every	O

to	O

not	O
long	O
before	O
the	O
Mindanao	O
vessel	O
came	O
from	O
thence	O
and	O
brought	O
a	O
letter	O
directed	O
to	O
the	O
chief	O
of	O
the	O
English	O
factory	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM
.	O

This	O
letter	O
the	O
general	O
would	O
have	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
have	O
opened	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
thought	O
it	O
might	O
come	O
from	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
East	O
India	PNM
merchants	O
whose	O
affairs	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
intermeddle	O
with	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
did	O
not	O
open	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
since	O
met	O
with	O
Captain	O
Bowry	O
at	O
Achin	PNM
and	O
,	O
telling	O
him	O
this	O
story	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
that	O
he	O
sent	O
that	O
letter	O
,	O
supposing	O
that	O
the	O
English	O
were	O
settled	O
there	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM
;	O
and	O
by	O
this	O
letter	O
we	O
also	O
thought	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
an	O
English	O
factory	O
at	O
Borneo	PNM
:	O
so	O
here	O
was	O
a	O
mistake	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
.	O

But	O
this	O
canoa	O
,	O
wherewith	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
thought	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Borneo	PNM
,	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
took	O
from	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
threatened	O
the	O
undertakers	O
very	O
hardly	O
.	O

However	O
this	O
did	O
not	O
so	O
far	O
discourage	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
secretly	O
bought	O
another	O
;	O
but	O
their	O
designs	O
taking	O
air	O
they	O
were	O
again	O
frustrated	O
by	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
.	O

The	O
whole	O
crew	O
were	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
under	O
a	O
general	O
disaffection	O
and	O
full	O
of	O
very	O
different	O
projects	O
;	O
and	O
all	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
action	O
.	O

The	O
main	O
division	O
was	O
between	O
those	O
that	O
had	O
money	O
and	O
those	O
that	O
had	O
none	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
difference	O
in	O
the	O
humours	O
of	O
these	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
that	O
had	O
money	O
lived	O
ashore	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
care	O
for	O
leaving	O
Mindanao	O
;	O
whilst	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
poor	O
lived	O
aboard	O
and	O
urged	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
sea	O
.	O

These	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
unruly	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
dissatisfied	O
,	O
and	O
sent	O
ashore	O
the	O
merchants	O
'	O
iron	O
to	O
sell	O
for	O
rack	O
and	O
honey	O
to	O
make	O
punch	O
,	O
wherewith	O
they	O
grew	O
drunk	O
and	O
quarrelsome	O
:	O
which	O
disorderly	O
actions	O
deterred	O
me	O
from	O
going	O
aboard	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
did	O
ever	O
abhor	O
drunkenness	O
,	O
which	O
now	O
our	O
men	O
that	O
were	O
aboard	O
abandoned	O
themselves	O
wholly	O
to	O
.	O

Yet	O
these	O
disorders	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
crushed	O
if	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
had	O
used	O
his	O
authority	O
to	O
suppress	O
them	O
:	O
but	O
he	O
with	O
his	O
merchants	O
living	O
always	O
ashore	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
command	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
every	O
man	O
did	O
what	O
he	O
pleased	O
and	O
encouraged	O
each	O
other	O
in	O
his	O
villainies	O
.	O

Now	O
Mr.	O
Harthop	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
's	O
merchants	O
,	O
did	O
very	O
much	O
importune	O
him	O
to	O
settle	O
his	O
resolutions	O
and	O
declare	O
his	O
mind	O
to	O
his	O
men	O
;	O
which	O
at	O
last	O
he	O
consented	O
to	O
do	O
.	O

Therefore	O
he	O
gave	O
warning	O
to	O
all	O
his	O
men	O
to	O
come	O
aboard	O
the	O
13th	O
day	O
of	O
January	O
1687	O
.	O

We	O
did	O
all	O
earnestly	O
expect	O
to	O
hear	O
what	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
would	O
propose	O
and	O
therefore	O
were	O
very	O
willing	O
to	O
go	O
aboard	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
unluckily	O
for	O
him	O
,	O
two	O
days	O
before	O
this	O
meeting	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
sent	O
aboard	O
his	O
gunner	O
to	O
fetch	O
something	O
ashore	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
cabin	O
.	O

The	O
gunner	O
,	O
rummaging	O
to	O
find	O
what	O
he	O
was	O
sent	O
for	O
,	O
among	O
other	O
things	O
took	O
out	O
the	O
captain	O
's	O
journal	O
from	O
America	PNM
to	O
the	O
island	O
Guam	O
,	O
and	O
laid	O
down	O
by	O
him	O
.	O

This	O
journal	O
was	O
taken	O
up	O
by	O
one	O
John	O
Read	O
,	O
a	O
Bristol	O
man	O
whom	O
I	O
have	O
mentioned	O
in	O
my	O
4th	O
chapter	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
a	O
pretty	O
ingenious	O
young	O
man	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
civil	O
carriage	O
and	O
behaviour	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
also	O
accounted	O
a	O
good	O
artist	O
,	O
and	O
kept	O
a	O
journal	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
now	O
prompted	O
by	O
his	O
curiosity	O
to	O
peep	O
into	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
's	O
journal	O
to	O
see	O
how	O
it	O
agreed	O
with	O
his	O
own	O
,	O
a	O
thing	O
very	O
usual	O
among	O
the	O
seamen	O
that	O
keep	O
journals	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
have	O
an	O
opportunity	O
,	O
and	O
especially	O
young	O
men	O
who	O
have	O
no	O
great	O
experience	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
first	O
opening	O
of	O
the	O
book	O
he	O
lit	O
on	O
a	O
place	O
in	O
which	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
had	O
inveighed	O
bitterly	O
against	O
most	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
,	O
especially	O
against	O
another	O
John	O
Reed	O
a	O
Jamaica	PNM
man	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
such	O
stuff	O
as	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
seek	O
after	O
:	O
but	O
,	O
hitting	O
so	O
pat	O
on	O
this	O
subject	O
,	O
his	O
curiosity	O
led	O
him	O
to	O
pry	O
further	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
,	O
while	O
the	O
gunner	O
was	O
busy	O
,	O
he	O
conveyed	O
the	O
book	O
away	O
to	O
look	O
over	O
it	O
at	O
his	O
leisure	O
.	O

The	O
gunner	O
,	O
having	O
dispatched	O
his	O
business	O
,	O
locked	O
up	O
the	O
cabin-door	O
,	O
not	O
missing	O
the	O
book	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
ashore	O
.	O

Then	O
John	O
Reed	O
showed	O
it	O
to	O
his	O
namesake	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
rest	O
that	O
were	O
aboard	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
the	O
biggest	O
part	O
of	O
them	O
ripe	O
for	O
mischief	O
;	O
only	O
wanting	O
some	O
fair	O
pretence	O
to	O
set	O
themselves	O
to	O
work	O
about	O
it	O
.	O

Therefore	O
looking	O
on	O
what	O
was	O
written	O
in	O
this	O
journal	O
to	O
be	O
matter	O
sufficient	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
accomplish	O
their	O
ends	O
Captain	O
Teat	O
who	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
before	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
abused	O
by	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
,	O
laid	O
hold	O
on	O
this	O
opportunity	O
to	O
be	O
revenged	O
for	O
his	O
injuries	O
and	O
aggravated	O
the	O
matter	O
to	O
the	O
height	O
;	O
persuading	O
the	O
men	O
to	O
turn	O
out	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
from	O
being	O
commander	O
in	O
hopes	O
to	O
have	O
commanded	O
the	O
ship	O
himself	O
.	O

As	O
for	O
the	O
seamen	O
they	O
were	O
easily	O
persuaded	O
to	O
anything	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
quite	O
tired	O
with	O
this	O
long	O
and	O
tedious	O
voyage	O
,	O
and	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
despaired	O
of	O
ever	O
getting	O
home	O
and	O
therefore	O
did	O
not	O
care	O
what	O
they	O
did	O
or	O
whither	O
they	O
went	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
only	O
want	O
of	O
being	O
busied	O
in	O
some	O
action	O
that	O
made	O
them	O
so	O
uneasy	O
;	O
therefore	O
they	O
consented	O
to	O
what	O
Teat	O
proposed	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
all	O
that	O
were	O
aboard	O
bound	O
themselves	O
by	O
oath	O
to	O
turn	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
out	O
and	O
to	O
conceal	O
this	O
design	O
from	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
ashore	O
until	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
under	O
sail	O
;	O
which	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
presently	O
if	O
the	O
surgeon	O
or	O
his	O
mate	O
had	O
been	O
aboard	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
both	O
ashore	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
thought	O
it	O
no	O
prudence	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
sea	O
without	O
a	O
surgeon	O
:	O
therefore	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
they	O
sent	O
ashore	O
one	O
John	O
Cookworthy	O
to	O
hasten	O
off	O
either	O
the	O
surgeon	O
or	O
his	O
mate	O
by	O
pretending	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
broke	O
his	O
leg	O
by	O
falling	O
into	O
the	O
hold	O
.	O

The	O
surgeon	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
he	O
intended	O
to	O
come	O
aboard	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
with	O
the	O
captain	O
and	O
would	O
not	O
come	O
before	O
;	O
but	O
sent	O
his	O
mate	O
,	O
Herman	O
Coppinger	O
.	O

This	O
man	O
some	O
time	O
before	O
this	O
was	O
sleeping	O
at	O
his	O
pagallies	O
and	O
a	O
snake	O
twisted	O
himself	O
about	O
his	O
neck	O
;	O
but	O
afterwards	O
went	O
away	O
without	O
hurting	O
him	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
country	O
it	O
is	O
usual	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
snakes	O
come	O
into	O
the	O
houses	O
and	O
into	O
the	O
ships	O
too	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
several	O
came	O
aboard	O
our	O
ship	O
when	O
we	O
lay	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
.	O

But	O
to	O
proceed	O
,	O
Herman	O
Coppinger	O
provided	O
to	O
go	O
aboard	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
being	O
the	O
time	O
appointed	O
for	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
and	O
all	O
his	O
men	O
to	O
meet	O
aboard	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
aboard	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
neither	O
of	O
us	O
distrusted	O
what	O
was	O
designing	O
by	O
those	O
aboard	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
thither	O
.	O

Then	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
was	O
only	O
a	O
trick	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
surgeon	O
off	O
;	O
for	O
now	O
,	O
having	O
obtained	O
their	O
desires	O
,	O
the	O
canoa	O
was	O
sent	O
ashore	O
again	O
immediately	O
to	O
desire	O
as	O
many	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
meet	O
to	O
come	O
aboard	O
;	O
but	O
not	O
to	O
tell	O
the	O
reason	O
lest	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
should	O
come	O
to	O
hear	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
13th	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
they	O
weighed	O
and	O
fired	O
a	O
gun	O
:	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
immediately	O
sent	O
aboard	O
Mr.	O
Nelly	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
now	O
his	O
chief	O
mate	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
the	O
matter	O
was	O
:	O
to	O
him	O
they	O
told	O
all	O
their	O
grievances	O
and	O
showed	O
him	O
the	O
journal	O
.	O

He	O
persuaded	O
them	O
to	O
stay	O
till	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
for	O
an	O
answer	O
from	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
and	O
the	O
merchants	O
.	O

So	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
again	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
Mr.	O
Harthop	O
came	O
aboard	O
:	O
he	O
persuaded	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
reconciled	O
again	O
,	O
or	O
at	O
least	O
to	O
stay	O
and	O
get	O
more	O
rice	O
:	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
deaf	O
to	O
it	O
and	O
weighed	O
again	O
while	O
he	O
was	O
aboard	O
.	O

Yet	O
at	O
Mr.	O
Harthop	O
's	O
persuasion	O
they	O
promised	O
to	O
stay	O
till	O
two	O
a	O
clock	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
for	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
and	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
come	O
aboard	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
suffered	O
no	O
man	O
to	O
go	O
ashore	O
except	O
one	O
William	O
Williams	O
that	O
had	O
a	O
wooden	O
leg	O
and	O
another	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
sawyer	O
.	O

If	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
had	O
yet	O
come	O
aboard	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
dashed	O
all	O
their	O
designs	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
neither	O
came	O
himself	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
captain	O
of	O
any	O
prudence	O
and	O
courage	O
would	O
have	O
done	O
,	O
nor	O
sent	O
till	O
the	O
time	O
was	O
expired	O
.	O

So	O
we	O
left	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
and	O
about	O
36	O
men	O
ashore	O
in	O
the	O
city	O
,	O
and	O
six	O
or	O
eight	O
that	O
ran	O
away	O
;	O
and	O
about	O
16	O
we	O
had	O
buried	O
there	O
,	O
the	O
most	O
of	O
which	O
died	O
by	O
poison	O
.	O

The	O
natives	O
are	O
very	O
expert	O
at	O
poisoning	O
and	O
do	O
it	O
upon	O
small	O
occasions	O
:	O
nor	O
did	O
our	O
men	O
want	O
for	O
giving	O
offence	O
through	O
their	O
general	O
rogueries	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
by	O
dallying	O
too	O
familiarly	O
with	O
their	O
women	O
,	O
even	O
before	O
their	O
faces	O
.	O

Some	O
of	O
their	O
poisons	O
are	O
slow	O
and	O
lingering	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
some	O
now	O
aboard	O
who	O
were	O
poisoned	O
there	O
but	O
died	O
not	O
till	O
some	O

we	O

the	O

at	O

ought	O
to	O
be	O
about	O

we	O

the	O

in	O

this	O
going	O

of	O

between	O

Accordingly	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM
and	O
all	O
other	O
places	O
in	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
we	O
found	O
them	O
reckoning	O
a	O
day	O
before	O
us	O
,	O
both	O
natives	O
and	O
Europeans	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
Europeans	O
,	O
coming	O

the	O

of	PNM
Good	PNM

in	O
a	O

contrary	O
to	O

and	O
us	O
,	O
wherever	O
we	O
met	O
they	O
were	O
a	O
full	O
day	O
before	O
us	O
in	O
their	O
accounts	O
.	O

So	O
among	O
the	O
Indian	O
Mohammedans	O
here	O
their	O
Friday	O
,	O
the	O
day	O
of	O
their	O
sultan	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
their	O
mosques	O
,	O
was	O
Thursday	O
with	O
us	O
;	O
though	O
it	O
were	O
Friday	O
also	O
with	O
those	O
who	O
came	O
eastward	O
from	O
Europe	PNM
.	O

Yet	O
at	O
the	O
Ladrone	PNM
Islands	PNM
we	O
found	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
of	O
Guam	PNM
keeping	O
the	O
same	O
computation	O
with	O
ourselves	O
;	O
the	O
reason	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
take	O
to	O
be	O
that	O
they	O
settled	O
that	O
colony	O
by	O
a	O
course	O
westward	O
from	O
Spain	PNM
;	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
going	O
first	O
to	O
America	PNM
and	O
thence	O
to	O
the	O
Ladrones	O
and	O
Philippines	O
.	O

But	O
how	O
the	O
reckoning	O
was	O
at	O
Manila	PNM
and	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
Spanish	O
colonies	O
in	O
the	O
Philippine	O
Islands	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
;	O
whether	O
they	O
keep	O
it	O
as	O
they	O
brought	O
it	O
or	O
corrected	O
it	O
by	O
the	O
accounts	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
,	O
Dutch	O
,	O
and	O
English	O
,	O
coming	O
the	O
contrary	O
way	O
from	O
Europe	PNM
.	O

One	O
great	O
reason	O
why	O
seamen	O
ought	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
difference	O
of	O
time	O
as	O
exact	O
as	O
they	O
can	O
is	O
that	O
they	O
may	O
be	O
the	O
more	O
exact	O
in	O
their	O
latitudes	O
.	O

For	O
our	O
tables	O
of	O
the	O
sun	O
's	O
declination	O
,	O
being	O
calculated	O
for	O
the	O
meridians	O
of	O
the	O
places	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
made	O
,	O
differ	O
about	O
12	O
minutes	O
from	O
those	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
that	O
lie	O
on	O
their	O
opposite	O
meridians	O
in	O
the	O
months	O
of	O
March	O

September	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
proportion	O
to	O
the	O
sun	O
's	O
declination	O
at	O
other	O
times	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
also	O
.	O

And	O
should	O
they	O
run	O
farther	O
as	O
we	O
did	O
the	O
difference	O
would	O
still	O
increase	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
be	O
an	O
occasion	O
of	O
great	O
errors	O
.	O

Yet	O
even	O
able	O
seamen	O
in	O
these	O
voyages	O
are	O
hardly	O
made	O
sensible	O
of	O
this	O
,	O
though	O
so	O
necessary	O
to	O
be	O
observed	O
,	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
duly	O
attending	O
to	O
the	O
reason	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
happened	O
among	O
those	O
of	O
our	O
crew	O
;	O
who	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
passed	O
180	O
degrees	O
began	O
to	O
decrease	O
the	O
difference	O
of	O
declination	O
,	O
whereas	O
they	O
ought	O
still	O
to	O
have	O
increased	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
increased	O
upon	O
us	O

We	O
had	O

at	O
north-north-east	O

fair	O

and	O
a	O

We	O

on	O
the	O

the	O

The	O

and	O
very	O
woody	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
we	O
saw	O
high	O
hills	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
we	O
were	O
abreast	O
of	O
Chambongo	PNM
,	O
a	O
town	O
in	O
this	O
island	O
and	O
30	O
leagues	O
from	O

Here	O
is	O
said	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
good	O
harbour	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
settlement	O
with	O
plenty	O
of	O
beef	O

It	O
is	O
reported	O
that	O
the	O

there	O
are	O

two	O

the	O

yet	O
there	O
are	O
some	O

About	O
six	O
leagues	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
Mindanao	PNM
we	O
fell	O
in	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
many	O

and	O
about	O
two	O

there	O
is	O
a	O
long	O
island	O
stretching	O
north-east	O

south-west	O
about	O
12	O

This	O

is	O
low	O
by	O

there	O
is	O
a	O
good	O

among	O

there	O
is	O
a	O

on	O

I	O
know	O
not	O
,	O
nor	O
how	O

it	O

The	O
17th	O
day	O
we	O
anchored	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
of	O
all	O
these	O
keys	O
in	O
eight	O
fathom	O
water	O

Here	O
are	O

to	O
the	O
westward	O
of	O
these	O

,	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
Mindanao	PNM
,	O
we	O
saw	O
abundance	O
of	O
coconut-trees	O
:	O
therefore	O
we	O
sent	O
our	O
canoa	O
ashore	O
,	O
thinking	O
to	O
find	O
inhabitants	O

but	O
found	O
none	O

and	O
close	O

there	O
were	O

the	O

From	O

We	O
weighed	O
again	O
the	O
14th	O
day	O
and	O
went	O
through	O
between	O
the	O
keys	O
;	O
but	O
met	O
such	O
uncertain	O
tides	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
anchor	O
again	O
.	O

The	O
22nd	O
day	O
we	O
got	O
about	O
the	O
westermost	O
point	O
of	O
all	O
Mindanao	O
and	O
stood	O
to	O
the	O

north-north-east	O
a	O
fresh	O

As	O
we	O
sailed	O
along	O
further	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
land	O
to	O
trend	O
north-north-east	O

On	O
this	O

Here	O
we	O

We	O
kept	O
on	O
this	O

we	O
had	O
the	O

The	O
3rd	O

we	O
anchored	O

At	O
this	O

Captain	O
Read	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
the	O
same	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
had	O
so	O
much	O
railed	O
against	O
in	O
his	O

was	O
now	O
made	O
captain	O
in	O
his	O
room	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
Captain	O
Teat	O
was	O
made	O
master	O
,	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Henry	O
More	O
quartermaster	O
-RRB-	O
ordered	O
the	O
carpenters	O
to	O
cut	O
down	O
our	O
quarter-deck	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
ship	O
snug	O
and	O
the	O
fitter	O
for	O
sailing	O
.	O

When	O
that	O
was	O
done	O
we	O
heeled	O
her	O
,	O
scrubbed	O
her	O
bottom	O
,	O
and	O
tallowed	O
it	O
.	O

Then	O
we	O
filled	O
all	O
our	O
water	O
,	O
for	O
here	O
is	O
a	O
delicate	O
small	O
run	O
of	O
water	O
.	O

The	O
land	O
was	O
pretty	O
low	O
in	O
this	O
bay	O
,	O
the	O
Mould	O
black	O
and	O
fat	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
trees	O
of	O
several	O
kinds	O
,	O
very	O
thick	O
and	O
tall	O
.	O

In	O
some	O
places	O
we	O
found	O
plenty	O
of	O
canes	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
we	O
use	O
in	O
England	PNM
for	O
walking-canes	O
.	O

These	O
were	O
short-jointed	O
,	O
not	O
above	O
two	O
foot	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
,	O
or	O
two	O
foot	O
10	O
inches	O
the	O
longest	O
,	O
and	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
not	O
above	O
two	O
foot	O
.	O

They	O
run	O
along	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
like	O
a	O
vine	O
;	O
or	O
,	O
taking	O
hold	O
of	O
their	O
trees	O
,	O
they	O
climb	O
up	O
to	O
their	O
very	O
tops	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
15	O
or	O
20	O
fathom	O
long	O
,	O
and	O
much	O
of	O
a	O
bigness	O
from	O
the	O
root	O
till	O
within	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
fathom	O
of	O
the	O

They	O
are	O
of	O
a	O
pale	O
green	O
colour	O
,	O
clothed	O
over	O
with	O
a	O
coat	O
of	O
short	O
thick	O
hairy	O
substance	O
of	O
a	O
dun	O
colour	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
comes	O
off	O
by	O
only	O
drawing	O
the	O
cane	O
through	O
your	O
hand	O
.	O

We	O
did	O
cut	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
and	O
they	O
proved	O
very	O
tough	O
heavy	O
canes	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
no	O
houses	O
nor	O
sign	O
of	O
inhabitants	O
;	O
but	O
while	O
we	O
lay	O
here	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
canoa	O
with	O
six	O
men	O
came	O
into	O
this	O
bay	O
;	O
but	O
whither	O
they	O
were	O
bound	O
or	O
from	O
whence	O
they	O
came	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
Indians	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
understand	O
them	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
this	O
bay	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
small	O
low	O
woody	O
island	O
,	O
not	O
above	O
a	O
mile	O
in	O
circumference	O
;	O
our	O
ship	O
rode	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
it	O
.	O

This	O
island	O
was	O
the	O
habitation	O
of	O
an	O
incredible	O
number	O
of	O
great	O
bats	O
,	O
with	O
bodies	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
ducks	O
,	O
or	O
large	O
fowl	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
vast	O
wings	O
:	O
for	O
I	O
saw	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM
one	O
of	O
this	O
sort	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
judge	O
that	O
the	O
wings	O
,	O
stretched	O
out	O
in	O
length	O
,	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
less	O
asunder	O
than	O
7	O
or	O
8	O
foot	O
from	O
tip	O
to	O
tip	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
much	O
more	O
than	O
any	O
of	O
us	O
could	O
fathom	O
with	O
our	O
arms	O
extended	O
to	O
the	O
utmost	O
.	O

The	O
wings	O
are	O
for	O
substance	O
like	O
those	O
of	O
other	O
bats	O
,	O
of	O
a	O
dun	O
or	O
mouse	O
colour	O
.	O

The	O
skin	O
or	O
leather	O
of	O
them	O
has	O
ribs	O
running	O
along	O
it	O
and	O
draws	O
up	O
in	O
3	O
or	O
4	O
folds	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
joints	O
of	O
those	O
ribs	O
and	O
the	O
extremities	O
of	O
the	O
wings	O
there	O
are	O
sharp	O
and	O
crooked	O
claws	O
by	O
which	O
they	O
may	O
hang	O
on	O
anything	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
sun	O
was	O
set	O
,	O
these	O
creatures	O
would	O
begin	O
to	O
take	O
their	O
flight	O
from	O
this	O
island	O
in	O
swarms	O
like	O
bees	O
,	O
directing	O
their	O
flight	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
main	O
island	O
;	O
and	O
whither	O
afterwards	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
.	O

Thus	O
we	O
should	O
see	O
them	O
rising	O
up	O
from	O
the	O
island	O
till	O
night	O
hindered	O
our	O
sight	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
light	O
we	O
should	O
see	O
them	O
returning	O
again	O
like	O
a	O
cloud	O
to	O
the	O
small	O
island	O
till	O
sun	O
rising	O
.	O

This	O
course	O
they	O
kept	O
constantly	O
while	O
we	O
lay	O
here	O
,	O
affording	O
us	O
every	O
morning	O
and	O
evening	O
an	O
hour	O
's	O
diversion	O
in	O
gazing	O
at	O
them	O
and	O
talking	O
about	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
our	O
curiosity	O
did	O
not	O
prevail	O
with	O
us	O
to	O
go	O
ashore	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
ourselves	O
and	O
Canoas	O
being	O
all	O
the	O
daytime	O
taken	O
up	O
in	O
business	O
about	O
our	O
ship	O
.	O

At	O
this	O
isle	O
also	O
we	O
found	O
plenty	O
of	O
turtle	O
and	O
manatee	O
but	O
no	O
fish	O
.	O

We	O
stayed	O
here	O
till	O
the	O
10th	O
of	O
February	O
1687	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
having	O
completed	O
our	O
business	O
,	O
we	O
sailed	O
hence	O
with	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
north	O
.	O

But	O
going	O
out	O
we	O
struck	O
on	O
a	O
rock	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
lay	O
two	O
hours	O
:	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
smooth	O
water	O
and	O
the	O
tide	O
of	O
flood	O
,	O
or	O
else	O
we	O
should	O
there	O
have	O
lost	O
our	O
ship	O
.	O

We	O
struck	O
off	O
a	O
great	O
piece	O
of	O
our	O
rudder	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
all	O
the	O
damage	O
that	O
we	O
received	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
more	O
narrowly	O
missed	O
losing	O
our	O
ships	O
this	O
time	O
than	O
in	O
any	O
other	O
in	O
the	O
whole	O
voyage	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
dangerous	O
shoal	O
because	O
it	O
does	O
not	O
break	O
,	O
unless	O
probably	O
it	O
may	O
appear	O
in	O
foul	O
weather	O
.	O

It	O
lies	O
about	O
two	O
miles	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
,	O
without	O
the	O
small	O
Bat	PNM
Island	PNM
.	O

Here	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
tide	O
of	O
flood	O
setting	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
ebb	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
.	O

After	O
we	O
were	O
past	O
this	O
shoal	O
we	O
coasted	O
along	O
by	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
Philippine	PNM
Islands	PNM
,	O
keeping	O
on	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

Some	O
of	O
them	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
mountainous	O
dry	O
land	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
many	O
fires	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
as	O
we	O
passed	O
by	O
Panay	O
,	O
a	O
great	O
island	O
settled	O
by	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
fires	O
up	O
and	O
down	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
well	O
settled	O
by	O
them	O
;	O
for	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
Spanish	O
custom	O
whereby	O
they	O
give	O
notice	O
of	O
any	O
danger	O
or	O
the	O
like	O
from	O
sea	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
probable	O
they	O
had	O
seen	O
our	O
ship	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
an	O
unfrequented	O
coast	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
rare	O
to	O
have	O
any	O
ship	O
seen	O
there	O
.	O

We	O
touched	O
not	O
at	O
Panay	PNM
nor	O
anywhere	O
else	O
though	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
small	O
islands	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
of	O
us	O
and	O
some	O
shoals	O
,	O
but	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
laid	O
down	O
in	O
our	O
charts	O
.	O

The	O
18th	O
day	O
of	O
February	O
we	O
anchored	O
at	O
the	O
north-west	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
Mindoro	PNM
,	O
in	O
10	O
fathom	O
water	O
,	O
about	O
three	O
quarters	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

Mindoro	O
is	O
a	O
large	O
island	O
;	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
it	O
lying	O
in	O
latitude	O
13	O
,	O
about	O
40	O
leagues	O
long	O
,	O
stretching	O
north-west	O
and	O
south-east	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
high	O
and	O
mountainous	O
and	O
not	O
very	O
woody	O
.	O

At	O
this	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
anchored	O
the	O
land	O
was	O
neither	O
very	O
high	O
nor	O
low	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
small	O
brook	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
land	O
by	O
the	O
sea	O
was	O
very	O
woody	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
trees	O
high	O
and	O
tall	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
league	O
or	O
two	O
farther	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
are	O
very	O
thin	O
and	O
small	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
saw	O
great	O
tracks	O
of	O
hog	O
and	O
beef	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
saw	O
some	O
of	O
each	O
and	O
hunted	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
wild	O
and	O
we	O
could	O
kill	O
none	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
were	O
here	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
canoa	O
with	O
four	O
Indians	O
came	O
from	O
Manila	PNM
.	O

They	O
were	O
very	O
shy	O
of	O
us	O
a	O
while	O
but	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
hearing	O
us	O
speak	O
Spanish	O
,	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
us	O
and	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
a	O
friar	O
that	O
lived	O
at	O
an	O
Indian	O
village	O
towards	O
the	O
south-east	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

They	O
told	O
us	O
also	O
that	O
the	O
harbour	O
of	O
Manila	PNM
is	O
seldom	O
or	O
never	O
without	O
20	O
or	O
30	O
sail	O
of	O
vessels	O
,	O
most	O
Chinese	O
,	O
some	O
Portuguese	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
few	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
have	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
.	O

They	O
said	O
that	O
when	O
they	O
had	O
done	O
their	O
business	O
with	O
the	O
friar	O
they	O
would	O
return	O
to	O
Manila	PNM
,	O
and	O
hope	O
to	O
be	O
back	O
again	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
in	O
four	O
days	O
'	O
time	O
.	O

We	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
we	O
came	O
for	O
a	O
trade	O
with	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
at	O
Manila	PNM
,	O
and	O
should	O
be	O
glad	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
carry	O
a	O
letter	O
to	O
some	O
merchant	O
there	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
promised	O
to	O
do	O
.	O

But	O
this	O
was	O
only	O
a	O
pretence	O
of	O
ours	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
them	O
what	O
intelligence	O
we	O
could	O
as	O
to	O
their	O
shipping	O
,	O
strength	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
like	O
,	O
under	O
colour	O
of	O
seeking	O
a	O
trade	O
;	O
for	O
our	O
business	O
was	O
to	O
pillage	O
.	O

Now	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
really	O
designed	O
to	O
have	O
traded	O
there	O
this	O
was	O
as	O
fair	O
an	O
opportunity	O
as	O
men	O
could	O
have	O
desired	O
:	O
for	O
these	O
men	O
could	O
have	O
brought	O
us	O
to	O
the	O
friar	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
small	O
present	O
to	O
him	O
would	O
have	O
engaged	O
him	O
to	O
do	O
any	O
kindness	O
for	O
us	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
trade	O
:	O
for	O
the	O
Spanish	O
governors	O
do	O
not	O
allow	O
of	O
it	O
and	O
we	O
must	O
trade	O
by	O
stealth	O
.	O

The	O
21st	O
day	O
we	O
went	O
from	O
hence	O
with	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
east-north-east	O
a	O
small	O
gale	O
.	O

The	O
23rd	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
we	O
were	O
fair	O
by	O
the	O
south-east	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
Luconia	PNM
,	O
the	O
place	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
long	O
desired	O
by	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
presently	O
saw	O
a	O
sail	O
coming	O
from	O
the	O
northward	O
and	O
making	O
after	O
her	O
we	O
took	O
her	O
in	O
two	O
hours	O
'	O
time	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
a	O
Spanish	O
bark	O
that	O
came	O
from	O
a	O
place	O
called	O
Pangasanam	PNM
,	O
a	O
small	O
town	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
end	O
of	O
Luconia	PNM
,	O
as	O
they	O
told	O
us	O
;	O
probably	O
the	O
same	O
with	O
Pongassiny	O
,	O
which	O
lies	O
on	O
a	O
bay	O
at	O
the	O
north-west	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
bound	O
to	O
Manila	PNM
but	O
had	O
no	O
goods	O
aboard	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
we	O
turned	O
her	O
away	O
.	O

The	O
23rd	O
we	O
took	O
another	O
Spanish	O
vessel	O
that	O
came	O
from	O
the	O
same	O
place	O
as	O
the	O
other	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
laden	O
with	O
rice	O
and	O
cotton-cloth	O
and	O
bound	O
for	O
Manila	PNM
also	O
.	O

These	O
goods	O
were	O
purposely	O
for	O
the	O
Acapulco	O
ship	O
:	O
the	O
rice	O
was	O
for	O
the	O
men	O
to	O
live	O
on	O
while	O
they	O
lay	O
there	O
and	O
in	O
their	O

The	O
master	O
of	O
this	O
prize	O
was	O
boatswain	O
of	O
the	O
Acapulco	O
ship	O
which	O
escaped	O
us	O
at	O
Guam	PNM
and	O
was	O
now	O
at	O
Manila	PNM
.	O

It	O
was	O
this	O
man	O
that	O
gave	O
us	O
the	O
relation	O
of	O
what	O
strength	O
it	O
had	O
,	O
how	O
they	O
were	O
afraid	O
of	O
us	O
there	O

and	O
of	O
the	O
accident	O
that	O
happened	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
is	O
before	O
mentioned	O
in	O
the	O
10th	O
chapter	O
.	O

We	O
took	O
these	O
two	O
vessels	O
within	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
leagues	O
of	O
Manila	PNM
.	O

Luconia	O
I	O
have	O
spoken	O
of	O
already	O
but	O
I	O
shall	O
now	O
add	O
this	O
further	O
account	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
island	O
,	O
taking	O
up	O
between	O
6	O
and	O
7	O
degrees	O
of	O
latitude	O
in	O
length	O
,	O
and	O
its	O
breadth	O
near	O
the	O
middle	O
is	O
about	O
60	O
leagues	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
ends	O
are	O
narrow	O
.	O

The	O
north	O
end	O
lies	O
in	O
about	O
19	O
degrees	O
north	O
latitude	O
and	O
the	O
south	O
end	O
is	O
about	O
12	O
degrees	O
30	O
minutes	O
.	O

This	O
great	O
island	O
has	O
abundance	O
of	O
small	O
keys	O
or	O
islands	O
lying	O
about	O
it	O
;	O
especially	O
at	O
the	O
north	O
end	O
.	O

The	O
south	O
side	O
fronts	O
towards	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
Philippine	PNM
Islands	PNM
:	O
of	O
these	O
that	O
are	O
its	O
nearest	O
neighbours	O
Mindoro	O
lately	O
mentioned	O
is	O
the	O
chief	O
,	O
and	O
gives	O
name	O
to	O
the	O
sea	O
or	O
strait	O
that	O
parts	O
it	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
islands	O
from	O
Luconia	PNM
:	O
being	O
called	O
the	O
Straits	PNM
of	PNM
Mindoro	PNM
.	O

The	O
body	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
Luconia	PNM
is	O
composed	O
of	O
many	O
spacious	O
plain	O
savannahs	O
and	O
large	O
mountains	O
.	O

The	O
north	O
end	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
plain	O
and	O
even	O
,	O
I	O
mean	O
freer	O
from	O
hills	O
,	O
than	O
the	O
south	O
end	O
:	O
but	O
the	O
land	O
is	O
all	O
along	O
of	O
a	O
good	O
height	O
.	O

It	O
does	O
not	O
appear	O
so	O
flourishing	O
and	O
green	O
as	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
islands	O
in	O
this	O
range	O
;	O
especially	O
that	O
of	O
St.	PNM
John	PNM
,	PNM
Mindanao	PNM
,	O
Bat	O
Island	O
,	O
etc.	O
,	O
yet	O
in	O
some	O
places	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
woody	O
.	O

Some	O
of	O
the	O
mountains	O
of	O
this	O
island	O
afford	O
gold	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
savannahs	O
are	O
well	O
stocked	O
with	O
herds	O
of	O
cattle	O
,	O
especially	O
Buffaloes	O
.	O

These	O
cattle	O
are	O
in	O
great	O
plenty	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
probable	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
many	O
of	O
these	O
here	O
even	O
before	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
came	O
hither	O
.	O

But	O
now	O
there	O
are	O
also	O
plenty	O
of	O
other	O
cattle	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
told	O
,	O
as	O
bullocks	O
,	O
horses	O
,	O
sheep	O
,	O
goats	O
,	O
hogs	O
,	O
etc.	O
,	O
brought	O
hither	O
by	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
pretty	O
well	O
inhabited	O
with	O
Indians	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
if	O
not	O
all	O
under	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
who	O
now	O
are	O
masters	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
native	O
Indians	O
do	O
live	O
together	O
in	O
towns	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
priests	O
among	O
them	O
to	O
instruct	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
Spanish	O
religion	O

Manila	PNM
,	O
the	O
chief	O
or	O
perhaps	O
the	O
only	O
city	O

lies	O
at	O
the	O

of	O
a	O

upon	O
a	O

in	O

It	O

and	O
is	O
never	O

I	O
have	O

of	O
the	O
two	O

going	O

coming	O
between	O
this	O

Besides	O
them	O
they	O
have	O
some	O

and	O
they	O
do	O
allow	O
the	O

but	O
the	O
Chinese	O
are	O
the	O

they	O
drive	O
the	O

for	O

I	O
had	O
the	O

of	O
this	O

two	O

three	O
years	O
after	O

from	O
Mr.	O

he	O
made	O
a	O

;	O
in	O
a	O
Portuguese	O
ship	O

as	O
I	O

Here	O
he	O

ten	O

;	O
some	O
of	O
those	O
that	O
we	O
left	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM

For	O
after	O
we	O
came	O
from	O
thence	O
they	O
bought	O
a	O
proa	O
there	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
instigation	O
of	O
an	O
Irishman	O
who	O
went	O
by	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
John	O
Fitz-Gerald	O
,	O
a	O
person	O
that	O
spoke	O
Spanish	O
very	O
well	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
in	O
this	O
their	O
proa	O
they	O
came	O
hither	O

They	O
had	O
been	O
here	O
but	O
eighteen	O
months	O
when	O
Mr.	O
Coppinger	O
arrived	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Fitz-Gerald	O
had	O
in	O

Mestiza	O

a	O

He	O
then	O
professed	O
physic	O

and	O
was	O
highly	O
esteemed	O
among	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
for	O
his	O

knowledge	O
in	O
those	O
arts	O
;	O
for	O

being	O
always	O
troubled	O
with	O
sore	O
shins	O
while	O
he	O
was	O
with	O
us	O

he	O
kept	O
some	O
plasters	O

salves	O
by	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
with	O
these	O
he	O
set	O
up	O
upon	O
his	O
bare	O
natural	O
stock	O
of	O
knowledge	O
and	O
his	O
experience	O
in	O

But	O
then	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
very	O
great	O

being	O
an	O
Irish	O
Roman	O

The	O
Mould	O
of	O
these	O
islands	O
for	O
the	O

part	O
is	O
blackish	O
and	O
pretty	O
deep	O
,	O
only	O
the	O
hills	O
are	O
somewhat	O
stony	O
.	O

The	O
eastern	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O
island	O
is	O
sandy	O
yet	O
all	O
clothed	O
with	O
trees	O
of	O
divers	O
sorts	O
.	O

The	O
trees	O
do	O
not	O
grow	O
so	O
thick	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
seen	O
them	O
in	O
some	O
places	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
are	O
generally	O
large	O
and	O
tall	O
and	O
fit	O
for	O
any	O
use	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
one	O
sort	O
of	O
tree	O
much	O
larger	O
than	O
any	O
other	O
on	O
this	O
island	O
and	O
which	O
I	O
have	O
not	O
seen	O
anywhere	O
else	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
about	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
foot	O
diameter	O
in	O
the	O
body	O
,	O
from	O
whence	O
is	O
drawn	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
clammy	O
juice	O
,	O
which	O
being	O
boiled	O
a	O
little	O
becomes	O
perfect	O
tar	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
you	O
boil	O
it	O
much	O
it	O
will	O
become	O
hard	O
as	O
pitch	O

It	O
may	O
be	O
put	O
to	O
either	O
use	O
;	O
we	O
used	O
it	O
both	O
ways	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
serviceable	O
.	O

The	O
way	O
that	O
they	O
get	O
this	O
juice	O
is	O
by	O
cutting	O
a	O
great	O
gap	O
horizontally	O
in	O
the	O
body	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
half	O
through	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
a	O
foot	O
from	O
the	O
ground	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
cutting	O
the	O
upper	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
body	O
aslope	O
inwardly	O
downward	O
,	O
till	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
it	O
meets	O
with	O
the	O
traverse	O
cutting	O
or	O
plain	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
plain	O
horizontal	O
semicircular	O
stump	O
they	O
make	O
a	O
hollow	O
like	O
a	O
basin	O
,	O
that	O
may	O
contain	O
a	O
quart	O
or	O
two	O

Into	O
this	O
hole	O
the	O
juice	O
which	O
drains	O
from	O
the	O
wounded	O
upper	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
falls	O
;	O
from	O
whence	O
you	O
must	O
empty	O
it	O
every	O
day	O
.	O

It	O
will	O
run	O
thus	O
for	O
some	O
months	O
and	O
then	O
dry	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
tree	O
will	O
recover	O
again	O

The	O
fruit-trees	O
that	O
nature	O
has	O
bestowed	O
on	O
these	O
isles	O
are	O
mangoes	O
;	O
and	O
trees	O
bearing	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O

and	O
other	O
trees	O
bearing	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
wild	O

These	O
all	O
grow	O
wild	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
and	O
in	O
very	O
great	O

The	O
mangoes	O
here	O
grow	O
on	O
trees	O
as	O

as	O
apple-trees	O
:	O
those	O
at	O
Fort	PNM
St.	PNM

are	O
not	O
so	O

The	O
fruit	O
of	O
these	O
is	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
a	O
small	O
peach	O
but	O
long	O

smaller	O
towards	O
the	O

it	O
is	O
of	O
a	O
yellowish	O
colour	O
when	O

it	O
is	O
very	O
juicy	O

and	O
of	O
a	O
pleasant	O

When	O
the	O
mango	O
is	O
young	O
they	O
cut	O
them	O
in	O
two	O
pieces	O

pickle	O
them	O
with	O
salt	O
and	O
vinegar	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
put	O
some	O
cloves	O
of	O
garlic	O

This	O
is	O
an	O
excellent	O
sauce	O
and	O
much	O
esteemed	O
;	O
it	O
is	O
called	O
mango-achar	O

Achar	O
I	O

in	O
the	O

and	O
we	O
generally	O

Mangoes	O
are	O
common	O
in	O
many	O
places	O
of	O
the	O

but	O
I	O
did	O
never	O

only	O
at	O

These	O
,	O
though	O

the	O

of	O

The	O
grape-tree	O
grows	O
with	O
a	O

body	O
of	O
a	O

about	O
a	O
foot	O
or	O
more	O
,	O
and	O
has	O

The	O
fruit	O
grows	O
in	O
clusters	O
all	O
about	O
the	O

like	O
the	O

There	O
are	O
of	O
them	O
both	O
red	O

They	O
are	O
much	O

grow	O
on	O
our	O

both	O
in	O

and	O
they	O
are	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
pleasant	O
winy	O
taste	O

I	O
never	O
saw	O
these	O
but	O
on	O
the	O
two	O
biggest	O
of	O
these	O
islands	O
;	O
the	O
rest	O
had	O
no	O
tar-trees	O

nor	O
wild	O
nutmegs	O
.	O

The	O
wild	O
nutmeg-tree	O
is	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
a	O
walnut-tree	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
does	O
not	O
spread	O
so	O
much	O
.	O

The	O
boughs	O
are	O
gross	O
and	O
the	O
fruit	O
grows	O
among	O
the	O
boughs	O
as	O
the	O
walnut	O
and	O
other	O
fruits	O
.	O

This	O
nutmeg	O
is	O
much	O
smaller	O
than	O
the	O
true	O
nutmeg	O
and	O
longer	O
also	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
enclosed	O
with	O
a	O

a	O
sort	O
of	O
mace	O

encircling	O
the	O

the	O

This	O
bastard	O
nutmeg	O
is	O
so	O
much	O
like	O
the	O
true	O
nutmeg	O
in	O
shape	O
that	O
at	O
our	O
first	O
arrival	O
here	O
we	O
thought	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
true	O
one	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
has	O
no	O
manner	O
of	O
smell	O
nor	O
taste	O
.	O

The	O
animals	O
of	O
these	O
islands	O
are	O
some	O
hogs	O

Guanos	O
;	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
those	O
creatures	O
mentioned	O

XI	O
which	O
are	O

much	O
bigger	O

Here	O
are	O
many	O

of	O
birds	O

as	O
parrots	O

parakeets	O

Here	O
are	O
also	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
wild	O
cocks	O
and	O
hens	O
:	O
they	O
are	O
much	O
like	O
our	O
tame	O
fowl	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
;	O
but	O
a	O
great	O

less	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
are	O
about	O
the	O
bigness	O
of	O
a	O
crow	O

The	O
cocks	O
do	O
crow	O
like	O
ours	O
but	O
much	O
more	O
small	O
and	O
shrill	O
;	O
and	O
by	O
their	O
crowing	O
we	O
do	O
first	O
find	O
them	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
where	O
we	O
shoot	O
them	O
.	O

Their	O
flesh	O
is	O
very	O
white	O

There	O
are	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
limpets	O

and	O
plenty	O
of	O
green	O
turtle	O

And	O
upon	O
this	O
mention	O
of	O
turtle	O
again	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
not	O
amiss	O
to	O
add	O
some	O
reasons	O
to	O
strengthen	O
the	O
opinion	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
given	O
concerning	O
these	O
creatures	O
removing	O
from	O
place	O
to	O
place	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
said	O
in	O
Chapter	O
5	O
that	O
they	O
leave	O
their	O
common	O
feeding-places	O
and	O
go	O
to	O
places	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
from	O
thence	O
to	O
lay	O
,	O
as	O
particularly	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
Ascension	PNM
.	O

Now	O
I	O
have	O
discoursed	O
with	O
some	O
since	O
that	O
subject	O
was	O
printed	O
who	O
are	O
of	O
opinion	O
that	O
when	O
the	O
laying-time	O
is	O
over	O
they	O
never	O
go	O
from	O
thence	O
,	O
but	O
lie	O
somewhere	O
in	O
the	O
sea	O
about	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
think	O
is	O
very	O
improbable	O
:	O
for	O
there	O
can	O
be	O
no	O
food	O
for	O
them	O
there	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
soon	O
make	O
appear	O
;	O
as	O
particularly	O
from	O
hence	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
sea	O
about	O
the	O
isle	O
of	O
Ascension	PNM
is	O
so	O
deep	O
as	O
to	O
admit	O
of	O
no	O
anchoring	O
but	O
at	O
one	O
place	O
,	O
where	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
sign	O
of	O
grass	O
:	O
and	O
we	O
never	O
bring	O
up	O
with	O
our	O

any	O
grass	O

weeds	O
out	O
of	O
very	O

But	O
if	O
this	O
be	O
granted	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
food	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O
turtle	O
go	O
from	O
hence	O
;	O
for	O
after	O
the	O
laying-time	O
you	O
shall	O
never	O

them	O

and	O
wherever	O

you	O
will	O
see	O
them	O
rise	O

hold	O
their	O

above	O

to	O
breathe	O
once	O

if	O
any	O

does	O

consider	O
how	O
fish	O
take	O
their	O
certain	O
seasons	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
to	O
go	O
from	O
one	O
sea	O

this	O
should	O

I	O

arrived	O
at	O
these	O

the	O
14th	O
day	O
of	O
March	O
1687	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
we	O
searched	O

for	O
a	O
place	O
to	O
careen	O
in	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
16th	O
day	O
we	O
entered	O
the	O

immediately	O
provided	O
to	O
careen	O

Some	O

were	O

The	O

we	O
had	O
a	O

We	O
bought	O
of	O
them	O
also	O
a	O
good	O
quantity	O
of	O
their	O
pitchy	O

which	O
we	O
boiled	O

and	O
used	O
about	O
our	O
ship	O

We	O
mixed	O
it	O
first	O
with	O

which	O
we	O
made	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
made	O
an	O

stuck	O
on	O
very	O

We	O
stayed	O
in	O
this	O

of	O
March	O
till	O
the	O
16th	O

in	O
which	O

we	O
made	O
a	O

suit	O
of	O
sails	O
of	O
the	O
cloth	O
that	O
was	O
taken	O
in	O
the	O

We	O
cut	O
a	O

main-top-mast	O
and	O
sawed	O
plank	O
to	O
sheath	O
the	O
ship	O

for	O
she	O
was	O
not	O

all	O

at	O
Mindanao	PNM

and	O
that	O
old	O
plank	O
that	O
was	O
left	O
on	O
then	O
we	O
now	O
ripped	O
off	O

clapped	O
on	O

While	O
we	O
lay	O
here	O
two	O

who	O
were	O

they	O
told	O
us	O
of	O
it	O
when	O
they	O
found	O
themselves	O
poisoned	O

had	O
lingered	O

Our	O

finished	O
here	O
we	O
left	O
the	O

taken	O
at	O

and	O
most	O

out	O

and	O
on	O
the	O
17th	O

we	O
went	O
from	O

to	O
the	O

we	O
first	O
anchored	O

on	O
the	O

the	O

purposely	O
to	O

for	O
there	O
was	O
a	O

when	O
we	O
first	O
came	O
to	O
the	O

we	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
so	O

But	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
dried	O
up	O

stood	O
in	O

two	O
or	O
three	O
hogsheads	O

in	O
a	O

therefore	O
we	O
did	O
immediately	O
cut	O
bamboos	O
and	O
made	O
spouts	O
through	O
which	O
we	O
conveyed	O
the	O

and	O
that	O
he	O
knew	O
some	O
islands	O
there	O
where	O
there	O
were	O
fishermen	O
lived	O
who	O
he	O
thought	O
could	O
supply	O
us	O
with	O
salt-fish	O
to	O
eat	O
at	O
sea	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
nothing	O
but	O
rice	O
to	O
eat	O
.	O

The	O
easterly	O
monsoon	O
was	O
not	O
yet	O
done	O
;	O
therefore	O
it	O
was	O
concluded	O
to	O
spend	O
some	O
time	O
there	O
and	O
then	O
take	O
the	O
advantage	O
of	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
the	O
western	O
monsoon	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
Manila	PNM
again	O
.	O

The	O
21st	O
day	O
of	O
April	O
1687	O
we	O
sailed	O
from	O
Pulo	PNM
Condore	PNM
,	O
directing	O
our	O
course	O
west	O
by	O
south	O
for	O
the	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM
Siam	PNM
.	O

We	O
had	O
fair	O
weather	O
and	O
a	O
fine	O
moderate	O
gale	O
of	O
wind	O
at	O
east-north-east	O
.	O

The	O
23rd	O
day	O
we	O
arrived	O
at	O
Pulo	PNM
Ubi	PNM
,	PNM
or	O
the	O
island	O
Ubi	O
.	O

This	O
island	O
is	O
about	O
40	O
leagues	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
of	O
Pulo	PNM
Condore	PNM
;	O
it	O
lies	O
just	O
at	O
the	O
entrance	O
of	O
the	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM
Siam	PNM
,	O
at	O
the	O
south-west	O
point	O
of	O
land	O
that	O
makes	O
the	O
bay	O
;	O
namely	O
,	O
the	O
Point	PNM
of	PNM
Cambodia	PNM
.	O

This	O
island	O
is	O
about	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
leagues	O
round	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
higher	O
land	O
than	O
any	O
of	O
Pulo	PNM
Condore	PNM
isles	O
.	O

Against	O
the	O
south-east	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
small	O
key	O
,	O
about	O
a	O
cable	O
's	O
length	O
from	O
the	O
main	O
island	O
.	O

This	O
Pulo	O
Ubi	O
is	O
very	O
woody	O
and	O
it	O
has	O
good	O
water	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
,	O
where	O
you	O
may	O
anchor	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
best	O
anchoring	O
is	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
against	O
a	O
small	O
bay	O
;	O
then	O
you	O
will	O
have	O
the	O
little	O
island	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
of	O
you	O
.	O

At	O
Pulo	O
Ubi	O
we	O
found	O
two	O
small	O
barks	O
laden	O
with	O
rice	O
.	O

They	O
belonged	O
to	O
Cambodia	PNM
,	O
from	O
whence	O
they	O
came	O
not	O
above	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
touched	O
here	O
to	O
fill	O
water	O
.	O

Rice	O
is	O
the	O
general	O
food	O
of	O
all	O
these	O
countries	O
,	O
therefore	O
it	O
is	O
transported	O
by	O
sea	O
from	O
one	O
country	O
to	O
another	O
,	O
as	O
corn	O
in	O
these	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

For	O
in	O
some	O
countries	O
they	O
produce	O
more	O
than	O
enough	O
for	O
themselves	O
and	O
send	O
what	O
they	O
can	O
spare	O
to	O
those	O
places	O
where	O
there	O
is	O
but	O
little	O
.	O

The	O
24th	O
day	O
we	O
went	O
into	O
the	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM
Siam	PNM
:	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
large	O
deep	O
bay	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
this	O
kingdom	O
,	O
I	O
shall	O
at	O
present	O
speak	O
but	O
little	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
design	O
a	O
more	O
particular	O
account	O
of	O
all	O
this	O
coast	O
,	O
to	O
wit	O

of	O
Tonquin	PNM

Siam	O
,	O
Champa	PNM

the	O
most	O
easterly	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
continent	O
of	O
Asia	PNM
,	O
lying	O
south	O
of	O
China	PNM
:	O
but	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
this	O
voyage	O
would	O
too	O
much	O
swell	O
this	O
volume	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
shall	O
choose	O
therefore	O
to	O
give	O
a	O
separate	O
relation	O
of	O
what	O
I	O
know	O
or	O
have	O
learnt	O
of	O
them	O

with	O
the	O
neighbouring	O
parts	O
of	O

,	PNM
Java	PNM
,	O
etc.	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
have	O
spent	O
some	O
time	O
.	O

We	O
ran	O
down	O
into	O
the	O
Bay	O
of	O
Siam	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
islands	O
that	O
our	O
Pulo	O
Condore	O
pilot	O
told	O
us	O
of	O
,	O
which	O
lie	O
about	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
:	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
good	O
a	O
pilot	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
,	O
he	O
run	O
us	O
a-ground	O
;	O
yet	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
damage	O
.	O

Captain	O
Read	O
went	O
ashore	O
at	O
these	O
islands	O
,	O
where	O
he	O
found	O
a	O
small	O
town	O
of	O
fishermen	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
fish	O
to	O
sell	O
and	O
so	O
we	O
returned	O
empty	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
yet	O
fair	O
weather	O
and	O
very	O
little	O
wind	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
being	O
often	O
becalmed	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
till	O
the	O
13th	O
day	O
of	O
May	O
before	O
we	O
got	O
to	O
Pulo	PNM
Ubi	PNM
again	O
.	O

There	O
we	O
found	O
two	O
small	O
vessels	O
at	O
an	O
anchor	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
laden	O
with	O
rice	O
and	O
lacquer	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
used	O
in	O
japanning	O
of	O
cabinets	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
these	O
came	O
from	O
Champa	PNM
,	O
bound	O
to	O
the	O
town	O
of	O
Malacca	PNM
,	O
which	O
belongs	O
to	O
the	O
Dutch	O
who	O
took	O
it	O
from	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
shows	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
trade	O
with	O
Champa	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
pretty	O
neat	O
vessel	O
,	O
her	O
bottom	O
very	O
clean	O
and	O
curiously	O
coated	O
,	O
she	O
had	O
about	O
forty	O
men	O
all	O
armed	O
with	O
cortans	O
,	O
or	O
broadswords	O
,	O
lances	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
guns	O
,	O
that	O
went	O
with	O
a	O
swivel	O
upon	O
their	O
gunwale	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
of	O
the	O
idolaters	O
,	O
natives	O
of	O
Champa	PNM
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
briskest	O
,	O
most	O
sociable	O
,	O
without	O
fearfulness	O
or	O
shyness	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
most	O
neat	O
and	O
dextrous	O
about	O
their	O
shipping	O
,	O
of	O
any	O
such	O
I	O
have	O
met	O
with	O
in	O
all	O
my	O
travels	O
.	O

The	O
other	O
vessel	O
came	O
from	O
the	O
river	PNM
of	PNM
Cambodia	PNM
and	O
was	O
bound	O
towards	O
the	O
Straits	PNM
of	PNM
Malacca	PNM
.	O

Both	O
of	O
them	O
stopped	O
here	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
westerly-winds	O
now	O
began	O
to	O
blow	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
against	O
them	O
,	O
being	O
somewhat	O
bleated	O
.	O

We	O
anchored	O
also	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
,	O
intending	O
to	O
fill	O
water	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
lay	O
here	O
we	O
had	O
very	O
violent	O
wind	O
at	O
south-west	O
and	O
a	O
strong	O
current	O
setting	O
right	O
to	O
windward	O
.	O

The	O
fiercer	O
the	O
wind	O
blew	O
,	O
the	O
more	O
strong	O
the	O
current	O
set	O
against	O
it	O
.	O

This	O
storm	O
lasted	O
till	O
the	O
20th	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
it	O
began	O
to	O
abate	O
.	O

The	O
21st	O
day	O
of	O
May	O
we	O
went	O
back	O
from	O
hence	O
towards	O
Pulo	PNM
Condore	PNM
.	O

In	O
our	O
way	O
we	O
overtook	O
a	O
great	O
junk	O
that	O
came	O
from	O
Palimbam	PNM
,	O
a	O
town	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
Sumatra	PNM
:	O
she	O
was	O
full	O
laden	O
with	O
pepper	O
which	O
they	O
bought	O
there	O
and	O
was	O
bound	O
to	O
Siam	PNM
:	O
but	O
,	O
it	O
blowing	O
so	O
hard	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
afraid	O
to	O
venture	O
into	O
that	O
bay	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
came	O
to	O
Pulo	PNM
Condore	PNM
with	O
us	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
both	O
anchored	O
May	O
the	O
24th	O
.	O

This	O
vessel	O
was	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
make	O
,	O
full	O
of	O
little	O
rooms	O
or	O
partitions	O
,	O
like	O
our	O
well-boats	O
.	O

I	O
shall	O
describe	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
chapter	O
.	O

The	O
men	O
of	O
this	O
junk	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
the	O
English	O
were	O
settled	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
Sumatra	PNM
,	O
at	O
a	O
place	O
called	O
Sillabar	PNM
;	O
and	O
the	O
first	O
knowledge	O
we	O
had	O
that	O
the	O
English	O
had	O
any	O
settlement	O
on	O
Sumatra	PNM
was	O
from	O
these	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
small	O
bark	O
at	O
an	O
anchor	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
therefore	O
Captain	O
Read	O
sent	O
a	O
canoa	O
aboard	O
her	O
to	O
know	O
from	O
whence	O
they	O
came	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
supposing	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
Malayan	O
vessel	O
,	O
he	O
ordered	O
the	O
men	O
not	O
to	O
go	O
aboard	O
for	O
they	O
are	O
accounted	O
desperate	O
fellows	O
and	O
their	O
vessels	O
are	O
commonly	O
full	O
of	O
men	O
who	O
all	O
wear	O
cressets	O
,	O
or	O
little	O
daggers	O
,	O
by	O
their	O
sides	O
.	O

The	O
canoa	O
's	O
crew	O
,	O
not	O
minding	O
the	O
captain	O
's	O
orders	O
,	O
went	O
aboard	O
,	O
all	O
but	O
one	O
man	O
that	O
stayed	O
in	O
the	O
canoa	O
.	O

The	O
Malayans	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
about	O
20	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
seeing	O
our	O
men	O
all	O
armed	O
,	O
thought	O
that	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
take	O
their	O
vessel	O
;	O
therefore	O
at	O
once	O
,	O
on	O
a	O
signal	O
given	O
,	O
they	O
drew	O
out	O
their	O
cressets	O
and	O
stabbed	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
before	O
they	O
knew	O
what	O
the	O
matter	O
was	O
.	O

The	O
rest	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
leapt	O
overboard	O
,	O
some	O
into	O
the	O
canoa	O
and	O
some	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
got	O
away	O
.	O

Among	O
the	O
rest	O
one	O
Daniel	O
Wallis	O
leapt	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
who	O
could	O
never	O
swim	O
before	O
nor	O
since	O
;	O
yet	O
now	O
he	O
swam	O
very	O
well	O
a	O
good	O
while	O
before	O
he	O
was	O
taken	O
up	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
Canoas	O
came	O
aboard	O
Captain	O
Read	O
manned	O
two	O
Canoas	O
and	O
went	O
to	O
be	O
revenged	O
on	O
the	O
Malayans	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
seeing	O
him	O
coming	O
did	O
cut	O
a	O
hole	O
in	O
the	O
vessel	O
's	O
bottom	O
and	O
went	O
ashore	O
in	O
their	O
boat	O
.	O

Captain	O
Read	O
followed	O
them	O
but	O
they	O
ran	O
into	O
the	O
woods	O
and	O
hid	O
themselves	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
stayed	O
ten	O
or	O
eleven	O
days	O
for	O
it	O
blew	O
very	O
hard	O
all	O
the	O
time	O

While	O

Herman	O

but	O
Captain	O
Read	O
sent	O
some	O
men	O
to	O

him	O
again	O

I	O

the	O

The	O

bound	O

remained	O
there	O
,	O
waiting	O
for	O
an	O
easterly	O

;	O
but	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
,	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
bastard	O
Portuguese	O
,	O
came	O
aboard	O
our	O
ship	O
and	O
was	O
entertained	O
for	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
his	O
knowledge	O
in	O
the	O
several	O
languages	O
of	O
these	O
countries	O
.	O

The	O
wind	O
continued	O
in	O
the	O
south-west	O
but	O
24	O
hours	O
or	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
came	O
about	O
to	O
the	O
north	O

and	O
then	O
to	O
the	O
north-east	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
sky	O
became	O
exceeding	O
clear	O

Then	O
the	O
wind	O
came	O
at	O
east	O
and	O
lasted	O
betwixt	O
east	O

south-east	O
for	O
eight	O
or	O
ten	O
days	O
.	O

Yet	O
we	O
continued	O
plying	O
to	O
windward	O
,	O
expecting	O
every	O
day	O
a	O
shift	O
of	O
wind	O
because	O
these	O
winds	O
were	O
not	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
season	O
of	O
the	O
year	O

We	O
were	O
now	O
afraid	O
lest	O
the	O
currents	O
might	O
deceive	O
us	O
and	O
carry	O
us	O
on	O
the	O
shoals	O

,	O
which	O
were	O
near	O
us	O
a	O
little	O
to	O
the	O
north-west	O

but	O
we	O
passed	O
on	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
without	O
seeing	O
any	O
sign	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
yet	O
we	O
were	O
kept	O
much	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O

our	O
intended	O
course	O
.	O

And	O
,	O
the	O
easterly	O
winds	O
still	O
continuing	O
,	O
we	O
despaired	O
of	O
getting	O
to	O
Manila	PNM
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
began	O
to	O
project	O
some	O
new	O
design	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
result	O
was	O
to	O
visit	O
the	O
island	O
Pratas	O
about	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
20	O

and	O
not	O

It	O
is	O
a	O

environed	O
with	O

it	O

It	O
lies	O

the	O

a	O

and	O
a	O
town	O
of	O
great	O
trade	O
in	O
China	PNM
,	O
that	O
the	O
Chinese	O
do	O
dread	O
the	O
rocks	O
about	O
it	O
more	O
than	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
did	O
formerly	O
dread	O
Bermuda	PNM
;	O
for	O
many	O
of	O
their	O
junks	O
coming	O
from	O

have	O
been	O
lost	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
abundance	O
of	O
treasure	O
in	O
them	O
;	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
informed	O
by	O
all	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
that	O
ever	O
we	O
conversed	O
with	O
in	O
these	O
parts	O
.	O

They	O
told	O
us	O
also	O
that	O
in	O
these	O
wrecks	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
were	O
drowned	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
Chinese	O
did	O
never	O
go	O
thither	O
to	O
take	O
up	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
treasure	O
that	O
was	O
lost	O
there	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
being	O
lost	O
themselves	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
danger	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
did	O
not	O
daunt	O
us	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
resolved	O
to	O
try	O
our	O
fortunes	O
there	O
if	O
the	O
winds	O
would	O
permit	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
did	O
beat	O
for	O
it	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
days	O
;	O
but	O
at	O
last	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
leave	O
that	O
design	O
also	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
winds	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
south-east	O
winds	O
continuing	O
forced	O
us	O
on	O
the	O

of	O
China	PNM

It	O
was	O
the	O
25th	O
day	O
of	O

when	O
we	O
made	O
the	O

at	O

The	O

are	O

both	O

did	O
thus	O

But	O
when	O
the	O
Tartars	O
conquered	O
them	O
they	O
broke	O
them	O
of	O
this	O
custom	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
fond	O
of	O
by	O

force	O
;	O
insomuch	O
that	O
they	O
resented	O
this	O

worse	O

their	O
subjection	O

rebelled	O
upon	O
it	O

still	O
worsted	O

They	O
seldom	O
wear	O
stockings	O
but	O
they	O
have	O
shoes	O
,	O
or	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
slippers	O
rather	O
.	O

The	O
men	O
's	O
shoes	O
are	O
made	O
diversely	O

The	O
women	O
have	O
very	O
small	O
feet	O
and	O
consequently	O
but	O
little	O
shoes	O
;	O
for	O
from	O
their	O
infancy	O
their	O
feet	O
are	O
kept	O
swathed	O
up	O
with	O
bands	O
as	O
hard	O
as	O
they	O
can	O
possibly	O
endure	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
from	O
the	O
time	O
they	O
can	O
go	O
till	O
they	O
have	O
done	O
growing	O
they	O
bind	O
them	O
up	O
every	O
night	O
.	O

This	O
they	O
do	O
purposely	O
to	O
hinder	O
them	O
from	O
growing	O
,	O
esteeming	O
little	O
feet	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
great	O
beauty	O
.	O

But	O
by	O
this	O
unreasonable	O
custom	O
they	O
do	O
in	O
a	O
manner	O
lose	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
their	O
feet	O
,	O
and	O
instead	O
of	O
going	O
they	O
only	O
stumble	O
about	O
their	O
houses	O
,	O
and	O
presently	O
squat	O
down	O
on	O
their	O
breeches	O
again	O
,	O
being	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
confined	O
to	O
sitting	O
all	O
days	O
of	O
their	O
lives	O

They	O
seldom	O
stir	O
abroad	O
and	O
one	O
would	O
be	O
apt	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
some	O
have	O
conjectured	O
,	O
their	O
keeping	O
up	O
their	O
fondness	O
for	O
this	O
fashion	O
were	O
a	O
stratagem	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
from	O
gadding	O
and	O
gossiping	O
about	O
and	O
confine	O
them	O
at	O
home	O

They	O
are	O
kept	O
constantly	O
to	O
their	O
work	O
,	O
being	O
fine	O
needlewomen	O
,	O
and	O
making	O
many	O
curious	O
embroideries	O

and	O
they	O
make	O
their	O

if	O
any	O
stranger	O
be	O
desirous	O
to	O
bring	O
away	O
any	O
for	O

he	O
must	O
be	O
a	O

a	O

to	O
the	O

The	O
Chinese	O
both	O
men	O
and	O

are	O
very	O
ingenious	O

as	O
may	O

by	O
the	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
of	O
Manila	PNM
that	O
we	O
took	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Luconia	PNM
told	O
me	O
that	O
this	O

is	O
made	O
of	O
conch-shells	O

the	O
inside	O
of	O

But	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
lately	O
mentioned	O

who	O
had	O
lived	O
in	O
China	PNM
and	O
spoke	O
that	O
and	O
the	O
neighbouring	O
languages	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
said	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
made	O
of	O
a	O
fine	O
sort	O
of	O
clay	O
that	O
was	O
dug	O
in	O
the	O
province	O
of	O
Canton	PNM

I	O
have	O
often	O
made	O
enquiry	O
about	O
it	O
but	O
could	O
never	O
be	O
well	O
satisfied	O
in	O
it	O
:	O
but	O
while	O
I	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Canton	PNM
I	O
forgot	O
to	O
enquire	O
about	O
it	O

They	O

China	PNM
affords	O
drugs	O
in	O
great	O
abundance	O
,	O
especially	O
China-root	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
peculiar	O
to	O
that	O
country	O
alone	O
;	O
for	O
there	O
is	O
much	O
of	O
this	O
root	O
growing	O
at	O
Jamaica	PNM
,	O
particularly	O
at	O
16-mile	O
walk	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM

it	O
is	O
very	O
plentiful	O

There	O
is	O
a	O

of	O

made	O
in	O
this	O
country	O
;	O
and	O
tea	O
in	O
abundance	O
is	O
brought	O
from	O
thence	O
;	O
being	O
much	O
used	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
Tonquin	PNM
and	O
Cochin-china	PNM
as	O
common	O
drinking	O

they	O

it	O

it	O

But	O
the	O
tea	O
at	O
Tonquin	PNM
of	PNM
Cochin-china	PNM
seems	O
not	O
so	O
good	O

or	O
of	O

such	O

this	O
in	O
China	PNM
;	O
for	O
I	O
have	O
drunk	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
these	O
countries	O
;	O
unless	O
the	O
fault	O
be	O
in	O
the	O
way	O

for	O
I	O
made	O
none	O

and	O
by	O
the	O
high	O
red	O

it	O
looks	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
made	O
a	O
decoction	O
of	O
it	O
or	O
kept	O
it	O
stale	O

Yet	O
at	O
Japan	PNM
I	O
was	O
told	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
pure	O
tea	O
,	O
very	O
good	O

The	O
Chinese	O
are	O
very	O
great	O
gamesters	O
and	O
they	O
will	O
never	O
be	O
tired	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
playing	O
night	O
and	O
day	O
till	O
they	O
have	O
lost	O
all	O
their	O
estates	O
;	O
then	O
it	O
is	O
usual	O
with	O
them	O
to	O
hang	O
themselves	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
frequently	O
done	O
by	O
the	O
Chinese	O
factors	O
at	O
Manila	PNM
,	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
told	O
by	O
Spaniards	O
that	O
lived	O
there	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
themselves	O
are	O
much	O
addicted	O
to	O
gaming	O
and	O
are	O
very	O
expert	O
at	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
Chinese	O
are	O
too	O
subtle	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
being	O
in	O
general	O
a	O
very	O
cunning	O
people	O
.	O

But	O
a	O
particular	O
account	O
of	O
them	O
and	O
their	O
country	O
would	O
fill	O
a	O
volume	O
;	O
nor	O
doth	O
my	O
short	O
experience	O
of	O
them	O
qualify	O
me	O
to	O
say	O
much	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

Wherefore	O
I	O
confine	O
myself	O
chiefly	O
to	O
what	O
I	O
observed	O
at	O
St.	PNM
John	PNM
's	PNM
Island	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
lay	O
some	O
time	O
and	O
visited	O
the	O
shore	O
every	O
day	O
to	O
buy	O
provision	O
,	O
as	O
hogs	O
,	O
fowls	O
,	O
and	O
buffalo	O
.	O

Here	O
was	O
a	O
small	O
town	O
standing	O
in	O
a	O
wet	O
swampy	O
ground	O
,	O
with	O
many	O
filthy	O
ponds	O
amongst	O
the	O
houses	O

which	O
were	O
built	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
as	O
ours	O
are	O

not	O
on	O

as	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM

In	O
these	O
ponds	O
were	O
plenty	O
of	O
ducks	O
;	O
the	O
houses	O
were	O
small	O
and	O
low	O
and	O
covered	O
with	O
thatch	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
insides	O
were	O
but	O
ill	O
furnished	O
,	O
and	O
kept	O
nastily	O
:	O
and	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
told	O
by	O
one	O
who	O
was	O
there	O
that	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
houses	O
in	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Canton	PNM
itself	O
are	O
but	O
poor	O
and	O
irregular	O
.	O

The	O
inhabitants	O
of	O
this	O
village	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
most	O
husbandmen	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
very	O
busy	O
in	O
sowing	O
their	O
rice	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
their	O
chiefest	O
commodity	O
.	O

The	O
land	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
choose	O
to	O
sow	O
the	O
rice	O
is	O
low	O
and	O
wet	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
ploughed	O
the	O
earth	O
was	O
like	O
a	O
mass	O
of	O
mud	O

They	O
plough	O
their	O
land	O
with	O
a	O
small	O
plough	O

drawn	O
by	O
one	O

and	O
one	O
man	O
both	O

the	O

drives	O
the	O
beast	O

When	O
the	O
rice	O
is	O
ripe	O
and	O
gathered	O
in	O
they	O
tread	O
it	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ear	O
with	O
buffaloes	O
in	O
a	O
large	O

I	O
was	O
once	O
at	O
this	O

with	O
seven	O

eight	O
Englishmen	O
more	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
occasion	O

some	O

we	O
killed	O
a	O

roasted	O

for	O

While	O
we	O
were	O

dressing	O
of	O
our	O
pork	O
one	O
of	O
the	O

sat	O
down	O
by	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
the	O
dinner	O
was	O
ready	O
we	O
cut	O
a	O
good	O
piece	O
and	O
gave	O
it	O
him	O

which	O
he	O
willingly	O
received	O

But	O
by	O
signs	O
he	O
begged	O
more	O
,	O
and	O
withal	O
pointed	O
into	O
the	O
woods	O
;	O
yet	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
his	O

nor	O
much	O

him	O
till	O
our	O
hunger	O
was	O
pretty	O
well	O
assuaged	O
;	O
although	O
he	O
did	O
still	O
make	O
signs	O
and	O
,	O
walking	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
from	O
us	O
,	O
he	O
beckoned	O
to	O
us	O
to	O

to	O
him	O
;	O
which	O
at	O

I	O
did	O
,	O
and	O
two	O

three	O

He	O
going	O
before	O
led	O
the	O
way	O
in	O
a	O
small	O
blind	O
path	O
through	O
a	O
thicket	O
into	O
a	O
small	O
grove	O
of	O
trees	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
there	O
was	O
an	O
old	O
idol-temple	O
about	O
ten	O
foot	O
square	O
:	O
the	O
walls	O
of	O
it	O
were	O
about	O
six	O
foot	O

two	O
foot	O
thick	O

made	O

The	O
floor	O
was	O
paved	O
with	O
broad	O
bricks	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
floor	O
stood	O
an	O
old	O
rusty	O
iron	O
bell	O
on	O
its	O
brims	O

This	O
bell	O
was	O
about	O
two	O
foot	O

standing	O
flat	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
;	O
the	O
brims	O
on	O
which	O
it	O
stood	O
were	O
about	O
sixteen	O
inches	O
diameter	O
.	O

From	O
the	O
brims	O
it	O
did	O
taper	O
away	O
a	O
little	O
towards	O
the	O
head	O
,	O
much	O
like	O
our	O
bells	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
brims	O
did	O
not	O
turn	O
out	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
ours	O
do	O

On	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
the	O
bell	O
there	O
were	O
three	O
iron	O
bars	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
a	O
man	O
's	O
arm	O
and	O
about	O
ten	O
inches	O
long	O
from	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
bell	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
ends	O
joined	O
as	O
in	O
a	O
centre	O
and	O
seemed	O
of	O
one	O
mass	O
with	O
the	O
bell	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
cast	O
together	O

These	O
bars	O
stood	O
all	O
parallel	O
to	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
farther	O
ends	O
,	O
which	O
stood	O
triangularly	O
and	O
opening	O
from	O
each	O
other	O
at	O
equal	O
distances	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
fliers	O
of	O
our	O
kitchen-jacks	O

were	O
made	O
exactly	O
in	O
the	O
shape	O
of	O
the	O
paw	O
of	O
some	O
monstrous	O
beast	O

This	O
it	O
seems	O

their	O
god	O

for	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
our	O
zealous	O
guide	O
came	O
before	O
the	O
bell	O
he	O
fell	O
flat	O
on	O
his	O
face	O
and	O
beckoned	O
to	O
us	O

seeming	O
very	O

At	O
the	O
inner	O
side	O
of	O
the	O

against	O
the	O

was	O
an	O
altar	O
of	O
white	O
hewn	O
stone	O

The	O
table	O
of	O
the	O
altar	O
was	O
about	O
three	O
foot	O
long	O
,	O
sixteen	O
inches	O

and	O
three	O

It	O
was	O
raised	O
about	O
two	O

supported	O
by	O
three	O
small	O
pillars	O
of	O
the	O

On	O
this	O

were	O
several	O

was	O
full	O

small	O
sticks	O
that	O

at	O
one	O

Our	O

made	O
a	O
great	O
many	O

for	O
us	O
to	O
fetch	O
and	O
to	O
leave	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
meat	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
seemed	O
very	O
importunate	O
but	O
we	O
refused	O

We	O
left	O
him	O
there	O

While	O
we	O
lay	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
we	O
saw	O
several	O
small	O
China	PNM
junks	O
sailing	O
in	O
the	O
lagoon	O
between	O
the	O
islands	O
and	O
the	O
main	O
,	O
one	O
came	O
and	O
anchored	O
by	O
us	O

I	O
and	O
some	O
more	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
went	O
aboard	O
to	O
view	O
her	O
:	O
she	O
was	O
built	O
with	O
a	O
square	O
flat	O
head	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
stern	O
,	O
only	O
the	O
head	O
or	O
fore	O
part	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
broad	O
as	O
the	O
stern	O
.	O

On	O
her	O
deck	O
she	O
had	O
little	O
thatched	O
houses	O
like	O
hovels	O
,	O
covered	O
with	O
palmetto-leaves	O
and	O
raised	O
about	O
three	O
foot	O
high	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
seamen	O
to	O
creep	O
into	O
.	O

She	O
had	O
a	O
pretty	O
large	O
cabin	O
wherein	O
there	O
was	O
an	O
altar	O
and	O
a	O
lamp	O
burning	O
.	O

I	O
did	O
but	O
just	O
look	O
in	O
and	O
saw	O
not	O
the	O
idol	O
.	O

The	O
hold	O
was	O
divided	O
into	O
many	O
small	O
partitions	O
,	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
made	O
so	O
tight	O
that	O
if	O
a	O
leak	O
should	O
spring	O
up	O
in	O
any	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
it	O
could	O
go	O
no	O
farther	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
could	O
do	O
but	O
little	O
damage	O
but	O
only	O
to	O
the	O
goods	O
in	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
that	O
room	O
where	O
the	O
leak	O
springs	O
up	O
.	O

Each	O
of	O
these	O
rooms	O
belong	O
to	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
merchants	O
,	O
or	O
more	O
;	O
and	O
every	O
man	O
freights	O
his	O
goods	O
in	O
his	O
own	O
room	O
;	O
and	O
probably	O
lodges	O
there	O
if	O
he	O
be	O
on	O

These	O
junks	O
have	O
only	O
two	O
masts	O
,	O
a	O
main-mast	O
and	O
a	O
fore-mast	O
.	O

The	O
fore-mast	O
has	O
a	O
square	O
yard	O
and	O
a	O
square	O
sail	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
main-mast	O
has	O
a	O
sail	O
narrow	O
aloft	O
like	O
a	O
sloop	O
's	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
fair	O
weather	O
they	O
use	O
a	O
topsail	O

is	O

haul	O
down	O
on	O
the	O

in	O

and	O
all	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
go	O
up	O
to	O
furl	O
it	O

The	O
main-mast	O
in	O
their	O
biggest	O
junks	O
seem	O
to	O
me	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
any	O
third-rate	O
man-of-war	O

mast	O
in	O
England	PNM

and	O
yet	O
not	O
pieced	O

made	O
of	O
one	O

tree	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
an	O
all	O
my	O

I	O
never	O

any	O
single-tree-masts	O

so	O

Some	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
went	O
over	O
to	O
a	O
pretty	O
large	O
town	O
on	O
the	O
continent	O
of	O
China	PNM
where	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
furnished	O
ourselves	O
with	O
provision	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
thing	O
we	O
were	O
always	O
in	O
want	O
of	O
and	O
was	O
our	O
chief	O
business	O
here	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
were	O
afraid	O
to	O
lie	O
in	O
this	O
place	O
any	O
longer	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
some	O
signs	O
of	O
an	O
approaching	O
storm	O
;	O
this	O
being	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
in	O
which	O
storms	O
are	O
expected	O
on	O
this	O
coast	O
;	O
and	O
here	O
was	O
no	O
safe	O
riding	O

It	O
was	O
now	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
for	O
the	O
south-west	O
monsoon	O
but	O
the	O
wind	O
had	O
been	O
whiffing	O
about	O
from	O
one	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
compass	O
to	O
another	O
for	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
quite	O
calm	O
.	O

This	O
caused	O
us	O
to	O
put	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
sea-room	O
at	O

;	O
for	O
such	O
flattering	O
weather	O
is	O
commonly	O
the	O
forerunner	O
of	O
a	O
tempest	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
we	O
weighed	O
anchor	O
and	O
set	O
out	O
;	O
yet	O
we	O
had	O
very	O
little	O
wind	O
all	O
the	O
next	O
night	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
day	O
ensuing	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
4th	O
day	O
of	O
July	O
,	O
about	O
four	O
a	O
clock	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
north-east	O
and	O
freshened	O
upon	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sky	O
looked	O
very	O
black	O
in	O
that	O
quarter	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
black	O
clouds	O
began	O
to	O
rise	O
apace	O
and	O
moved	O
towards	O
us	O
;	O
having	O
hung	O
all	O
the	O
morning	O
in	O
the	O
horizon	O
.	O

This	O
made	O
us	O
take	O
in	O
our	O
topsails	O
and	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
still	O
increasing	O
,	O
about	O
nine	O
a	O
clock	O
we	O
reefed	O
our	O
mainsail	O
and	O
foresail	O
;	O
at	O
ten	O
we	O
furled	O
our	O
foresail	O
,	O
keeping	O
under	O
a	O
mainsail	O
and	O
mizzen	O
.	O

At	O
eleven	O
a	O
clock	O
we	O
furled	O
our	O
mainsail	O
and	O
ballasted	O
our	O
mizzen	O
;	O
at	O
which	O
time	O
it	O
began	O
to	O
rain	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
twelve	O
a	O
clock	O
at	O
night	O
it	O
blew	O
exceeding	O
hard	O
and	O
the	O
rain	O
poured	O
down	O
as	O
through	O
a	O
sieve	O
.	O

It	O
thundered	O
and	O
lightened	O
prodigiously	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sea	O
seemed	O
all	O
of	O
a	O
fire	O
about	O
us	O
;	O
for	O
every	O
sea	O
that	O
broke	O
sparkled	O
like	O
lightning	O
.	O

The	O
violent	O
wind	O
raised	O
the	O
sea	O
presently	O
to	O
a	O
great	O
height	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
ran	O
very	O
short	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
break	O
in	O
on	O
our	O
deck	O
.	O

One	O
sea	O
struck	O
away	O
the	O
rails	O
of	O
our	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
sheet-anchor	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
stowed	O
with	O
one	O
flook	O
or	O
bending	O
of	O
the	O
iron	O
over	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
gunwale	O
,	O
and	O
lashed	O
very	O
well	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
side	O
,	O
was	O
violently	O
washed	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
like	O
to	O
have	O
struck	O
a	O
hole	O
in	O
our	O
bow	O
as	O
it	O
lay	O
beating	O
against	O
it	O
.	O

Then	O
we	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
put	O
right	O
before	O
the	O
wind	O
to	O
stow	O
our	O
anchor	O
again	O
;	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
with	O
much	O
ado	O
;	O
but	O
afterwards	O
we	O
durst	O
not	O
adventure	O
to	O
bring	O
our	O
ship	O
to	O
the	O
wind	O
again	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
foundering	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
turning	O
the	O
ship	O
either	O
to	O
or	O
fro	O
from	O
the	O
wind	O
is	O
dangerous	O
in	O
such	O
violent	O
storms	O
.	O

The	O
fierceness	O
of	O
the	O
weather	O
continued	O
till	O
four	O
a	O
clock	O
that	O
morning	O
;	O
in	O
which	O
time	O
we	O
did	O
cut	O
away	O
two	O
Canoas	O
that	O
were	O
towing	O
astern	O
.	O

After	O
four	O
a	O
clock	O
the	O
thunder	O
and	O
the	O
rain	O
abated	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
corpus	O
sant	O
at	O
our	O
main-top-mast	O
head	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
very	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
truck	O
of	O
the	O
spindle	O

This	O
sight	O
rejoiced	O
our	O
men	O
exceedingly	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
height	O
of	O
the	O
storm	O
is	O
commonly	O
over	O
when	O
the	O
corpus	O
sant	O
is	O
seen	O
aloft	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
they	O
are	O
seen	O
lying	O
on	O
the	O
deck	O
it	O
is	O
generally	O
accounted	O
a	O
bad	O
sign	O
.	O

A	O
corpus	O
sant	O
is	O
a	O
certain	O
small	O
glittering	O
light	O
;	O
when	O
it	O
appears	O
as	O
this	O
did	O
on	O
the	O
very	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
main-mast	O
or	O
at	O
a	O
yard-arm	O
it	O
is	O
like	O
a	O
star	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
it	O
appears	O
on	O
the	O
deck	O
it	O
resembles	O
a	O
great	O
glow-worm	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
have	O
another	O
name	O
for	O
it	O
-LRB-	O
though	O
I	O
take	O
even	O
this	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
Spanish	O
or	O
Portuguese	O
name	O

and	O
a	O
corruption	O
only	O
of	O
corpus	O

-RRB-	O
and	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
told	O
that	O
when	O
they	O
see	O
them	O
they	O
presently	O
go	O
to	O
prayers	O
and	O
bless	O
themselves	O
for	O
the	O
happy	O
sight	O

I	O
have	O
heard	O
some	O
ignorant	O
seamen	O
discoursing	O
how	O
they	O
have	O
seen	O
them	O
creep	O
,	O
or	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
say	O
,	O
travel	O
about	O
in	O
the	O
scuppers	O
,	O
telling	O
many	O
dismal	O
stories	O
that	O
happened	O
at	O
such	O
times	O
:	O
but	O
I	O
did	O
never	O
see	O
anyone	O
stir	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
first	O
fixed	O

except	O
upon	O

where	O
every	O
sea	O
washes	O
it	O
about	O
:	O
neither	O
did	O
I	O
ever	O
see	O
any	O
but	O
when	O
we	O
have	O
had	O
hard	O
rain	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
wind	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
do	O
believe	O
it	O
is	O
some	O
jelly	O
:	O
but	O
enough	O
of	O
this	O

We	O
continued	O
scudding	O
right	O
before	O
wind	O
and	O
sea	O
from	O
two	O
till	O
seven	O
a	O
clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
wind	O
being	O
much	O
abated	O
we	O
set	O
our	O
mizzen	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
our	O
ship	O
to	O
the	O
wind	O

and	O
lay	O
under	O
a	O

till	O
eleven	O

Then	O
it	O
fell	O
flat	O
calm	O

and	O
it	O
continued	O
so	O
for	O
about	O
two	O
hours	O
:	O
but	O
the	O
sky	O
looked	O
very	O
black	O
and	O
rueful	O
,	O
especially	O
in	O
the	O
south-west	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sea	O
tossed	O
us	O
about	O
like	O
an	O

for	O

of	O

About	O
one	O
a	O
clock	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
the	O
wind	O
sprung	O
up	O
at	O
south-west	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
quarter	O
from	O
whence	O
we	O
did	O
expect	O
it	O
:	O
therefore	O
we	O
presently	O
brailed	O
up	O
our	O
mizzen	O
and	O
wore	O
our	O
ship	O
:	O
but	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
sooner	O
put	O
our	O
ship	O
before	O
the	O
wind	O
but	O
it	O
blew	O
a	O
storm	O
again	O
and	O
rained	O
very	O
hard	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
so	O
violently	O
as	O
the	O
night	O
before	O
:	O
but	O
the	O
wind	O
was	O
altogether	O
as	O
boisterous	O

so	O
continued	O
till	O
ten	O
or	O
eleven	O
a	O
clock	O
at	O
night	O

All	O
which	O
time	O
we	O
scudded	O

Afterwards	O
the	O

died	O
away	O
by	O

and	O
before	O

The	O
6th	O
day	O
in	O
the	O

having	O
fine	O

we	O

up	O
our	O

dry	O
ourselves	O

our	O

The	O

These	O

They	O

they	O

of	O

Between	O
the	O

is	O
a	O

The	O
20th	O

we	O
had	O

blundering	O

for	O
we	O
did	O
not	O

any	O
people	O
,	O
being	O
in	O

in	O
these	O

;	O
however	O
seeing	O
we	O
were	O
here	O
,	O
we	O
boldly	O
ran	O
into	O
the	O
harbour	O
and	O
presently	O
sent	O
ashore	O
our	O
canoa	O
to	O
the	O

Our	O
people	O
were	O
met	O
by	O
an	O
officer	O
at	O
their	O
landing	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
quartermaster	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
the	O
chiefest	O
man	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
was	O
conducted	O
before	O
the	O
governor	O
and	O
examined	O
of	O
what	O
nation	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
was	O
our	O
business	O
here	O
.	O

He	O
answered	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
English	O
and	O
were	O
bound	O
to	O
Amoy	PNM
or	O
Anhay	PNM
,	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
city	O
standing	O
on	O
a	O
navigable	O
river	O
in	O
the	O
province	O
of	O
Fokien	PNM
in	O
China	PNM
,	O
and	O
is	O
a	O
place	O
of	O
vast	O
trade	O
,	O
there	O
being	O
a	O
huge	O
multitude	O
of	O
ships	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
general	O
on	O
all	O
these	O
coasts	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
heard	O
of	O
several	O
that	O
have	O
been	O
there	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
also	O
that	O
,	O
having	O
received	O
some	O
damage	O
by	O
a	O
storm	O
,	O
we	O
therefore	O
put	O
in	O
here	O
to	O
refit	O
before	O
we	O
could	O
adventure	O
to	O
go	O
farther	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
intend	O
to	O
lie	O
here	O
till	O
after	O
the	O
full	O
moon	O
,	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
another	O
storm	O
.	O

The	O
governor	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
better	O
refit	O
our	O
ship	O
at	O
Amoy	O
than	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
heard	O
that	O
two	O
English	O
vessels	O
were	O
arrived	O
there	O
already	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
very	O
ready	O
to	O
assist	O
us	O
in	O
anything	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
must	O
not	O
expect	O
to	O
trade	O
there	O
but	O
must	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
places	O
allowed	O
to	O
entertain	O
merchant-strangers	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
Amoy	O
and	O
Macao	PNM
.	O

Macao	O
is	O
a	O
town	O
of	O
great	O
trade	O
also	O
,	O
lying	O
in	O
an	O
island	O
at	O
the	O
very	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
river	PNM
of	PNM
Canton	PNM
.	O

It	O
is	O
fortified	O
and	O
garrisoned	O
by	O
a	O
large	O
Portuguese	O
colony	O
,	O
but	O
yet	O
under	O
the	O
Chinese	O
government	O
,	O
whose	O
people	O
inhabit	O
one	O
moiety	O
of	O
the	O
town	O
and	O
lay	O
on	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
what	O
tax	O
they	O
please	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
dare	O
not	O
disoblige	O
the	O
Chinese	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
losing	O
their	O
trade	O
.	O

However	O
the	O
governor	O
very	O
kindly	O
told	O
our	O
quartermaster	O
that	O
whatsoever	O
we	O
wanted	O
,	O
if	O
that	O
place	O
could	O
furnish	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
it	O
.	O

Yet	O
that	O
we	O
must	O
not	O
come	O
ashore	O
on	O
that	O
island	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
would	O
send	O
aboard	O
some	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
we	O
wanted	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
should	O
also	O
bring	O
it	O
off	O
to	O
us	O
.	O

That	O
nevertheless	O
we	O
might	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
on	O
other	O
islands	O
to	O
buy	O
refreshments	O
of	O
the	O
Chinese	O
.	O

After	O
the	O
discourse	O
was	O
ended	O
the	O
governor	O
dismissed	O
him	O
with	O
a	O
small	O

on	O

we	O
could	O

as	O
we	O
did	O
on	O
all	O
the	O

I	O
have	O
made	O
it	O
my	O
general	O
observation	O
that	O
where	O
the	O
land	O
is	O
fenced	O
with	O
steep	O
rocks	O
and	O
cliffs	O
against	O
the	O
sea	O
there	O
the	O
sea	O
is	O
very	O
deep	O
,	O
and	O
seldom	O
affords	O
anchor-ground	O
;	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
where	O
the	O
land	O
falls	O
away	O
with	O
a	O
declivity	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
-LRB-	O
although	O
the	O
land	O
be	O
extraordinary	O
high	O
within	O
-RRB-	O
yet	O
there	O
are	O
commonly	O
good	O
soundings	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
anchoring	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
the	O
visible	O
declivity	O
of	O
the	O
land	O
appears	O
near	O
,	O
or	O
at	O
the	O
edge	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
whether	O
pretty	O
steep	O
or	O
more	O
sloping	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
commonly	O
find	O
our	O
anchor-ground	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
deep	O
or	O
steep	O
;	O
therefore	O
we	O
come	O
nearer	O
the	O
shore	O
or	O
anchor	O
farther	O
off	O
as	O
we	O
see	O
convenient	O
;	O
for	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
coast	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
that	O
I	O
know	O
or	O
have	O
heard	O
of	O
where	O
the	O
land	O
is	O
of	O
a	O
continual	O
height	O
without	O
some	O
small	O
valleys	O
or	O
declivities	O
which	O
lie	O
intermixed	O
with	O
the	O
high	O
land	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
the	O
subsidings	O
of	O
valleys	O
or	O
low	O
lands	O
that	O
make	O
dents	O
in	O
the	O
shore	O
and	O
creeks	O
,	O
small	O
bays	O
,	O
and	O
harbours	O
,	O
or	O
little	O
coves	O
,	O
etc.	O
,	O
which	O
afford	O
good	O
anchoring	O
,	O
the	O
surface	O
of	O
the	O
earth	O
being	O
there	O
lodged	O
deep	O
under	O
water	O
.	O

Thus	O
we	O
find	O
many	O
good	O
harbours	O
on	O
such	O
coasts	O
where	O
the	O
land	O
bounds	O
the	O
sea	O
with	O
steep	O
cliffs	O
,	O
by	O
reason	O
of	O
the	O
declivities	O
or	O
subsiding	O
of	O
the	O
land	O
between	O
these	O
cliffs	O
:	O
but	O
where	O
the	O
declension	O
from	O
the	O
hills	O
or	O
cliffs	O
is	O
not	O
within	O
land	O
,	O
between	O
hill	O
and	O
hill	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Chile	PNM
and	O
Peru	PNM
,	O
the	O
declivity	O
is	O
toward	O
the	O
main	O
sea	O
,	O
or	O
into	O
it	O
,	O
the	O
coast	O
being	O
perpendicular	O

or	O
very	O
steep	O
from	O
the	O

All	O
that	O
coast	O
is	O
too	O

for	O

has	O
the	O

in	O

the	O

soon	O
driven	O

therefore	O
we	O
never	O

we	O
see	O
the	O
land	O
high	O
and	O
bounding	O
the	O
sea	O
with	O
steep	O
cliffs	O
;	O
and	O
for	O
this	O
reason	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
in	O
sight	O
of	O
States	PNM
Island	PNM
near	PNM
Tierra	PNM
del	PNM
Fuego	PNM
,	O
before	O
we	O
entered	O
into	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
,	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
think	O
of	O
anchoring	O
after	O
we	O
saw	O
what	O
land	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
steep	O
cliffs	O
which	O
appeared	O
against	O
the	O
sea	O
:	O
yet	O
there	O
might	O
be	O
little	O
harbours	O
or	O
coves	O
for	O
shallops	O
or	O
the	O
like	O
to	O
anchor	O
in	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
see	O
or	O
search	O
after	O
.	O

As	O
high	O
steep	O
cliffs	O
bounding	O
the	O
sea	O
have	O
this	O
ill	O
consequence	O
that	O
they	O
seldom	O
afford	O
anchoring	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
have	O
this	O
benefit	O
that	O
we	O
can	O
see	O
them	O
far	O
off	O
and	O
sail	O
close	O
to	O
them	O
without	O
danger	O
:	O
for	O
which	O
reason	O
we	O
call	O
them	O
bold	O
shores	O
;	O
whereas	O
low	O
land	O
on	O
the	O
contrary	O
is	O
seen	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
and	O
in	O
many	O
places	O
we	O
dare	O
not	O
come	O
near	O
it	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
running	O
aground	O
before	O
we	O
see	O
it	O

Besides	O
there	O
are	O
in	O
many	O
places	O
shoals	O
thrown	O
out	O

the	O

of	O

that	O
from	O
the	O

This	O
which	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
usually	O
good	O
anchoring	O
near	O
low	O
lands	O

may	O
be	O
illustrated	O
by	O
several	O
instances	O

Thus	O
on	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
bay	O
of	O
Campeachy	PNM
there	O
is	O

and	O
there	O
also	O
is	O
good	O

all	O
along	O

in	O
some	O
places	O
to	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

of	O

we	O
shall	O
have	O
so	O
many	O
fathom	O
as	O
we	O
are	O

off	O
from	O

that	O
is	O
from	O
nine	O

till	O
you	O

to	O
land	O

The	O
bay	O
of	O

also	O
is	O
low	O
land	O
,	O
and	O
continues	O
mostly	O
so	O
as	O
we	O
passed	O
along	O
from	O

to	O
the	O

afterwards	O
the	O

The	O
common	O
employment	O
for	O
the	O
men	O
is	O
fishing	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
did	O
never	O
see	O
them	O
catch	O
much	O
:	O
whether	O
it	O
is	O
more	O
plenty	O

The	O

I	O
did	O
never	O
see	O
them	O
kill	O
any	O
of	O
their	O
goats	O
or	O
hogs	O
for	O
themselves	O
,	O
yet	O
they	O
would	O
beg	O
the	O
paunches	O
of	O
the	O
goats	O
that	O
they	O
themselves	O
did	O
sell	O
to	O
us	O
:	O
and	O
if	O
any	O
of	O
our	O
surly	O
seamen	O
did	O
heave	O
them	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
they	O
would	O
take	O
them	O
up	O
again	O
and	O
the	O
skins	O
of	O
the	O
goats	O
also	O

They	O
would	O
not	O
meddle	O
with	O
hogs	O

if	O
our	O

threw	O
away	O
any	O

what	O
they	O
made	O
chitterlings	O
and	O
sausages	O
of	O

The	O
goat-skins	O
these	O
people	O
would	O
carry	O
ashore	O
,	O
and	O
making	O
a	O
fire	O
they	O
would	O
singe	O
off	O
all	O
the	O
hair	O

and	O
afterwards	O
let	O
the	O
skin	O
lie	O
and	O
parch	O
on	O
the	O
coals	O
till	O
they	O
thought	O
it	O
eatable	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
they	O
would	O
gnaw	O
it	O
and	O
tear	O
it	O
in	O
pieces	O
with	O
their	O
teeth	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
swallow	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
paunches	O
of	O
the	O
goats	O
would	O
make	O
them	O
an	O
excellent	O
dish	O
;	O
they	O
dressed	O
it	O
in	O
this	O
manner	O
.	O

They	O
would	O
turn	O
out	O
all	O
the	O
chopped	O
grass	O
and	O
crudities	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
maw	O
into	O
their	O
pots	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
it	O
over	O
the	O
fire	O
and	O
stir	O
it	O
about	O
often	O
:	O
this	O
would	O
smoke	O
and	O
puff	O
,	O
and	O
heave	O
up	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
boiling	O
;	O
wind	O
breaking	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ferment	O
and	O
making	O
a	O
very	O
savoury	O
stink	O

While	O
this	O
was	O
doing	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
any	O
fish	O
,	O
as	O
commonly	O
they	O
had	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
small	O
fish	O
,	O
these	O
they	O
would	O
make	O
very	O
clean	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
hating	O
nastiness	O
belike	O
-RRB-	O
and	O
cut	O
the	O
flesh	O
from	O
the	O
bone	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
mince	O
the	O
flesh	O
as	O
small	O
as	O
possibly	O
they	O
could	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
pot	O
was	O
well	O
boiled	O
they	O
would	O
take	O
it	O
up	O
and	O
,	O
strewing	O
a	O
little	O
salt	O
into	O
it	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
eat	O
it	O
,	O
mixed	O
with	O
their	O
raw	O
minced	O
flesh	O
.	O

The	O
dung	O
in	O
the	O
maw	O
would	O
look	O
like	O
so	O
much	O
boiled	O
herbs	O
minced	O
very	O
small	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
took	O
up	O
their	O
mess	O
with	O
their	O
fingers	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
Moors	O
do	O
their	O
pillaw	O
,	O
using	O
no	O
spoons	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
another	O
dish	O
made	O
of	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
locusts	O
,	O
whose	O
bodies	O
were	O
about	O
an	O
inch	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
long	O
and	O
as	O
thick	O
as	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
one	O
's	O
little	O
finger	O
;	O
with	O
large	O
thin	O
wings	O
and	O
long	O
and	O
small	O
legs	O
.	O

At	O
this	O
time	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
these	O
creatures	O
came	O
in	O
great	O
swarms	O
to	O
devour	O
their	O
potato	O
leaves	O
and	O
other	O
herbs	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
natives	O
would	O
go	O
out	O
with	O
small	O
nets	O
and	O
take	O
a	O
quart	O
at	O
one	O
sweep	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
had	O
enough	O
they	O
would	O
carry	O
them	O
home	O
and	O
parch	O
them	O
over	O
the	O
fire	O
in	O
an	O
earthen	O
pan	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
their	O
wings	O
and	O
legs	O
would	O
fall	O
off	O
and	O
their	O
heads	O
and	O
backs	O
would	O
turn	O
red	O
like	O
boiled	O
shrimps	O
,	O
being	O
before	O
brownish	O
.	O

Their	O
bodies	O
being	O
full	O
would	O
eat	O
very	O
moist	O
,	O
their	O
heads	O
would	O
crackle	O
in	O
one	O
's	O
teeth	O
.	O

I	O
did	O
once	O
eat	O
of	O
this	O
dish	O
and	O
liked	O
it	O
well	O
enough	O
;	O
but	O
their	O
other	O
dish	O
my	O
stomach	O
would	O
not	O
take	O
.	O

Their	O
common	O
drink	O
is	O
water	O
;	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
of	O
all	O
other	O
Indians	O
:	O
besides	O
which	O
they	O
make	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
drink	O
with	O
the	O
juice	O
of	O
the	O
sugar-cane	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
boil	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
some	O
small	O
black	O
sort	O
of	O
berries	O
among	O
it	O
.	O

When	O
it	O
is	O
well	O
boiled	O
they	O
put	O
it	O
into	O
great	O
jars	O
and	O
let	O
it	O
stand	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
days	O
and	O
work	O
.	O

Then	O
it	O
settles	O
and	O
becomes	O
clear	O
,	O
and	O
is	O
presently	O
fit	O
to	O
drink	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
an	O
excellent	O
liquor	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
much	O
like	O
English	O
beer	O
,	O
both	O
in	O
colour	O
and	O
taste	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
very	O
strong	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
very	O
wholesome	O
:	O
for	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
drank	O
briskly	O
of	O
it	O
all	O
day	O
for	O
several	O
weeks	O
,	O
were	O
frequently	O
drunk	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
never	O
sick	O
after	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
natives	O
brought	O
a	O
vast	O
deal	O
of	O
it	O
every	O
day	O
to	O
those	O
aboard	O
and	O
ashore	O
:	O
for	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
were	O
ashore	O
at	O
work	O
on	O
Bashee	PNM
Island	PNM
;	O
which	O
island	O
they	O
gave	O
that	O
name	O
to	O
from	O
their	O
drinking	O
this	O
liquor	O
there	O
;	O
that	O
being	O
the	O
name	O
which	O
the	O
natives	O
called	O
this	O
liquor	O
by	O
:	O
and	O
as	O
they	O
sold	O
it	O
to	O
our	O
men	O
very	O
cheap	O
so	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
spare	O
to	O
drink	O
it	O
as	O
freely	O
.	O

And	O
indeed	O
from	O
the	O
plenty	O
of	O
this	O
liquor	O
and	O
their	O
plentiful	O
use	O
of	O
it	O
our	O

What	O
language	O
these	O
people	O
do	O
speak	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
:	O
for	O
it	O
had	O
no	O
affinity	O
in	O
sound	O
to	O
the	O
Chinese	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
spoken	O
much	O
through	O
the	O

;	O
nor	O
yet	O
to	O
the	O
Malayan	O
language	O

They	O
called	O
the	O
metal	O
that	O
their	O
earrings	O
were	O
made	O
of	O
bullawan	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
Mindanao	O
word	O
for	O
gold	O
;	O
therefore	O
probably	O
they	O
may	O
be	O
related	O
to	O
the	O
Philippine	O
Indians	O
;	O
for	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
general	O
name	O
for	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
learn	O
from	O
whence	O
they	O
have	O
their	O
iron	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
most	O
likely	O
they	O
go	O
in	O
their	O
great	O
boats	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
end	O
of	O
Luconia	PNM
and	O
trade	O
with	O
the	O
Indians	O
of	O
that	O
island	O
for	O
it	O

Neither	O
did	O
I	O
see	O
anything	O
beside	O
iron	O
and	O
pieces	O
of	O
buffalo	O
hides	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
could	O
judge	O
that	O
they	O
bought	O
of	O
strangers	O
:	O
their	O
clothes	O
were	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
growth	O
and	O
manufacture	O
.	O

These	O
men	O
had	O
wooden	O
lances	O
and	O
a	O
few	O
lances	O
headed	O
with	O
iron	O
;	O
which	O
are	O
all	O
the	O
weapons	O
that	O
they	O
have	O

Their	O
armour	O
is	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
buffalo	O
hide	O
,	O
shaped	O
like	O
our	O
carters	O
'	O
frocks	O

being	O
without	O

both	O

This	O
buff	O
coat	O
reaches	O
down	O
to	O
their	O
knees	O
:	O
it	O
is	O
close	O
about	O
their	O

below	O
it	O
is	O
three	O
foot	O
wide	O
and	O
as	O
thick	O

I	O
could	O
never	O
perceive	O
them	O
to	O
worship	O
anything	O
,	O
neither	O
had	O
they	O
any	O
idols	O
;	O
neither	O
did	O
they	O
seem	O
to	O
observe	O
any	O
one	O
day	O
more	O
than	O

I	O
could	O
never	O
perceive	O
that	O
one	O
man	O
was	O
of	O
greater	O
power	O
than	O
another	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
all	O
equal	O
;	O
only	O
every	O
man	O
ruling	O
in	O
his	O
own	O
house	O

and	O
the	O
children	O
respecting	O
and	O
honouring	O
their	O
parents	O

Yet	O
it	O
is	O
probable	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
some	O
law	O
or	O
custom	O
by	O
which	O
they	O
are	O
governed	O
;	O
for	O
while	O
we	O
lay	O
here	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
young	O
man	O
buried	O
alive	O
in	O
the	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
for	O
theft	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
we	O

from	O
them	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
deep	O
hole	O
dug	O
and	O
abundance	O
of	O
people	O
came	O
to	O
the	O

to	O
take	O
their	O
last	O
farewell	O
of	O
him	O
:	O
among	O
the	O
rest	O
there	O
was	O
one	O
woman	O
who	O
made	O
great	O
lamentation	O
and	O
took	O
off	O
the	O
condemned	O
person	O
's	O
earrings	O

We	O
supposed	O
her	O
to	O
be	O
his	O

After	O
he	O
had	O
taken	O
his	O
leave	O
of	O

he	O
was	O
put	O
into	O

covered	O

He	O
did	O
not	O

yielded	O
very	O
quietly	O
to	O
his	O
punishment	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
rammed	O
the	O
earth	O
close	O
upon	O
him	O
and	O
stifled	O
him	O

They	O
have	O

one	O

when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
their	O
houses	O
,	O
would	O
modestly	O
beg	O
any	O
rags	O
or	O
small	O
pieces	O
of	O
cloth	O
to	O
swaddle	O
their	O
young	O
ones	O
in	O

holding	O
their	O
children	O
out	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
begging	O
is	O
usual	O
among	O
all	O
these	O
wild	O
nations	O
.	O

Yet	O
neither	O
did	O
they	O
beg	O
so	O
importunately	O
as	O
in	O
other	O
places	O
;	O
nor	O
did	O
the	O
men	O
ever	O
beg	O
anything	O
at	O
all	O
.	O

Neither	O
,	O
except	O
once	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
that	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
I	O
shall	O
relate	O
-RRB-	O
did	O
they	O
steal	O
anything	O
;	O
but	O
dealt	O
justly	O
and	O
with	O
great	O
sincerity	O
with	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
make	O
us	O
very	O
welcome	O
to	O
their	O
houses	O
with	O
bashee-drink	O
.	O

If	O
they	O
had	O
none	O
of	O
this	O
liquor	O
themselves	O
they	O
would	O
buy	O
a	O
jar	O
of	O
drink	O
of	O
their	O
neighbours	O
and	O
sit	O
down	O
with	O
us	O
:	O
for	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
them	O
go	O
and	O
give	O
a	O
piece	O
or	O
two	O
of	O
their	O
gold	O
for	O
some	O
jars	O
of	O
bashee	O
.	O

And	O
indeed	O
among	O
wild	O
Indians	O
,	O
as	O
these	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
,	O
I	O
wondered	O
to	O
see	O
buying	O
and	O
selling	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
not	O
so	O
usual	O
;	O
nor	O
to	O
converse	O
so	O
freely	O
as	O
to	O
go	O
aboard	O
strangers	O
'	O
ships	O
with	O
so	O
little	O
caution	O
:	O
yet	O
their	O
own	O
small	O
trading	O
may	O
have	O
brought	O
them	O
to	O
this	O
.	O

At	O
these	O
entertainments	O
they	O
and	O
their	O
family	O
,	O
wife	O
and	O
children	O
,	O
drank	O
out	O
of	O
small	O
calabashes	O
:	O
and	O
when	O
by	O
themselves	O
they	O
drink	O
about	O
from	O
one	O
to	O
another	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
any	O
of	O
us	O
came	O
among	O
them	O
then	O
they	O
would	O
always	O
drink	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
us	O
.	O

They	O
have	O
no	O
sort	O
of	O
coin	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
have	O
small	O
crumbs	O
of	O
the	O
metal	O
before	O
described	O
which	O
they	O
bind	O
up	O
very	O
safe	O
in	O
plantain	O
leaves	O
or	O
the	O
like	O
.	O

This	O
metal	O
they	O
exchange	O
for	O
what	O
they	O
want	O
,	O
giving	O
a	O
small	O
quantity	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
about	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
grains	O
,	O
for	O
a	O
jar	O
of	O
drink	O
that	O
would	O
hold	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
gallons	O
.	O

They	O
have	O
no	O
scales	O
but	O
give	O
it	O
by	O
guess	O

Thus	O
much	O
in	O
general	O
.	O

To	O
proceed	O
therefore	O
with	O
our	O
affairs	O
:	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
before	O
that	O
we	O
anchored	O
here	O
the	O
6th	O
day	O
of	O
August	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
were	O
furling	O
our	O
sails	O
there	O
came	O
near	O
100	O
boats	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
aboard	O
,	O
with	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
men	O
in	O
each	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
our	O
deck	O
was	O
full	O
of	O
men	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
at	O
first	O
afraid	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
got	O
up	O
20	O
or	O
30	O
small	O
arms	O
on	O
our	O
poop	O
and	O
kept	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
men	O
as	O
sentinels	O
,	O
with	O
guns	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
ready	O
to	O
fire	O
on	O
them	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
offered	O
to	O
molest	O
us	O
.	O

But	O
they	O
were	O
pretty	O
quiet	O
,	O
only	O
they	O
picked	O
up	O
such	O
old	O
iron	O
that	O
they	O
found	O
on	O
our	O
deck	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
also	O
took	O
out	O
our	O
pump	O
bolts	O
and	O
linchpins	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
carriages	O
of	O
our	O
guns	O
before	O
we	O
perceived	O
them	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
perceived	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
very	O
busy	O
getting	O
out	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
linchpins	O
;	O
and	O
took	O
hold	O
of	O
the	O
fellow	O
who	O
immediately	O
bawled	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
presently	O
leapt	O
overboard	O
,	O
some	O
into	O
their	O
boats	O
,	O
others	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
all	O
made	O
away	O
for	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

But	O
when	O
we	O
perceived	O
their	O
fright	O
we	O
made	O
much	O
of	O
him	O
that	O
was	O
in	O
hold	O
,	O
who	O
stood	O
trembling	O
all	O
the	O
while	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
we	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
small	O
piece	O
of	O
iron	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
he	O
immediately	O
leapt	O
overboard	O
and	O
swam	O
to	O
his	O
consorts	O
who	O
hovered	O
about	O
our	O
ship	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
issue	O
.	O

Then	O
we	O
beckoned	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
come	O
aboard	O
again	O
,	O
being	O
very	O
loth	O
to	O
lose	O
a	O
commerce	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

Some	O
of	O
the	O
boats	O
came	O
aboard	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
always	O
very	O
honest	O
and	O
civil	O
afterward	O
.	O

We	O
presently	O
after	O
this	O
sent	O
a	O
canoa	O
ashore	O
to	O
see	O
their	O
manner	O
of	O
living	O
and	O
what	O
provision	O
they	O
had	O
:	O
the	O
canoa	O
's	O
crew	O
were	O
made	O
very	O
welcome	O
with	O
bashee-drink	O
and	O
saw	O
abundance	O
of	O
hogs	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
bought	O
and	O
returned	O
aboard	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
the	O
natives	O
brought	O
aboard	O
both	O
hogs	O
and	O
goats	O
to	O
us	O
in	O
their	O
own	O
boats	O
;	O
and	O
every	O
day	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
fifteen	O
or	O
twenty	O
hogs	O
and	O
goats	O
in	O
boats	O
aboard	O
by	O
our	O
side	O
.	O

These	O
we	O
bought	O
for	O
a	O
small	O
matter	O
;	O
we	O
could	O
buy	O
a	O
good	O
fat	O
goat	O
for	O
an	O
old	O
iron	O
hoop	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
hog	O
of	O
seventy	O
or	O
eighty	O
pounds	O
weight	O
for	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
pound	O
of	O
iron	O
.	O

Their	O
drink	O
also	O
they	O
brought	O
off	O
in	O
jars	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
bought	O
for	O
old	O
nails	O
,	O
spikes	O
and	O
leaden	O
bullets	O
.	O

Beside	O
the	O
fore-mentioned	O
commodities	O
they	O
brought	O
aboard	O
great	O
quantities	O
of	O
yams	O
and	O
potatoes	O
;	O
which	O
we	O
purchased	O
for	O
nails	O
,	O
spikes	O
or	O
bullets	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
one	O
man	O
's	O
work	O
to	O
be	O
all	O
day	O
cutting	O
out	O
bars	O
of	O
iron	O
into	O
small	O
pieces	O
with	O
a	O
cold	O
chisel	O
:	O
and	O
these	O
were	O
for	O
the	O
great	O
purchases	O
of	O
hogs	O
and	O
goats	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
sell	O
for	O
nails	O
,	O
as	O
their	O
drink	O
and	O
roots	O
.	O

We	O
never	O
let	O
them	O
know	O
what	O
store	O
we	O
have	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
may	O
value	O
it	O
the	O
more	O
.	O

Every	O
morning	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
light	O
they	O
would	O
thus	O
come	O
aboard	O
with	O
their	O
commodities	O
which	O
we	O
bought	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
occasion	O
.	O

We	O
did	O
commonly	O
furnish	O
ourselves	O
with	O
as	O
many	O
goats	O
and	O
roots	O
as	O
served	O
us	O
all	O
the	O
day	O
;	O
and	O
their	O
hogs	O
we	O
bought	O
in	O
large	O
quantities	O
as	O
we	O
thought	O
convenient	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
salted	O
them	O
.	O

Their	O
hogs	O
were	O
very	O
sweet	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
never	O
saw	O
so	O
many	O
measled	O
ones	O
.	O

We	O
filled	O
all	O
our	O
water	O
at	O
a	O
curious	O
brook	O
close	O
by	O
us	O
in	O
Grafton	PNM
's	PNM
Isle	PNM
where	O
we	O
first	O
anchored	O
.	O

We	O
stayed	O
there	O
about	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
days	O
before	O
we	O
went	O
to	O
other	O
islands	O
.	O

We	O
sailed	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
,	O
passing	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
of	O
Grafton	PNM
Island	PNM
,	O
and	O
then	O
passed	O
through	O
between	O
that	O
and	O
Monmouth	PNM
Island	PNM
;	O
but	O
we	O
found	O
no	O
anchoring	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
end	O
of	O
Monmouth	PNM
Island	PNM
,	O
and	O
there	O
we	O
stopped	O
during	O
one	O
tide	O
.	O

The	O
tide	O
runs	O
very	O
strong	O
here	O
and	O
sometimes	O
makes	O
a	O
short	O
chopping	O
sea	O
.	O

Its	O
course	O
among	O
these	O
islands	O
is	O
south	O
by	O
east	O
and	O
north	O
by	O
W	O
.	O

The	O
flood	O
sets	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
,	O
and	O
ebb	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
rises	O
and	O
falls	O
eight	O
foot	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
went	O
from	O
hence	O
we	O
coasted	O
about	O
two	O
leagues	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
on	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
of	O
Monmouth	PNM
Island	PNM
;	O
and	O
,	O
finding	O
no	O
anchor-ground	O
we	O
stood	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
Bashee	PNM
Island	PNM
and	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
on	O
the	O
north-east	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
against	O
a	O
small	O
sandy	O
bay	O
,	O
in	O
seven	O
fathom	O
clean	O
hard	O
sand	O
and	O
about	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

Here	O
is	O
a	O
pretty	O
wide	O
channel	O
between	O
these	O
two	O
islands	O
and	O
anchoring	O
all	O
over	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
depth	O
of	O
water	O
is	O
twelve	O
,	O
fourteen	O
,	O
and	O
sixteen	O
fathom	O
.	O

We	O
presently	O
built	O
a	O
tent	O
ashore	O
to	O
mend	O
our	O
sails	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
stayed	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
our	O
time	O
here	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
13th	O
day	O
of	O
August	O
till	O
the	O
26th	O
day	O
of	O
September	O
.	O

In	O
which	O
time	O
we	O
mended	O
our	O
sails	O
and	O
scrubbed	O
our	O
ship	O
's	O
bottom	O
very	O
well	O
;	O
and	O
every	O
day	O
some	O
of	O
us	O
went	O
to	O
their	O
towns	O
and	O
were	O
kindly	O
entertained	O
by	O
them	O
.	O

Their	O
boats	O
also	O
came	O
aboard	O
with	O
their	O
merchandise	O
to	O
sell	O
,	O
and	O
lay	O
aboard	O
all	O
day	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
take	O
it	O
off	O
their	O
hands	O
one	O
day	O
they	O
would	O
bring	O
the	O
same	O
again	O
the	O
next	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
yet	O
the	O
winds	O
at	O
south-west	O
and	O
south-south-west	O
mostly	O
fair	O
weather	O
.	O

In	O
October	O
we	O
did	O
expect	O
the	O
winds	O
to	O
shift	O
to	O
the	O
north-east	O
and	O
therefore	O
we	O
provided	O
to	O
sail	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
eastern	O
monsoon	O
was	O
settled	O
-RRB-	O
to	O
cruise	O
off	O
of	O
Manila	PNM
.	O

Accordingly	O
we	O
provided	O
a	O
stock	O
of	O
provision	O
.	O

We	O
salted	O
seventy	O
or	O
eighty	O
good	O
fat	O
hogs	O
and	O
bought	O
yams	O
and	O
potatoes	O
good	O
store	O
to	O
eat	O
at	O
sea	O
.	O

About	O
the	O
24th	O
day	O
of	O
September	O
the	O
winds	O
shifted	O
about	O
to	O
the	O
east	O
,	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
to	O
the	O
north-east	O
fine	O
fair	O
weather	O
.	O

The	O
25th	O
it	O
came	O
at	O
north	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
grow	O
fresh	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sky	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
clouded	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
wind	O
freshened	O
on	O
us	O
.	O

At	O
twelve	O
a	O
clock	O
at	O
night	O
it	O
blew	O
a	O
very	O
fierce	O
storm	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
then	O
riding	O
with	O
our	O
best	O
bower	O
ahead	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
our	O
yards	O
and	O
top-mast	O
were	O
down	O
yet	O
we	O
drove	O
.	O

This	O
obliged	O
us	O
to	O
let	O
go	O
our	O
sheet-anchor	O
,	O
veering	O
out	O
a	O
good	O
scope	O
of	O
cable	O
,	O
which	O
stopped	O
us	O
till	O
ten	O
or	O
eleven	O
a	O
clock	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
.	O

Then	O
the	O
wind	O
came	O
on	O
so	O
fierce	O
that	O
she	O
drove	O
again	O
,	O
with	O
both	O
anchors	O
ahead	O
.	O

The	O
wind	O
was	O
now	O
at	O
north	O
by	O
W.	O
and	O
we	O
kept	O
driving	O
till	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
a	O
clock	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
:	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
well	O
for	O
us	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
islands	O
,	O
rocks	O
,	O
or	O
sands	O
in	O
our	O
way	O
,	O
for	O
if	O
there	O
had	O
we	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
driven	O
upon	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
used	O
our	O
utmost	O
endeavours	O
to	O
stop	O
here	O
,	O
being	O
loth	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
sea	O
because	O
we	O
had	O
six	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
ashore	O
who	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
off	O
now	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
we	O
were	O
driven	O
out	O
into	O
deep	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
vain	O
to	O
wait	O
any	O
longer	O
:	O
therefore	O
we	O
hove	O
in	O
our	O
sheet-cable	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
up	O
our	O
sheet-anchor	O
,	O
and	O
cut	O
away	O
our	O
best	O
bower	O
-LRB-	O
for	O

have	O
foundered	O
us	O
-RRB-	O
and	O
so	O
put	O
to	O
sea	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
very	O
violent	O
weather	O
the	O
night	O
ensuing	O
,	O
with	O
very	O
hard	O
rain	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
scud	O
with	O
our	O
bare	O
poles	O
till	O
three	O
a	O
clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
.	O

Then	O
the	O
wind	O
slackened	O
and	O
we	O
brought	O
our	O
ship	O
to	O
under	O
a	O
mizzen	O
,	O
and	O
lay	O
with	O
our	O
head	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
.	O

The	O
27th	O
day	O
the	O
wind	O
abated	O
much	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
rained	O
very	O
hard	O
all	O
day	O
and	O
the	O
night	O
ensuing	O
.	O

The	O
28th	O
day	O
the	O
wind	O
came	O
about	O
to	O
the	O
north-east	O
and	O
it	O
cleared	O
up	O
and	O
blew	O
a	O
hard	O
gale	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
stood	O
not	O
there	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
shifted	O
about	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
,	O
thence	O
to	O
the	O
south-east	O
,	O
then	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
settled	O
at	O
south-west	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
moderate	O
gale	O
and	O
fair	O
weather	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
29th	O
day	O
when	O
the	O
wind	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
south-west	O
.	O

Then	O
we	O
made	O
all	O
the	O
sail	O
we	O
could	O
for	O
the	O
island	O
again	O
.	O

The	O
30th	O
day	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
west	O
and	O
saw	O
the	O
islands	O
but	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
in	O
before	O
night	O
.	O

Therefore	O
we	O
stood	O
off	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
till	O
two	O
a	O
clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
;	O
then	O
we	O
tacked	O
and	O
stood	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
twelve	O
a	O
clock	O
the	O
1st	O
day	O
of	O
October	O
we	O
anchored	O
again	O
at	O
the	O
place	O
from	O
whence	O
we	O
were	O
driven	O
.	O

Then	O
our	O
six	O
men	O
were	O
brought	O
aboard	O
by	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
to	O
whom	O
we	O
gave	O
three	O
whole	O
bars	O
of	O
iron	O
for	O
their	O
kindness	O
and	O
civility	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
an	O
extraordinary	O
present	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

Mr.	O
Robert	O
Hall	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
that	O
was	O
left	O
ashore	O
.	O

I	O
shall	O
speak	O
more	O
of	O
him	O
hereafter	O

He	O
and	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
them	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
out	O
of	O
sight	O
,	O
the	O
natives	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
kind	O
to	O
them	O
than	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
persuaded	O
them	O
to	O
cut	O
their	O
hair	O
short	O
,	O
as	O
theirs	O
was	O
,	O
offering	O
to	O
each	O
of	O
them	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
do	O
it	O
a	O
young	O
woman	O
to	O
wife	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
small	O
hatchet	O
and	O
other	O
iron	O
utensils	O
fit	O
for	O
a	O
planter	O
,	O
in	O
dowry	O
;	O
and	O
withal	O
showed	O
them	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
land	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
manage	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
courted	O
thus	O
by	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
town	O
where	O
they	O
then	O
were	O
:	O
but	O
they	O
took	O
up	O
their	O
headquarters	O
at	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
him	O
with	O
whom	O
they	O
first	O
went	O
ashore	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
ship	O
appeared	O
in	O
sight	O
again	O
then	O
they	O
importuned	O
them	O
for	O
some	O
iron	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
chief	O
thing	O
that	O
they	O
covet	O
,	O
even	O
above	O
their	O
earrings	O
.	O

We	O
might	O
have	O
bought	O
all	O
their	O
earrings	O
,	O
or	O
other	O
gold	O
they	O
had	O
,	O
with	O
our	O
iron	O
bars	O
,	O
had	O
we	O
been	O
assured	O
of	O
its	O
goodness	O
;	O
and	O
yet	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
touched	O
and	O
compared	O
with	O
other	O
gold	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
discern	O
any	O
difference	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
looked	O
so	O
pale	O
in	O
the	O
lump	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
seeing	O
them	O
polish	O
it	O
so	O
often	O
was	O
a	O
new	O
discouragement	O
.	O

This	O
last	O
storm	O
put	O
our	O
men	O
quite	O
out	O
of	O
heart	O
:	O
for	O
although	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
altogether	O
so	O
fierce	O
as	O
that	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
China	PNM
,	O
which	O
was	O
still	O
fresh	O
in	O
memory	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
wrought	O
more	O
powerfully	O
and	O
frightened	O
them	O
from	O
their	O
design	O
of	O
cruising	O
before	O
Manila	O
,	O
fearing	O
another	O
storm	O
there	O
.	O

Now	O
every	O
man	O
wished	O
himself	O
at	O
home	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
done	O
a	O
hundred	O
times	O
before	O
:	O
but	O
Captain	O
Read	O
and	O
Captain	O
Teat	O
the	O
master	O
persuaded	O
them	O
to	O
go	O
towards	O
Cape	PNM
Comorin	PNM
,	O
and	O
then	O
they	O
would	O
tell	O
them	O
more	O
of	O
their	O
minds	O
,	O
intending	O
doubtless	O
to	O
cruise	O
in	O
the	O
Red	O
Sea	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
easily	O
prevailed	O
with	O
the	O
crew	O
.	O

The	O
eastern	O
monsoon	O
was	O
now	O
at	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
had	O
been	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
the	O
Straits	O
of	O
Malacca	PNM
:	O
but	O
Captain	O
Teat	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
dangerous	O
by	O
reason	O
of	O
many	O
islands	O
and	O
shoals	O
there	O
with	O
which	O
none	O
of	O
us	O
were	O
acquainted	O
.	O

Therefore	O
he	O
thought	O
it	O
best	O
to	O
go	O
round	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
Philippine	PNM
Islands	PNM
and	O
so	O
,	O
keeping	O
south	O

pass	O
out	O
into	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indian	PNM

about	O
the	O

This	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
very	O
tedious	O
way	O
about	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
dangerous	O
altogether	O
for	O
shoals	O
;	O
but	O
not	O
for	O
meeting	O
with	O
English	O

which	O
was	O
their	O
greatest	O
fear	O

that	O
the	O
farther	O
we	O

should	O

We	O
had	O
fair	O
weather	O
and	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
west	O

We	O
first	O
steered	O
south-south-west	O

passed	O
close	O

that	O
lie	O

the	O
north	O

of	O

We	O
left	O
them	O

us	O

passed	O
on	O
the	O

it	O
and	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
Philippine	O

to	O
the	O

The	O
north-east	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O

appears	O
to	O
be	O
good	O

of	O
an	O

and	O
even	O
for	O

only	O
it	O

some	O

the	O

Leaving	O
the	O
isle	O
Luconia	PNM
,	O
and	O
with	O
it	O
our	O
golden	O
projects	O
,	O
we	O
sailed	O
onto	O
the	O
southward	O

passing	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
Philippine	PNM
Islands	PNM
.	O

These	O
appear	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
mountainous	O
and	O
less	O
woody	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
in	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
St.	PNM
John	PNM
;	O
the	O
first	O
of	O
that	O
name	O
I	O
mentioned	O
:	O
the	O

I	O
spoke	O
of	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
China	PNM
.	O

This	O
I	O
have	O
already	O
described	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
very	O
woody	O
island	O
.	O

Here	O
the	O
wind	O
coming	O
southerly	O
forced	O
us	O
to	O
keep	O
farther	O
from	O
the	O
islands	O
.	O

The	O
14th	O
day	O
of	O
October	O
we	O
came	O
close	O
by	O
a	O
small	O
low	O
woody	O
island	O
that	O
lies	O
east	O
from	O
the	O
south-east	O
end	O
of	O
Mindanao	PNM
,	O
distant	O
from	O
it	O
about	O
20	O
leagues	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
not	O
find	O
it	O
set	O
down	O
in	O
any	O
sea-chart	O
.	O

The	O
15th	O
day	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
north-east	O
and	O
we	O
steered	O
west	O
for	O
the	O
island	O
Mindanao	PNM
,	O
and	O
arrived	O
at	O
the	O
south-east	O
end	O
again	O
on	O
the	O
16th	O
day	O
.	O

There	O
we	O
went	O
in	O
and	O
anchored	O
between	O
two	O
small	O
islands	O
which	O
lie	O
in	O
about	O
5	O
degrees	O
10	O
minutes	O
north	O
latitude	O
.	O

I	O
mentioned	O
them	O
when	O
we	O
first	O
came	O
on	O
this	O
coast	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
fine	O
small	O
cove	O
on	O
the	O
north-west	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
easternmost	O
island	O
,	O
fit	O
to	O
careen	O
in	O
or	O
haul	O
ashore	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
went	O
in	O
there	O
and	O
presently	O
unrigged	O
our	O
ship	O
and	O
provided	O
to	O
haul	O

These	O
islands	O
are	O
about	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
island	O
Mindanao	PNM
;	O
they	O
are	O
about	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
leagues	O
in	O
circumference	O
and	O
of	O
a	O
pretty	O
good	O
height	O
.	O

The	O
mould	O
is	O
black	O
and	O
deep	O
and	O
there	O
are	O
two	O
small	O
brooks	O
of	O
fresh	O
water	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
both	O
plentifully	O
stored	O
with	O
great	O
high	O
trees	O
;	O
therefore	O
our	O
carpenters	O
were	O
sent	O
ashore	O
to	O
cut	O
down	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
for	O
our	O
use	O
;	O
for	O
here	O
they	O
made	O
a	O
new	O
boltsprit	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
set	O
here	O
also	O
,	O
our	O
old	O
one	O
being	O
very	O
faulty	O
.	O

They	O
made	O
a	O
new	O
fore-yard	O
too	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
fore-top-mast	O
:	O
and	O
our	O
pumps	O
being	O
faulty	O
and	O
not	O
serviceable	O
they	O
did	O
cut	O
a	O
tree	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
pump	O
.	O

They	O
first	O
squared	O
it	O
,	O
then	O
sawed	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
hollowed	O
each	O
side	O
exactly	O
.	O

The	O
two	O
hollow	O
sides	O
were	O
made	O
big	O
enough	O
to	O
contain	O
a	O
pump	O
box	O
in	O
the	O
midst	O
of	O
them	O
both	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
joined	O
together	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
required	O
their	O
utmost	O
skill	O
to	O
close	O
them	O
exactly	O
to	O
the	O
making	O
a	O
tight	O
cylinder	O
for	O
the	O
pump-box	O
;	O
being	O
unaccustomed	O
to	O
such	O
work	O
.	O

We	O
learnt	O
this	O
way	O
of	O
pump-making	O
from	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
who	O
make	O
their	O
pumps	O
that	O
they	O
use	O
in	O
their	O
ships	O
in	O
the	O
South	O
Seas	O
after	O
this	O
manner	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
confident	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
no	O
better	O
hand-pumps	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
than	O
they	O
have	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
lay	O
here	O
the	O
young	O
prince	O
that	O
I	O
mentioned	O
in	O
the	O
13th	O
chapter	O
came	O
aboard	O
.	O

He	O
understanding	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
bound	O
farther	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
desired	O
us	O
to	O
transport	O
him	O
and	O
his	O
men	O
to	O
his	O
own	O
island	O
.	O

He	O
showed	O
it	O
to	O
us	O
in	O
our	O
chart	O
and	O
told	O
us	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
which	O
we	O
put	O
down	O
in	O
our	O
chart	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
named	O
there	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
quite	O
forgot	O
to	O
put	O
it	O
into	O
my	O
journal	O
.	O

This	O
man	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
not	O
above	O
six	O
days	O
before	O
this	O
he	O
saw	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
and	O
several	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
that	O
we	O
left	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
named	O
the	O
names	O
of	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
who	O
he	O
said	O
were	O
all	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
now	O
they	O
were	O
at	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Mindanao	PNM
;	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
been	O
out	O
with	O
Raja	O
Laut	O
,	O
fighting	O
under	O
him	O
in	O
his	O
wars	O
against	O
his	O
enemies	O
the	O
Alfoores	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
fought	O
with	O
undaunted	O
courage	O
;	O
for	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
highly	O
honoured	O
and	O
esteemed	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
by	O
the	O
sultan	O
as	O
by	O
the	O
general	O
Raja	O
Laut	O
;	O
that	O
now	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
intended	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
his	O
men	O
to	O
Fort	PNM
St.	PNM
George	PNM
and	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
thereto	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
proffered	O
forty	O
ounces	O
of	O
gold	O
for	O
a	O
ship	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
owner	O
and	O
he	O
were	O
not	O
yet	O
agreed	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
feared	O
that	O
the	O
sultan	O
would	O
not	O
let	O
him	O
go	O
away	O
till	O
the	O
wars	O
were	O
ended	O
.	O

All	O
this	O
the	O
prince	O
told	O
us	O
in	O
the	O
Malayan	O
tongue	O
,	O
which	O
many	O
of	O
us	O
had	O
learnt	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
he	O
went	O
away	O
he	O
promised	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
us	O
again	O
in	O
three	O
days	O
'	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
long	O
Captain	O
Read	O
promised	O
to	O
stay	O
for	O
him	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
now	O
almost	O
finished	O
our	O
business	O
-RRB-	O
and	O
he	O
seemed	O
very	O
glad	O
of	O
the	O
opportunity	O
of	O
going	O
with	O
us	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
I	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
persuade	O
our	O
men	O
to	O
return	O
with	O
the	O
ship	O
to	O
the	O
river	O
of	O
Mindanao	PNM
and	O
offer	O
their	O
service	O
again	O
to	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
.	O

I	O
took	O
an	O
opportunity	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
filling	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
there	O
being	O
then	O
half	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O
ashore	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
found	O
all	O
these	O
very	O
willing	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
desired	O
them	O
to	O
say	O
nothing	O
till	O
I	O
had	O
tried	O
the	O
minds	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
half	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
intended	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
it	O
being	O
their	O
turn	O
to	O
fill	O
water	O
then	O
;	O
but	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
seemed	O
most	O
forward	O
to	O
invite	O
back	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
,	O
told	O
Captain	O
Read	O
and	O
Captain	O
Teat	O
of	O
the	O
project	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
presently	O
dissuaded	O
the	O
men	O
from	O
any	O
such	O
designs	O
.	O

Yet	O
fearing	O
the	O
worst	O
they	O
made	O
all	O
possible	O
haste	O
to	O
be	O
gone	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
since	O
been	O
informed	O
that	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
and	O
his	O
men	O
stayed	O
there	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
afterward	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
got	O
passages	O
from	O
thence	O
in	O
Dutch	O
sloops	O
to	O
Ternate	PNM
,	O
particularly	O
Mr.	O
Rofy	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Nelly	O
.	O

There	O
they	O
remained	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
got	O
to	O
Batavia	PNM
-LRB-	O
where	O
the	O
Dutch	O
took	O
their	O
journals	O
from	O
them	O
-RRB-	O
and	O
so	O
to	O
Europe	PNM
;	O
and	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
's	O
men	O
died	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM
;	O
of	O
which	O
number	O
Mr.	O
Harthrop	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Smith	O
,	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
's	O
merchants	O
,	O
were	O
two	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
and	O
his	O
surgeon	O
,	O
going	O
in	O
a	O
small	O
canoa	O
aboard	O
of	O
a	O
Dutch	O
ship	O
then	O
in	O
the	O
road	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
get	O
passage	O
to	O
Europe	PNM
,	O
were	O
overset	O
by	O
the	O
natives	O
at	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
;	O
who	O
waited	O
their	O
coming	O
purposely	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
unsuspected	O
by	O
them	O
;	O
where	O
they	O
both	O
were	O
killed	O
in	O
the	O
water	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
done	O
by	O
the	O
general	O
's	O
order	O
,	O
as	O
some	O
think	O
,	O
to	O
get	O
his	O
gold	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
did	O
immediately	O
seize	O
on	O
.	O

Others	O
say	O
it	O
was	O
because	O
the	O
general	O
's	O
house	O
was	O
burnt	O
a	O
little	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
was	O
suspected	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
author	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
others	O
say	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
's	O
threats	O
occasioned	O
his	O
own	O
ruin	O
;	O
for	O
he	O
would	O
often	O
say	O
passionately	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
abused	O
by	O
the	O
general	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
satisfaction	O
for	O
it	O
;	O
saying	O
also	O
that	O
now	O
he	O
was	O
well	O
acquainted	O
with	O
their	O
rivers	O
,	O
and	O
knew	O
how	O
to	O
come	O
in	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
also	O
knew	O
their	O
manner	O
of	O
fighting	O
and	O
the	O
weakness	O
of	O
their	O
country	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
he	O
would	O
go	O
away	O
and	O
get	O
a	O
band	O
of	O
men	O
to	O
assist	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
returning	O
thither	O
again	O
he	O
would	O
spoil	O
and	O
take	O
all	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
and	O
their	O
country	O
too	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
general	O
had	O
been	O
informed	O
of	O
these	O
discourses	O
he	O
would	O
say	O
:	O
``	O
What	O
,	O
is	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
made	O
of	O
iron	O
and	O
able	O
to	O
resist	O
a	O
whole	O

?	O

Or	O
does	O
he	O
think	O
that	O
we	O
are	O
afraid	O
of	O
him	O
that	O
he	O
speaks	O
thus	O

Yet	O
did	O
he	O
never	O
touch	O
him	O
till	O
now	O
the	O
Mindanayans	O
killed	O
him	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
very	O
probable	O
there	O
might	O
be	O
somewhat	O
of	O
truth	O
in	O
all	O
this	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
captain	O
was	O
passionate	O

and	O
the	O
general	O
greedy	O
of	O
gold	O

But	O
,	O
whatever	O
was	O
the	O
occasion	O

so	O
he	O
was	O
killed	O

as	O
several	O
have	O
assured	O
me	O

his	O
gold	O

That	O
very	O

that	O
the	O

to	O
us	O

we	O

directing	O

having	O
the	O

the	O

A	O

abundance	O
of	O

lying	O

We	O
saw	O
a	O
high	O

but	O
the	O
land	O
on	O

The	O

Indeed	O
all	O

against	O
us	O
at	O

sometimes	O

we	O
were	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
going	O
about	O
the	O

The	O
22nd	O
day	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
latitude	O
1	O

20	O

,	O
being	O
about	O
three	O

with	O
a	O

,	O
about	O
2	O
or	O
3	O
a	O
clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
we	O
heard	O
a	O
clashing	O
in	O
the	O
water	O
like	O
boats	O
rowing	O
:	O
and	O
fearing	O
some	O
sudden	O
attack	O
we	O
got	O
up	O
all	O
our	O
arms	O
and	O
stood	O
ready	O
to	O
defend	O
ourselves	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
day	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
great	O
proa	O
,	O
built	O
like	O
the	O
Mindanayan	O
proas	O
,	O
with	O
about	O
60	O
men	O
in	O
her	O
;	O
and	O
six	O

proas	O

They	O
lay	O
still	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
to	O
windward	O
of	O
us	O
to	O
view	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
probably	O
designed	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
prey	O
of	O
us	O
when	O
they	O
first	O
came	O
out	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
now	O
afraid	O
to	O
venture	O
on	O
us	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
we	O
showed	O
them	O
Dutch	O
colours	O
,	O
thinking	O
thereby	O
to	O
allure	O
them	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
us	O
:	O
for	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
go	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
presently	O
rowed	O
in	O
toward	O
the	O
island	O
and	O
went	O
into	O
a	O
large	O
opening	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
saw	O
them	O
no	O
more	O
;	O
nor	O
did	O
we	O
ever	O
see	O
any	O
other	O
boats	O
or	O
men	O
,	O
but	O
only	O
one	O
fishing	O
canoa	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
about	O
this	O
island	O
;	O
neither	O
did	O
we	O
see	O
any	O
house	O
on	O
all	O
the	O
coast	O

About	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
leagues	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
of	O
this	O
place	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
range	O
of	O
both	O
large	O
and	O
small	O
islands	O
;	O
and	O
many	O
shoals	O
also	O
that	O
are	O
not	O
laid	O
down	O
in	O
our	O
charts	O
;	O
which	O
made	O
it	O
extremely	O
troublesome	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
get	O
through	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
passed	O
between	O
them	O
all	O
and	O
the	O
island	O
Celebes	O
,	O
and	O
anchored	O
against	O
a	O
sandy	O
bay	O
in	O
eight	O

sandy	O
ground	O
,	O
about	O
half	O
a	O

being	O
then	O
in	O
latitude	O
1	O
degree	O
50	O
minutes	O
south	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
stayed	O
several	O
days	O
and	O
sent	O
out	O
our	O
Canoas	O
a-striking	O
of	O
turtle	O
every	O
day	O
;	O
for	O
here	O
is	O
great	O
plenty	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
shy	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
generally	O
wherever	O
we	O
found	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
East	PNM
India	PNM
seas	O

I	O
know	O
not	O
the	O
reason	O
of	O
it	O
unless	O
the	O
natives	O
go	O
very	O
much	O
a-striking	O
here	O
:	O
for	O
even	O
in	O
the	O
West	O
Indies	O
they	O
are	O
shy	O
in	O
places	O
that	O
are	O
much	O
disturbed	O
:	O
and	O
yet	O
on	O
New	PNM
Holland	PNM
we	O
found	O
them	O
shy	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
shall	O
relate	O
;	O
though	O
the	O
natives	O
there	O
do	O
not	O
molest	O
them	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
shoal	O
without	O
us	O
we	O
went	O
and	O
gathered	O
shellfish	O
at	O
low-water	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
a	O
monstrous	O
sort	O
of	O
cockles	O
;	O
the	O
meat	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
would	O
suffice	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
men	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
wholesome	O
meat	O
.	O

We	O
did	O
also	O
beat	O
about	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
but	O
found	O
no	O
game	O

One	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
always	O
troubled	O
with	O
sore	O

found	O
a	O
certain	O
vine	O
that	O
supported	O
itself	O
by	O

The	O
leaves	O

the	O

This	O

so	O
were	O

at	O
this	O

taking	O

they	O
were	O
one	O
whole	O

half	O
the	O
next	O
before	O
they	O
got	O
it	O
down	O

This	O
tree	O

though	O
it	O
grew	O
in	O
a	O

was	O

18	O

even	O
there	O
it	O

and	O
then	O
ran	O

10	O

;	O
there	O
it	O
spread	O
itself	O
into	O
many	O

branches	O
,	O
like	O
an	O
oak	O
,	O
very	O
green	O
and	O
flourishing	O
:	O
yet	O
it	O
was	O
perished	O
at	O
the	O
heart	O

which	O
marred	O
it	O
for	O
the	O
service	O
intended	O

So	O
leaving	O
it	O
and	O
having	O
no	O
more	O
business	O
here	O
we	O
weighed	O
and	O
went	O
from	O
hence	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
it	O
being	O
the	O
29th	O
day	O
of	O
November	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
lay	O
here	O
we	O
had	O
some	O
tornadoes	O
,	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
every	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
pretty	O
fresh	O
land-winds	O
which	O
were	O
at	O
west	O
.	O

The	O
sea-breezes	O
are	O
small	O
and	O
uncertain	O
,	O
sometimes	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
north-east	O
and	O
so	O
veering	O
about	O
to	O
the	O
east	O
and	O
south-east	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
north-east	O
when	O
we	O
weighed	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
steered	O
off	O
south-south-west	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
shoal	O
ahead	O
of	O
us	O
and	O
altered	O
our	O
course	O
to	O
the	O
south-south-east	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
at	O
4	O
a	O
clock	O
we	O
were	O
close	O
by	O
another	O
great	O
shoal	O
;	O
therefore	O
we	O
tacked	O
and	O
stood	O
in	O
for	O
the	O
island	O
Celebes	O
again	O
,	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
running	O
on	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
shoals	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
.	O

By	O
day	O
a	O
man	O
might	O
avoid	O
them	O
well	O
enough	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
all	O
beacons	O
on	O
them	O
like	O
huts	O
built	O
on	O
tall	O
posts	O
,	O
above	O
high-water	O
mark	O
,	O
probably	O
set	O
up	O
by	O
the	O
natives	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
Celebes	O
or	O
those	O
of	O
some	O
other	O
neighbouring	O
islands	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
never	O
saw	O
any	O
such	O
elsewhere	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
night	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
violent	O
tornado	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
south-west	O
which	O
lasted	O
about	O
an	O
hour	O
.	O

The	O
30th	O
day	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
fresh	O
land-wind	O
and	O
steered	O
away	O
south	O
,	O
passing	O
between	O
the	O
two	O
shoals	O
which	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
.	O

These	O
shoals	O
lie	O
in	O
latitude	O
3	O
degrees	O
south	O
and	O
about	O
ten	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
island	O
Celebes	PNM
.	O

Being	O
past	O
them	O
the	O
wind	O
died	O
away	O
and	O
we	O
lay	O
becalmed	O
till	O
the	O
afternoon	O
:	O
then	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
hard	O
tornado	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
south-west	O
,	O
and	O
towards	O
the	O
evening	O
we	O
saw	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
spouts	O
,	O
the	O
first	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
since	O
I	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
;	O
in	O
the	O
West	O
Indies	O
I	O
had	O
often	O
met	O
with	O
them	O

A	O
spout	O
is	O
a	O
small	O
ragged	O
piece	O
or	O
part	O
of	O
a	O
cloud	O
hanging	O
down	O
about	O
a	O
yard	O
,	O
seemingly	O
from	O
the	O
blackest	O
part	O
thereof	O
.	O

Commonly	O
it	O
hangs	O
down	O
sloping	O
from	O
thence	O
,	O
or	O
sometimes	O
appearing	O
with	O
a	O
small	O
bending	O
,	O
or	O
elbow	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
.	O

I	O
never	O
saw	O
any	O
hang	O
perpendicularly	O
down	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
small	O
at	O
the	O
lower	O
end	O
,	O
seeming	O
no	O
bigger	O
than	O
one	O
's	O
arm	O
,	O
but	O
still	O
fuller	O
towards	O
the	O
cloud	O
from	O
whence	O
it	O
proceeds	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
surface	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
begins	O
to	O
work	O
you	O
shall	O
see	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
for	O
about	O
100	O
paces	O
in	O
circumference	O
,	O
foam	O
and	O
move	O
gently	O
round	O
till	O
the	O
whirling	O
motion	O
increases	O
:	O
and	O
then	O
it	O
flies	O
upward	O
in	O
a	O
pillar	O
,	O
about	O
100	O
paces	O
in	O
compass	O
at	O
the	O
bottom	O
,	O
but	O
lessening	O
gradually	O
upwards	O
to	O
the	O
smallness	O
of	O
the	O
spout	O
itself	O
,	O
there	O
where	O
it	O
reaches	O
the	O
lower	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
spout	O
,	O
through	O
which	O
the	O
rising	O
seawater	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
conveyed	O
into	O
the	O
clouds	O
.	O

This	O
visibly	O
appears	O
by	O
the	O
clouds	O
increasing	O
in	O
bulk	O
and	O
blackness	O
.	O

Then	O
you	O
shall	O
presently	O
see	O
the	O
cloud	O
drive	O
along	O
,	O
although	O
before	O
it	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
without	O
any	O
motion	O
:	O
the	O
spout	O
also	O
keeping	O
the	O
same	O
course	O
with	O
the	O
cloud	O
,	O
and	O
still	O
sucking	O
up	O
the	O
water	O
as	O
it	O
goes	O
along	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
make	O
a	O
wind	O
as	O
they	O
go	O
.	O

Thus	O
it	O
continues	O
for	O
the	O
space	O
of	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
,	O
until	O
the	O

and	O
then	O
,	O
breaking	O
off	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
water	O
which	O
was	O
below	O
the	O
spout	O
,	O
or	O
pendulous	O
piece	O
of	O
cloud	O
,	O
falls	O
down	O
again	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
making	O
a	O
great	O
noise	O
with	O
its	O
fall	O
and	O
clashing	O
motion	O
in	O
the	O
sea	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
very	O
dangerous	O
for	O
a	O
ship	O
to	O
be	O
under	O
a	O
spout	O
when	O
it	O
breaks	O
,	O
therefore	O
we	O
always	O
endeavour	O
to	O
shun	O
it	O
by	O
keeping	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
if	O
possibly	O
we	O
can	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
wind	O
to	O
carry	O
us	O
away	O
,	O
we	O
are	O
often	O
in	O
great	O
fear	O
and	O
danger	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
is	O
usually	O
calm	O
when	O
spouts	O
are	O
at	O
work	O
;	O
except	O
only	O
just	O
where	O
they	O
are	O
.	O

Therefore	O
men	O
at	O
sea	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
see	O
a	O
spout	O
coming	O
and	O
know	O
not	O
how	O
to	O
avoid	O
it	O
,	O
do	O
sometimes	O
fire	O
shot	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
great	O
guns	O
into	O
it	O
,	O
to	O
give	O
it	O
air	O
or	O
vent	O
,	O
that	O
so	O
it	O
may	O
break	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
did	O
never	O
hear	O
that	O
it	O
proved	O
to	O
be	O
of	O
any	O
benefit	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
being	O
on	O
this	O
subject	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
not	O
amiss	O
to	O
give	O
you	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
an	O
accident	O
that	O
happened	O
to	O
a	O
ship	O
once	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Guinea	PNM
,	O
some	O
time	O
in	O
or	O
about	O
the	O
year	O
1674	O

One	O
Captain	O
Records	O
of	O
London	PNM
,	O
bound	O
for	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Guinea	PNM
,	O
in	O
a	O
ship	O
of	O
300	O
tuns	O
and	O
16	O
guns	O
called	O
the	O
Blessing	O
:	O
when	O
he	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
latitude	O
7	O
or	O
8	O
degrees	O
north	O
he	O
saw	O
several	O
spouts	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
which	O
came	O
directly	O
towards	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
,	O
having	O
no	O
wind	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
the	O
spout	O
,	O
made	O
ready	O
to	O
receive	O
it	O
by	O
furling	O
his	O
sails	O
.	O

It	O
came	O
on	O
very	O
swift	O
and	O
broke	O
a	O
little	O
before	O
it	O
reached	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
making	O
a	O
great	O
noise	O
and	O
raising	O
the	O
sea	O
round	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
a	O
great	O
house	O
or	O
some	O
such	O
thing	O
had	O
been	O
cast	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
.	O

The	O
fury	O
of	O
the	O
wind	O
still	O
lasted	O
and	O
took	O
the	O
ship	O
on	O
the	O
starboard	O
bow	O
with	O
such	O
violence	O
that	O
it	O
snapped	O
off	O
the	O
boltsprit	O
and	O
foremast	O
both	O
at	O
once	O
,	O
and	O
blew	O
which	O
ship	O
all	O
along	O
,	O
ready	O
to	O
overset	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
ship	O
did	O
presently	O
right	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
wind	O
whirling	O
round	O
took	O
the	O
ship	O
a	O
second	O
time	O
with	O
the	O
like	O
fury	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
but	O
on	O
the	O
contrary	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
again	O
like	O
to	O
overset	O
her	O
the	O
other	O
way	O
.	O

The	O
mizzen-mast	O
felt	O
the	O
fury	O
of	O
this	O
second	O
blast	O
and	O
was	O
snapped	O
short	O
off	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
foremast	O
and	O
boltsprit	O
had	O
been	O
before	O
.	O

The	O
mainmast	O
and	O
main-top-mast	O
received	O
no	O
damage	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
fury	O
of	O
the	O
wind	O
-LRB-	O
which	O
was	O
presently	O
over	O
-RRB-	O
did	O
not	O

Three	O
men	O
were	O
in	O
the	O

when	O
the	O

broke	O

one	O
on	O
the	O

fell	O
with	O
them	O
into	O
the	O

all	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
saved	O

I	O
had	O
this	O

Mr.	O
John	O

We	O
are	O
usually	O
very	O
much	O
afraid	O
of	O
them	O
:	O
yet	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
damage	O
that	O
ever	O
I	O
heard	O
done	O
by	O
them	O
.	O

They	O
seem	O
terrible	O
enough	O
,	O
the	O
rather	O
because	O
they	O
come	O
upon	O
you	O
while	O
you	O
lie	O
becalmed	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
log	O
in	O
the	O

and	O
can	O
not	O

out	O

though	O
I	O
have	O
seen	O
and	O
been	O
beset	O
by	O
them	O
often	O

yet	O
the	O
fright	O
was	O
always	O
the	O
greatest	O
of	O
the	O
harm	O

December	O
the	O
1st	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
gentle	O
gale	O
at	O
east-south-east	O

We	O
steered	O
south	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
noon	O
I	O
was	O
by	O
observation	O
in	O
latitude	O
3	O

Then	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
island	O
Bouton	PNM
,	O
bearing	O
south-west	O
and	O
about	O
ten	O
leagues	O

We	O
had	O
very	O
uncertain	O
and	O
inconstant	O
winds	O
:	O
the	O
tornadoes	O
came	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
south-west	O

which	O
was	O
against	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
what	O

we	O
had	O
were	O
so	O
faint	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
us	O
little	O
kindness	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
took	O
the	O
advantage	O
of	O
the	O
smallest	O
gale	O
and	O
got	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
every	O
day	O

The	O

The	O
5th	O
day	O
we	O
got	O
close	O
by	O
the	O
north-west	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
Bouton	PNM
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
it	O
being	O
fair	O
weather	O
,	O
we	O
hoisted	O
out	O
our	O
canoa	O
and	O
sent	O
the	O
Moskito	O
men	O
,	O
of	O
whom	O
we	O
had	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
,	O
to	O
strike	O
turtle	O
,	O
for	O
here	O
are	O
plenty	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
being	O
shy	O
we	O
chose	O
to	O
strike	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
-LRB-	O
which	O
is	O
customary	O
in	O
the	O
West	O
Indies	O
also	O
-RRB-	O
for	O
every	O
time	O
they	O
come	O
up	O
to	O
breathe	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
once	O
in	O
8	O
or	O
10	O
minutes	O
,	O
they	O
blow	O
so	O
hard	O
that	O
one	O
may	O
hear	O
them	O
at	O
30	O
or	O
40	O
yards	O
distance	O
;	O
by	O
which	O
means	O
the	O
striker	O
knows	O
where	O
they	O
are	O
,	O
and	O
may	O
more	O
easily	O
approach	O
them	O
than	O
in	O
the	O
day	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
turtle	O
sees	O
better	O
than	O
he	O
hears	O
;	O
but	O
on	O
the	O
contrary	O
the	O
manatee	O
's	O
hearing	O
is	O
quickest	O

In	O
the	O
morning	O
they	O
returned	O
with	O
a	O
very	O
large	O
turtle	O
which	O
they	O
took	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
and	O
withal	O
an	O
Indian	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
came	O
aboard	O
with	O
them	O

He	O
spoke	O
the	O
Malayan	O
language	O
;	O
by	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
understand	O
him	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
two	O
leagues	O
farther	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
of	O
us	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
harbour	O
in	O
which	O
we	O
might	O
anchor	O
:	O
so	O
,	O
having	O
a	O
fair	O
wind	O
,	O
we	O
got	O
thither	O
by	O
noon	O

This	O
harbour	O
is	O
in	O
latitude	O

lying	O
on	O

Which	O
island	O
lies	O

island	O
Celebes	O
,	O
distant	O
from	O
it	O
about	O
three	O

four	O

It	O
is	O
of	O
a	O
long	O
form	O

stretching	O
south-west	O
and	O
north-east	O
above	O
25	O

It	O

and	O
appears	O
pretty	O
even	O
and	O
flat	O
and	O
very	O

There	O
is	O
a	O
large	O
town	O
within	O
a	O
league	O
of	O
the	O
anchoring-place	O
called	O
Callasusung	PNM

the	O
chief	O
,	O
if	O

It	O
is	O
about	O
a	O

there	O
is	O
a	O
strong	O

clear	O
round	O
the	O
town	O

The	O
houses	O
are	O
built	O
like	O
the	O
houses	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM
;	O
but	O
more	O
neat	O
:	O
and	O
the	O
whole	O
town	O
was	O
very	O
clean	O
and	O
delightsome	O
.	O

The	O
inhabitants	O
are	O
small	O
and	O
well	O
shaped	O

They	O
are	O
much	O
like	O
the	O
Mindanayans	O
in	O
shape	O
,	O
colour	O
,	O
and	O
habit	O
;	O
but	O
more	O
neat	O
and	O
tight	O
.	O

They	O
speak	O
the	O
Malayan	O
language	O
and	O
are	O
all	O
Mohammedans	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
very	O
obedient	O
to	O
the	O
sultan	O
,	O
who	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
man	O
about	O
forty	O
or	O
fifty	O
years	O
old	O
,	O
and	O
has	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
wives	O
and	O
children	O
.	O

About	O
an	O
hour	O
after	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
the	O
sultan	O
sent	O
a	O
messenger	O
aboard	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
and	O
what	O
our	O
business	O
.	O

We	O
gave	O
him	O
an	O
account	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
returned	O
ashore	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
after	O
he	O
came	O
aboard	O
again	O
and	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
the	O
sultan	O
was	O
very	O
well	O
pleased	O
when	O
he	O
heard	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
English	O
;	O
and	O
said	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
anything	O
that	O
the	O
island	O
afforded	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
himself	O
would	O
come	O
aboard	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
.	O

Therefore	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
made	O
clean	O
,	O
and	O
everything	O
put	O
in	O
the	O
best	O
order	O
to	O
receive	O
him	O

About	O

him	O

him	O
into	O
his	O

fired	O
five	O

As	O
soon	O

he	O
came	O

he	O
gave	O
leave	O
to	O
his	O

to	O

The	O
sultan	O
seemed	O
very	O
well	O
pleased	O
to	O
be	O
visited	O
by	O
the	O
English	O
;	O
and	O
said	O
he	O
had	O
coveted	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
sight	O
of	O
Englishmen	O

having	O
heard	O
extraordinary	O
characters	O
of	O
their	O
just	O
and	O
honourable	O
dealing	O
:	O
but	O
he	O
exclaimed	O
against	O
the	O
Dutch	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
all	O
the	O
Mindanayans	O
and	O
all	O
the	O

For	O
Macassar	O

one	O
of	O

From	O
thence	O
the	O
Dutch	O
come	O

The	O
slaves	O
that	O
these	O

here	O

to	O
the	O

are	O

not	O

themselves	O

his	O

who	O
hunt	O

For	O

After	O
two	O

three	O
hours	O

discourse	O
the	O

went	O
ashore	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
five	O

at	O
his	O

The	O
next	O

he	O

to	O
come	O
ashore	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
with	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
men	O
went	O
to	O
wait	O
on	O
the	O
sultan	O
.	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
slip	O
an	O
opportunity	O
of	O
seeing	O
the	O
place	O
and	O
so	O
accompanied	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
met	O
at	O
the	O
landing-place	O
by	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
chief	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
guided	O
to	O
a	O
pretty	O
neat	O
house	O
where	O
the	O
sultan	O
waited	O
our	O
coming	O
.	O

The	O
house	O
stood	O
at	O
the	O
further	O
end	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
town	O
before	O
mentioned	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
passed	O
through	O
;	O
and	O
abundance	O
of	O
people	O
were	O
gazing	O
on	O
us	O
as	O
we	O
passed	O
by	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
near	O
the	O
house	O
there	O
were	O
forty	O
poor	O
naked	O
soldiers	O
with	O
muskets	O
made	O
a	O
lane	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
pass	O
through	O
.	O

This	O
house	O
was	O
not	O
built	O
on	O
posts	O
as	O
the	O
rest	O
were	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
Mindanayan	O
way	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
room	O
in	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
entertained	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
covered	O
with	O
mats	O
to	O
sit	O
on	O
.	O

Our	O
entertainment	O
was	O
tobacco	O
and	O
betel-nut	O
and	O
young	O
coconuts	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
house	O
was	O
beset	O
with	O
men	O
and	O
women	O
and	O
children	O
,	O
who	O
thronged	O
to	O
get	O
near	O
the	O
windows	O
to	O
look	O
on	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
did	O
not	O
tarry	O
above	O
an	O
hour	O
before	O
we	O
took	O
our	O
leaves	O
and	O
departed	O
.	O

This	O
town	O
stands	O
in	O
a	O
sandy	O
soil	O
;	O
but	O
what	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
is	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
,	O
for	O
none	O
of	O
us	O
were	O
ashore	O
but	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
the	O
sultan	O
came	O
aboard	O
again	O
and	O
presented	O
Captain	O
Read	O
with	O
a	O
little	O
boy	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
too	O
small	O
to	O
be	O
serviceable	O
on	O
board	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
Captain	O
Read	O
returned	O
thanks	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
he	O
was	O
too	O
little	O
for	O
him	O
.	O

Then	O
the	O
sultan	O
sent	O
for	O
a	O
bigger	O
boy	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
captain	O
accepted	O
.	O

This	O
boy	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
pretty	O
tractable	O
boy	O
;	O
but	O
what	O
was	O
wonderful	O
in	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
two	O
rows	O
of	O
teeth	O
,	O
one	O
within	O
another	O
on	O
each	O
jaw	O
.	O

None	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
people	O
were	O
so	O
,	O
nor	O
did	O
I	O
ever	O
see	O
the	O
like	O
.	O

The	O
captain	O
was	O
presented	O
also	O
with	O
two	O
he-goats	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
promised	O
some	O
buffalo	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
but	O
few	O
of	O
either	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

We	O
did	O
not	O
see	O
any	O
buffalo	O
nor	O
many	O
goats	O
,	O
neither	O
have	O
they	O
much	O
rice	O
,	O
but	O
their	O
chiefest	O
food	O
is	O
roots	O
.	O

We	O
bought	O
here	O
about	O
a	O
thousand	O
pound	O
weight	O
of	O
potatoes	O
.	O

Here	O
our	O
men	O
bought	O
also	O
abundance	O
of	O
cockatoos	O
and	O
fine	O
large	O
parakeets	O
,	O
curiously	O
coloured	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
the	O
finest	O
I	O
ever	O
saw	O
.	O

The	O
cockatoo	O
is	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
a	O
parrot	O
and	O
shaped	O
much	O
like	O
it	O
with	O
such	O
a	O
bill	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
as	O
white	O
as	O
milk	O
,	O
and	O
has	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
feathers	O
on	O
his	O
head	O
like	O
a	O
crown	O
.	O

At	O
this	O
place	O
we	O
bought	O
a	O
proa	O
also	O
of	O
the	O
Mindanayan	O
make	O
,	O
for	O
our	O
own	O
use	O
,	O
which	O
our	O
carpenters	O
afterwards	O
altered	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
delicate	O
boat	O
fit	O
for	O
any	O
service	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
sharp	O
at	O
both	O
ends	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
sawed	O
off	O
one	O
and	O
made	O
that	O
end	O
flat	O
,	O
fastening	O
a	O
rudder	O
to	O
it	O
and	O
she	O
rowed	O
and	O
sailed	O
incomparably	O
.	O

We	O
stayed	O
here	O
but	O
till	O
the	O
12th	O
day	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
bad	O
harbour	O
and	O
foul	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
bad	O
time	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
too	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
tornadoes	O
began	O
to	O
come	O
in	O
thick	O
and	O
strong	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
went	O
to	O
weigh	O
our	O
anchor	O
it	O
was	O
hooked	O
in	O
a	O
rock	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
broke	O
our	O
cable	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
our	O
anchor	O
though	O
we	O
strove	O
hard	O
for	O
it	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
went	O
away	O
and	O
left	O
it	O
there	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
north-north-east	O
and	O
we	O
steered	O
towards	O
the	O
south-east	O
and	O
fell	O
in	O
with	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
small	O
islands	O
that	O
lie	O
in	O
5	O
degrees	O
40	O
minutes	O
south	O
latitude	O
and	O
about	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
leagues	O
from	O
Callasusung	PNM
harbour	O
.	O

These	O
islands	O
appeared	O
very	O
green	O
with	O
coconut-trees	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
saw	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
towns	O
on	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
heard	O
a	O
drum	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
got	O
in	O
among	O
shoals	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
out	O
again	O
till	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
.	O

We	O
knew	O
not	O
whether	O
the	O
drum	O
were	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
us	O
or	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
making	O
merry	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
usual	O
in	O
these	O
parts	O
to	O
do	O
all	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
singing	O
and	O
dancing	O
till	O
morning	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
a	O
pretty	O
strong	O
tide	O
here	O
,	O
the	O
flood	O
setting	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
and	O
the	O
ebb	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
.	O

These	O
shoals	O
and	O
many	O
other	O
that	O
are	O
not	O
laid	O
down	O
in	O
our	O
charts	O
lie	O
on	O
the	O
south-west	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
islands	O
where	O
we	O
heard	O
the	O
drum	O
,	O
about	O
a	O
league	O
from	O
them	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
we	O
passed	O
between	O
the	O
islands	O
and	O
tried	O
for	O
a	O
passage	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
.	O

We	O
met	O
with	O
divers	O
shoals	O
on	O
this	O
side	O
also	O
,	O
but	O
found	O
channels	O
to	O
pass	O
through	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
steered	O
away	O
for	O
the	O
island	O
Timor	PNM
,	O
intending	O
to	O
pass	O
out	O
by	O
it	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
the	O
winds	O
commonly	O
at	O
west-south-west	O
and	O
south-west	O
hard	O
gales	O
and	O
rainy	O
weather	O
.	O

The	O
16th	O
day	O
we	O
got	O
clear	O
of	O
the	O
shoals	O
and	O
steered	O
south	O
by	O
east	O
with	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
west-south-west	O
but	O
veering	O
every	O
half	O
hour	O
,	O
sometimes	O
at	O
south-west	O
and	O
then	O
again	O
at	O
west	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
at	O
north-north-west	O
,	O
bringing	O
much	O
rain	O
with	O
thunder	O
and	O
lightning	O
.	O

The	O
20th	O
day	O
we	O
passed	O
by	O
the	O
island	O
Omba	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
pretty	O
high	O
island	O
lying	O
in	O
latitude	O
8	O
degrees	O
20	O
minutes	O
and	O
not	O
above	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
north-east	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
Timor	PNM

It	O
is	O
about	O
13	O
or	O
14	O
leagues	O
long	O
and	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
leagues	O
wide	O

About	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
leagues	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
of	O
Omba	PNM
is	O
another	O
pretty	O
large	O
island	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
had	O
no	O
name	O
in	O
our	O
charts	O
;	O
yet	O
by	O
the	O
situation	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
that	O
which	O
in	O
some	O
maps	O
is	O
called	O
Pentare	PNM
.	O

We	O
saw	O
on	O
it	O
abundance	O
of	O
smokes	O
by	O
day	O
and	O
fires	O
by	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
large	O
town	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
not	O
far	O
from	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
such	O
bad	O
weather	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
go	O
ashore	O
.	O

Between	O
Omba	O
and	O
Pentare	PNM
and	O
in	O
the	O
mid-channel	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
small	O
low	O
sandy	O
island	O
with	O
great	O
shoals	O
on	O
either	O
side	O
;	O
but	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
channel	O
close	O
by	O
Pentare	O
,	O
between	O
that	O
and	O
the	O
shoals	O
about	O
the	O
small	O
isle	O

We	O
were	O
three	O
days	O
beating	O
off	O
and	O
on	O
,	O
not	O
having	O
a	O
wind	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
at	O
south-south-west	O

The	O
23rd	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
having	O
a	O
small	O
gale	O
at	O
north	O
,	O
we	O
got	O
through	O
,	O
keeping	O
close	O
by	O
Pentare	O

The	O
tide	O
of	O
ebb	O
here	O
set	O
out	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
helped	O
through	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
but	O
little	O
wind	O
.	O

But	O
this	O
tide	O
,	O
which	O
did	O
us	O
a	O
kindness	O
in	O
setting	O
us	O
through	O
,	O
had	O
like	O
to	O
have	O
ruined	O
us	O
afterwards	O
;	O
for	O
there	O
are	O
two	O
small	O
islands	O
lying	O
at	O
the	O
south	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
channel	O
we	O
came	O
through	O
,	O
and	O
towards	O
these	O
islands	O
the	O
tide	O
hurried	O
us	O
so	O
swiftly	O
that	O
we	O
very	O
narrowly	O
escaped	O
being	O
driven	O
ashore	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
the	O
little	O
wind	O
we	O
had	O
before	O
at	O
north	O
dying	O
away	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
one	O
breath	O

wind	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
there	O
,	O
neither	O
was	O
there	O
any	O

But	O
we	O
got	O
out	O
our	O
oars	O
and	O
rowed	O
,	O
yet	O
all	O
in	O
vain	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
tide	O
set	O
wholly	O
on	O
one	O
of	O
these	O

which	O
was	O
a	O

by	O

,	O
having	O
a	O

in	O
the	O

we	O

In	O
the	O

again	O
we	O
had	O
the	O

and	O
the	O

The	O
29th	O
day	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
north-west	O
point	O
of	O
Timor	PNM
south-east	O
by	O
east	O
distant	O
about	O
eight	O

Timor	PNM
is	O
a	O

It	O
is	O

I	O
have	O

The	O
27th	O
day	O
we	O
saw	O
two	O
small	O
islands	O
which	O
lie	O
near	O
the	O
south-west	O
end	O
of	O
Timor	PNM
.	O

They	O
bear	O
from	O
us	O
south-east	O

We	O
had	O
very	O
hard	O
gales	O
of	O
wind	O
and	O
still	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
rain	O

the	O

and	O
west-south-west	O

Being	O
now	O
clear	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
islands	O
we	O
stood	O
off	O

intending	O

at	O
New	PNM
Holland	PNM

a	O

Indeed	O
as	O
the	O
winds	O
were	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
now	O
keep	O
our	O

-LRB-	O
which	O
was	O
first	O
westerly	O

New	PNM

unless	O
we	O
had	O
gone	O

this	O
was	O
not	O

The	O
31st	O
day	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
latitude	O
13	O
degrees	O
20	O
minutes	O
,	O
still	O
standing	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O

the	O

bearing	O
commonly	O
very	O

we	O
keeping	O

it	O
under	O
two	O

and	O
our	O

and	O
sometimes	O
a	O
main-topsail	O
reefed	O

About	O
10	O
a	O
clock	O
at	O
night	O
we	O
tacked	O
and	O
stood	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
running	O
on	O
a	O
shoal	O
which	O
is	O
laid	O
down	O
in	O
our	O

it	O
bearing	O
south	O
by	O
W.	O
from	O
the	O
east	O
end	O
of	O
Timor	PNM
;	O
and	O
so	O
the	O
island	O
bore	O
from	O
us	O
by	O
our	O
judgments	O
and	O
reckoning	O
.	O

At	O
3	O
a	O
clock	O
we	O
tacked	O
again	O
and	O
stood	O
south	O
by	O
W.	O
and	O
south-south-west	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
morning	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
day	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
shoal	O
right	O
ahead	O
:	O
it	O
lies	O
in	O
13	O
degrees	O
50	O
minutes	O
by	O
all	O
our	O
reckonings	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
small	O
spit	O
of	O
sand	O
,	O
just	O
appearing	O
above	O
the	O
water	O
's	O
edge	O
,	O
with	O
several	O
rocks	O
about	O
it	O
,	O
eight	O
or	O
ten	O
foot	O
high	O
above	O
water	O
.	O

It	O
lies	O
in	O
a	O
triangular	O
form	O
;	O
each	O
side	O
being	O
about	O
a	O
league	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
.	O

We	O
stemmed	O
right	O
with	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
within	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
of	O
the	O
rocks	O
and	O
sounded	O
;	O
but	O
found	O
no	O
ground	O
.	O

Then	O
we	O
went	O
about	O
and	O
stood	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
two	O
hours	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
tacked	O
and	O
stood	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
again	O
,	O
thinking	O
to	O
weather	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
not	O
.	O

So	O
we	O
bore	O
away	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
east	O
point	O
,	O
giving	O
the	O
rocks	O
a	O
small	O
berth	O
:	O
then	O
we	O
trimmed	O
sharp	O
and	O
stood	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
,	O
passing	O
close	O
by	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
sounded	O
again	O
but	O
found	O
no	O
ground	O
.	O

This	O
shoal	O
is	O
laid	O
down	O
in	O
our	O
charts	O
not	O
above	O
16	O
or	O
20	O
leagues	O
from	O
New	PNM
Holland	PNM
;	O
but	O
we	O
did	O
run	O
afterwards	O
60	O
leagues	O
due	O
south	O
before	O
we	O
fell	O
in	O
with	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
very	O
confident	O
that	O
no	O
part	O
of	O
New	PNM
Holland	PNM
hereabouts	O
lies	O
so	O
far	O
northerly	O
by	O
40	O
leagues	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
laid	O
down	O
in	O
our	O
charts	O
.	O

For	O
if	O
New	PNM
Holland	PNM
were	O
laid	O
down	O
true	O
we	O
must	O
of	O
necessity	O
have	O
been	O
driven	O
near	O
40	O
leagues	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
of	O
our	O
course	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
is	O
very	O
improbable	O
that	O
the	O
current	O
should	O
set	O
so	O
strong	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
,	O
seeing	O
we	O
had	O
such	O
a	O
constant	O
westerly	O
wind	O
.	O

I	O
grant	O
that	O
when	O
the	O
monsoon	O
shifts	O
first	O
the	O
current	O
does	O
not	O
presently	O
shift	O
,	O
but	O
runs	O
afterwards	O
near	O
a	O
month	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
monsoon	O
had	O
been	O
shifted	O
at	O
least	O
two	O
months	O
now	O
.	O

But	O
of	O
the	O
monsoons	O
and	O
other	O
winds	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
currents	O
elsewhere	O
in	O
their	O
proper	O
place	O
.	O

As	O
to	O
these	O
here	O
I	O
do	O
rather	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O
land	O
is	O
not	O
laid	O
down	O
true	O
,	O
than	O
that	O
the	O
current	O
deceived	O
us	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
more	O
probable	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
deceived	O
before	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
a	O
shoal	O
than	O
afterwards	O
;	O
for	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
New	PNM
Holland	PNM
we	O
found	O
the	O
tides	O
keeping	O
their	O
constant	O
course	O
;	O
the	O
flood	O
running	O
north	O

1688	O
The	O
4th	O
day	O
of	O
January	O
1688	O
we	O
fell	O
in	O
with	O
the	O

of	O
New	PNM
Holland	PNM
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
16	O
degrees	O
50	O
minutes	O
,	O
having	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
before	O
,	O
made	O
our	O
course	O
due	O
south	O
from	O
the	O
shoal	O
that	O
we	O
passed	O
by	O
the	O
31st	O
day	O
of	O
December	O
.	O

We	O
ran	O
in	O
close	O
by	O
it	O
and	O
,	O
finding	O
no	O
convenient	O
anchoring	O
because	O
it	O
lies	O
open	O
to	O
the	O
north-west	O

we	O
ran	O
along	O

eastward	O

steering	O
north-east	O
by	O
east	O
for	O
so	O
the	O

lies	O

We	O
steered	O
thus	O
about	O
12	O
leagues	O

and	O
then	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
point	O
of	O

New	PNM
Holland	PNM
is	O
a	O
very	O
large	O
tract	O
of	O
land	O

It	O
is	O
not	O
yet	O
determined	O
whether	O
it	O
is	O
an	O
island	O
or	O
a	O
main	O

but	O
I	O
am	O

that	O
it	O

neither	O

This	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
that	O
we	O
saw	O
is	O
all	O
low	O

with	O
sandy	O
banks	O
against	O
the	O

,	O
only	O
the	O

and	O
so	O
are	O
some	O
of	O
the	O

in	O
this	O

The	O
land	O
is	O
of	O
a	O
dry	O
sandy	O
soil	O

destitute	O
of	O

except	O
you	O
make	O
wells	O
;	O
yet	O
producing	O
divers	O

but	O
the	O
woods	O
are	O
not	O
thick	O
,	O
nor	O
the	O
trees	O
very	O
big	O

Most	O
of	O
the	O
trees	O
that	O
we	O
saw	O
are	O
dragon-trees	O
as	O
we	O
supposed	O
;	O
and	O
these	O
too	O
are	O
the	O
largest	O
trees	O
of	O
any	O
there	O

They	O
are	O
about	O
the	O
bigness	O
of	O
our	O
large	O
apple-trees	O

and	O
about	O
the	O

and	O
the	O
rind	O

blackish	O

The	O

that	O
are	O

We	O
compared	O
it	O
with	O
some	O
gum-dragon	O
or	O
dragon	O
's	O
blood	O
that	O
was	O
aboard	O
,	O

it	O
was	O

The	O

sort	O
of	O
trees	O
were	O
not	O

There	O
was	O
pretty	O
long	O
grass	O
growing	O
under	O
the	O
trees	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
thin	O

We	O
saw	O
no	O
trees	O
that	O
bore	O
fruit	O
or	O

We	O
saw	O
no	O
sort	O
of	O

any	O
track	O
of	O

but	O
once	O
;	O

Here	O
are	O
a	O

none	O
bigger	O

I	O
did	O

These	O

if	O
they	O

any	O
that	O

They	O
did	O
at	O
first	O
endeavour	O
with	O
their	O
weapons	O
to	O
frighten	O
us	O
,	O
who	O
lying	O
ashore	O
deterred	O
them	O
from	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
fishing-places	O
.	O

Some	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
wooden	O
swords	O
,	O
others	O
had	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
lances	O

The	O
sword	O
is	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
wood	O
shaped	O
somewhat	O
like	O
a	O
cutlass	O

The	O
lance	O
is	O
a	O
long	O
straight	O
pole	O
sharp	O
at	O
one	O
end	O
,	O
and	O
hardened	O
afterwards	O
by	O

I	O
saw	O
no	O
iron	O
nor	O
any	O
other	O
sort	O
of	O
metal	O
;	O
therefore	O
it	O
is	O
probable	O
they	O
use	O
stone-hatchets	O
,	O
as	O
some	O
Indians	O
in	O
America	PNM
do	O
,	O
described	O
in	O
Chapter	O

How	O
they	O
get	O
their	O
fire	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
;	O
but	O
probably	O
as	O
Indians	O
do	O
,	O
out	O
of	O

.	O

I	O
have	O
seen	O
the	O
Indians	O
of	O
Bon-Airy	O
do	O
it	O
and	O
have	O
myself	O
tried	O
the	O
experiment	O
:	O
they	O
take	O
a	O
flat	O
piece	O
of	O
wood	O
that	O
is	O
pretty	O
soft	O
and	O
make	O
a	O
small	O
dent	O
in	O
one	O
side	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
then	O
they	O
take	O
another	O
hard	O
round	O
stick	O
about	O
the	O
bigness	O
of	O
one	O
's	O
little	O
finger	O
and	O
,	O
sharpening	O
it	O
at	O
one	O
end	O
like	O
a	O
pencil	O
,	O
they	O
put	O
that	O
sharp	O
end	O
in	O
the	O
hole	O
or	O
dent	O
of	O
the	O
flat	O
soft	O
piece	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
rubbing	O
or	O
twirling	O
the	O
hard	O
piece	O
between	O
the	O
palms	O
of	O
their	O
hands	O
they	O
drill	O
the	O
soft	O
piece	O
till	O
it	O
smokes	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
takes	O
fire	O
.	O

These	O
people	O
speak	O
somewhat	O
through	O
the	O
throat	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
understand	O
one	O
word	O
that	O
they	O
said	O
.	O

We	O
anchored	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
before	O
,	O
January	O
the	O
5th	O
and	O
,	O
seeing	O
men	O
walking	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
we	O
presently	O
sent	O
a	O
canoa	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
acquaintance	O
with	O
them	O
:	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
hopes	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
provision	O
among	O
them	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
seeing	O
our	O
boat	O
coming	O
,	O
ran	O
away	O
and	O
hid	O
themselves	O
.	O

We	O
searched	O
afterwards	O
three	O
days	O
in	O
hopes	O
to	O
find	O
their	O
houses	O
;	O
but	O
found	O
none	O
:	O
yet	O
we	O
saw	O
many	O
places	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
made	O
fires	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
,	O
being	O
out	O
of	O
hopes	O
to	O
find	O
their	O
habitations	O
,	O
we	O
searched	O
no	O
farther	O
;	O
but	O
left	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
toys	O
ashore	O
in	O
such	O
places	O
where	O
we	O
thought	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
come	O
.	O

In	O
all	O
our	O
search	O
we	O
found	O
no	O
water	O
but	O
old	O
wells	O
on	O
the	O
sandy	O
bays	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
we	O
went	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
islands	O
and	O
there	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
:	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
there	O
were	O
40	O
on	O
one	O
island	O
,	O
men	O
,	O
women	O
,	O
and	O
children	O
.	O

The	O
men	O
at	O
our	O
first	O
coming	O
ashore	O
threatened	O
us	O
with	O
their	O
lances	O
and	O
swords	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
frightened	O
by	O
firing	O
one	O
gun	O
which	O
we	O
fired	O
purposely	O
to	O
scare	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
island	O
was	O
so	O
small	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
hide	O
themselves	O
:	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
much	O
disordered	O
at	O
our	O
landing	O
,	O
especially	O
the	O
women	O
and	O
children	O
:	O
for	O
we	O
went	O
directly	O
to	O
their	O
camp	O
.	O

The	O
lustiest	O
of	O
the	O
women	O
,	O
snatching	O
up	O
their	O
infants	O
,	O
ran	O
away	O
howling	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
little	O
children	O
ran	O
after	O
squeaking	O
and	O
bawling	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
men	O
stood	O
still	O
.	O

Some	O
of	O
the	O
women	O
and	O
such	O
people	O
as	O
could	O
not	O
go	O
from	O
us	O
lay	O
still	O
by	O
a	O
fire	O
,	O
making	O
a	O
doleful	O
noise	O
as	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
coming	O
to	O
devour	O
them	O
:	O
but	O
when	O
they	O
saw	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
intend	O
to	O
harm	O
them	O
they	O
were	O
pretty	O
quiet	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
rest	O
that	O
fled	O
from	O
us	O
at	O
our	O
first	O
coming	O
returned	O
again	O
.	O

This	O
their	O
place	O
of	O
dwelling	O
was	O
only	O
a	O
fire	O
with	O
a	O
few	O
boughs	O
before	O
it	O
,	O
set	O
up	O
on	O
that	O
side	O
the	O
winds	O
was	O
of	O
.	O

After	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
here	O
a	O
little	O
while	O
the	O
men	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
familiar	O
and	O
we	O
clothed	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
designing	O
to	O
have	O
had	O
some	O
service	O
of	O
them	O
for	O
it	O
:	O
for	O
we	O
found	O
some	O
wells	O
of	O
water	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
intended	O
to	O
carry	O
2	O
or	O
3	O
barrels	O
of	O
it	O
aboard	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
being	O
somewhat	O
troublesome	O
to	O
carry	O
to	O
the	O
Canoas	O
we	O
thought	O
to	O
have	O
made	O
these	O
men	O
to	O
have	O
carried	O
it	O
for	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
we	O
gave	O
them	O
some	O
old	O
clothes	O
;	O
to	O
one	O
an	O
old	O
pair	O
of	O
breeches	O
,	O
to	O
another	O
a	O
ragged	O
shirt	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
third	O
a	O
jacket	O
that	O
was	O
scarce	O
worth	O
owning	O
;	O
which	O
yet	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
acceptable	O
at	O
some	O
places	O
where	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
we	O
thought	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
with	O
these	O
people	O
.	O

We	O
put	O
them	O
on	O
them	O
,	O
thinking	O
that	O
this	O
finery	O
would	O
have	O
brought	O
them	O
to	O
work	O
heartily	O
for	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
our	O
water	O
being	O
filled	O
in	O
small	O
long	O
barrels	O
,	O
about	O
six	O
gallons	O
in	O
each	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
made	O
purposely	O
to	O
carry	O
water	O
in	O
,	O
we	O
brought	O
these	O
our	O
new	O
servants	O
to	O
the	O
wells	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
a	O
barrel	O
on	O
each	O
of	O
their	O
shoulders	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
carry	O
to	O
the	O
canoa	O
.	O

But	O
all	O
the	O
signs	O
we	O
could	O
make	O
were	O
to	O
no	O
purpose	O
for	O
they	O
stood	O
like	O
statues	O
without	O
motion	O
but	O
grinned	O
like	O
so	O
many	O
monkeys	O
staring	O
one	O
upon	O
another	O
:	O
for	O
these	O
poor	O
creatures	O
seem	O
not	O
accustomed	O
to	O
carry	O
burdens	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
ship-boys	O
of	O
10	O
years	O
old	O
would	O
carry	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

So	O
we	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
carry	O
our	O
water	O
ourselves	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
very	O
fairly	O
put	O
the	O
clothes	O
off	O
again	O
and	O
laid	O
them	O
down	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
clothes	O
were	O
only	O
to	O
work	O
in	O
.	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
perceive	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
any	O
great	O
liking	O
to	O
them	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
neither	O
did	O
they	O
seem	O
to	O
admire	O
anything	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
.	O

At	O
another	O
time	O
,	O
our	O
canoa	O
being	O
among	O
these	O
islands	O
seeking	O
for	O
game	O
,	O
espied	O
a	O
drove	O
of	O
these	O
men	O
swimming	O
from	O
one	O
island	O
to	O
another	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
have	O
no	O

we	O

They	O

,	O
standing	O
on	O

at	O

Those	O

also	O
that	O
live	O
on	O
the	O
main	O
would	O
always	O
run	O
away	O
from	O
us	O
;	O
yet	O
we	O
took	O
several	O
of	O
them	O

For	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
already	O
observed	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
such	O
bad	O
eyes	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
see	O
us	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
close	O
to	O
them	O

We	O
did	O
always	O
give	O
them	O
victuals	O
and	O
let	O
them	O
go	O
again	O

the	O

first	O
time	O
of	O

did	O

for	O
us	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
here	O
about	O
a	O
week	O
we	O
hauled	O
our	O
ship	O
into	O
a	O
small	O

cove	O
at	O
a	O

as	O

at	O

without	O

All	O

for	O
the	O
sea	O
did	O
not	O
come	O
near	O
us	O
by	O
about	O
a	O

We	O
had	O
therefore	O
time	O
enough	O
to	O
clean	O
our	O
ship	O
's	O
bottom	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
very	O
well	O

Most	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
lay	O
ashore	O
in	O
a	O
tent	O
where	O
our	O
sails	O
were	O
mending	O
;	O
and	O
our	O

brought	O
home	O
turtle	O

manatee	O
every	O
day	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
our	O
constant	O
food	O

While	O
we	O
lay	O
here	O
I	O
did	O
endeavour	O
to	O
persuade	O
our	O
men	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
some	O

but	O
was	O
threatened	O
to	O
be	O
turned	O
ashore	O

This	O
made	O
me	O
desist	O

some	O
more	O

March	O
the	O
12th	O
1688	O
we	O
sailed	O
from	O
New	PNM
Holland	PNM
with	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
north-north-west	O
and	O
fair	O
weather	O
.	O

We	O
directed	O
our	O
course	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
,	O
intending	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
to	O
touch	O
at	O
the	O
island	O
Cocos	O
:	O
but	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
the	O
winds	O
at	O
north-west	O
,	O
west-north-west	O
,	O
and	O
north-north-west	O
for	O
several	O
days	O
;	O
which	O
obliged	O
us	O
to	O
keep	O
a	O
more	O
easterly	O
course	O
than	O
was	O
convenient	O
to	O
find	O
that	O
island	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
soon	O
after	O
our	O
setting	O
out	O
very	O
bad	O
weather	O
with	O
much	O
thunder	O
and	O
lightning	O
,	O
rain	O
and	O
high	O
blustering	O
winds	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
26th	O
day	O
of	O
March	O
before	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
Cocos	O
which	O
is	O
in	O
12	O
degrees	O
12	O
minutes	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
by	O
judgment	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
40	O
or	O
50	O
leagues	O
to	O
the	O
east	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
wind	O
was	O
now	O
at	O
south-west	O
.	O

Therefore	O
we	O
did	O
rather	O
choose	O
to	O
bear	O
away	O
towards	O
some	O
islands	O
on	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
of	O
Sumatra	PNM
than	O
to	O
beat	O
against	O
the	O
wind	O
for	O
the	O
island	O
Cocos	PNM
.	O

I	O
was	O
very	O
glad	O
of	O
this	O
;	O
being	O
in	O
hopes	O
to	O
make	O
my	O
escape	O
from	O
them	O
to	O
Sumatra	PNM
or	O
to	O
some	O
other	O
place	O
.	O

We	O
met	O
nothing	O
of	O
remark	O
in	O
this	O
voyage	O
beside	O
the	O
catching	O
two	O
great	O
sharks	O
till	O
the	O
28th	O
day	O
.	O

Then	O
we	O
fell	O
in	O
with	O
a	O
small	O
woody	O
island	O
in	O
latitude	O
10	O
degrees	O
20	O
minutes	O
.	O

Its	O
longitude	O
from	O
New	PNM
Holland	PNM
,	O
from	O
whence	O
we	O
came	O
,	O
was	O
by	O
my	O
account	O
12	O
degrees	O
6	O
minutes	O
west	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
deep	O
water	O
about	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
no	O
anchoring	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
sent	O
two	O
Canoas	O
ashore	O
;	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
with	O
the	O
carpenters	O
to	O
cut	O
a	O
tree	O
to	O
make	O
another	O
pump	O
;	O
the	O
other	O
canoa	O
went	O
to	O
search	O
for	O
fresh	O
water	O
and	O
found	O
a	O
fine	O
small	O
brook	O
near	O
the	O
south-west	O
point	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
but	O
there	O
the	O
sea	O
fell	O
in	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
so	O
high	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
it	O
off	O
.	O

At	O
noon	O
both	O
our	O
Canoas	O
returned	O
aboard	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
carpenters	O
brought	O
aboard	O
a	O
good	O
tree	O
which	O
they	O
afterwards	O
made	O
a	O
pump	O
with	O
,	O
such	O
a	O
one	O
as	O
they	O
made	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM
.	O

The	O
other	O
canoa	O
brought	O
aboard	O
as	O
many	O
boobies	O
and	O
men-of-war	O
birds	O
as	O
sufficed	O
all	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
boiled	O
.	O

They	O
got	O
also	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
land	O
animal	O
somewhat	O
resembling	O
a	O
large	O
crawfish	O
without	O
its	O
great	O
claws	O
.	O

These	O
creatures	O
lived	O
in	O
holes	O
in	O
the	O
dry	O
sandy	O
ground	O
like	O
rabbits	O
.	O

Sir	O
Francis	O
Drake	O
in	O
his	O
Voyage	O
round	O
the	O
World	O
makes	O
mention	O
of	O
such	O
that	O
he	O
found	O
at	O
Ternate	PNM
,	O
or	O
some	O
other	O
of	O
the	O
Spice	O
Islands	O
,	O
or	O
near	O
them	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
very	O
good	O
sweet	O
meat	O
and	O
so	O
large	O
that	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
man	O
could	O
eat	O
;	O
being	O
almost	O
as	O
thick	O
as	O
one	O
's	O
leg	O

Their	O
shells	O
were	O
of	O
a	O
dark	O
brown	O

red	O
when	O
boiled	O

This	O
island	O
is	O
of	O
a	O
good	O
height	O
,	O
with	O
steep	O
cliffs	O
against	O
the	O
south	O

and	O
a	O

very	O
deep	O

About	O
one	O
a	O
clock	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
we	O
made	O
sail	O
from	O
this	O
island	O
with	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
south-west	O
and	O
we	O
steered	O
north-west	O
.	O

Afterwards	O
the	O
winds	O
came	O
about	O
at	O
north-west	O
and	O
continued	O
between	O
the	O
west-north-west	O
and	O
the	O
north-north-west	O
several	O
days	O
.	O

I	O
observed	O
that	O
the	O
winds	O
blew	O
for	O
the	O
most	O
part	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
west	O
or	O
north-west	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
had	O
always	O
rainy	O
weather	O
with	O
tornadoes	O
,	O
and	O
much	O
thunder	O
and	O
lightning	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
the	O
wind	O
came	O
any	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
it	O
blew	O
but	O
faint	O
and	O
brought	O
fair	O
weather	O

We	O
met	O
nothing	O

the	O
7th	O

April	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
being	O
in	O
latitude	O
7	O

we	O
saw	O
the	O

Sumatra	PNM
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O

bearing	O
north	O

The	O
8th	O
day	O
we	O

on	O
the	O

we	O

we	O
hoisted	O

yet	O
sweet	O
and	O
good	O

The	O
12th	O
day	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
small	O
island	O
called	O
Triste	PNM
in	O
latitude	O
-LRB-	O
by	O
observation	O
-RRB-	O
4	O
degrees	O
south	O
;	O
it	O
is	O
about	O
14	O
or	O
15	O
leagues	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
Sumatra	PNM
.	O

From	O
hence	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
there	O
are	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
small	O
uninhabited	O
islands	O
lying	O
much	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
distance	O
from	O
Sumatra	PNM
.	O

This	O
island	O
Triste	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
mile	O
round	O
and	O
so	O
low	O
that	O
the	O
tide	O
flows	O
clear	O
over	O
it	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
of	O
a	O
sandy	O
soil	O
and	O
full	O
of	O
coconut-trees	O
.	O

The	O
nuts	O
are	O
but	O
small	O
;	O
yet	O
sweet	O
enough	O
,	O
full	O
,	O
and	O
more	O
ponderous	O
than	O
I	O
ever	O
felt	O
any	O
of	O
that	O
bigness	O
;	O
notwithstanding	O
that	O
every	O
spring	O
tide	O
the	O
salt-water	O
goes	O
clear	O
over	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

We	O
sent	O
ashore	O
our	O
Canoas	O
for	O
coconuts	O
and	O
they	O
returned	O
aboard	O
laden	O
with	O
them	O
three	O
times	O
.	O

Our	O
strikers	O
also	O
went	O
out	O
and	O
struck	O
some	O
fish	O
which	O
was	O
boiled	O
for	O
supper	O
.	O

They	O
also	O
killed	O
two	O
young	O
alligators	O
which	O
we	O
salted	O
for	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
no	O
opportunity	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
to	O
make	O
any	O
escape	O
as	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
done	O
and	O
gone	O
over	O
hence	O
to	O
Sumatra	PNM
,	O
could	O
I	O
have	O
kept	O
a	O
boat	O
to	O
me	O
.	O

But	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
compassing	O
this	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
the	O
15th	O
day	O
we	O
went	O
from	O
hence	O
,	O
steering	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
on	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
of	O
Sumatra	PNM
.	O

Our	O
food	O
now	O
was	O
rice	O
and	O
the	O
meat	O
of	O
the	O
coconuts	O
rasped	O
and	O
steeped	O
in	O
water	O
;	O
which	O
made	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
milk	O
into	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
put	O
our	O
rice	O
,	O
making	O
a	O
pleasant	O
mess	O
enough	O
.	O

After	O
we	O
parted	O
from	O
Triste	PNM
we	O
saw	O
other	O
small	O
islands	O
that	O
were	O
also	O
full	O
of	O
coconut-trees	O
.	O

The	O
19th	O
day	O
,	O
being	O
in	O
latitude	O
3	O
degrees	O
25	O
minutes	O
south	O
,	O
the	O
south-west	O
point	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
Nassau	PNM

north	O
about	O
five	O
miles	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
pretty	O
large	O
uninhabited	O
island	O
in	O
latitude	O
3	O
degrees	O
20	O
minutes	O
south	O
and	O
is	O
full	O
of	O
high	O
trees	O

About	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
island	O
Nassau	PNM
there	O
is	O
a	O
small	O
island	O
full	O
of	O
coconut-trees	O
.	O

There	O
we	O
anchored	O
the	O
29th	O
day	O
to	O
replenish	O
our	O
stock	O
of	O
coconuts	O
.	O

A	O
reef	O
of	O
rocks	O
lies	O
almost	O
round	O
this	O
island	O
so	O
that	O
our	O
boats	O
could	O
not	O
go	O
ashore	O
nor	O
come	O
aboard	O
at	O
low-water	O
;	O
yet	O
we	O
got	O
aboard	O
four	O
boat-load	O
of	O
nuts	O
.	O

This	O
island	O
is	O
low	O
like	O
Triste	PNM
and	O
the	O
anchoring	O
is	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
;	O
where	O
you	O
have	O
14	O
fathom	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
shore	O
,	O
clean	O
sand	O
.	O

The	O
21st	O
day	O
we	O
went	O
from	O
hence	O
and	O
kept	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
,	O
coasting	O
still	O
on	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
Sumatra	PNM
;	O
and	O
having	O
the	O

;	O
sometimes	O
rains	O
and	O
tornadoes	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O

The	O
25th	O
day	O
we	O
crossed	O
the	O
Equator	O
,	O
still	O
coasting	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
between	O
the	O
island	O
Sumatra	PNM
and	O
a	O
range	O
of	O
small	O
islands	O
lying	O
14	O
or	O
15	O
leagues	O
off	O
it	O
.	O

Amongst	O
all	O
these	O
islands	O
Hog	O
Island	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
considerable	O
.	O

It	O
lies	O
in	O
latitude	O
3	O
degrees	O
40	O
minutes	O
north	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
pretty	O
high	O
even	O
land	O
,	O
clothed	O
with	O
tall	O
flourishing	O
trees	O
;	O
we	O
passed	O
it	O
by	O
the	O
28th	O
day	O
.	O

The	O
29th	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
sail	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
of	O
us	O
which	O
we	O
chased	O
:	O
but	O
it	O
being	O
little	O
wind	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
come	O
up	O
with	O
her	O
till	O
the	O
30th	O
day	O
.	O

Then	O
,	O
being	O
within	O
a	O
league	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
Captain	O
Read	O
went	O
into	O
a	O
canoa	O
and	O
took	O
her	O
and	O
brought	O
her	O
aboard	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
a	O
proa	O
with	O
four	O
men	O
in	O
her	O
,	O
belonging	O
to	O
Achin	PNM
,	O
whither	O
she	O
was	O
bound	O
.	O

She	O
came	O
from	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
coconut	O
islands	O
that	O
we	O
passed	O
by	O
and	O
was	O
laden	O
with	O
coconuts	O
and	O
coconut-oil	O
.	O

Captain	O
Read	O
ordered	O
his	O
men	O
to	O
take	O
aboard	O
all	O
the	O
nuts	O
and	O
as	O
much	O
of	O
the	O
oil	O
as	O
he	O
thought	O
convenient	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
cut	O
a	O
hole	O
in	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
the	O
proa	O
and	O
turned	O
her	O
loose	O
,	O
keeping	O
the	O
men	O
prisoners	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
for	O
the	O
lucre	O
of	O
the	O
cargo	O
that	O
Captain	O
Read	O
took	O
this	O
boat	O
but	O
to	O
hinder	O
me	O
and	O
some	O
others	O
from	O
going	O
ashore	O
;	O
for	O
he	O
knew	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
ready	O
to	O
make	O
our	O
escapes	O
if	O
an	O
opportunity	O
presented	O
itself	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
thought	O
that	O
by	O
abusing	O
and	O
robbing	O
the	O
natives	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
afraid	O
to	O
trust	O
ourselves	O
among	O
them	O
.	O

But	O
yet	O
this	O
proceeding	O
of	O
his	O
turned	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
advantage	O
,	O
as	O
shall	O
be	O
declared	O
hereafter	O
.	O

May	O
the	O
1st	O
we	O
ran	O
down	O
by	O
the	O
north-west	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
Sumatra	PNM
,	O
within	O
seven	O

All	O
this	O

The	O
prisoners	O
who	O
were	O
taken	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
showed	O
us	O
the	O

Harbour	PNM
,	O
and	O
the	O
channels	O

and	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
an	O
English	O
factory	O
at	O
Achin	PNM
.	O

I	O
wished	O
myself	O
there	O
but	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
wait	O
with	O
patience	O
till	O
my	O
time	O
was	O
come	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
now	O
directing	O
our	O
course	O
towards	O
the	O
Nicobar	O
Islands	O
,	O
intending	O
there	O
to	O

the	O

to	O
make	O
her	O
sail	O
well	O
.	O

The	O
14th	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
we	O
had	O
sight	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Nicobar	PNM
Islands	PNM
.	O

The	O
southernmost	O
of	O
them	O
lies	O
about	O
40	O
leagues	O
north-north-west	O
from	O
the	O
north-west	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
Sumatra	PNM
.	O

This	O
most	O
southerly	O
of	O
them	O
is	O
Nicobar	O
itself	O
,	O
but	O
all	O
the	O
cluster	O
of	O
islands	O
lying	O
south	O
of	O
the	O
Andaman	O
Islands	O
are	O
called	O
by	O
our	O
seamen	O
the	O
Nicobar	PNM
Islands	PNM
.	O

The	O
inhabitants	O
of	O
these	O
islands	O
have	O
no	O
certain	O
converse	O
with	O
any	O
nation	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
ships	O
pass	O
by	O
them	O
they	O
will	O
come	O
aboard	O
in	O
their	O
proas	O
and	O
offer	O
their	O
commodities	O
to	O
sale	O
,	O
never	O
enquiring	O
of	O
what	O
nation	O
they	O
are	O
;	O
for	O
all	O
white	O
people	O
are	O
alike	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

Their	O
chiefest	O
commodities	O
are	O
ambergris	O
and	O
fruits	O
.	O

Ambergris	O
is	O
often	O
found	O
by	O
the	O
native	O
Indians	O
of	O
these	O
islands	O
who	O
know	O
it	O
very	O
well	O
;	O
as	O
also	O
know	O
how	O
to	O
cheat	O
ignorant	O
strangers	O
with	O
a	O
certain	O
mixture	O
like	O
it	O
.	O

Several	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
bought	O
such	O
of	O
them	O
for	O
a	O
small	O
purchase	O
.	O

Captain	O
Weldon	O
also	O
about	O
this	O
time	O
touched	O
at	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
islands	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
where	O
we	O
lay	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
saw	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
such	O
ambergris	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
bought	O
there	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
good	O
,	O
having	O
no	O
smell	O
at	O
all	O
.	O

Yet	O
I	O
saw	O
some	O
there	O
very	O
good	O
and	O
fragrant	O
.	O

At	O
that	O
island	O
where	O
Captain	O
Weldon	O
was	O
there	O
were	O
two	O
friars	O
sent	O
thither	O
to	O
convert	O
the	O
Indians	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
them	O
came	O
away	O
with	O
Captain	O
Weldon	O
;	O
the	O
other	O
remained	O
there	O
still	O
.	O

He	O
that	O
came	O
away	O
with	O
Captain	O
Weldon	O
gave	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
character	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
of	O
that	O
island	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
honest	O
,	O
civil	O
,	O
harmless	O
people	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
addicted	O
to	O
quarrelling	O
,	O
theft	O
,	O
or	O
murder	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
marry	O
or	O
at	O
least	O
live	O
as	O
man	O
and	O
wife	O
,	O
one	O
man	O
with	O
one	O
woman	O
,	O
never	O
changing	O
till	O
death	O
made	O
the	O
separation	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
punctual	O

honest	O
in	O
performing	O
their	O
bargains	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
inclined	O
to	O
receive	O
the	O
Christian	O
religion	O
.	O

This	O
relation	O
I	O
had	O
afterwards	O
from	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
a	O
priest	O
at	O
Tonquin	PNM
who	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
he	O
received	O
this	O
information	O
by	O
a	O
letter	O
from	O
the	O
friar	O
that	O
Captain	O
Weldon	O
brought	O
away	O
from	O
thence	O
.	O

But	O
to	O
proceed	O
.	O

The	O
5th	O
day	O
of	O
May	O
we	O
ran	O
down	O
on	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
Nicobar	PNM
properly	O
so-called	O
and	O
anchored	O
at	O
the	O
north-west	O
end	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
a	O
small	O
bay	O
in	O
eight	O
fathom	O
water	O
not	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

The	O
body	O
of	O
this	O
island	O
is	O
in	O
7	O
degrees	O
30	O
minutes	O
north	O
latitude	O

It	O
is	O
about	O
12	O
leagues	O
long	O
,	O
and	O
3	O
or	O
4	O
broad	O
.	O

The	O
south	O
end	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
pretty	O
high	O
with	O
steep	O
cliffs	O
against	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
is	O
low	O
,	O
flat	O

and	O
even	O

The	O
mould	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
black	O
and	O
deep	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
well	O
watered	O
with	O
small	O
running	O
streams	O
.	O

It	O
produces	O
abundance	O
of	O
tall	O
trees	O
fit	O
for	O
any	O
uses	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
whole	O
bulk	O
of	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
but	O
one	O
entire	O
grove	O
.	O

But	O
that	O
which	O
adds	O
most	O
to	O
its	O
beauty	O
off	O
at	O
sea	O
are	O
the	O
many	O
spots	O
of	O
coconut-trees	O
which	O
grow	O
round	O
it	O
in	O
every	O
small	O

The	O

are	O
half	O
a	O

or	O
a	O

more	O
or	O

and	O
these	O
bays	O
are	O
intercepted	O
or	O
divided	O
from	O
each	O
other	O
with	O
as	O
many	O
little	O
rocky	O
points	O
of	O

As	O
the	O
coconut-trees	O
do	O
thus	O
grow	O
in	O
groves	O
fronting	O
to	O
the	O
sea	O
in	O
the	O
bays	O

so	O
there	O
is	O
another	O
sort	O
of	O
fruit-trees	O
in	O
the	O
bays	O

the	O
back	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
coconut-trees	O
,	O
farther	O

the	O
sea	O

It	O
is	O
called	O
by	O
the	O

a	O
melory-tree	O

This	O
tree	O
is	O
as	O

like	O
a	O
pear	O
and	O
has	O
a	O
pretty	O
tough	O
smooth	O
rind	O
of	O
a	O
light	O
green	O
colour	O
.	O

The	O
inside	O
of	O
the	O
fruit	O
is	O
in	O
substance	O
much	O
like	O
an	O
apple	O
but	O
full	O
of	O
small	O
strings	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
a	O
brown	O

I	O
did	O
never	O

these	O
trees	O
anywhere	O

here	O

The	O
natives	O
of	O
this	O
island	O
are	O
tall	O
well-limbed	O
men	O
;	O
pretty	O
long-visaged	O
,	O
with	O
black	O
eyes	O
;	O
their	O
noses	O
middle	O
proportioned	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
whole	O
symmetry	O
of	O
their	O
faces	O
agreeing	O
very	O
well	O
.	O

Their	O
hair	O
is	O
black	O
and	O
lank	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
skins	O
of	O
a	O
dark	O
copper	O
colour	O
.	O

The	O
women	O
have	O
no	O
hair	O
on	O
their	O
eyebrows	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
believe	O
it	O
is	O
plucked	O
up	O
by	O
the	O
roots	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
men	O
had	O
hair	O
growing	O
on	O
their	O
eyebrows	O
as	O
other	O
people	O
.	O

The	O
men	O
go	O
all	O
naked	O
save	O
only	O
a	O
long	O
narrow	O
piece	O
of	O
cloth	O
or	O
sash	O
which	O
,	O
going	O
round	O
their	O
waists	O
and	O
thence	O
down	O
between	O
their	O
thighs	O
,	O
is	O
brought	O
up	O
behind	O
and	O
tucked	O
in	O
at	O
that	O
part	O
which	O
goes	O
about	O
the	O
waist	O
.	O

The	O
women	O
have	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
short	O
petticoat	O
reaching	O
from	O
their	O
waist	O
to	O
their	O
knees	O
.	O

Their	O
language	O
was	O
different	O
from	O
any	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
ever	O
heard	O
before	O
;	O
yet	O
they	O
had	O
some	O
few	O
Malayan	O
words	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
a	O
word	O
or	O
two	O
of	O
Portuguese	O
;	O
which	O
probably	O
they	O
might	O
learn	O
aboard	O
of	O
their	O
ships	O
,	O
passing	O
by	O
this	O
place	O
:	O
for	O
when	O
these	O
men	O
see	O
a	O
sail	O
they	O
do	O
presently	O
go	O
aboard	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
their	O
Canoas	O
.	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
perceive	O
any	O
form	O
of	O
religion	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
;	O
they	O
had	O
neither	O
temple	O
nor	O
idol	O
nor	O
any	O
manner	O
of	O
outward	O
veneration	O
to	O
any	O
deity	O
that	O
I	O
did	O
see	O
.	O

They	O
inhabit	O
all	O
round	O
the	O
island	O
by	O
the	O
seaside	O
in	O
the	O
bays	O
;	O
there	O
being	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
houses	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
in	O
each	O
bay	O
.	O

Their	O
houses	O
are	O
built	O
on	O
posts	O
as	O
the	O
Mindanayans	O
are	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
small	O
,	O
low	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
a	O
square	O
form	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
but	O
one	O
room	O
in	O
each	O
house	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
room	O
is	O
about	O
eight	O
foot	O
from	O
the	O
ground	O
;	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
the	O
roof	O
is	O
raised	O
about	O
eight	O
foot	O
higher	O
.	O

But	O
instead	O
of	O
a	O
sharp	O
ridge	O
the	O
top	O
is	O
exceeding	O
neatly	O
arched	O
with	O
small	O
rafters	O
about	O
the	O
bigness	O
of	O
a	O
man	O
's	O
arm	O
,	O
bent	O
round	O
like	O
a	O
half	O
moon	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
curiously	O
thatched	O
with	O
palmetto-leaves	O
.	O

They	O
live	O
under	O
no	O
government	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
perceive	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
equal	O
without	O
any	O
distinction	O
;	O
every	O
man	O
ruling	O
in	O
his	O
own	O
house	O
.	O

Their	O
plantations	O
are	O
only	O
those	O
coconut-trees	O
which	O
grow	O
by	O
the	O
seaside	O
;	O
there	O
being	O
no	O
cleared	O
land	O
farther	O
in	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
:	O
for	O
I	O
observed	O
that	O
when	O
past	O
the	O
fruit-trees	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
paths	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
going	O
into	O
the	O
woods	O
.	O

The	O
greatest	O
use	O
which	O
they	O
make	O
of	O
their	O
coconut-trees	O
is	O
to	O
draw	O
toddy	O
from	O
them	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
are	O
very	O
fond	O
.	O

The	O
melory-trees	O
seem	O
to	O
grow	O
wild	O
;	O
they	O
have	O
great	O
earthen	O
pots	O
to	O
boil	O
the	O
melory	O
fruit	O
in	O
which	O
will	O
hold	O
12	O
or	O
14	O
gallons	O
.	O

These	O
pots	O
they	O
fill	O
with	O
the	O
fruit	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
putting	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
water	O
,	O
they	O
cover	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
pot	O
with	O
leaves	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
steam	O
while	O
it	O
boils	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
fruit	O
is	O
soft	O
they	O
peel	O
off	O
the	O
rind	O
and	O
scrape	O
the	O
pulp	O
from	O
the	O
strings	O
with	O
a	O
flat	O
stick	O
made	O
like	O
a	O
knife	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
make	O
it	O
up	O
in	O
great	O
lumps	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
a	O
Holland	O
cheese	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
it	O
will	O
keep	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
days	O
.	O

It	O
looks	O
yellow	O
,	O
and	O
tastes	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
is	O
their	O
chiefest	O
food	O
:	O
for	O
they	O
have	O
no	O
yams	O
,	O
potatoes	O
,	O
rice	O
,	O
nor	O
plantains	O
-LRB-	O
except	O
a	O
very	O
few	O
-RRB-	O
yet	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
few	O
small	O
hogs	O
and	O
a	O
very	O
few	O
cocks	O
and	O
hens	O
like	O
ours	O
.	O

The	O
men	O
employ	O
themselves	O
in	O
fishing	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
see	O
much	O
fish	O
that	O
they	O
got	O
:	O
every	O
house	O
has	O
at	O
least	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
Canoas	O
belonging	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
draw	O
up	O
ashore	O
.	O

The	O
Canoas	O
that	O
they	O
go	O
a-fishing	O
in	O
are	O
sharp	O
at	O
both	O
ends	O
;	O
and	O
both	O
the	O
sides	O
and	O
the	O
bottom	O
are	O
very	O
thin	O
and	O
smooth	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
shaped	O
somewhat	O
like	O
the	O
proas	O
at	O
Guam	PNM
with	O
one	O
side	O
flattish	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
with	O
a	O
pretty	O
big	O
belly	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
small	O
slight	O
outlayers	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
.	O

Being	O
thus	O
thin	O
and	O
light	O
they	O
are	O
better	O
managed	O
with	O
oars	O
than	O
with	O
sails	O
:	O
yet	O
they	O
sail	O
well	O
enough	O
and	O
steered	O
with	O
a	O
paddle	O
.	O

There	O
commonly	O
go	O
20	O
or	O
30	O
men	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
Canoas	O
;	O
and	O
seldom	O
fewer	O
than	O
9	O
or	O
10	O
.	O

Their	O
oars	O
are	O
short	O
and	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
paddle	O
but	O
row	O
with	O
them	O
as	O
we	O
do	O
.	O

The	O
benches	O
they	O
sit	O
on	O
when	O
they	O
row	O
are	O
made	O
of	O
split	O
bamboos	O
,	O
laid	O
across	O
and	O
so	O
neat	O
together	O
that	O
they	O
look	O
like	O
a	O
deck	O
.	O

The	O
bamboos	O
lie	O
movable	O
so	O
that	O
when	O
any	O
go	O
in	O
to	O
row	O
they	O
take	O
up	O
a	O
bamboo	O
in	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
they	O
would	O
sit	O
and	O
lay	O
it	O
by	O
to	O
make	O
room	O
for	O
their	O
legs	O
.	O

The	O
Canoas	O
of	O
those	O
of	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
these	O
islands	O
were	O
like	O
those	O
of	O
Nicobar	PNM
;	O
and	O
probably	O
they	O
were	O
alike	O
in	O
other	O
things	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
saw	O
no	O
different	O
at	O
all	O
in	O
the	O
natives	O
of	O
them	O
who	O
came	O
hither	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
here	O
.	O

But	O
to	O
proceed	O
with	O
our	O
affairs	O
:	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
before	O
,	O
the	O
5th	O
day	O
of	O
May	O
about	O
10	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
when	O
we	O
anchored	O
at	O
this	O
island	O
:	O
Captain	O
Read	O
immediately	O
ordered	O
his	O
men	O
to	O
heel	O
the	O
ship	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
clean	O
her	O
:	O
which	O
was	O
done	O
this	O
day	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
.	O

All	O
the	O
water	O
vessels	O
were	O
filled	O
.	O

They	O
intended	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
sea	O
at	O
night	O
:	O
for	O
,	O
the	O
winds	O
being	O
yet	O
at	O
north-north-east	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
was	O
in	O
hopes	O
to	O
get	O
over	O
to	O
Cape	PNM
Comorin	PNM
before	O
the	O
wind	O
shifted	O
.	O

Otherwise	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
somewhat	O
difficult	O
for	O
him	O
to	O
get	O
thither	O
because	O
the	O
westerly	O
monsoon	O
was	O
not	O
at	O
hand	O
.	O

I	O
thought	O
now	O
was	O
my	O
time	O
to	O
make	O
my	O
escape	O
by	O
getting	O
leave	O
if	O
possible	O
to	O
stay	O
here	O
:	O
for	O
it	O
seemed	O
not	O
very	O
feasible	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
by	O
stealth	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
reason	O
to	O
despair	O
of	O
getting	O
leave	O
:	O
this	O
being	O
a	O
place	O
where	O
my	O
stay	O
could	O
probably	O
do	O
our	O
crew	O
no	O
harm	O
should	O
I	O
design	O
it	O
.	O

Indeed	O
one	O
reason	O
that	O
put	O
me	O
on	O
the	O
thoughts	O
of	O
staying	O
at	O
this	O
particular	O
place	O
,	O
besides	O
the	O
present	O
opportunity	O
of	O
leaving	O
Captain	O
Read	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
did	O
always	O
intend	O
to	O
do	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
was	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
here	O
also	O
a	O
prospect	O
of	O
advancing	O
a	O
profitable	O
trade	O
for	O
ambergris	O
with	O
these	O
people	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
gaining	O
a	O
considerable	O
fortune	O
to	O
myself	O
:	O
for	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
learned	O
their	O
language	O
and	O
,	O
by	O
accustoming	O
myself	O
to	O
row	O
with	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
proas	O
or	O
Canoas	O
,	O
especially	O
by	O
conforming	O
myself	O
to	O
their	O
customs	O
and	O
manners	O
of	O
living	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
seen	O
how	O
they	O
got	O
their	O
ambergris	O
,	O
and	O
have	O
known	O
what	O
quantities	O
they	O
get	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
when	O
most	O
is	O
found	O
.	O

And	O
then	O
afterwards	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
easy	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
have	O
transported	O
myself	O
from	O
thence	O
,	O
either	O
in	O
some	O
ship	O
that	O
passed	O
this	O
way	O
,	O
whether	O
English	O
,	O
Dutch	O
,	O
or	O
Portuguese	O
;	O
or	O
else	O
to	O
have	O
gotten	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
young	O
men	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
to	O
have	O
gone	O
with	O
me	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
Canoas	O
to	O
Achin	PNM
;	O
and	O
there	O
to	O
have	O
furnished	O
myself	O
with	O
such	O
commodities	O
as	O
I	O
found	O
most	O
coveted	O
by	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
therewith	O
at	O
my	O
return	O
to	O
have	O
bought	O
their	O
ambergris	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
till	O
this	O
time	O
made	O
no	O
open	O
show	O
of	O
going	O
ashore	O
here	O
:	O
but	O
now	O
,	O
the	O
water	O
being	O
filled	O
and	O
the	O
ship	O
in	O
a	O
readiness	O
to	O
sail	O
,	O
I	O
desired	O
Captain	O
Read	O
to	O
set	O
me	O
ashore	O
on	O
this	O
island	O
.	O

He	O
,	O
supposing	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
go	O
ashore	O
in	O
a	O
place	O
less	O
frequented	O
by	O
ships	O
than	O
this	O
,	O
gave	O
me	O
leave	O
:	O
which	O
probably	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
refused	O
to	O
have	O
done	O
if	O
he	O
thought	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
gotten	O
from	O
hence	O
in	O
any	O
short	O
time	O
;	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
my	O
giving	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
him	O
to	O
the	O
English	O
or	O
Dutch	O
.	O

I	O
soon	O
got	O
up	O
my	O
chest	O
and	O
bedding	O
and	O
immediately	O
got	O
some	O
to	O
row	O
me	O
ashore	O
;	O
for	O
fear	O
lest	O
his	O
mind	O
should	O
change	O
again	O
.	O

The	O
canoa	O
that	O
brought	O
me	O
ashore	O
landed	O
me	O
on	O
a	O
small	O
sandy	O
bay	O
where	O
there	O
were	O
two	O
houses	O
but	O
no	O
person	O
in	O
them	O
.	O

For	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
were	O
removed	O
to	O
some	O
other	O
house	O
,	O
probably	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
us	O
because	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
close	O
by	O
:	O
and	O
yet	O
both	O
men	O
and	O
women	O
came	O
aboard	O
the	O
ship	O
without	O
any	O
sign	O
of	O
fear	O
.	O

When	O
our	O
ship	O
's	O
canoa	O
was	O
going	O
aboard	O
again	O
they	O
met	O
the	O
owner	O
of	O
the	O
houses	O
coming	O
ashore	O
in	O
his	O
boat	O
.	O

He	O
made	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
signs	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
fetch	O
me	O
off	O
again	O
:	O
but	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
understand	O
him	O
.	O

Then	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
me	O
and	O
offered	O
his	O
boat	O
to	O
carry	O
me	O
off	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
refused	O
it	O
.	O

Then	O
he	O
made	O
signs	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
go	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
house	O
and	O
,	O
according	O
as	O
I	O
did	O
understand	O
him	O
by	O
his	O
signs	O
and	O
a	O
few	O
Malayan	O
words	O
that	O
he	O
used	O
,	O
he	O
intimated	O
that	O
somewhat	O
would	O
come	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
woods	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
sleep	O
and	O
kill	O
me	O
,	O
meaning	O
probably	O
some	O
wild	O
beast	O
.	O

Then	O
I	O
carried	O
my	O
chest	O
and	O
clothes	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
house	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
ashore	O
an	O
hour	O
before	O
Captain	O
Teat	O
and	O
one	O
John	O
Damarel	O
,	O
with	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
armed	O
men	O
more	O
,	O
came	O
to	O
fetch	O
me	O
aboard	O
again	O
.	O

They	O
need	O
not	O
have	O
sent	O
an	O
armed	O
posse	O
for	O
me	O
;	O
for	O
had	O
they	O
but	O
sent	O
the	O
cabin-boy	O
ashore	O
for	O
me	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
denied	O
going	O
aboard	O
.	O

For	O
though	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
hid	O
myself	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
yet	O
then	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
abused	O
or	O
have	O
killed	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
purposely	O
to	O
incense	O
them	O
against	O
me	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
them	O
therefore	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
ready	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
them	O
and	O
went	O
aboard	O
with	O
all	O
my	O
things	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
came	O
aboard	O
I	O
found	O
the	O
ship	O
in	O
an	O
uproar	O
;	O
for	O
there	O
were	O
three	O
men	O
more	O
who	O
,	O
taking	O
courage	O
by	O
my	O
example	O
,	O
desired	O
leave	O
also	O
to	O
accompany	O
me	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
the	O
surgeon	O
Mr.	O
Coppinger	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
was	O
Mr.	O
Robert	O
Hall	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
named	O
Ambrose	O
;	O
I	O
have	O
forgot	O
his	O
surname	O
.	O

These	O
men	O
had	O
always	O
harboured	O
the	O
same	O
designs	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
.	O

The	O
two	O
last	O
were	O
not	O
much	O
opposed	O
;	O
but	O
Captain	O
Read	O
and	O
his	O
crew	O
would	O
not	O
part	O
with	O
the	O
surgeon	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
the	O
surgeon	O
leapt	O
into	O
the	O
canoa	O
and	O
,	O
taking	O
up	O
my	O
gun	O
,	O
swore	O
he	O
would	O
go	O
ashore	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
if	O
any	O
man	O
did	O
oppose	O
it	O
he	O
would	O
shoot	O
him	O
:	O
but	O
John	O
Oliver	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
then	O
quartermaster	O
,	O
leapt	O
into	O
the	O
canoa	O
,	O
taking	O
hold	O
of	O
him	O
took	O
away	O
the	O
gun	O
and	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
more	O
,	O
they	O
dragged	O
him	O
again	O
into	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

Then	O
Mr.	O
Hall	O
and	O
Ambrose	O
and	O
I	O
were	O
again	O
sent	O
ashore	O
;	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
that	O
rowed	O
us	O
ashore	O
stole	O
an	O
axe	O
and	O
gave	O
it	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
knowing	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
commodity	O
with	O
the	O
Indians	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
now	O
dark	O
,	O
therefore	O
we	O
lighted	O
a	O
candle	O
and	O
I	O
,	O
being	O
the	O
oldest	O
stander	O
in	O
our	O
new	O
country	O
,	O
conducted	O
them	O
into	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
houses	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
did	O
presently	O
hang	O
up	O
our	O
hammocks	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
scarce	O
done	O
this	O
before	O
the	O
canoa	O
came	O
ashore	O
again	O
and	O
brought	O
the	O
four	O
Malayan	O
men	O
belonging	O
to	O
Achin	PNM
-LRB-	O
which	O
we	O
took	O
in	O
the	O
proa	O
we	O
took	O
off	O
of	O
Sumatra	PNM
-RRB-	O
and	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
that	O
came	O
to	O
our	O
ship	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
Siam	O
junk	O
at	O
Pulo	PNM
Condore	PNM
:	O
the	O
crew	O
having	O
no	O
occasion	O
for	O
these	O
,	O
being	O
leaving	O
the	O
Malayan	O
parts	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
spark	O
served	O
as	O
an	O
interpreter	O
;	O
and	O
not	O
fearing	O
now	O
that	O
the	O
Achinese	O
could	O
be	O
serviceable	O
to	O
us	O
in	O
bringing	O
us	O
over	O
to	O
their	O
country	O
,	O
forty	O

off	O

nor	O
imagining	O
that	O
we	O

make	O
such	O
an	O
attempt	O
,	O
as	O
indeed	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
bold	O
one	O

Now	O
we	O
were	O
men	O
enough	O
to	O
defend	O
ourselves	O
against	O
the	O
natives	O
of	O
this	O
island	O
if	O
they	O
should	O
prove	O
our	O
enemies	O
:	O
though	O
if	O
none	O
of	O
these	O
men	O
had	O
come	O
ashore	O
to	O
me	O
I	O
should	O
not	O
have	O
feared	O
any	O
danger	O
:	O
nay	O
perhaps	O
less	O
because	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
cautious	O
of	O
giving	O
any	O
offence	O
to	O
the	O
natives	O
.	O

And	O
I	O
am	O
of	O
the	O
opinion	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
no	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
so	O
barbarous	O
as	O
to	O
kill	O
a	O

that	O
falls	O

come	O
to	O

-LRB-	O
which	O
is	O
the	O

thing	O
because	O
their	O

After	O

I	O
will	O

I	O
speak	O

to	O
the	O
compass	O
of	O

and	O
know	O
some	O
of	O
these	O

to	O
be	O

and	O
many	O

have	O

I	O
first	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
West	PNM

At	O
that	O
time	O
how	O
barbarous	O
were	O
the	O
poor	O
Florida	O
Indians	O
accounted	O
which	O
now	O
we	O
find	O
to	O
be	O
civil	O
enough	O
?	O

What	O
strange	O
stories	O
have	O
we	O
heard	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
whose	O
islands	O
were	O
called	O
the	O
Isles	O
of	O

Yet	O
we	O
find	O
that	O
they	O
do	O
trade	O
very	O
civilly	O
with	O
the	O
French	O
and	O
Spaniards	O
;	O
and	O
have	O
done	O
so	O
with	O
us	O

I	O
do	O
own	O
that	O
they	O
have	O
formerly	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
destroy	O
our	O
plantations	O
at	O
Barbados	PNM
,	O
and	O
have	O
since	O
hindered	O
us	O
from	O
settling	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
Santa	PNM
Loca	PNM
by	O
destroying	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
colonies	O
successively	O
of	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
settled	O
there	O
;	O
and	O
even	O
the	O
island	O
Tobago	O
has	O
been	O
often	O
annoyed	O
and	O
ravaged	O
by	O
them	O
when	O
settled	O
by	O
the	O
Dutch	O
,	O
and	O
still	O
lies	O
waste	O
-LRB-	O
though	O
a	O
delicate	O
fruitful	O
island	O
-RRB-	O
as	O
being	O
too	O
near	O
the	O
Caribbees	O
on	O
the	O
continent	O
,	O
who	O
visit	O
it	O
every	O
year	O

But	O
this	O
was	O
to	O
preserve	O
their	O
own	O
right	O
by	O
endeavouring	O
to	O
keep	O
out	O
any	O
that	O
would	O
settle	O
themselves	O
on	O
those	O
islands	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
planted	O
themselves	O
;	O
yet	O
even	O
these	O
people	O
would	O
not	O
hurt	O
a	O
single	O
person	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
told	O
by	O
some	O
that	O
have	O
been	O
prisoners	O
among	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
could	O
instance	O
also	O
in	O
the	O
Indians	O
of	O
Boca	PNM
Toro	PNM
and	O
Boca	PNM
Drago	PNM
,	O
and	O
many	O
other	O
places	O
where	O
they	O
do	O
live	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
wild	O
and	O
savage	O
:	O
yet	O
there	O
they	O
have	O
been	O
familiar	O
with	O
privateers	O
,	O
but	O
by	O
abuses	O
have	O
withdrawn	O
their	O
friendship	O
again	O
.	O

As	O
for	O
these	O
Nicobar	O
people	O
I	O
found	O
them	O
affable	O
enough	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
fear	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
much	O
care	O
whether	O
I	O
had	O
gotten	O
any	O
more	O
company	O
or	O
no	O
.	O

But	O
however	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
well	O
satisfied	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
rather	O
because	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
men	O
enough	O
to	O
row	O
ourselves	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
Sumatra	PNM
;	O
and	O
accordingly	O
we	O
presently	O
consulted	O
how	O
to	O
purchase	O
a	O
canoa	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
fine	O
clear	O
moonlight	O
night	O
in	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
left	O
ashore	O
.	O

Therefore	O
we	O
walked	O
on	O
the	O
sandy	O
bay	O
to	O
watch	O
when	O
the	O
ship	O
would	O
weigh	O
and	O
be	O
gone	O
,	O
not	O
thinking	O
ourselves	O
secure	O
in	O
our	O
new-gotten	O
liberty	O
till	O
then	O
.	O

About	O
eleven	O
or	O
twelve	O
a	O
clock	O
we	O
saw	O
her	O
under	O
sail	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
returned	O
to	O
our	O
chamber	O
and	O
so	O
to	O
sleep	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
6th	O
of	O
May	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
be	O
times	O
our	O
landlord	O
with	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
of	O
his	O
friends	O
came	O
to	O
see	O
his	O
new	O
guests	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
somewhat	O
surprised	O
to	O
see	O
so	O
many	O
of	O
us	O
for	O
he	O
knew	O
of	O
no	O
more	O
but	O
myself	O
.	O

Yet	O
he	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
well	O
pleased	O
and	O
entertained	O
us	O
with	O
a	O
large	O
calabash	O
of	O
toddy	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
brought	O
with	O
him	O
.	O

Before	O
he	O
went	O
away	O
again	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
wheresoever	O
we	O
came	O
they	O
left	O
their	O
houses	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
whether	O
out	O
of	O
fear	O
or	O
superstition	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
-RRB-	O
we	O
bought	O
a	O
canoa	O
of	O
him	O
for	O
an	O
axe	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
did	O
presently	O
put	O
our	O
chests	O
and	O
clothes	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
designing	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
and	O
lie	O
there	O
till	O
the	O
monsoon	O
shifted	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
expected	O
every	O
day	O
.	O

When	O
our	O
things	O
were	O
stowed	O
away	O
we	O
with	O
the	O
Achinese	O
entered	O
with	O
joy	O
into	O
our	O
new	O
frigate	O
and	O
launched	O
off	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
no	O
sooner	O
off	O
but	O
our	O
canoa	O
overset	O
,	O
bottom	O
upwards	O
.	O

We	O
preserved	O
our	O
lives	O
well	O
enough	O
by	O
swimming	O
and	O
dragged	O
also	O
our	O
chests	O
and	O
clothes	O
ashore	O
;	O
but	O
all	O
our	O
things	O
were	O
wet	O

I	O
had	O
nothing	O
of	O
value	O
but	O
my	O
journal	O
and	O
some	O
draughts	O
of	O
land	O
of	O
my	O
own	O
taking	O
which	O
I	O
much	O
prized	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
hitherto	O
carefully	O
preserved	O

Mr.	O
Hall	O
had	O
also	O
such	O
another	O
cargo	O
of	O
books	O
and	O

which	O
were	O
now	O
like	O
to	O
perish	O

But	O
we	O
presently	O
opened	O
our	O
chests	O
and	O
took	O
out	O
our	O
books	O
which	O
,	O

some	O
of	O
our	O
draughts	O
that	O
lay	O

We	O
lay	O
here	O
afterwards	O
three	O

dry	O
our	O

a	O

made	O

The	O
canoa	O
being	O
now	O
very	O
well	O
fixed	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
books	O
and	O
clothes	O
dry	O
,	O
we	O
launched	O
out	O
a	O
second	O
time	O
and	O
rowed	O
towards	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
leaving	O
many	O
islands	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
of	O
us	O

The	O
Indians	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
accompanied	O
us	O
with	O
eight	O
or	O
ten	O
Canoas	O
against	O
our	O
desire	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
thought	O
that	O
these	O
men	O
would	O
make	O
provision	O
dearer	O
at	O
that	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
we	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
by	O
giving	O
an	O
account	O
what	O

we	O
gave	O
for	O
it	O
at	O
the	O
place	O
from	O
whence	O
we	O
came	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
owing	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O

being	O
there	O
;	O
for	O
the	O

Therefore	O
to	O

with	O

Mr.	O
Hall	O
scared	O
one	O
canoa	O
's	O
crew	O
by	O
firing	O
a	O
shot	O
over	O
them	O
.	O

They	O
all	O
leapt	O
overboard	O
and	O
cried	O
out	O
but	O
,	O
seeing	O
us	O
row	O
away	O
,	O
they	O
got	O
into	O
their	O
canoa	O
again	O
and	O
came	O
after	O
us	O
.	O

The	O
firing	O
of	O
that	O
gun	O
made	O
all	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
to	O
be	O
our	O
enemies	O
.	O

For	O
presently	O
after	O
this	O
we	O
put	O
ashore	O
at	O
a	O
bay	O
where	O
were	O
four	O
houses	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
Canoas	O
:	O
but	O
they	O
all	O
went	O
away	O
and	O
came	O
near	O
us	O
no	O
more	O
for	O
several	O
days	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
then	O
a	O
great	O
loaf	O
of	O
melory	O
which	O
was	O
our	O
constant	O
food	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
mind	O
to	O
coconuts	O
or	O
toddy	O
our	O
Malayans	O
of	O
Achin	O
would	O
climb	O
the	O
trees	O
and	O
fetch	O
as	O
many	O
nuts	O
as	O
we	O
would	O
have	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
good	O
pot	O
of	O
toddy	O
every	O
morning	O
.	O

Thus	O
we	O
lived	O
till	O
our	O
melory	O
was	O
almost	O
spent	O
;	O
being	O
still	O
in	O
hopes	O
that	O
the	O
natives	O
would	O
come	O
to	O
us	O
and	O
sell	O
it	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
formerly	O
done	O
.	O

But	O
they	O
came	O
not	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
nay	O
they	O
opposed	O
us	O
wherever	O
we	O
came	O
and	O
,	O
often	O
shaking	O
their	O
lances	O
at	O
us	O
,	O
made	O
all	O
the	O
show	O
of	O
hatred	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
invent	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
when	O
we	O
saw	O
that	O
they	O
stood	O
in	O
opposition	O
to	O
us	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
use	O
force	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
food	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
it	O
other	O
ways	O
.	O

With	O
this	O
resolution	O
we	O
went	O
into	O
our	O
canoa	O
to	O
a	O
small	O
bay	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
smooth	O
water	O
there	O
and	O
good	O
landing	O
;	O
but	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
being	O
yet	O
on	O
the	O
quarter	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
land	O
without	O
jeopardy	O
of	O
oversetting	O
our	O
canoa	O
and	O
wetting	O
our	O
arms	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
must	O
have	O
lain	O
at	O
the	O
mercy	O
of	O
our	O
enemies	O
who	O
stood	O
2	O
or	O
300	O
men	O
in	O
every	O
bay	O
where	O
they	O
saw	O
us	O
coming	O
to	O
keep	O
us	O
off	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
set	O
out	O
we	O
rowed	O
directly	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
end	O
and	O
presently	O
were	O
followed	O
by	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
of	O
their	O
Canoas	O
.	O

They	O
keeping	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
rowed	O
away	O
faster	O
than	O
we	O
did	O
and	O
got	O
to	O
the	O
bay	O
before	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
there	O
,	O
with	O
about	O
20	O
more	O
Canoas	O
full	O
of	O
men	O
,	O
they	O
all	O
landed	O
and	O
stood	O
to	O
hinder	O
us	O
from	O
landing	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
rowed	O
in	O
within	O
a	O
hundred	O
yards	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

Then	O
we	O
lay	O
still	O
and	O
I	O
took	O
my	O
gun	O
and	O
presented	O
at	O
them	O
;	O
at	O
which	O
they	O
all	O
fell	O
down	O
flat	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
turned	O
myself	O
about	O
and	O
,	O
to	O
show	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
intend	O
to	O
harm	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
fired	O
my	O
gun	O
off	O
towards	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
see	O
the	O
shot	O
graze	O
on	O
the	O
water	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
my	O
gun	O
was	O
loaded	O
again	O
we	O
rowed	O
gently	O
in	O
;	O
at	O
which	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
withdrew	O
.	O

The	O
rest	O
standing	O
up	O
did	O
still	O
cut	O
and	O
hew	O
the	O
air	O
,	O
making	O
signs	O
of	O
their	O
hatred	O
;	O
till	O
I	O
once	O
more	O
frightened	O
them	O
with	O
my	O
gun	O
and	O
discharged	O
it	O
as	O
before	O
.	O

Then	O
more	O
of	O
them	O
sneaked	O
away	O
,	O
leaving	O
only	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
men	O
on	O
the	O
bay	O
.	O

Then	O
we	O
rowed	O
in	O
again	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Hall	O
,	O
taking	O
his	O
sword	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
,	O
leapt	O
ashore	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
stood	O
ready	O
with	O
my	O
gun	O
to	O
fire	O
at	O
the	O
Indians	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
injured	O
him	O
:	O
but	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
stir	O
till	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
them	O
and	O
saluted	O
them	O
.	O

He	O
shook	O
them	O
by	O
the	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
such	O
signs	O
of	O
friendship	O
as	O
he	O
made	O
the	O
peace	O
was	O
concluded	O
,	O
ratified	O
,	O
and	O
confirmed	O
by	O
all	O
that	O
were	O
present	O
:	O
and	O
others	O
that	O
were	O
gone	O
were	O
again	O
called	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
all	O
very	O
joyfully	O
accepted	O
of	O
a	O
peace	O
.	O

This	O
became	O
universal	O
over	O
all	O
the	O
island	O
to	O
the	O
great	O
joy	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
no	O
ringing	O
of	O
bells	O
nor	O
bonfires	O
made	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
custom	O
here	O
;	O
but	O
gladness	O
appeared	O
in	O
their	O
countenances	O
,	O
for	O
now	O
they	O
could	O
go	O
out	O
and	O
fish	O
again	O
without	O
fear	O
of	O
being	O
taken	O
.	O

This	O
peace	O
was	O
not	O
more	O
welcome	O
to	O
them	O
than	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
for	O
now	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
brought	O
their	O
melory	O
again	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
which	O
we	O
bought	O
for	O
old	O
rags	O
and	O
small	O
strips	O
of	O
cloth	O
about	O
as	O
broad	O
as	O
the	O
palm	O
of	O
one	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
see	O
above	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
hens	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
have	O
but	O
few	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

At	O
some	O
places	O
we	O
saw	O
some	O
small	O
hogs	O
which	O
we	O
could	O
have	O
bought	O
of	O
them	O
reasonably	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
offend	O
our	O
Achinese	O
friends	O
who	O
were	O
Mohammedans	O
.	O

We	O
stayed	O
here	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
and	O
then	O
rowed	O
toward	O
the	O
south	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
keeping	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
kindly	O
received	O
by	O
the	O
natives	O
wherever	O
we	O
came	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
arrived	O
at	O
the	O
south	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
we	O
fitted	O
ourselves	O
with	O
melory	O
and	O
water	O
.	O

We	O
bought	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
loaves	O
of	O
melory	O
and	O
about	O
twelve	O
large	O
coconut-shells	O
that	O
had	O
all	O
the	O
kernel	O
taken	O
out	O
,	O
yet	O
were	O
preserved	O
whole	O
,	O
except	O
only	O
a	O
small	O
hole	O
at	O
one	O
end	O
;	O
and	O
all	O
these	O
held	O
for	O
us	O
about	O
three	O
gallons	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
of	O
water	O
.	O

We	O
bought	O
also	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
bamboos	O
that	O
held	O
about	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
gallons	O
more	O
:	O
this	O
was	O
our	O
sea-store	O

We	O
now	O
designed	O
to	O
go	O
for	O

about	O
40	O

We	O
only	O
waited	O
for	O
the	O
western	O
monsoon	O

which	O
we	O
had	O
expected	O
a	O
great	O

it	O
seemed	O
to	O

,	O
who	O
were	O
born	O
at	O
Achin	PNM

and	O
the	O
mongrel	O
Portuguese	O
.	O

Our	O
vessel	O
,	O
the	O
Nicobar	O
canoa	O
,	O
was	O
not	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O
nor	O
of	O
the	O
least	O
size	O
:	O
she	O
was	O
much	O
about	O
the	O
burden	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
London	O
wherries	O
below	O
bridge	O
,	O
and	O
built	O
sharp	O
at	O
both	O
ends	O
like	O
the	O
fore	O
part	O
of	O
a	O
wherry	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
deeper	O
than	O
a	O
wherry	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
so	O
broad	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
so	O
thin	O
and	O
light	O
that	O
when	O
empty	O
four	O
men	O
could	O
launch	O
her	O
or	O
haul	O
her	O
ashore	O
on	O
a	O
sandy	O
bay	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
good	O
substantial	O
mast	O
and	O
a	O
mat	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
good	O
outlayers	O
lashed	O
very	O
fast	O
and	O
firm	O
on	O
each	O
side	O
the	O
vessel	O
,	O
being	O
made	O
of	O
strong	O
poles	O
.	O

So	O
that	O
while	O
these	O
continued	O
firm	O
the	O
vessel	O
could	O
not	O
overset	O
which	O
she	O
should	O
easily	O
have	O
done	O
without	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
them	O
too	O
had	O
they	O
not	O
been	O
made	O
very	O
strong	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
therefore	O
much	O
beholden	O
to	O
our	O
Achinese	O
companions	O
for	O
this	O
contrivance	O
.	O

These	O
men	O
were	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
so	O
sensible	O
of	O
the	O
danger	O
as	O
Mr.	O
Hall	O
and	O
myself	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
all	O
confided	O
so	O
much	O
in	O
us	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
scruple	O
anything	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
approve	O
of	O
.	O

Neither	O
was	O
Mr.	O
Hall	O
so	O
well	O
provided	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
,	O
for	O
before	O
we	O
left	O
the	O
ship	O
I	O
had	O
purposely	O
consulted	O
our	O
chart	O
of	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
-LRB-	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
but	O
one	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
-RRB-	O
and	O
out	O
of	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
written	O
in	O
my	O
pocket-book	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
bearing	O
and	O
distance	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
Malacca	PNM
coast	O
and	O
that	O
of	O
Sumatra	PNM
,	O
Pegu	O
,	O
and	O
Siam	O
,	O
and	O
also	O
brought	O
away	O
with	O
me	O
a	O
pocket-compass	O
for	O
my	O
direction	O
in	O
any	O
enterprise	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
undertake	O
.	O

The	O
weather	O
at	O
our	O
setting	O
out	O
was	O
very	O
fair	O
,	O
clear	O
and	O
hot	O
.	O

The	O
wind	O
was	O
still	O
at	O
south-east	O
,	O
a	O
very	O
small	O
breeze	O
just	O
fanning	O
the	O
air	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
clouds	O
were	O
moving	O
gently	O
from	O
west	O
to	O
east	O
,	O
which	O
gave	O
us	O
hopes	O
that	O
the	O
winds	O
were	O
either	O
at	O
west	O
already	O
abroad	O
at	O
sea	O
,	O
or	O
would	O
be	O
so	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
short	O
time	O
.	O

We	O
took	O
this	O
opportunity	O
of	O
fair	O
weather	O
,	O
being	O
in	O
hopes	O
to	O
accomplish	O
our	O
voyage	O
to	O
Achin	PNM
before	O
the	O
western	O
monsoon	O
was	O
set	O
in	O
strong	O
,	O
knowing	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
very	O
blustering	O
weather	O
after	O
this	O
fair	O
weather	O
,	O
especially	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
coming	O
of	O
the	O
western	O
monsoon	O
.	O

We	O
rowed	O
therefore	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
,	O
supposing	O
that	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
clear	O
from	O
the	O
island	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
a	O
true	O
wind	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
call	O
it	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
land	O
hauls	O
the	O
wind	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
often	O
find	O
the	O
wind	O
at	O
sea	O
different	O
from	O
what	O
it	O
is	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

We	O
rowed	O
with	O
four	O
oars	O
taking	O
our	O
turns	O
:	O
Mr.	O
Hall	O
and	O
I	O
steered	O
also	O
by	O
turns	O
,	O
for	O
none	O
of	O
the	O
rest	O
were	O
capable	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

We	O
rowed	O
the	O
first	O
afternoon	O
and	O
the	O
night	O
ensuing	O
about	O
twelve	O
leagues	O
by	O
my	O
judgment	O
.	O

Our	O
course	O
was	O
south-south-east	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
16th	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
sun	O
was	O
an	O
hour	O
high	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
island	O
from	O
whence	O
we	O
came	O
bearing	O
N.	O
W.	O
by	O
north	O
.	O

Therefore	O
I	O
found	O
we	O
had	O
gone	O
a	O
point	O
more	O
to	O
the	O
east	O
than	O
I	O
intended	O
for	O
which	O
reason	O
we	O
steered	O
south	O
by	O
east	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
at	O
4	O
a	O
clock	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
gentle	O
breeze	O
at	O
west-south-west	O
which	O
continued	O
so	O
till	O
nine	O
,	O
all	O
which	O
time	O
we	O
laid	O
down	O
our	O
oars	O
and	O
steered	O
away	O
south-south-east	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
then	O
at	O
the	O
helm	O
and	O
I	O
found	O
by	O
the	O
rippling	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
strong	O
current	O
against	O
us	O
.	O

It	O
made	O
a	O
great	O
noise	O
that	O
might	O
be	O
heard	O
near	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
.	O

At	O
9	O
a	O
clock	O
it	O
fell	O
calm	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
continued	O
till	O
ten	O
.	O

Then	O
the	O
wind	O
sprang	O
up	O
again	O
and	O
blew	O
a	O
fresh	O
breeze	O
all	O
night	O
.	O

The	O
17th	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
we	O
looked	O
out	O
for	O
the	O
island	O
Sumatra	PNM
,	O
supposing	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
within	O
20	O
leagues	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
rowed	O
and	O
sailed	O
by	O
our	O
reckoning	O
24	O
leagues	O
from	O
Nicobar	PNM
Island	PNM
;	O
and	O
the	O
distance	O
from	O
Nicobar	PNM
to	O
Achin	PNM
is	O
about	O
40	O
leagues	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
looked	O
in	O
vain	O
for	O
the	O
island	O
Sumatra	PNM
;	O
for	O
,	O
turning	O
ourselves	O
about	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
to	O
our	O
grief	O
Nicobar	PNM
Island	PNM
lying	O
west-north-west	O
and	O
not	O
above	O
eight	O
leagues	O
distant	O
.	O

By	O
this	O
it	O
was	O
visible	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
met	O
a	O
very	O
strong	O
current	O
against	O
us	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
wind	O
freshened	O
on	O
us	O
and	O
we	O
made	O
the	O
best	O
use	O
of	O
it	O
while	O
the	O
weather	O
continued	O
fair	O
.	O

At	O
noon	O
we	O
had	O
an	O
observation	O
of	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
my	O
latitude	O
was	O
6	O
degrees	O
55	O
minutes	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Hall	O
's	O
was	O
7	O
degrees	O
north	O
.	O

The	O
18th	O
day	O
the	O
wind	O
freshened	O
on	O
us	O
again	O
and	O
the	O
sky	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
clouded	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
indifferent	O
clear	O
till	O
noon	O
and	O
we	O
thought	O
to	O
have	O
had	O
an	O
observation	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
were	O
hindered	O
by	O
the	O
clouds	O
that	O
covered	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
the	O
sun	O
when	O
it	O
came	O
on	O
the	O
meridian	O
.	O

This	O
often	O
happens	O
that	O
we	O
are	O
disappointed	O
of	O
making	O
observations	O
by	O
the	O
sun	O
's	O
being	O
clouded	O
at	O
noon	O
though	O
it	O
shines	O
clear	O
both	O
before	O
and	O
after	O
,	O
especially	O
in	O
places	O
near	O
the	O
sun	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
obscuring	O
of	O
the	O
sun	O
at	O
noon	O
is	O
commonly	O
sudden	O
and	O
unexpected	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
about	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
or	O
more	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
then	O
also	O
a	O
very	O
ill	O
presage	O
by	O
a	O
great	O
circle	O
about	O
the	O
sun	O
-LRB-	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
times	O
the	O
diameter	O
of	O
it	O
-RRB-	O
which	O
seldom	O
appears	O
but	O
storms	O
of	O
wind	O
or	O
much	O
rain	O
ensue	O
.	O

Such	O
circles	O
about	O
the	O
moon	O
are	O
more	O
frequent	O
but	O
of	O
less	O
import	O
.	O

We	O
do	O
commonly	O
take	O
great	O
notice	O
of	O
these	O
that	O
are	O
about	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
observing	O
if	O
there	O
be	O
any	O
breach	O
in	O
the	O
circle	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
what	O
quarter	O
the	O
breach	O
is	O
;	O
for	O
from	O
thence	O
we	O
commonly	O
find	O
the	O
greatest	O
stress	O
of	O
the	O
wind	O
will	O
come	O
.	O

I	O
must	O
confess	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
anxious	O
at	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
this	O
circle	O
and	O
wished	O
heartily	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
near	O
some	O
land	O
.	O

Yet	O
I	O
showed	O
no	O
sign	O
of	O
it	O
to	O
discourage	O
any	O
consorts	O
,	O
but	O
made	O
a	O
virtue	O
of	O
necessity	O
and	O
put	O
a	O
good	O
countenance	O
on	O
the	O
matter	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
Mr.	O
Hall	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
wind	O
became	O
too	O
strong	O
and	O
violent	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
feared	O
it	O
would	O
,	O
it	O
being	O
even	O
then	O
very	O
strong	O
,	O
we	O
must	O
of	O
necessity	O
steer	O
away	O
before	O
the	O
wind	O
and	O
sea	O
till	O
better	O
weather	O
presented	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
as	O
the	O
winds	O
were	O
now	O
we	O
should	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
about	O
twenty	O
leagues	O
to	O
Achin	PNM
,	O
be	O
driven	O
sixty	O
or	O
seventy	O
leagues	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Cudda	PNM
or	O
Queda	PNM
,	O
a	O
kingdom	O
and	O
town	O
and	O
harbour	O
of	O
trade	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Malacca	PNM
.	O

The	O
winds	O
therefore	O
bearing	O
very	O
hard	O
we	O
rolled	O
up	O
the	O
foot	O
of	O
our	O
sail	O
on	O
a	O
pole	O
fastened	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
settled	O
our	O
yard	O
within	O
three	O
foot	O
of	O
the	O
canoa	O
sides	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
now	O
but	O
a	O
small	O
sail	O
;	O
yet	O
it	O
was	O
still	O
too	O
big	O
considering	O
the	O
wind	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
wind	O
being	O
on	O
our	O
broadside	O
pressed	O
her	O
down	O
very	O
much	O
,	O
though	O
supported	O
by	O
her	O
outlayers	O
;	O
insomuch	O
that	O
the	O
poles	O
of	O
the	O
outlayers	O
going	O
from	O
the	O
sides	O
of	O
their	O
vessel	O
bent	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
break	O
;	O
and	O
should	O
they	O
have	O
broken	O
our	O
overturning	O
and	O
perishing	O
had	O
been	O
inevitable	O
.	O

Besides	O
the	O
sea	O
increasing	O
would	O
soon	O
have	O
filled	O
the	O
vessel	O
this	O
way	O
.	O

Yet	O
thus	O
we	O
made	O
a	O
shift	O
to	O
bear	O
up	O
with	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
vessel	O
against	O
the	O
wind	O
for	O
a	O
while	O
:	O
but	O
the	O
wind	O
still	O
increasing	O
about	O
one	O
a	O
clock	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
we	O
put	O
away	O
right	O
before	O
wind	O
and	O
sea	O
,	O
continuing	O
to	O
run	O
thus	O
all	O
the	O
afternoon	O
and	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
night	O
ensuing	O
.	O

The	O
wind	O
continued	O
increasing	O
all	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sea	O
still	O
swelled	O
higher	O
and	O
often	O
broke	O
,	O
but	O
did	O
us	O
no	O
damage	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
ends	O
of	O
the	O
vessel	O
being	O
very	O
narrow	O
he	O
that	O
steered	O
received	O
and	O
broke	O
the	O
sea	O
on	O
his	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
kept	O
it	O
from	O
coming	O
in	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
to	O
endanger	O
the	O
vessel	O
:	O
though	O
much	O
water	O
would	O
come	O
in	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
keep	O
heaving	O
out	O
continually	O
.	O

And	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
we	O
saw	O
it	O
was	O
well	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
altered	O
our	O
course	O
,	O
every	O
wave	O
would	O
else	O
have	O
filled	O
and	O
sunk	O
us	O
,	O
taking	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
vessel	O
:	O
and	O
though	O
our	O
outlayers	O
were	O
well	O
lashed	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
canoa	O
's	O
bottom	O
with	O
rattans	O
,	O
yet	O
they	O
must	O
probably	O
have	O
yielded	O
to	O
such	O
a	O
sea	O
as	O
this	O
;	O
when	O
even	O
before	O
they	O
were	O
plunged	O
under	O
water	O
and	O
bent	O
like	O
twigs	O

The	O
evening	O
of	O
this	O
18th	O
day	O
was	O
very	O
dismal	O
.	O

The	O
sky	O
looked	O
very	O
black	O
,	O
being	O
covered	O
with	O
dark	O
clouds	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
blew	O
hard	O
and	O
the	O
seas	O
ran	O
high	O

The	O
sea	O
was	O
already	O
roaring	O
in	O
a	O
white	O
foam	O
about	O
us	O
;	O
a	O
dark	O
night	O
coming	O
on	O
and	O
no	O
land	O
in	O
sight	O
to	O
shelter	O
us	O

and	O
our	O
little	O
ark	O
in	O
danger	O
to	O
be	O
swallowed	O
by	O
every	O

and	O
,	O
what	O
was	O
worst	O
of	O
all	O

none	O

The	O
reader	O
may	O
better	O
guess	O
than	O
I	O
can	O
express	O
the	O
confusion	O
that	O
we	O
were	O

,	O
some	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
have	O
already	O
related	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
worst	O
of	O
them	O
all	O
was	O
but	O
a	O
play-game	O
in	O
comparison	O
with	O
this	O
.	O

I	O
must	O
confess	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
great	O
conflicts	O
of	O
mind	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
.	O

Other	O
dangers	O
came	O
not	O
upon	O
me	O
with	O
such	O
a	O
leisurely	O
and	O
dreadful	O
solemnity	O
.	O

A	O
sudden	O
skirmish	O
or	O
engagement	O
or	O
so	O
was	O
nothing	O
when	O
one	O
's	O
blood	O
was	O
up	O
and	O
pushed	O
forwards	O
with	O
eager	O
expectations	O
.	O

But	O
here	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
lingering	O
view	O
of	O
approaching	O
death	O
and	O
little	O
or	O
no	O
hopes	O
of	O
escaping	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
must	O
confess	O
that	O
my	O
courage	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
hitherto	O
kept	O
up	O
,	O
failed	O
me	O
here	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
made	O
very	O
sad	O
reflections	O
on	O
my	O
former	O
life	O
,	O
and	O
looked	O
back	O
with	O
horror	O
and	O
detestation	O
on	O
actions	O
which	O
before	O
I	O
disliked	O
but	O
now	O
I	O
trembled	O
at	O
the	O
remembrance	O
of	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
long	O
before	O
this	O
repented	O
me	O
of	O
that	O
roving	O
course	O
of	O
life	O
but	O
never	O
with	O
such	O
concern	O
as	O
now	O
.	O

I	O
did	O
also	O
call	O
to	O
mind	O
the	O
many	O
miraculous	O
acts	O
of	O
God	O
's	O
providence	O
towards	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
whole	O
course	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
kind	O
I	O
believe	O
few	O
men	O
have	O
met	O
with	O
the	O
like	O
.	O

For	O
all	O
these	O
I	O
returned	O
thanks	O
in	O
a	O
peculiar	O
manner	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
once	O
more	O
desired	O
God	O
's	O
assistance	O
,	O
and	O
composed	O
my	O
mind	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
in	O
the	O

it	O

Mr.	O
Hall	O
and	O
I	O
took	O
turns	O

and	O
the	O
rest	O
took	O
turns	O
to	O
heave	O
out	O
the	O

and	O
thus	O
we	O
provided	O
to	O
spend	O
the	O
most	O
doleful	O
night	O
I	O
ever	O
was	O
in	O
.	O

About	O
ten	O
a	O
clock	O
it	O
began	O
to	O
thunder	O
,	O
lightning	O
,	O
and	O
rain	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
rain	O
was	O
very	O
welcome	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
having	O
drunk	O
up	O
all	O
the	O
water	O
we	O
brought	O
from	O
the	O
island	O

The	O
wind	O
at	O
first	O
blew	O
harder	O
than	O
before	O
,	O
but	O
within	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
it	O
abated	O
and	O
became	O
more	O
moderate	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
sea	O
also	O
assuaged	O
of	O
its	O
fury	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
by	O
a	O
lighted	O
match	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
kept	O
a	O
piece	O
burning	O
on	O
purpose	O
,	O
we	O
looked	O
on	O
our	O
compass	O
to	O
see	O
how	O
we	O
steered	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
our	O
course	O
to	O
be	O
still	O
east	O

We	O
had	O
no	O
occasion	O
to	O
look	O
on	O
the	O
compass	O
before	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
steered	O
right	O
before	O
the	O
wind	O
,	O
which	O
if	O
it	O
shifted	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
obliged	O
to	O
have	O
altered	O
our	O
course	O
accordingly	O
.	O

But	O
now	O
it	O
being	O
abated	O
we	O
found	O
our	O
vessel	O
lively	O
enough	O
with	O
that	O
small	O
sail	O
which	O
was	O
then	O
aboard	O
to	O
haul	O
to	O
our	O
former	O
course	O
south-south-east	O

which	O
accordingly	O
we	O
did	O

being	O
now	O
in	O

again	O
to	O

the	O

But	O
about	O
two	O
a	O
clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
of	O
the	O
19th	O
day	O
we	O
had	O
another	O
gust	O
of	O
wind	O
with	O
much	O
thunder	O
,	O
lightning	O
,	O
and	O
rain	O
,	O
which	O
lasted	O
till	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
obliged	O
us	O
to	O
put	O
before	O
the	O
wind	O
again	O
,	O
steering	O
thus	O
for	O
several	O
hours	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
very	O
dark	O
and	O
the	O
hard	O
rain	O
soaked	O
us	O
so	O
thoroughly	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
one	O
dry	O
thread	O
about	O
us	O
.	O

The	O
rain	O
chilled	O
us	O
extremely	O
;	O
for	O
any	O
fresh	O
water	O
is	O
much	O
colder	O
than	O
that	O
of	O
the	O

For	O
even	O
in	O
the	O

the	O

and	O
in	O
the	O

the	O

is	O
cold	O
and	O
unwholesome	O
for	O

In	O
this	O
wet	O

we	O
spent	O
the	O
tedious	O
night	O

Never	O

on	O
a	O

more	O

the	O
dawning	O

than	O
we	O
did	O
now	O

At	O

the	O

with	O

the	O

30	O

40	O

high	O
;	O
which	O
was	O
dreadful	O
enough	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
common	O
saying	O
among	O
seamen	O
,	O
and	O
true	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
experienced	O

that	O
a	O

We	O
continued	O
our	O
course	O
still	O
east	O
before	O
wind	O
and	O

till	O
about	O
eight	O
a	O
clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
of	O
this	O
19th	O
day	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
Malayan	O
friends	O
cried	O
out	O
``	O
Pulo	O
Way	O
.	O
''	O

Mr.	O
Hall	O
and	O
Ambrose	O
and	O
I	O
thought	O
the	O
fellow	O
had	O
said	O
``	O
pull	O
away	O
,	O
''	O
an	O
expression	O
usual	O
among	O
English	O
seamen	O
when	O
they	O
are	O
rowing	O
.	O

And	O
we	O
wondered	O
what	O
he	O
meant	O
by	O
it	O
till	O
we	O
saw	O
him	O
point	O
to	O
his	O
consorts	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
looking	O
that	O
way	O
saw	O
land	O
appearing	O
like	O
an	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
our	O
Malayans	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
an	O
island	O
at	O
the	O
north-west	O
end	O
of	O
Sumatra	PNM
called	O
Way	O
;	O
for	O
Pulo	PNM
Way	O
is	O
the	O
island	O
Way	O

We	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
dropping	O
with	O
wet	O
,	O
cold	O
and	O
hungry	O
,	O
were	O
all	O
overjoyed	O
at	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
land	O
and	O
presently	O
marked	O
its	O
bearing	O
.	O

It	O
bore	O
south	O
and	O
the	O
wind	O
was	O
still	O
at	O
west	O
,	O
a	O
strong	O
gale	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
sea	O
did	O
not	O
run	O
so	O
high	O
as	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
.	O

Therefore	O
we	O
trimmed	O
our	O
small	O
sail	O
no	O
bigger	O
than	O
an	O
apron	O
and	O
steered	O
with	O
it	O
.	O

Now	O
our	O
outlayers	O
did	O
us	O
a	O
great	O
kindness	O
again	O
,	O
for	O
although	O
we	O
had	O
but	O
a	O
small	O
sail	O
yet	O
the	O
wind	O
was	O
strong	O
and	O
pressed	O
down	O
our	O
vessel	O
's	O
side	O
very	O
much	O
:	O
but	O
being	O
supported	O
by	O
the	O
outlayers	O
we	O
could	O
brook	O
it	O
well	O
enough	O
,	O
which	O
otherwise	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
done	O
.	O

About	O
noon	O
we	O
saw	O
more	O
land	O
beneath	O
the	O
supposed	O
Pulo	O
Way	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
steering	O
towards	O
it	O
,	O
before	O
night	O
we	O
saw	O
all	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Sumatra	PNM
,	O
and	O
found	O
the	O
errors	O
of	O
our	O
Achinese	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
high	O
land	O
that	O
we	O

saw	O

which	O
then	O
appeared	O

an	O

not	O

Our	O

continued	O

about	O
seven	O
a	O
clock	O
at	O
night	O

then	O
it	O
abated	O
and	O
at	O
ten	O
a	O

we	O

all	O

The	O
next	O

the	O
20th	O

our	O

The	O
Achinese	O

that	O

It	O
was	O
for	O

that	O

being	O
now	O
no	O

under	O
that	O
necessity	O
they	O
again	O
took	O
up	O
their	O
accustomed	O
nicety	O

They	O
all	O
lay	O
sick	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
their	O
sickness	O
increased	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
threatened	O
us	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
died	O
,	O
the	O
rest	O
would	O
kill	O
us	O
for	O
having	O
brought	O
them	O
this	O
voyage	O
;	O
yet	O
I	O
question	O
whether	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
attempted	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
country	O
people	O
have	O
suffered	O
it	O

We	O
made	O
a	O
shift	O
to	O
dress	O
our	O
own	O
food	O
,	O
for	O
none	O
of	O
these	O
people	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
kind	O
in	O
giving	O
us	O
anything	O
that	O
we	O
wanted	O
,	O
would	O
yet	O
come	O
near	O
us	O
to	O
assist	O
us	O
in	O
dressing	O
our	O
victuals	O
:	O
nay	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
touch	O
anything	O
that	O
we	O
used	O

We	O
had	O
all	O
fevers	O
and	O
therefore	O
took	O
turns	O
to	O
dress	O
victuals	O
according	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
strength	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
,	O
or	O
stomachs	O
to	O
eat	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
my	O
fever	O
to	O
increase	O
and	O
my	O
head	O
so	O
distempered	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
scarce	O
stand	O
,	O
therefore	O
I	O
whetted	O
and	O
sharpened	O
my	O
penknife	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
let	O
myself	O
blood	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
for	O
my	O
knife	O
was	O
too	O
blunt	O
.	O

We	O
stayed	O
here	O
ten	O
or	O
twelve	O
days	O
in	O
hopes	O
to	O
recover	O
our	O
health	O
but	O
,	O
finding	O
no	O
amendment	O
,	O
we	O
desired	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Achin	PNM
.	O

But	O
we	O
were	O
delayed	O
by	O
the	O
natives	O
who	O
had	O
a	O
desire	O
to	O
have	O
kept	O
Mr.	O
Hall	O

myself	O
to	O
sail	O
in	O
their	O
vessels	O
to	O
Malacca	PNM

Cudda	PNM
,	O
or	O
to	O
other	O
places	O
whither	O
they	O
trade	O

But	O
,	O
finding	O
us	O
more	O
desirous	O
to	O
be	O
with	O
our	O
countrymen	O
in	O
our	O
factory	O
at	O
Achin	PNM
,	O
they	O
provided	O
a	O
large	O

to	O

us	O
thither	O
,	O
we	O
not	O

our	O

Besides	O
,	O
before	O
this	O
three	O
of	O
our	O
Malayan	O
comrades	O
were	O
gone	O
very	O
sick	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
only	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
and	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
remained	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
accompanying	O
us	O
to	O
Achin	PNM
and	O
they	O
both	O
as	O
sick	O
as	O
we	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
June	O
1686	O
-LSB-	O
sic	O
,	O
1688	O
-RSB-	O
when	O
we	O
left	O
Passange	PNM
Jonca	PNM

We	O
had	O
four	O
men	O
to	O
row	O
,	O
one	O
to	O
steer	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
gentleman	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
that	O
went	O
purposely	O
to	O
give	O
an	O
information	O
to	O
the	O
government	O
of	O
our	O
arrival	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
but	O
three	O
days	O
and	O
nights	O
in	O
our	O
passage	O
,	O
having	O
sea-breezes	O
by	O
day	O
and	O
land-winds	O
by	O
night	O
and	O
very	O
fair	O
weather	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
arrived	O
at	O
Achin	PNM
I	O
was	O
carried	O
before	O
the	O
shebander	O
,	O
the	O
chief	O
magistrate	O
in	O
the	O
city	O
.	O

One	O
Mr.	O
Dennis	O
Driscal	O
,	O
an	O
Irishman	O
and	O
a	O
resident	O
there	O
in	O
the	O
factory	O
which	O
our	O
East	O
India	PNM
Company	O
had	O
there	O
then	O
,	O
was	O
interpreter	O
.	O

I	O
being	O
weak	O
was	O
suffered	O
to	O
stand	O
in	O
the	O
shebander	O
's	O
presence	O
:	O
for	O
it	O
is	O
their	O
custom	O
to	O
make	O
men	O
sit	O
on	O
the	O
floor	O
as	O
they	O
do	O
,	O
cross-legged	O
like	O
tailors	O
:	O
but	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
strength	O
then	O
to	O
pluck	O
up	O
my	O
heels	O
in	O
that	O
manner	O
.	O

The	O
shebander	O
asked	O
of	O
me	O
several	O
questions	O
,	O
especially	O
how	O
we	O
durst	O
adventure	O
to	O
come	O
in	O
a	O
canoa	O
from	O
the	O
Nicobar	PNM
Islands	PNM
to	O
Sumatra	PNM
.	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
accustomed	O
to	O
hardships	O
and	O
hazards	O
therefore	O
I	O
did	O
with	O
much	O
freedom	O
undertake	O
it	O
.	O

He	O
enquired	O
also	O
concerning	O
our	O
ship	O
,	O
whence	O
she	O
came	O
,	O
etc.	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
from	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
;	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
ranged	O
about	O
the	O
Philippine	O
islands	O
,	O
etc.	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
now	O
gone	O
towards	O
Arabia	PNM
and	O
the	O
Red	O
Sea	O
.	O

The	O
Malayans	O
also	O
and	O
Portuguese	O
were	O
afterwards	O
examined	O
and	O
confirmed	O
what	O
I	O
declared	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
I	O
was	O
dismissed	O
with	O
Mr.	O
Driscal	O
,	O
who	O
then	O
lived	O
in	O
the	O
English	PNM
East	PNM
India	PNM
Company	O
's	O
factory	O
.	O

He	O
provided	O
a	O
room	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
lie	O
in	O
and	O
some	O
victuals	O
.	O

Three	O
days	O
after	O
our	O
arrival	O
here	O
our	O
Portuguese	O
died	O
of	O
a	O
fever	O
.	O

What	O
became	O
of	O
our	O
Malayans	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
:	O
Ambrose	O
lived	O
not	O
long	O
after	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Hall	O
also	O
was	O
so	O
weak	O
that	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
he	O
would	O
recover	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
the	O
best	O
;	O
but	O
still	O
very	O
sick	O
of	O
a	O
fever	O
and	O
little	O
likely	O
to	O
live	O
.	O

Therefore	O
Mr.	O
Driscal	O
and	O
some	O
other	O
Englishmen	O
persuaded	O
me	O
to	O
take	O
some	O
purging	O
physic	O
of	O
a	O
Malayan	O
doctor	O
.	O

I	O
took	O
their	O
advice	O
,	O
being	O
willing	O
to	O
get	O
ease	O
:	O
but	O
after	O
three	O
doses	O
,	O
each	O
a	O
large	O
calabash	O
of	O
nasty	O
stuff	O
,	O
finding	O
no	O
amendment	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
to	O
desist	O
from	O
more	O
physic	O
;	O
but	O
was	O
persuaded	O
to	O
take	O
one	O
dose	O
more	O
;	O
which	O
I	O
did	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
wrought	O
so	O
violently	O
that	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
ended	O
my	O
days	O
.	O

I	O
struggled	O
till	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
about	O
twenty	O
or	O
thirty	O
times	O
at	O
stool	O
:	O
but	O
,	O
it	O
working	O
so	O
quick	O
with	O
me	O
with	O
little	O
intermission	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
strength	O
being	O
almost	O
spent	O
,	O
I	O
even	O
threw	O
myself	O
down	O
once	O
for	O
all	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
above	O
sixty	O
stools	O
in	O
all	O
before	O
it	O
left	O
off	O
working	O
.	O

I	O
thought	O
my	O
Malayan	O
doctor	O
,	O
whom	O
they	O
so	O
much	O
commended	O
,	O
would	O
have	O
killed	O
me	O
outright	O
.	O

I	O
continued	O
extraordinary	O
weak	O
for	O
some	O
days	O
after	O
his	O
drenching	O
me	O
thus	O
:	O
but	O
my	O
fever	O
left	O
me	O
for	O
above	O
a	O
week	O
:	O
after	O
which	O
it	O
returned	O
upon	O
me	O
again	O
for	O
a	O
twelvemonth	O
and	O
a	O
flux	O
with	O
it	O
.	O

However	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
recovered	O
from	O
the	O
effects	O
of	O
my	O
drench	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
shift	O
to	O
go	O
abroad	O
:	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
kindly	O
invited	O
to	O
Captain	O
Bowrey	O
's	O
house	O
there	O
,	O
my	O
first	O
visit	O
was	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
who	O
had	O
a	O
ship	O
in	O
the	O
road	O
but	O
lived	O
ashore	O
.	O

This	O
gentleman	O
was	O
extraordinary	O
kind	O
to	O
us	O
all	O
,	O
particularly	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
importuned	O
me	O
to	O
go	O
his	O
boatswain	O
to	O
Persia	PNM
;	O
whither	O
he	O
was	O
bound	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
design	O
to	O
sell	O
his	O
ship	O
there	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
told	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
by	O
himself	O
.	O

From	O
thence	O
he	O
intended	O
to	O
pass	O
with	O
the	O
caravan	O
to	O
Aleppo	PNM
and	O
so	O
home	O
for	O
England	PNM
.	O

His	O
business	O
required	O
him	O
to	O
stay	O
some	O
time	O
longer	O
at	O
Achin	PNM
;	O
I	O
judge	O
to	O
sell	O
some	O
commodities	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
yet	O
disposed	O
of	O
.	O

Yet	O
he	O
chose	O
rather	O
to	O
leave	O
the	O
disposal	O
of	O
them	O
to	O
some	O
merchant	O
there	O
and	O
make	O
a	O
short	O
trip	O
to	O
the	O
Nicobar	PNM
Islands	PNM
in	O
the	O
meantime	O
,	O
and	O
on	O
his	O
return	O
to	O
take	O
in	O
his	O
effects	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
proceed	O
towards	O
Persia	PNM
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
sudden	O
resolution	O
of	O
Captain	O
Bowrey	O
's	O
,	O
presently	O
after	O
the	O
arrival	O
of	O
a	O
small	O
frigate	O
from	O
Siam	O
with	O
an	O
ambassador	O
from	O
the	O
king	O
of	O
Siam	O
to	O
the	O
queen	O
of	O
Achin	PNM
.	O

The	O
ambassador	O
was	O
a	O
Frenchman	O
by	O
nation	O
.	O

The	O
vessel	O
that	O
he	O
came	O
in	O
was	O
but	O
small	O
yet	O
very	O
well	O
manned	O
,	O
and	O
fitted	O
for	O
a	O
fight	O
.	O

Therefore	O
it	O
was	O
generally	O
supposed	O
here	O
that	O
Captain	O
Bowrey	O
was	O
afraid	O
to	O
lie	O
in	O
Achin	O
Road	O
because	O
the	O
Siamers	O
were	O
now	O
at	O
wars	O
with	O
the	O
English	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
defend	O
his	O
ship	O
if	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
attacked	O
by	O
them	O
.	O

But	O
whatever	O
made	O
him	O
think	O
of	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
Nicobar	PNM
Islands	PNM
he	O
provided	O
to	O
sail	O
;	O
and	O
took	O
me	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Hall	O
,	O
and	O
Ambrose	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
though	O
all	O
of	O
us	O
so	O
sick	O
and	O
weak	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
do	O
him	O
no	O
service	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
some	O
time	O
about	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
June	O
when	O
we	O
sailed	O
out	O
of	O
Achin	PNM
road	O
:	O
but	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
the	O
winds	O
at	O
north-west	O
with	O
turbulent	O
weather	O
which	O
forced	O
us	O
back	O
again	O
in	O
two	O
days	O
'	O
time	O
.	O

Yet	O
he	O
gave	O
us	O
each	O
12	O
mess	O
apiece	O
,	O
a	O
gold	O
coin	O
,	O
each	O
of	O
which	O
is	O
about	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
15	O
pence	O
English	O
.	O

So	O
he	O
gave	O
over	O
that	O
design	O
:	O
and	O
,	O
some	O
English	O
ships	O
coming	O
into	O
Achin	O
Road	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
afraid	O
of	O
the	O
Siamers	O
who	O
lay	O
there	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
he	O
again	O
invited	O
me	O
to	O
his	O
house	O
at	O
Achin	PNM
,	O
and	O
treated	O
me	O
always	O
with	O
wine	O
and	O
good	O
cheer	O
,	O
and	O
still	O
importuned	O
me	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
him	O
to	O
Persia	PNM
:	O
but	O
I	O
being	O
very	O
weak	O
,	O
and	O
fearing	O
the	O
westerly	O
winds	O
would	O
create	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
trouble	O
,	O
did	O
not	O
give	O
him	O
a	O
positive	O
answer	O
;	O
especially	O
because	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O
might	O
get	O
a	O
better	O
voyage	O
in	O
the	O
English	O
ships	O
newly	O
arrived	O
,	O
or	O
some	O
others	O
now	O
expected	O
here	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
this	O
Captain	O
Bowrey	O
who	O
sent	O
the	O
letter	O
from	O
Borneo	PNM
directed	O
to	O
the	O
chief	O
of	O
the	O
English	O
factory	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM
,	O
of	O
which	O
mention	O
is	O
made	O
in	O
Chapter	O
XIII	O
.	O

A	O
short	O
time	O
after	O
this	O
Captain	O
Welden	O
arrived	O
here	O
from	O
Fort	PNM
St.	PNM
George	PNM
in	O
a	O
ship	O
called	O
the	O
Curtana	PNM
bound	O
to	O
Tonquin	PNM
.	O

This	O
being	O
a	O
more	O
agreeable	O
voyage	O
than	O
to	O
Persia	PNM
at	O
this	O
time	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
;	O
besides	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
better	O
accommodated	O
,	O
especially	O
with	O
a	O
surgeon	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
being	O
still	O
sick	O
;	O
I	O
therefore	O
chose	O
rather	O
to	O
serve	O
Captain	O
Welden	O
than	O
Captain	O
Bowrey	O
.	O

But	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
with	O
a	O
particular	O
account	O
of	O
that	O
expedition	O
were	O
to	O
carry	O
my	O
reader	O
back	O
again	O
:	O
whom	O
,	O
having	O
brought	O
thus	O
far	O
towards	O
England	PNM
in	O
my	O
circumnavigation	O
of	O
the	O
globe	O
,	O
I	O
shall	O
not	O
weary	O
him	O
with	O
new	O
rambles	O
,	O
nor	O
so	O
much	O
swell	O
this	O
volume	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
must	O
describe	O
the	O
tour	O
I	O
made	O
in	O
those	O
remote	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
from	O
and	O
to	O
Sumatra	PNM

So	O
that	O
my	O
voyage	O
to	O
Tonquin	PNM
at	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
as	O
also	O
another	O
to	O
Malacca	PNM

1689	O
In	O
short	O
it	O
may	O
suffice	O
that	O
I	O
set	O
out	O
to	O
Tonquin	PNM
with	O
Captain	O
Welden	O
about	O
July	O
1688	O
and	O
returned	O
to	O
Achin	PNM
in	O
the	O
April	O
following	O
.	O

I	O
stayed	O
here	O
till	O
the	O
latter	O
end	O
of	O
September	O
1689	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
making	O
a	O
short	O
voyage	O
to	O
Malacca	PNM
,	O
came	O
thither	O
again	O
about	O
Christmas	O
.	O

Soon	O
after	O
that	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
Fort	PNM
St.	PNM
George	PNM
and	O
,	O
staying	O
there	O
about	O
five	O
months	O
,	O
I	O
returned	O
once	O
more	O
to	O
Sumatra	PNM
;	O
not	O
to	O
Achin	PNM
but	O
Bencoolen	O
,	O
an	O
English	O

on	O
the	O
west	O
coast	O
;	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
was	O

about	O
five	O

So	O
that	O
having	O
brought	O
my	O
reader	O
to	O
Sumatra	PNM
without	O
carrying	O
him	O
back	O
,	O
I	O
shall	O
bring	O
him	O
on	O
next	O
way	O
from	O
thence	O
to	O
England	PNM
:	O
and	O
of	O
all	O
that	O
occurred	O
between	O
my	O
first	O
setting	O
out	O
from	O
this	O
island	O
in	O
1688	O
and	O
my	O
final	O
departure	O
from	O
it	O
at	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
1691	O
,	O
I	O
shall	O
only	O
take	O
notice	O
at	O
present	O
of	O
two	O
passages	O
which	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
ought	O
not	O
to	O
omit	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
is	O
that	O
,	O
at	O
my	O
return	O
from	O
Malacca	PNM
a	O
little	O
before	O
Christmas	O
1689	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
at	O
Achin	PNM
one	O
Mr.	O
Morgan	O
who	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
ship	O
's	O
crew	O
that	O
left	O
me	O
ashore	O
at	O
Nicobar	PNM
,	O
now	O
mate	O
of	O
a	O
Danish	O
ship	O
of	O
Trangambar	PNM
;	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
town	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Coromandel	PNM
,	O
near	O
Cape	PNM
Comorin	PNM
,	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
Danes	O
:	O
and	O
,	O
receiving	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
our	O
crew	O
from	O
him	O
and	O
others	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
amiss	O
to	O
gratify	O
the	O
reader	O
's	O
curiosity	O
therewith	O
;	O
who	O
would	O
probably	O
be	O
desirous	O
to	O
know	O
the	O
success	O
of	O
those	O
ramblers	O
in	O
their	O
new-intended	O
expedition	O
towards	O
the	O
Red	O
Sea	O
.	O

And	O
withal	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
unlikely	O
that	O
these	O
papers	O
might	O
fall	O
into	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
London	O
merchants	O
who	O
were	O
concerned	O
in	O
fitting	O
out	O
that	O
ship	O
;	O
which	O
I	O
said	O
formerly	O
was	O
called	O
the	O
Cygnet	O
of	O
London	PNM
,	O
sent	O
on	O
a	O
trading	O
voyage	O
into	O
the	O
South	O
Seas	O
under	O
the	O
command	O
of	O
Captain	O
Swan	O
:	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
willing	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
particular	O
information	O
of	O
the	O
fate	O
of	O
their	O
ship	O

And	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
even	O
before	O
this	O
meeting	O
with	O
Mr.	O
Morgan	O
while	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
Tonquin	PNM
,	O
January	O
1689	O
,	O
I	O
met	O
with	O
an	O
English	O
ship	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
of	O
Tonquin	PNM
called	O
the	O
Rainbow	O
of	O
London	PNM
,	O
Captain	O

;	O
by	O
whose	O

Mr.	O
Barlow	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
returning	O
in	O
that	O
ship	O
to	O
England	PNM
,	O
I	O
sent	O
a	O
packet	O
which	O
he	O
undertook	O
to	O
deliver	O
to	O
the	O
merchants	O
,	O
owners	O
of	O
the	O
Cygnet	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
which	O
he	O
said	O
he	O
knew	O
:	O
wherein	O
I	O
gave	O
a	O
particular	O
account	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
course	O

transactions	O
of	O
their	O

from	O
the	O

it	O
in	O

it	O
there	O

to	O
its	O
leaving	O

But	O
I	O
never	O

To	O
proceed	O
therefore	O
with	O
Mr.	O

me	O
that	O

Of	O

the	O

This	O

I	O
had	O
partly	O
by	O
Mr.	O

from	O

I	O
met	O
myself	O
afterwards	O
at	O

these	O
were	O
the	O

went	O
up	O
into	O

Captain	O

having	O
thus	O

the	O

half	O
of	O

When	O
they	O
were	O
near	O

they	O
met	O
with	O
a	O
Portuguese	O
ship	O
richly	O

out	O
of	O

they	O
took	O
what	O

turned	O

it	O

about	O
April	O

there	O

his	O

where	O
they	O
were	O
much	O
admired	O
by	O
all	O
that	O

them	O

Some	O
time	O
after	O
this	O
Mr.	O
Moody	O
,	O
who	O
spoke	O
the	O
Malayan	O
language	O
very	O
well	O
and	O
was	O
a	O
person	O
very	O
capable	O
to	O
manage	O
the	O
company	O
's	O
affairs	O
,	O
was	O
ordered	O
by	O
the	O
governor	O
of	O
Fort	PNM
St.	PNM
George	PNM
to	O
prepare	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Indrapore	PNM
,	O
an	O
English	O
factory	O
on	O
the	O
west	O
coast	O
of	O
Sumatra	PNM
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
succeed	O
Mr.	O
Gibbons	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
the	O
chief	O
of	O
that	O
place	O
.	O

By	O
this	O
time	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
intimately	O
acquainted	O
with	O
Mr.	O
Moody	O
and	O
was	O
importuned	O
by	O
him	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
him	O
and	O
to	O
be	O
gunner	O
of	O
the	O
fort	O
there	O
.	O

I	O
always	O
told	O
him	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
desire	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM
Bengal	PNM
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
now	O
an	O
offer	O
to	O
go	O
thither	O
with	O
Captain	O
Metcalf	O
,	O
who	O
wanted	O
a	O
mate	O
and	O
had	O
already	O
spoke	O
to	O
me	O
.	O

Mr.	O
Moody	O
,	O
to	O
encourage	O
me	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
with	O
him	O
to	O
Indrapore	O
he	O
would	O
buy	O
a	O
small	O
vessel	O
there	O
and	O
send	O
me	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
Meangis	O
,	O
commander	O
of	O
her	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
carry	O
Prince	O
Jeoly	O
and	O
his	O
mother	O
with	O
me	O
-LRB-	O
that	O
being	O
their	O
country	O
-RRB-	O
by	O
which	O
means	O
I	O
might	O
gain	O
a	O
commerce	O
with	O
his	O
people	O
for	O
cloves	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
design	O
that	O
I	O
liked	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
I	O
consented	O
to	O
go	O
thither	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
some	O
time	O
in	O
July	O
1690	O
when	O
we	O
went	O
from	O
Fort	PNM
St.	PNM
George	PNM
in	O
a	O
small	O
ship	O
called	O
the	O
Diamond	O
,	O
Captain	O
Howel	O
commander	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
about	O
fifty	O
or	O
sixty	O
passengers	O
in	O
all	O
;	O
some	O
ordered	O
to	O
be	O
left	O
at	O
Indrapore	PNM
,	O
and	O
some	O
at	O
Bencoolen	PNM
:	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
of	O
us	O
were	O
officers	O
,	O
the	O
rest	O
soldiers	O
to	O
the	O
company	O
.	O

We	O
met	O
nothing	O
in	O
our	O
voyage	O
that	O
deserves	O
notice	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
abreast	O
of	O
Indrapore	PNM
.	O

And	O
then	O
the	O
wind	O
came	O
at	O
north-west	O
,	O
and	O
blew	O
so	O
hard	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
in	O
but	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
bear	O
away	O
to	O
Bencoolen	PNM
,	O
another	O
English	O
factory	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
coast	O
,	O
lying	O
fifty	O
or	O
sixty	O
leagues	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
of	O
Indrapore	PNM
.	O

Upon	O
our	O
arrival	O
at	O
Bencoolen	PNM
we	O
saluted	O
the	O
fort	O
and	O
were	O
welcomed	O
by	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
same	O
day	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
,	O
and	O
Captain	O
Howel	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Moody	O
with	O
the	O
other	O
merchants	O
went	O
ashore	O
and	O
were	O
all	O
kindly	O
received	O
by	O
the	O
governor	O
of	O
the	O
fort	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
two	O
days	O
before	O
I	O
went	O
ashore	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
was	O
importuned	O
by	O
the	O
governor	O
to	O
stay	O
there	O
to	O
be	O
gunner	O
of	O
this	O
fort	O
;	O
because	O
the	O
gunner	O
was	O
lately	O
dead	O
:	O
and	O
this	O
being	O
a	O
place	O
of	O
greater	O
import	O
than	O
Indrapore	O
I	O
should	O
do	O
the	O
company	O
more	O
service	O
here	O
than	O
there	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
the	O
governor	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
augment	O
my	O
salary	O
which	O
,	O
by	O
agreement	O
with	O
the	O
governor	O
of	O
Fort	PNM
St.	PNM
George	PNM
I	O
was	O
to	O
have	O
had	O
at	O
Indrapore	PNM
,	O
I	O
was	O
willing	O
to	O
serve	O
him	O
provided	O
Mr.	O
Moody	O
would	O
consent	O
to	O
it	O
.	O

As	O
to	O
my	O
salary	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
24	O
dollars	O
per	O
month	O
which	O
was	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
he	O
gave	O
to	O
the	O
old	O
gunner	O
.	O

Mr.	O
Moody	O
gave	O
no	O
answer	O
till	O
a	O
week	O
after	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
being	O
ready	O
to	O
be	O
gone	O
to	O
Indrapore	PNM
,	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
I	O
might	O
use	O
my	O
own	O
liberty	O
either	O
to	O
stay	O
here	O
or	O
go	O
with	O
him	O
to	O
Indrapore	PNM
.	O

He	O
added	O
that	O
if	O
I	O
went	O
with	O
him	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
certain	O
as	O
yet	O
to	O
perform	O
his	O
promise	O
in	O
getting	O
a	O
vessel	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Meangis	PNM
with	O
Jeoly	O
and	O
his	O
mother	O
:	O
but	O
he	O
would	O
be	O
so	O
fair	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
left	O
Madras	O
on	O
his	O
account	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
give	O
me	O
the	O
half	O
share	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
painted	O
people	O
,	O
and	O
leave	O
them	O
in	O
my	O
possession	O
and	O
at	O
my	O
disposal	O
.	O

I	O
accepted	O
of	O
the	O
offer	O
and	O
writings	O
were	O
immediately	O
drawn	O
between	O
us	O
.	O

Thus	O
it	O
was	O
that	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
have	O
this	O
painted	O
prince	O
,	O
whose	O
name	O
was	O
Jeoly	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
mother	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
born	O
on	O
a	O
small	O
island	O
called	O
Meangis	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
once	O
or	O
twice	O
mentioned	O
in	O
Chap	O
.	O

XIII	O
.	O

I	O
saw	O
the	O
island	O
twice	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
more	O
close	O
by	O
it	O
:	O
each	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
about	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
leagues	O
round	O
and	O
of	O
a	O
good	O
height	O
.	O

Jeoly	O
himself	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
they	O
all	O
three	O
abounded	O
with	O
gold	O
,	O
cloves	O
and	O
nutmegs	O
:	O
for	O
I	O
showed	O
him	O
some	O
of	O
each	O
sort	O
several	O
times	O
and	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
Malayan	O
language	O
which	O
he	O
spoke	O
indifferent	O
well	O
:	O
``	O
Meangis	O
hadda	O
madochala	O
se	O
bullawan	O
''	O
:	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
``	O
There	O
is	O
abundance	O
of	O
gold	O
at	O
Meangis	PNM
.	O
''	O

Bullawan	O
I	O
have	O
observed	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
common	O
word	O
for	O
gold	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM
;	O
but	O
whether	O
the	O
proper	O
Malayan	O
word	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
found	O
much	O
difference	O
between	O
the	O
Malayan	O
language	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
spoken	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM
and	O
the	O
language	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Malacca	PNM
and	O
Achin	PNM
.	O

When	O
I	O
showed	O
him	O
spice	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
only	O
tell	O
me	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
madochala	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
abundance	O
;	O
but	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
appear	O

the	O

a	O
thing	O
frequent	O
among	O
all	O
the	O
Indians	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
met	O
with	O
to	O
show	O
their	O
hair	O
when	O
they	O
would	O
express	O
more	O
than	O
they	O
can	O
number	O

That	O
there	O
were	O
not	O
above	O
thirty	O
men	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
and	O
about	O
one	O
hundred	O
women	O
:	O
that	O
he	O
himself	O
had	O
five	O
wives	O
and	O
eight	O
children	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
wives	O
painted	O
him	O

He	O
was	O
painted	O
all	O
down	O
the	O
breast	O
,	O
between	O
his	O
shoulders	O
behind	O
;	O
on	O
his	O
thighs	O

in	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
several	O
broad	O

round	O
his	O

I	O
can	O
not	O
liken	O
the	O
drawings	O
to	O
any	O
figure	O
of	O
animals	O
or	O
the	O
like	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
curious	O

full	O
of	O
great	O
variety	O
of	O
lines	O

flourishes	O
,	O
chequered	O
work	O

keeping	O
a	O
very	O

appearing	O
very	O
artificial	O

even	O
to	O
wonder	O
,	O
especially	O
that	O
upon	O
and	O
between	O
his	O
shoulder-blades	O

By	O
the	O
account	O
he	O
gave	O
me	O
of	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
doing	O
it	O
I	O
understood	O
that	O
the	O
painting	O
was	O
done	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
manner	O
as	O
the	O
Jerusalem	O
cross	O
is	O
made	O
in	O
men	O
's	O
arms	O
,	O
by	O
pricking	O
the	O
skin	O
and	O
rubbing	O
in	O
a	O
pigment	O
.	O

But	O
whereas	O
powder	O
is	O
used	O
in	O
making	O
the	O
Jerusalem	O
cross	O
,	O
they	O
at	O
Meangis	O
use	O
the	O
gum	O
of	O
a	O
tree	O
beaten	O
to	O
powder	O
called	O
by	O
the	O
English	O
dammer	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
used	O
instead	O
of	O
pitch	O
in	O
many	O
parts	O
of	O
India	PNM
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
and	O
women	O
on	O
the	O
island	O
were	O
thus	O
painted	O
:	O
and	O
also	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
all	O
earrings	O
made	O
of	O
gold	O
,	O
and	O
gold	O
shackles	O
about	O
their	O
legs	O
and	O
arms	O
:	O
that	O
their	O
common	O
food	O
of	O
the	O
produce	O
of	O
the	O
land	O
was	O
potatoes	O
and	O
yams	O
:	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
plenty	O
of	O
cocks	O
and	O
hens	O
but	O
no	O
other	O
tame	O
fowl	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
that	O
fish	O
-LRB-	O
of	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
lover	O
,	O
as	O
wild	O
Indians	O
generally	O
are	O
-RRB-	O
was	O
very	O
plentiful	O
about	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
Canoas	O
and	O
went	O
a-fishing	O
frequently	O
in	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
often	O
visited	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
small	O
islands	O
whose	O
inhabitants	O
spoke	O
the	O
same	O
language	O
as	O
they	O
did	O
;	O
which	O
was	O
so	O
unlike	O
the	O
Malayan	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
learnt	O
while	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
slave	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM
,	O
that	O
when	O
his	O
mother	O
and	O
he	O
were	O
talking	O
together	O
in	O
their	O
Meangian	O
tongue	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
understand	O
one	O
word	O
they	O
said	O
.	O

And	O
indeed	O
all	O
the	O
Indians	O
who	O
spoke	O
Malayan	O
,	O
who	O
are	O
the	O
trading	O
and	O
politer	O
sort	O
,	O
looked	O
on	O
these	O
Meangians	O
as	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
barbarians	O
;	O
and	O
upon	O
any	O
occasion	O
of	O
dislike	O
would	O
call	O
them	O
bobby	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
hogs	O
;	O
the	O
greatest	O
expression	O
of	O
contempt	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
,	O
especially	O
from	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
Malayans	PNM
who	O
are	O
generally	O
Mohammedans	O
;	O
and	O
yet	O
the	O
Malayans	O
everywhere	O
call	O
a	O
woman	O
babby	O
,	O
by	O
a	O
name	O
not	O
much	O
different	O
,	O
and	O
mamma	O
signifies	O
a	O
man	O
;	O
though	O
these	O
two	O
last	O
words	O
properly	O
denote	O
male	O
and	O
female	O
:	O
and	O
as	O
ejam	O
signifies	O
a	O
fowl	O
,	O
so	O
ejam	O
mamma	O
is	O
a	O
cock	O
,	O
and	O
ejam	O
babbi	O
is	O
a	O
hen	O
.	O

But	O
this	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
also	O
that	O
the	O
customs	O
of	O
those	O
other	O
isles	O
and	O
their	O
manner	O
of	O
living	O
was	O
like	O
theirs	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
the	O
only	O
people	O
with	O
whom	O
they	O
had	O
any	O
converse	O
:	O
and	O
that	O
one	O
time	O
as	O
he	O
,	O
with	O
his	O
father	O
,	O
mother	O
and	O
brother	O
,	O
with	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
men	O
more	O
,	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
other	O
islands	O
they	O
were	O
driven	O
by	O
a	O
strong	O
wind	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Mindanao	PNM
,	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
taken	O
by	O
the	O
fishermen	O
of	O
that	O
island	O
and	O
carried	O
ashore	O
and	O
sold	O
as	O
slaves	O
;	O
they	O
being	O
first	O
stripped	O
of	O
their	O
gold	O
ornaments	O
.	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
see	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
gold	O
that	O
they	O
wore	O
,	O
but	O
there	O
were	O
great	O
holes	O
in	O
their	O
ears	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
it	O
was	O
manifest	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
worn	O
some	O
ornaments	O
in	O
them	O
.	O

Jeoly	O
was	O
sold	O
to	O
one	O
Michael	O
,	O
a	O
Mindanayan	O
that	O
spoke	O
good	O
Spanish	O
,	O
and	O
commonly	O
waited	O
on	O
Raja	O
Laut	O
,	O
serving	O
him	O
as	O
our	O
interpreter	O
where	O
the	O
Raja	O
was	O
at	O
a	O
loss	O
in	O
any	O
word	O
,	O
for	O
Michael	O
understood	O
it	O
better	O
.	O

He	O
did	O
often	O
beat	O
and	O
abuse	O
his	O
painted	O
servant	O
to	O
make	O
him	O
work	O
,	O
but	O
all	O
in	O
vain	O
,	O
for	O
neither	O
fair	O
means	O
,	O
threats	O
,	O
nor	O
blows	O
would	O
make	O
him	O
work	O
as	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
him	O
.	O

Yet	O
he	O
was	O
very	O
timorous	O
and	O
could	O
not	O
endure	O
to	O
see	O
any	O
sort	O
of	O
weapons	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
often	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
arms	O
at	O
Meangis	O
,	O
they	O
having	O
no	O
enemies	O
to	O
fight	O
with	O
.	O

I	O
knew	O
this	O
Michael	O
very	O
well	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM
:	O
I	O
suppose	O
that	O
name	O
was	O
given	O
him	O
by	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
who	O
baptised	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
when	O
they	O
had	O
footing	O
at	O
that	O
island	O
:	O
but	O
at	O
the	O
departure	O
of	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
they	O
were	O
Mohammedans	O
again	O
as	O
before	O
.	O

Some	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
lay	O
at	O
this	O
Michael	O
's	O
house	O
,	O
whose	O
wife	O
and	O
daughter	O
were	O
pagallies	O
to	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
often	O
saw	O
Jeoly	O
at	O
his	O
master	O
Michael	O
's	O
house	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
have	O
him	O
so	O
long	O
after	O
he	O
remembered	O
me	O
again	O
.	O

I	O
did	O
never	O
see	O
his	O
father	O
nor	O
brother	O
,	O
nor	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
others	O
that	O
were	O
taken	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
Jeoly	O
came	O
several	O
times	O
aboard	O
our	O
ship	O
when	O
we	O
lay	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM
,	O
and	O
gladly	O
accepted	O
of	O
such	O
victuals	O
as	O
we	O
gave	O
him	O
;	O
for	O
his	O
master	O
kept	O
him	O
at	O
very	O
short	O
commons	O
.	O

Prince	O
Jeoly	O
lived	O
thus	O
a	O
slave	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM
four	O
or	O
five	O
years	O
,	O
till	O
at	O
last	O
Mr.	O
Moody	O
bought	O
him	O
and	O
his	O
mother	O
for	O
60	O
dollars	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
is	O
before	O
related	O
,	O
carried	O
him	O
to	O
Fort	PNM
St.	PNM
George	PNM
,	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
along	O
with	O
me	O
to	O
Bencoolen	PNM
.	O

Mr.	O
Moody	O
stayed	O
at	O
Bencoolen	PNM
about	O
three	O
weeks	O
and	O
then	O
went	O
back	O
with	O
Captain	O
Howel	O
to	O
Indrapore	O
,	O
leaving	O
Jeoly	O
and	O
his	O
mother	O
with	O
me	O
.	O

They	O
lived	O
in	O
a	O
house	O
by	O
themselves	O
without	O
the	O
fort	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
no	O
employment	O
for	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
both	O
employed	O
themselves	O
.	O

She	O
used	O
to	O
make	O
and	O
mend	O
their	O
own	O
clothes	O
,	O
at	O
which	O
she	O
was	O
not	O
very	O
expert	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
wear	O
no	O
clothes	O
at	O
Meangis	O
but	O
only	O
a	O
cloth	O
about	O
their	O
waists	O
:	O
and	O
he	O
busied	O
himself	O
in	O
making	O
a	O
chest	O
with	O
four	O
boards	O
and	O
a	O
few	O
nails	O
that	O
he	O
begged	O
of	O
me	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
but	O
an	O
ill-shaped	O
odd	O
thing	O
,	O
yet	O
he	O
was	O
as	O
proud	O
of	O
it	O
as	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
the	O
rarest	O
piece	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

After	O
some	O
time	O
they	O
were	O
both	O
taken	O
sick	O
and	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
took	O
as	O
much	O
care	O
of	O
them	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
my	O
brother	O
and	O
sister	O
,	O
yet	O
she	O
died	O
.	O

I	O
did	O
what	O
I	O
could	O
to	O
comfort	O
Jeoly	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
took	O
on	O
extremely	O
,	O
insomuch	O
that	O
I	O
feared	O
him	O
also	O
.	O

Therefore	O
I	O
caused	O
a	O
grave	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
presently	O
to	O
hide	O
her	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
sight	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
her	O
shrouded	O
decently	O
in	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
new	O
calico	O
;	O
but	O
Jeoly	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
satisfied	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
wrapped	O
all	O
her	O
clothes	O
about	O
her	O
and	O
two	O
new	O
pieces	O
of	O
chintz	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Moody	O
gave	O
her	O
,	O
saying	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
his	O
mother	O
's	O
and	O
she	O
must	O
have	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
not	O
disoblige	O
him	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
endangering	O
his	O
life	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
used	O
all	O
possible	O
means	O
to	O
recover	O
his	O
health	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
found	O
little	O
amendment	O
while	O
we	O
stayed	O
here	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
little	O
printed	O
relation	O
that	O
was	O
made	O
of	O
him	O
when	O
he	O
was	O
shown	O
for	O
a	O
sight	O
in	O
England	PNM
there	O
was	O
a	O
romantic	O
story	O
of	O
a	O
beautiful	O
sister	O
of	O
his	O
,	O
a	O
slave	O
with	O
them	O
at	O
Mindanao	PNM
;	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
sultan	O
's	O
falling	O
in	O
love	O
with	O
her	O
;	O
but	O
these	O
were	O
stories	O
indeed	O
.	O

They	O
reported	O
also	O
that	O
this	O
paint	O
was	O
of	O
such	O
virtue	O
that	O
serpents	O
and	O
venomous	O
creatures	O
would	O
flee	O
from	O
him	O
,	O
for	O
which	O
reason	O
I	O
suppose	O
,	O
they	O
represented	O
so	O
many	O
serpents	O
scampering	O
about	O
in	O
the	O
printed	O
picture	O
that	O
was	O
made	O
of	O
him	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
never	O
knew	O
any	O
paint	O
of	O
such	O
virtue	O
:	O
and	O
as	O
for	O
Jeoly	O
I	O
have	O
seen	O
him	O
as	O
much	O
afraid	O
of	O
snakes	O
,	O
scorpions	O

or	O
centipedes	O
as	O
myself	O

the	O

my	O

this	O

the	O

of	O
the	O

the	O
year	O
1690	O

towards	O

I	O
began	O
to	O
wish	O
myself	O
away	O
again	O

I	O
saw	O
so	O
much	O
ignorance	O
in	O
him	O
with	O
respect	O
to	O
his	O
charge	O

being	O
much	O

a	O

governor	O
of	O

and	O
yet	O
so	O
much	O
insolence	O

cruelty	O
with	O

rashness	O
in	O

of	O
the	O

that	O
I	O
soon	O

him	O

not	O

myself	O

them	O
a	O
fire-ship	O
.	O

With	O
this	O
they	O
thought	O
to	O
have	O
burnt	O
the	O
Dutch	O
commodore	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
probably	O
enough	O
have	O
done	O
it	O
as	O
she	O
lay	O
at	O
anchor	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
had	O
the	O
courage	O
to	O
have	O
come	O
boldly	O
on	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
fired	O
their	O
ship	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
and	O
the	O
Dutch	O
sent	O
and	O
towed	O
her	O
away	O
,	O
where	O
she	O
spent	O
herself	O
without	O
any	O
execution	O
.	O

Had	O
the	O
French	O
men-of-war	O
also	O
come	O
boldly	O
up	O
and	O
grappled	O
with	O
their	O
enemies	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
done	O
something	O
considerable	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
fort	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
played	O
on	O
them	O
without	O
damaging	O
our	O
ships	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
theirs	O
.	O

But	O
instead	O
of	O
this	O
the	O
French	O
dropped	O
anchor	O
out	O
of	O
reach	O
of	O
the	O
shot	O
of	O
the	O
fort	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
lay	O
exchanging	O
shot	O
with	O
their	O
enemies	O
'	O
ships	O
with	O
so	O
little	O
advantage	O
to	O
themselves	O
that	O
after	O
about	O
four	O
hours	O
fighting	O
they	O
cut	O
their	O
cables	O
and	O
went	O
away	O
in	O
haste	O
and	O
disorder	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
their	O
sails	O
loose	O
,	O
even	O
their	O
top-gallant	O
sails	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
not	O
usual	O
but	O
when	O
ships	O
are	O
just	O
next	O
to	O
running	O
away	O
.	O

Captain	O
Heath	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
his	O
ship	O
was	O
so	O
heavy	O
and	O
encumbered	O
,	O
behaved	O
himself	O
very	O
bravely	O
in	O
the	O
fight	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
upon	O
the	O
going	O
off	O
of	O
the	O
French	O
,	O
went	O
aboard	O
the	O
Dutch	O
commodore	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
pursue	O
them	O
he	O
would	O
stand	O
out	O
with	O
them	O
to	O
sea	O
though	O
he	O
had	O
very	O
little	O
water	O
aboard	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
Dutch	O
commander	O
excused	O
himself	O
,	O
saying	O
he	O
had	O
orders	O
to	O
defend	O
himself	O
from	O
the	O
French	O
but	O
none	O
to	O
chase	O
them	O
or	O
go	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
way	O
to	O
seek	O
them	O
.	O

And	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
exploit	O
which	O
the	O
French	O
have	O
thought	O
fit	O
to	O
brag	O
of	O
.	O

I	O
hear	O
that	O
the	O
Dutch	O
have	O
taken	O
from	O
them	O
since	O
their	O
fort	O
of	O
Pondicherry	PNM
.	O

But	O
to	O
proceed	O
with	O
our	O
voyage	O
:	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
at	O
sea	O
long	O
before	O
our	O
men	O
began	O
to	O
droop	O
in	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
distemper	O
that	O
stole	O
insensibly	O
on	O
them	O
and	O
proved	O
fatal	O
to	O
above	O
thirty	O
,	O
who	O
died	O
before	O
we	O
arrived	O
at	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
.	O

We	O
had	O
sometimes	O
two	O
,	O
and	O
once	O
three	O
men	O
thrown	O
overboard	O
in	O
a	O
morning	O
.	O

This	O
distemper	O
might	O
probably	O
arise	O
from	O
the	O
badness	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
which	O
we	O
took	O
in	O
at	O
Bencoolen	PNM
:	O
for	O
I	O
did	O
observe	O
while	O
I	O
was	O
there	O
that	O
the	O
river-water	O
wherewith	O
our	O
ships	O
were	O
watered	O
was	O
very	O
unwholesome	O
,	O
it	O
being	O
mixed	O
with	O
the	O
water	O
of	O
many	O
small	O
creeks	O
that	O
proceeded	O
from	O
low	O
land	O
,	O
and	O
whose	O
streams	O
were	O
always	O
very	O
black	O
,	O
they	O
being	O
nourished	O
by	O
the	O
water	O
that	O
drained	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
low	O
swampy	O
unwholesome	O
ground	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
observed	O
not	O
only	O
there	O
but	O
in	O
other	O
hot	O
countries	O
also	O
,	O
both	O
in	O
the	O
East	O
and	O
West	O
Indies	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
land-floods	O
which	O
pour	O
into	O
the	O
channels	O
of	O
the	O
rivers	O
about	O
the	O
season	O
of	O
the	O
rains	O
are	O
very	O
unwholesome	O
.	O

For	O
when	O
I	O
lived	O
in	O
the	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM
Campeachy	PNM
the	O
fish	O
were	O
found	O
dead	O
in	O
heaps	O
on	O
the	O
shores	O
of	O
the	O
rivers	O
and	O
creeks	O
at	O
such	O
a	O
season	O
;	O
and	O
many	O
we	O
took	O
up	O
half	O
dead	O
;	O
of	O
which	O
sudden	O
mortality	O
there	O
appeared	O
no	O
cause	O
but	O
only	O
the	O
malignity	O
of	O
the	O
waters	O
draining	O
off	O
the	O
land	O
.	O

This	O
happens	O
chiefly	O
as	O
I	O
take	O
it	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
water	O
drains	O
through	O
thick	O
woods	O
and	O
savannahs	O
of	O
long	O
grass	O
and	O
swampy	O
grounds	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
some	O
hot	O
countries	O
abound	O
:	O
and	O
I	O
believe	O
it	O
receives	O
a	O
strong	O
tincture	O
from	O
the	O
roots	O
of	O
several	O
kinds	O
of	O
trees	O
,	O
herbs	O
,	O
etc.	O
,	O
and	O
especially	O
where	O
there	O
is	O
any	O
stagnancy	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
it	O
soon	O
corrupts	O
;	O
and	O
possibly	O
the	O
serpents	O
and	O
other	O
poisonous	O
vermin	O
and	O
insects	O
may	O
not	O
a	O
little	O
contribute	O
to	O
its	O
bad	O
qualities	O
:	O
at	O
such	O
times	O
it	O
will	O
look	O
very	O
deep-coloured	O
,	O
yellow	O
,	O
red	O
,	O
or	O
black	O
,	O
etc.	O
.	O

The	O
season	O
of	O
the	O
rains	O
was	O
over	O
and	O
the	O
land-floods	O
were	O
abating	O
upon	O
the	O
taking	O
up	O
this	O
water	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
of	O
Bencoolen	PNM
:	O
but	O
would	O
the	O
seamen	O
have	O
given	O
themselves	O
the	O
trouble	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
filled	O
their	O
vessels	O
with	O
excellent	O
good	O
water	O
at	O
a	O
spring	O
on	O
the	O
back	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
fort	O
,	O
not	O
above	O
2	O
or	O
300	O
paces	O
from	O
the	O
landing-place	O
;	O
and	O
with	O
which	O
the	O
fort	O
is	O
served	O
.	O

And	O
I	O
mention	O
this	O
as	O
a	O
caution	O
to	O
any	O
ships	O
that	O
shall	O
go	O
to	O
Bencoolen	PNM
for	O
the	O
future	O
;	O
and	O
withal	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
worth	O
the	O
care	O
of	O
the	O
owners	O
or	O
governors	O
of	O
the	O
factory	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
tend	O
much	O
to	O
the	O
preservation	O
of	O
their	O
seamen	O
's	O
lives	O
to	O
lay	O
pipes	O
to	O
convey	O
the	O
fountain	O
water	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
which	O
might	O
easily	O
be	O
done	O
with	O
a	O
small	O
charge	O
:	O
and	O
had	O
I	O
stayed	O
longer	O
there	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
undertaken	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
design	O
also	O
of	O
bringing	O
into	O
the	O
fort	O
,	O
though	O
much	O
higher	O
:	O
for	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
great	O
convenience	O
and	O
security	O
to	O
it	O
in	O
case	O
of	O
a	O
siege	O
.	O

Besides	O
the	O
badness	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
it	O
was	O
stowed	O
among	O
the	O
pepper	O
in	O
the	O
hold	O
which	O
made	O
it	O
very	O
hot	O
.	O

Every	O
morning	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
take	O
our	O
allowance	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
hot	O
that	O
a	O
man	O
could	O
hardly	O
suffer	O
his	O
hands	O
in	O
it	O
or	O
hold	O
a	O
bottle	O
full	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
his	O
hands	O
.	O

I	O
never	O
anywhere	O
felt	O
the	O
like	O
nor	O
could	O
have	O
thought	O
it	O
possible	O
that	O
water	O
should	O
heat	O
to	O
that	O
degree	O
in	O
a	O
ship	O
's	O
hold	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
exceeding	O
black	O
too	O
,	O
and	O
looked	O
more	O
like	O
ink	O
than	O
water	O
.	O

Whether	O
it	O
grew	O
so	O
black	O
with	O
standing	O
or	O
was	O
tinged	O
with	O
the	O
pepper	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
,	O
for	O
this	O
water	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
black	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
first	O
taken	O
up	O
.	O

Our	O
food	O
also	O
was	O
very	O
bad	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
ship	O
had	O
been	O
out	O
of	O
England	PNM
upon	O
this	O
voyage	O
above	O
three	O
years	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
salt	O
provision	O
brought	O
from	O
thence	O
and	O
which	O
we	O
fed	O
on	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
so	O
long	O
in	O
salt	O
was	O
but	O
ordinary	O
food	O
for	O
sickly	O
men	O
to	O
feed	O
on	O
.	O

Captain	O
Heath	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
saw	O
the	O
misery	O
of	O
his	O
company	O
,	O
ordered	O
his	O
own	O
tamarinds	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
some	O
jars	O
aboard	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
given	O
some	O
to	O
each	O
mess	O
to	O
eat	O
with	O
their	O
rice	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
refreshment	O
to	O
the	O
men	O
and	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
it	O
contributed	O
much	O
to	O
keep	O
us	O
on	O
our	O
legs	O
.	O

This	O
distemper	O
was	O
so	O
universal	O
that	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
there	O
was	O
scarce	O
a	O
man	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
but	O
languished	O
under	O
it	O
;	O
yet	O
it	O
stole	O
so	O
insensibly	O
on	O
us	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
say	O
we	O
were	O
sick	O
,	O
feeling	O
little	O
or	O
no	O
pain	O
,	O
only	O
a	O
weakness	O
and	O
but	O
little	O
stomach	O
.	O

Nay	O
most	O
of	O
those	O
that	O
died	O
in	O
this	O
voyage	O
would	O
hardly	O
be	O
persuaded	O
to	O
keep	O
their	O
cabins	O
or	O
hammocks	O
,	O
till	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
stir	O
about	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
lie	O
down	O
they	O
made	O
their	O
wills	O
and	O
piked	O
off	O
in	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
.	O

The	O
loss	O
of	O
these	O
men	O
and	O
the	O
weak	O
languishing	O
condition	O
that	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
us	O
were	O
in	O
rendered	O
us	O
incapable	O
to	O
govern	O
our	O
ship	O
but	O
the	O
wind	O
blew	O
more	O
than	O
ordinary	O
.	O

This	O
often	O
happened	O
when	O
we	O
drew	O
near	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
and	O
as	O
oft	O
put	O
us	O
to	O
our	O
trumps	O
to	O
manage	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

Captain	O
Heath	O
,	O
to	O
encourage	O
his	O
men	O
to	O
their	O
labour	O
,	O
kept	O
his	O
watch	O
as	O
constantly	O
as	O
any	O
man	O
though	O
sickly	O
himself	O
,	O
and	O
lent	O
a	O
helping	O
hand	O
on	O
all	O
occasions	O
.	O

But	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
almost	O
despairing	O
of	O
gaining	O
his	O
passage	O
to	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
by	O
reason	O
of	O
the	O
winds	O
coming	O
southerly	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
having	O
now	O
been	O
sailing	O
eight	O
or	O
nine	O
weeks	O
,	O
he	O
called	O
all	O
our	O
men	O
to	O
consult	O
about	O
our	O
safety	O
and	O
desired	O
every	O
man	O
from	O
the	O
highest	O
to	O
the	O
lowest	O
freely	O
to	O
give	O
his	O
real	O
opinion	O
and	O
advice	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
in	O
this	O
dangerous	O
juncture	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
in	O
a	O
condition	O
to	O
keep	O
out	O
long	O
;	O
and	O
could	O
we	O
not	O
get	O
to	O
land	O
quickly	O
must	O
have	O
perished	O
at	O
sea	O
.	O

He	O
consulted	O
therefore	O
whether	O
it	O
were	O
best	O
to	O
beat	O
for	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
or	O
bear	O
away	O
for	O
Johanna	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
might	O
expect	O
relief	O
,	O
that	O
being	O
a	O
place	O
where	O
our	O
outward-bound	O
East	O
India	PNM
ships	O
usually	O
touch	O
and	O
whose	O
natives	O
are	O
very	O
familiar	O
:	O
but	O
other	O
places	O
,	O
especially	O
St.	PNM
Lawrence	PNM
,	O
or	O
Madagascar	PNM
,	O
which	O
was	O
nearer	O
,	O
was	O
unknown	O
to	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
now	O
so	O
nigh	O
the	O
Cape	O
that	O
with	O
a	O
fair	O
wind	O
we	O
might	O
expect	O
to	O
be	O
there	O
in	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
days	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
the	O
wind	O
was	O
now	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
hope	O
to	O
get	O
thither	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
this	O
wind	O
was	O
fair	O
to	O
carry	O
us	O
to	O
Johanna	PNM
;	O
but	O
then	O
Johanna	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
the	O
wind	O
should	O
continue	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
bring	O
us	O
into	O
a	O
true	O
tradewind	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
thither	O
under	O
a	O
fortnight	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
we	O
should	O
meet	O
calms	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
might	O
probably	O
expect	O
,	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
much	O
longer	O
.	O

Besides	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
lose	O
our	O
passage	O
about	O
the	O
Cape	O
till	O
October	O
or	O
November	O
,	O
this	O
being	O
about	O
the	O
latter	O
end	O
of	O
March	O
,	O
for	O
after	O
the	O
10th	O
of	O
May	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
usual	O
to	O
beat	O
about	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
to	O
come	O
home	O
.	O

All	O
circumstances	O
therefore	O
being	O
weighed	O
and	O
considered	O
,	O
we	O
at	O
last	O
unanimously	O
agreed	O
to	O
prosecute	O
our	O
voyage	O
towards	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
and	O
with	O
patience	O
wait	O
for	O
a	O
shift	O
of	O
wind	O

But	O
Captain	O

,	O
having	O
thus	O
far	O
sounded	O
the	O
inclination	O
of	O
his	O
weak	O
men	O

told	O
them	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O

that	O
they	O
all	O
consented	O
to	O
beat	O
for	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
,	O
for	O
our	O
desires	O
were	O
not	O
sufficient	O
to	O
bring	O
us	O
thither	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
there	O
would	O
need	O
a	O
more	O
than	O
ordinary	O
labour	O
and	O
management	O
from	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
able	O
.	O

And	O
withal	O
for	O
their	O
encouragement	O
he	O
promised	O
a	O
month	O
's	O
pay	O
gratis	O
to	O
every	O
man	O
that	O
would	O
engage	O
to	O

on	O

be	O

whether	O
it	O
were	O
his	O
turn	O
to	O

not	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
money	O
he	O
promised	O
to	O
pay	O
at	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
.	O

This	O
offer	O
was	O
first	O
embraced	O
by	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
officers	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
as	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
as	O
found	O
themselves	O
in	O
a	O
capacity	O
listed	O
themselves	O
in	O
a	O
roll	O
to	O
serve	O
their	O
commander	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
wisely	O
contrived	O
of	O
the	O
captain	O
for	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
compelled	O
them	O
in	O
their	O
weak	O
condition	O
,	O
neither	O
would	O
fair	O
words	O
alone	O
without	O
some	O
hopes	O
of	O
a	O
reward	O
have	O
engaged	O
them	O
to	O
so	O
much	O

work	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O

were	O
much	O
out	O
of	O

For	O
my	O
part	O
I	O
was	O
too	O
weak	O
to	O
enter	O
myself	O
into	O
that	O
list	O
for	O

our	O
common	O
safety	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
plainly	O
saw	O
lay	O
at	O
stake	O
,	O
would	O
have	O
prompted	O
me	O
to	O
do	O
more	O
than	O
any	O
such	O
reward	O
would	O
do	O

In	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
after	O
this	O
it	O
pleased	O
God	O
to	O
favour	O
us	O
with	O
a	O
fine	O
wind	O

which	O
,	O
being	O

by	O
the	O

The	O

before	O

entered	O
the	O

was	O
about	O
the	O
beginning	O

,	O
being	O
near	O

we	O
fired	O
a	O

every	O

to	O
give	O
notice	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
in	O

The	O
next	O

a	O
Dutch	O

came	O
aboard	O
in	O
his	O

who	O
seeing	O
us	O
so	O

not	O

we	O

tolerably	O
well	O
at	O

,	O
and	O
,	O
being	O
requested	O
by	O
our	O

to	O

sent	O
ashore	O
for	O
a	O
hundred	O
lusty	O
men	O
who	O
immediately	O
came	O
aboard	O

brought	O
our	O

in	O
to	O
an	O

They	O
also	O
unbent	O
our	O

did	O
everything	O

us	O
that	O
they	O
were	O

to	O

for	O
which	O
Captain	O

gratified	O
them	O
to	O
the	O

These	O

had	O
better	O

ate	O
freely	O

which	O
our	O

for	O
want	O

in	O
the	O

had	O
hung	O
up	O
6	O

10	O

in	O
a	O

This	O
was	O

before	O
we	O
knew	O
it	O

it	O
:	O
besides	O
in	O
the	O

there	O
was	O
a	O

The	O

I	O
can	O

take	O
notice	O
of	O
a	O
common	O
prejudice	O
our	O
European	O
seamen	O
have	O
as	O
to	O
this	O
country	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
look	O
upon	O

I	O

to	O
that	O
:	O
and	O
their	O

the	O

to	O
its	O
blowing	O
off	O

On	O
the	O
contrary	O
I	O
have	O
always	O
observed	O
the	O

to	O

Such	O
a	O
one	O
we	O
felt	O
in	O
this	O
very	O

as	O
we	O
went	O
from	O
Cape	PNM

For	O
one	O
afternoon	O
about	O
the	O
19th	O
of	O
January	O
1683	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
37	O
south	O
we	O
felt	O
a	O
brisk	O
gale	O
coming	O
from	O
off	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
America	PNM
,	O
but	O
so	O
violent	O
hot	O
that	O
we	O
thought	O
it	O
came	O
from	O
some	O
burning	O
mountain	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
like	O
the	O
heat	O
from	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
an	O
oven	O
.	O

Just	O
such	O
another	O
gleam	O
I	O
felt	O
one	O
afternoon	O
also	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
lay	O
at	O
anchor	O
at	O
the	O
Groin	O
in	O
July	O
1694	O
,	O
it	O
came	O
with	O
a	O
southerly	O
wind	O
,	O
both	O
these	O
were	O
followed	O
by	O
a	O
thunder	O
shower	O
.	O

These	O
were	O
the	O
only	O
great	O
blooms	O
I	O
ever	O
met	O
with	O
in	O
my	O
travels	O
.	O

But	O
setting	O
these	O
aside	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
exceptions	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
made	O
it	O
my	O
general	O
observation	O
that	O
the	O
sea-winds	O
are	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
warmer	O
than	O
those	O
which	O
blow	O
from	O
land	O
unless	O
where	O
the	O
wind	O
blows	O
from	O
the	O
Poles	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
take	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
true	O
cause	O
of	O
the	O
coldness	O
of	O
the	O
south	O
wind	O
at	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
,	O
for	O
it	O
is	O
cold	O
at	O
sea	O
also	O
.	O

And	O
as	O
for	O
the	O
coldness	O
of	O
land-winds	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
south-west	O
parts	O
of	O
Europe	PNM
are	O
very	O
sensible	O
of	O
it	O
from	O
the	O
northern	O
and	O
eastern	O
winds	O
;	O
so	O
on	O
the	O
opposite	O
coast	O
of	O
Virginia	PNM
they	O
are	O
as	O
much	O
pinched	O
with	O
the	O
north-west	O
winds	O
blowing	O
excessively	O
cold	O
from	O
over	O
the	O
continent	O
;	O
though	O
its	O
latitude	O
be	O
not	O
much	O
greater	O
than	O
this	O
of	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
.	O

But	O
to	O
proceed	O
:	O
this	O
large	O
promontory	O
consists	O
of	O
high	O
and	O
very	O
remarkable	O
land	O
and	O
off	O
at	O
sea	O
it	O
affords	O
a	O
very	O
pleasant	O
and	O
agreeable	O
prospect	O
.	O

And	O
without	O
doubt	O
the	O
prospect	O
of	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
agreeable	O
to	O
those	O
Portuguese	O
who	O
first	O
found	O
out	O
this	O
way	O
by	O
sea	O
to	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
;	O
when	O
after	O
coasting	O
along	O
the	O
vast	O
continent	O
of	O
Africa	PNM
towards	O
the	O
South	O
Pole	O
they	O
had	O
the	O
comfort	O
of	O
seeing	O
the	O
land	O
and	O
their	O
course	O
end	O
in	O
this	O
promontory	O
:	O
which	O
therefore	O
they	O
called	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
de	PNM
Bon	PNM
Esperance	PNM
,	O
or	O
of	O
Good	PNM
Hope	PNM
,	O
finding	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
now	O
proceed	O
easterly	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
good	O
sounding	O
off	O
this	O
Cape	O
50	O
are	O
60	O
leagues	O
at	O
sea	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
our	O
English	O
seamen	O
,	O
standing	O
over	O
as	O
they	O
usually	O
do	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Brazil	PNM
,	O
content	O
themselves	O
with	O
their	O
soundings	O
,	O
concluding	O
thereby	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
abreast	O
of	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
,	O
they	O
often	O
pass	O
by	O
without	O
seeing	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
begin	O
to	O
shape	O
their	O
course	O
northward	O
.	O

They	O
have	O
several	O
other	O
signs	O
whereby	O
to	O
know	O
when	O
they	O
are	O
near	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
by	O
the	O
seafowl	O
they	O
meet	O
at	O
sea	O
,	O
especially	O
the	O
albatrosses	O
,	O
a	O
very	O
large	O
long-winged	O
bird	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
mangovolucres	O
,	O
a	O
smaller	O
fowl	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
greatest	O
dependence	O
of	O
our	O
English	O
seamen	O
now	O
is	O
upon	O
their	O
observing	O
the	O
variation	O
of	O
the	O
compass	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
very	O
carefully	O
minded	O
when	O
they	O
come	O
near	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
by	O
taking	O
the	O
sun	O
's	O
amplitude	O
mornings	O
and	O
evenings	O
.	O

This	O
they	O
are	O
so	O
exact	O
in	O
that	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
the	O
azimuth	O
compass	O
,	O
an	O
instrument	O
more	O
peculiar	O
to	O
the	O
seamen	O
of	O
our	O
nation	O
,	O
they	O
know	O
when	O
they	O
are	O
abreast	O
of	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
or	O
are	O
either	O
to	O
the	O
east	O
or	O
the	O
west	O
of	O
it	O
:	O
and	O
for	O
that	O
reason	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
to	O
southward	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
soundings	O
or	O

they	O
can	O
shape	O
their	O

right	O
without	O
being	O

There	O
is	O

These	O

are	O
people	O
of	O
a	O
middle	O
stature	O
with	O
small	O
limbs	O
and	O
thin	O
bodies	O

full	O

as	O
the	O

Their	O
complexion	O
is	O
darker	O

neither	O

They	O
besmear	O
themselves	O
all	O
over	O
with	O
grease	O
as	O
well	O
to	O
keep	O
their	O
joints	O

up	O

To	O
do	O
this	O
the	O

they	O
rub	O
soot	O
over	O
the	O
greased	O
parts	O

especially	O
their	O

which	O
adds	O
to	O
their	O
natural	O
beauty	O
,	O
as	O

does	O
in	O
Europe	PNM
;	O
but	O
withal	O
sends	O
from	O
them	O
a	O
strong	O
smell	O
which	O
though	O
sufficiently	O

is	O

use	O
it	O

This	O
custom	O
of	O

is	O
very	O

use	O
palm-oil	O

anointing	O
themselves	O
from	O
head	O

;	O
but	O
when	O
they	O
want	O
oil	O
they	O
make	O
use	O
of	O
kitchen-stuff	O

They	O
spend	O
sometimes	O
half	O

in	O
chafing	O
the	O
oil	O
and	O
rubbing	O
it	O
into	O

leaving	O
no	O

their	O

they	O
daub	O

these	O

The	O
Americans	O
also	O
in	O
some	O
places	O
do	O
use	O
this	O
custom	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
so	O
frequently	O
,	O
perhaps	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
oil	O

grease	O
to	O
do	O
it	O

Yet	O
some	O
American	O
Indians	O
in	O
the	O
North	O

frequently	O
daub	O
themselves	O
with	O
a	O

these	O

unsavourly	O

to	O
people	O
not	O

The	O

They	O
never	O

Indeed	O
most	O
Indians	O
that	O
live	O
remote	O

are	O
molested	O
with	O

For	O

cold	O
countries	O
as	O
in	O
the	O
north	O

hence	O

the	O

I	O
was	O

by	O
my	O
Dutch	O
landlord	O
that	O
they	O
kept	O
sheep	O

here	O
before	O
the	O
Dutch	O
settled	O
among	O
them	O

and	O
that	O
the	O
inland	O

have	O
still	O
great	O
stocks	O
of	O
cattle	O
and	O
sell	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
Dutch	O
for	O
rolls	O
of	O
tobacco	O
:	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
price	O
for	O
which	O
they	O
sell	O
a	O
cow	O
or	O
sheep	O
was	O
as	O
much	O
twisted	O
tobacco	O
as	O
would	O
reach	O
from	O
the	O
horns	O
or	O
head	O
to	O
the	O
tail	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
are	O
great	O
lovers	O
of	O
tobacco	O

will	O
do	O
anything	O
for	O
it	O

This	O
their	O

seem	O
all	O
very	O
busy	O

both	O
men	O

dancing	O
very	O
oddly	O
on	O
the	O

by	O

They	O
traced	O
to	O

promiscuously	O
,	O
often	O
clapping	O
their	O
hands	O
and	O
singing	O
aloud	O

Their	O

were	O
sometimes	O
to	O
the	O
east	O

sometimes	O
to	O
the	O

:	O
neither	O
did	O
I	O
see	O
any	O

After	O
I	O
had	O
thus	O
observed	O
them	O
for	O

I	O
returned	O
to	O
my	O

was	O
not	O

2	O

300	O

and	O
I	O
heard	O
them	O
singing	O
in	O
the	O

all	O
night	O

In	O
the	O
grey	O
of	O
the	O
morning	O
I	O
walked	O
out	O
again	O
and	O
found	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
men	O

women	O
still	O
singing	O

dancing	O
;	O
who	O
continued	O
their	O

till	O
the	O
moon	O
went	O
down	O

the	O

As	O
for	O

a	O

Upon	O
our	O

at	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
Captain	PNM

took	O
a	O

in	O
in	O

to	O

Such	O

as	O
were	O

did	O
so	O
too	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
rest	O
he	O
provided	O

paid	O
their	O

Three	O
or	O
four	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
who	O
came	O
ashore	O
very	O
sick	O
died	O

but	O
the	O
rest	O

by	O
the	O
assistance	O
of	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

recovered	O
their	O

Those	O
that	O

at	O
all	O
calls	O
and	O
assisted	O
to	O
bring	O
in	O
the	O

received	O
Captain	O
Heath	O
's	O
bounty	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
they	O
furnished	O
themselves	O
with	O
liquor	O
for	O
their	O
homeward	O
voyage	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
so	O
few	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
sail	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
therefore	O
Captain	O
Heath	O
desired	O
the	O
governor	O
to	O
spare	O
him	O
some	O
men	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
informed	O
,	O
had	O
a	O
promise	O
to	O
be	O
supplied	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
homeward-bound	O
Dutch	O
East	O
India	PNM
ships	O
that	O
were	O
now	O
expected	O
every	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
waited	O
for	O
them	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
meantime	O
in	O
came	O
the	O
James	O
and	O
Mary	O

and	O
the	O
Josiah	O
of	O
London	PNM
,	O
bound	O

Out	O
of	O
these	O
we	O
thought	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
furnished	O
with	O
men	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
had	O
only	O
enough	O
for	O
themselves	O
;	O
therefore	O
we	O
waited	O
yet	O
longer	O
for	O
the	O
Dutch	O
fleet	O
,	O
which	O
at	O
last	O
arrived	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
could	O
get	O
no	O
men	O
from	O
them	O
.	O

Captain	O
Heath	O
was	O
therefore	O
forced	O
to	O
get	O
men	O
by	O
stealth	O
such	O
as	O
he	O
could	O
pick	O
up	O
whether	O
soldiers	O
or	O
seamen	O

The	O
Dutch	O
knew	O
our	O
want	O
of	O
men	O
,	O
therefore	O
near	O
forty	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
those	O
that	O
had	O
a	O
design	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
Europe	PNM
,	O
came	O
privately	O
and	O
offered	O
themselves	O
,	O
and	O
waited	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
at	O
places	O
appointed	O
,	O
where	O
our	O
boats	O
went	O
and	O
fetched	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
aboard	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
and	O
hid	O
them	O
,	O
especially	O
when	O
any	O
Dutch	O
boat	O
came	O
aboard	O
our	O
ship	O
.	O

Here	O
at	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
I	O
met	O
my	O
friend	O
Daniel	O
Wallis	O
,	O
the	O
same	O
who	O
leapt	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
and	O
swam	O
at	O
Pulo	PNM

After	O
several	O

to	O
Madagascar	PNM

Don	O
Mascarin	O

the	O

Hooghly	O
he	O
was	O
now	O
got	O
hither	O
in	O
a	O
homeward-bound	O
Dutch	O
ship	O
.	O

I	O
soon	O
persuaded	O
him	O
to	O
come	O
over	O
to	O
us	O
and	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
get	O
him	O
aboard	O
our	O
ship	O
.	O

About	O
the	O
23rd	O
of	O
May	O
we	O
sailed	O
from	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
in	O
the	O
company	O
of	O
the	O
James	O
and	O
Mary	O
and	O
the	O
Josiah	O
,	O
directing	O
our	O
course	O
towards	O
the	O
island	O
St.	PNM
Helena	PNM
.	O

We	O
met	O
nothing	O
of	O
remark	O
in	O
this	O
voyage	O
except	O
a	O
great	O
swelling	O
sea	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
south-west	O
which	O
,	O
taking	O
us	O
on	O
the	O
broadside	O
,	O
made	O
us	O
roll	O
sufficiently	O
.	O

Such	O
of	O
our	O
water-casks	O
as	O
were	O
between	O
decks	O
running	O
from	O
side	O
to	O
side	O
were	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
all	O
staved	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
deck	O
well	O
washed	O
with	O
the	O
fresh	O
water	O
.	O

The	O
shot	O
tumbled	O
out	O
the	O
lockers	O
and	O
garlands	O
;	O
and	O
rung	O
a	O
loud	O
peal	O
,	O
rumbling	O
from	O
side	O
to	O
side	O
every	O
roll	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
made	O
;	O
neither	O
was	O
it	O
an	O
easy	O
matter	O
to	O
reduce	O
them	O
again	O
within	O
bounds	O
.	O

The	O
guns	O
,	O
being	O
carefully	O
looked	O
after	O
and	O
lashed	O
fast	O
,	O
never	O
budged	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
tackles	O
or	O
pulleys	O
and	O
lashings	O
made	O
great	O
music	O
too	O
.	O

The	O
sudden	O
and	O
violent	O
motion	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
made	O
us	O
fearful	O
lest	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
guns	O
should	O
have	O
broken	O
loose	O
,	O
which	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
detrimental	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
sides	O
.	O

The	O
masts	O
were	O
also	O
in	O
great	O
danger	O
to	O
be	O
rolled	O
by	O
the	O
board	O
;	O
but	O
no	O
harm	O
happened	O
to	O
any	O
of	O
us	O
besides	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
buts	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
barrel	O
or	O
two	O
of	O
good	O
Cape	O
wine	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
staved	O
in	O
the	O
great	O
cabin	O
.	O

This	O
great	O
tumbling	O
sea	O
took	O
us	O
shortly	O
after	O
we	O
came	O
from	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
.	O

The	O
violence	O
of	O
it	O
lasted	O
but	O
one	O
night	O
;	O
yet	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
continual	O
swelling	O
came	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
south-west	O
almost	O
during	O
all	O
the	O
passage	O
to	O
St.	PNM
Helena	PNM
;	O
which	O
was	O
an	O
eminent	O
token	O
that	O
the	O
south-west	O
winds	O
were	O
now	O
violent	O
in	O
the	O
higher	O
latitudes	O
towards	O
the	O
South	PNM
Pole	PNM
;	O
for	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
for	O
those	O
winds	O
.	O

Notwithstanding	O
this	O
boisterous	O
sea	O
coming	O
thus	O
obliquely	O
upon	O
us	O
we	O
had	O
fine	O
clear	O
weather	O
and	O
a	O
moderate	O
gale	O
at	O
south-east	O
,	O
or	O
between	O
that	O
and	O
the	O
east	O
,	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
St.	PNM
Helena	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
arrived	O
the	O
20th	O
day	O
of	O
June	O

There	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
Princess	O
Ann	O
at	O
an	O
anchor	O
waiting	O
for	O
us	O

The	O
island	O
St.	PNM
Helena	PNM
lies	O
in	O
about	O
16	O
degrees	O
south	O
latitude	O

The	O
air	O
is	O
commonly	O
serene	O
and	O
clear	O
except	O
in	O
the	O
months	O
that	O
yield	O
rain	O
;	O
yet	O
we	O
had	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
very	O
rainy	O
days	O
even	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
here	O
.	O

Here	O
are	O
moist	O
seasons	O
to	O

the	O

is	O
temperate	O

though	O
so	O
near	O
the	O

and	O
very	O

The	O

small	O

not	O
above	O
nine	O

ten	O
leagues	O

and	O
stands	O
3	O

400	O

It	O
is	O
bounded	O
against	O
the	O
sea	O
with	O

that	O
there	O
is	O
no	O

at	O
two	O

The	O

they	O
are	O

you	O

the	O

afford	O
some	O
trees	O
fit	O

This	O

by	O
the	O

the	O

about	O

But	O
when	O

they	O
all	O

they	O

all	O
the	O

that	O
the	O

But	O
now	O
they	O
are	O
in	O
hopes	O
to	O
produce	O
wine	O

in	O
a	O

there	O
being	O
a	O
few	O

there	O
to	O

that	O

This	O
I	O
was	O
told	O
but	O
I	O
saw	O
nothing	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
rained	O
so	O
hard	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
ashore	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
the	O
opportunity	O
of	O
seeing	O
their	O
plantations	O

I	O
was	O
also	O
informed	O
that	O
they	O
get	O
manatee	O
or	O
sea-cows	O
here	O
,	O
which	O
seemed	O
very	O
strange	O
to	O
me	O
.	O

Therefore	O
enquiring	O
more	O
strictly	O
into	O
the	O
matter	O
I	O
found	O
the	O
St.	PNM
Helena	PNM
manatee	O
to	O
be	O
,	O
by	O
their	O
shapes	O
and	O
manner	O
of	O
lying	O
ashore	O
on	O
the	O
rocks	O
,	O
those	O
creatures	O
called	O
sea-lions	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
manatee	O
never	O
come	O
ashore	O
,	O
neither	O
are	O
they	O
found	O
near	O
any	O
rocky	O
shores	O
as	O
this	O
island	O
is	O
,	O
there	O
being	O
no	O
feeding	O
for	O
them	O
in	O
such	O
places	O
.	O

Besides	O
in	O
this	O
island	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
river	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
drink	O
at	O
,	O
though	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
small	O
brook	O
runs	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
valley	O
by	O
the	O
fort	O
.	O

We	O
stayed	O
here	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
days	O
;	O
all	O
which	O
time	O
the	O
islanders	O
lived	O
at	O
the	O
town	O
to	O
entertain	O
the	O
seamen	O
;	O
who	O
constantly	O
flock	O
ashore	O
to	O
enjoy	O
themselves	O
among	O
their	O
country	O
people	O
.	O

Our	O
touching	O
at	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
had	O
greatly	O
drained	O
the	O
seamen	O
of	O
their	O
loose	O
coins	O
,	O
at	O
which	O
these	O
islanders	O
as	O
greatly	O
repined	O
;	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
poorer	O
sort	O
openly	O
complained	O
against	O
such	O
doings	O
,	O
saying	O
it	O
was	O
fit	O
that	O
the	O
East	O
India	PNM
Company	O
should	O
be	O
acquainted	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
hinder	O
their	O
ships	O
from	O
touching	O
at	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
.	O

Yet	O
they	O
were	O
extremely	O
kind	O
,	O
in	O
hopes	O
to	O
get	O
what	O
was	O
remaining	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
very	O
poor	O
:	O
but	O
such	O
as	O
could	O
get	O
a	O
little	O
liquor	O
to	O
sell	O
to	O
the	O
seamen	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
got	O
what	O
the	O
seamen	O
could	O
spare	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
punch-houses	O
were	O
never	O
empty	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
had	O
we	O
all	O
come	O
directly	O
hither	O
and	O
not	O
touched	O
at	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
,	O
even	O
the	O
poorest	O
people	O
among	O
them	O
would	O
have	O
gotten	O
something	O
by	O
entertaining	O
sick	O
men	O
.	O

For	O
commonly	O
the	O
seamen	O
coming	O
home	O
are	O
troubled	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
with	O
scorbutic	O
distempers	O
:	O
and	O
their	O
only	O
hopes	O
are	O
to	O
get	O
refreshment	O
and	O
health	O
at	O
this	O
island	O
;	O
and	O
these	O
hopes	O
seldom	O
or	O
never	O
fail	O
them	O
if	O
once	O
they	O
get	O
footing	O
here	O
.	O

For	O
the	O
islands	O
afford	O
abundance	O
of	O
delicate	O
herbs	O
,	O
wherewith	O
the	O
sick	O
are	O
first	O
bathed	O
to	O
supple	O
their	O
joints	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
fruits	O
and	O
herbs	O
and	O
fresh	O
food	O
soon	O
after	O
cure	O
them	O
of	O
their	O
scorbutic	O
humours	O
.	O

So	O
that	O
in	O
a	O
week	O
's	O
time	O
men	O
that	O
have	O
been	O
carried	O
ashore	O
in	O
hammocks	O
and	O
they	O
who	O
were	O
wholly	O
unable	O
to	O
go	O
have	O
soon	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
leap	O
and	O
dance	O
.	O

Doubtless	O
the	O
serenity	O
and	O
wholesomeness	O
of	O
the	O
air	O
contributes	O
much	O
to	O
the	O
carrying	O
off	O
of	O
these	O
distempers	O
;	O
for	O
here	O
is	O
constantly	O
a	O
fresh	O
breeze	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
stayed	O
here	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
seamen	O
got	O
sweethearts	O

One	O
young	O
man	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
James	O

yet	O
very	O
earnestly	O

My	O

was	O

two	O

for	O
myself	O

Jeoly	O

whom	O
I	O

very	O
diligent	O
to	O
pick	O
up	O
such	O
things	O
as	O
the	O
islands	O
afforded	O
,	O
carrying	O
ashore	O
with	O
him	O
a	O
bag	O
which	O
the	O
people	O

him	O

They	O
flocked	O
about	O
him	O

seemed	O
to	O
admire	O
him	O
much	O

This	O
was	O
the	O

I	O

towards	O
England	PNM
,	O
and	O
designing	O
to	O
touch	O
nowhere	O
by	O
the	O
way	O

We	O
were	O
now	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
the	O
tradewinds	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
commonly	O
find	O
at	O
east-south-east	O
or	O
south-east	O
by	O
east	O
or	O
south-east	O
till	O
we	O
draw	O
near	O
the	O

and	O
sometimes	O
till	O
we	O
are	O
eight	O
or	O
ten	O
degrees	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
of	O
the	O

For	O
which	O
reason	O
ships	O
might	O
shape	O
their	O
course	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
keep	O
on	O
the	O
African	O
shore	O
and	O
pass	O
between	O
Cape	PNM
Verde	PNM
and	O
Cape	PNM

;	O
for	O
that	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
directest	O
course	O
to	O
England	PNM

But	O
experience	O
often	O
shows	O
us	O
that	O
the	O
farthest	O
way	O
about	O
is	O
the	O
nearest	O
way	O
home	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
it	O
is	O
here	O
.	O

For	O
by	O
striving	O
to	O
keep	O
near	O
the	O
African	O
shore	O
you	O
meet	O
with	O
the	O
winds	O
more	O
uncertain	O
and	O
subject	O
to	O

whereas	O
in	O
keeping	O
the	O
midway	O
between	O
Africa	PNM

America	PNM
,	O
or	O
rather	O
nearer	O
the	O
American	O
continent	O
,	O
till	O
you	O
are	O
north	O
of	O
the	O

you	O
have	O
a	O
brisk	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
way	O
we	O
took	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
our	O
passage	O
before	O
we	O
got	O
to	O
the	O
Line	O
we	O
saw	O
three	O
ships	O
and	O
,	O
making	O
towards	O
them	O
we	O
found	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
Portuguese	O
,	O
bound	O
to	O
Brazil	PNM
.	O

The	O
third	O
kept	O
on	O
a	O
wind	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
speak	O
with	O
her	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
found	O
by	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
it	O
was	O

After	O
this	O
