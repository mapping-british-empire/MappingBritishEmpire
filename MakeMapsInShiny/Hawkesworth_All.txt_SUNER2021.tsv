During	O
the	O
whole	O
of	O
our	O
course	O
from	O
the	O
Lizard	O
,	O
we	O
observed	O
that	O
no	O
fish	O
followed	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
judged	O
to	O
be	O
owing	O
to	O
her	O
being	O
sheathed	O
with	O
copper	O
.	O

By	O
the	O
26th	O
,	O
our	O
water	O
was	O
become	O
foul	O
,	O
and	O
stunk	O
intolerably	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
purified	O
it	O
with	O
a	O
machine	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
put	O
on	O
board	O
for	O
that	O
purpose	O
:	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
ventilator	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
air	O
was	O
forced	O
through	O
the	O
water	O
in	O
a	O
continued	O
stream	O
,	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
necessary	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
morning	O
of	O
the	O
27th	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Sal	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
de	PNM
Verds	PNM
,	O
and	O
seeing	O
several	O
turtle	O
upon	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
we	O
hoisted	O
out	O
our	O
jolly	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
attempted	O
to	O
strike	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
all	O
went	O
down	O
before	O
our	O
people	O
could	O
come	O
within	O
reach	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
morning	O
of	O
the	O
28th	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
near	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Bona	PNM

,	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
off	O
the	O
Isle	PNM
of	PNM
May	PNM
,	O
and	O
on	O
Monday	O
the	O
30th	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
in	O
Port	PNM
Praya	PNM

The	O
rainy	O
season	O
was	O
already	O
set	O
in	O
,	O
which	O
renders	O
this	O
place	O
very	O
unsafe	O
;	O
a	O
large	O
swell	O
that	O
rolls	O
in	O
from	O
the	O
southward	O
,	O
makes	O
a	O
frightful	O
surf	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
reason	O
every	O
hour	O
to	O
expect	O
a	O
tornado	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
violent	O
,	O
and	O
blows	O
directly	O
in	O
,	O
the	O
consequences	O
are	O
likely	O
to	O
be	O
fatal	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
after	O
the	O
15th	O
of	O
August	O
no	O
ship	O
comes	O
hither	O
till	O
the	O
rainy	O
season	O
is	O
over	O
,	O
which	O
happens	O
in	O
November	O
;	O
for	O
this	O
reason	O
.	O

I	O
made	O
all	O
possible	O
haste	O
to	O
fill	O
my	O
water	O
and	O
get	O
away	O
.	O

I	O
procured	O
three	O
bullocks	O
for	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
little	O
better	O
than	O
carrion	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
weather	O
was	O
so	O
hot	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
flesh	O
stunk	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
hours	O
after	O
they	O
were	O
killed	O
.	O

On	O
Thursday	O
the	O
2d	O
of	O
August	O
,	O
we	O
got	O
again	O
under	O
sail	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
large	O
cargo	O
of	O
fowls	O
,	O
lean	O
goats	O
,	O
and	O
monkies	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
people	O
contrived	O
to	O
procure	O
for	O
old	O
shirts	O
,	O
jackets	O
and	O
other	O
articles	O
of	O
the	O
like	O

The	O
intolerable	O
heat	O
,	O
and	O
almost	O
incessant	O
rain	O
,	O
very	O
soon	O
affected	O
our	O
health	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
men	O
began	O
to	O
fall	O
down	O
in	O
fevers	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
all	O
my	O
attention	O
and	O
diligence	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
shift	O
themselves	O
before	O
they	O
slept	O

when	O
they	O
were	O
wet	O

On	O
Wednesday	O
the	O
8th	O
,	O
the	O
Tamar	O
fired	O
a	O
gun	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
we	O
shortened	O
sail	O
till	O
she	O
came	O
up	O
:	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
suffered	O
no	O
damage	O
but	O
the	O
carrying	O
away	O
of	O
her	O
top-sail-yard	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
make	O
an	O
easy	O
sail	O
till	O
she	O
had	O
got	O
up	O
another	O

and	O
the	O
wind	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
coming	O
again	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
,	O
we	O
lost	O
a	O
good	O
deal	O
of	O
way	O
.	O

We	O
continued	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
mortification	O
,	O
to	O
observe	O
that	O
no	O
fish	O
would	O
come	O
near	O
enough	O
to	O
our	O
copper	O
bottom	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
strike	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
sea	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
quickened	O
with	O
them	O
at	O
a	O
little	O
distance	O

Ships	O

about	O
three	O

;	O
and	O
about	O
noon	O

on	O

We	O
observed	O
also	O
that	O
the	O
water	O
was	O
frequently	O
very	O
shallow	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
seven	O

eight	O

from	O
the	O
shore	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
many	O
times	O
not	O
more	O
than	O
ten	O
fathom	O

We	O
continued	O
to	O
stand	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
all	O
day	O
as	O
near	O
as	O
possible	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
we	O
saw	O
an	O
island	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
about	O
six	O
leagues	O
;	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
we	O
stood	O
in	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
that	O
it	O
corresponded	O
with	O
Narborough	O

As	O

said	O
to	O
lie	O
about	O
three	O

north	O

of	O
this	O
island	O

I	O
sent	O
the	O

for	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
she	O
returned	O
,	O
having	O

it	O

I	O
stood	O
in	O
for	O
the	O

There	O
were	O
thousands	O

about	O

several	O

rocks	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
remarkable	O
rock	O
,	O
rising	O
from	O
the	O
water	O
like	O
a	O
steeple	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
south	O

of	O
the	O
entrance	O

this	O
rock	O
is	O
an	O
excellent	O
mark	O
to	O
know	O
the	O
harbour	O

which	O
it	O
would	O
otherwise	O
be	O
difficult	O
to	O
find	O

At	O
night	O
,	O
there	O
being	O
little	O
wind	O
,	O
we	O
anchored	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
miles	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O

and	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
breeze	O
from	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
we	O
turned	O
up	O
the	O
harbour	O

;	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
very	O
narrow	O

with	O
many	O

about	O
it	O

and	O
the	O

by	O

I	O
mention	O
all	O
these	O

it	O
may	O
be	O
of	O
importance	O
to	O

The	O
wind	O
blew	O
very	O
hard	O
the	O
greater	O
part	O
of	O
this	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
ran	O
an	O
ugly	O
sea	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
stationed	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
ordered	O
out	O
two	O
boats	O
to	O
sound	O
the	O
harbour	O
,	O
and	O
attended	O
in	O
my	O
own	O
boat	O
myself	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
it	O
very	O
narrow	O
for	O
near	O
two	O
miles	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
tide	O
running	O
at	O
the	O
rate	O
of	O
eight	O
miles	O
an	O
hour	O
:	O
we	O
found	O
also	O
many	O
rocks	O
and	O
shoals	O
,	O
but	O
all	O
the	O
danger	O
shows	O
itself	O
above	O
water	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
I	O
landed	O
,	O
and	O
walked	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
which	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
see	O
was	O
all	O
downs	O
,	O
without	O
a	O
single	O
tree	O
or	O
shrub	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
the	O
dung	O
of	O
many	O
beasts	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
glimpse	O
of	O
four	O
,	O
which	O
ran	O
away	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
came	O
in	O
sight	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
certainly	O
determine	O
what	O
they	O
were	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
believed	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
Guanicoes	O
,	O
many	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
afterwards	O
saw	O
come	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
water	O
side	O
:	O
they	O
resemble	O
our	O
deer	O
,	O
but	O
are	O
much	O
larger	O
,	O
the	O
height	O
of	O
some	O
being	O
not	O
less	O
than	O
thirteen	O
hands	O
;	O
they	O
are	O
very	O
shy	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
swift	O
.	O

After	O
I	O
returned	O
to	O
my	O
boat	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
farther	O
up	O
the	O
harbour	O
,	O
and	O
landed	O
upon	O
an	O
island	O
that	O
was	O
covered	O
with	O
seals	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
killed	O
above	O
fifty	O
,	O
and	O
among	O
them	O
many	O
that	O
were	O
larger	O
than	O
a	O
bullock	O
,	O
having	O
before	O
half	O
loaded	O
our	O
boat	O
with	O
different	O
kinds	O
of	O
birds	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
,	O
and	O
seals	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
enough	O
to	O
supply	O
the	O
navy	O
of	O
England	PNM
.	O

Among	O
the	O
birds	O
one	O
was	O
very	O
remarkable	O
:	O
the	O
head	O
resembled	O
that	O
of	O
an	O
eagle	O
,	O
except	O
that	O
it	O
had	O
a	O
large	O
comb	O
upon	O
it	O
;	O
round	O
the	O
neck	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
white	O
ruff	O
,	O
exactly	O
resembling	O
a	O
lady	O
's	O
tippet	O
;	O
the	O
feathers	O
on	O
the	O
back	O
were	O
as	O
black	O
as	O
jet	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
bright	O
as	O
the	O
finest	O
polish	O
could	O
render	O
that	O
mineral	O
:	O
the	O
legs	O
were	O
remarkably	O
strong	O
and	O
large	O
,	O
the	O
talons	O
were	O
like	O
those	O
of	O
an	O
eagle	O
,	O
except	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
so	O
sharp	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
wings	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
extended	O

measured	O
;	O
from	O

no	O
less	O

twelve	O

The	O
Tamar	O
worked	O
into	O
the	O
harbour	O
with	O
the	O
tide	O
of	O
flood	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
kept	O
my	O
station	O
with	O
the	O
Dolphin	O
till	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
a	O
leading	O
wind	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
wind	O
shifting	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
,	O
I	O
weighed	O
about	O
five	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
intending	O
to	O
go	O
up	O
with	O
the	O
evening	O
flood	O
:	O
before	O
I	O
could	O
get	O
under	O
sail	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
shifted	O
again	O
to	O
N.W.	O
by	O
N.	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
being	O
low	O
water	O
,	O
the	O
ship	O
lying	O
but	O
just	O
within	O
the	O
harbour	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
being	O
no	O
tide	O
to	O
assist	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
anchor	O
near	O
the	O
south	O
shore	O
.	O

The	O
wind	O
came	O
off	O
the	O
land	O
in	O
very	O
hard	O
flaws	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
,	O
our	O
anchor	O
coming	O
home	O
,	O
the	O
ship	O
tailed	O
on	O
shore	O
against	O
a	O
steep	O
gravelly	O
beach	O
.	O

The	O
anchoring	O
ground	O
indeed	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
yet	O
sounded	O
was	O
bad	O
,	O
being	O
very	O
hard	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
this	O
situation	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
wind	O
blows	O
fresh	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
always	O
the	O
greatest	O
reason	O
to	O
fear	O
that	O
the	O
anchor	O
should	O
come	O
home	O
before	O
the	O
ship	O
can	O
be	O
brought	O
up	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
were	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
it	O
began	O
to	O
blow	O
very	O
hard	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
tide	O
running	O
like	O
a	O
sluice	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
difficulty	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
carry	O
an	O
anchor	O
out	O
to	O
heave	O
us	O
off	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
after	O
about	O
four	O
hours	O
hard	O
labour	O
,	O
this	O
was	O
effected	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
ship	O
floated	O
in	O
the	O
stream	O
.	O

As	O
there	O
was	O
only	O
about	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
feet	O
of	O
the	O
after	O
part	O
of	O
her	O
that	O
touched	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
reason	O
to	O
hope	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
suffered	O
no	O
damage	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
determined	O
to	O
unhang	O
the	O
rudder	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
examined	O
.	O

During	O
all	O
this	O
night	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
the	O
wind	O
blew	O
with	O
great	O
violence	O
;	O
we	O
had	O
let	O
go	O
our	O
best	O
bower	O
anchor	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
in	O
hopes	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
brought	O
us	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
not	O
yet	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
weigh	O
it	O
.	O

We	O
now	O
rode	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
disagreeable	O
situation	O
with	O
our	O
small	O
bower	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
unfortunately	O
came	O
home	O
again	O
:	O
we	O
therefore	O
got	O
a	O
hawser	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
Tamar	O
,	O
who	O
lay	O
in	O
the	O
stream	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
weighing	O
the	O
small	O
bower	O
,	O
we	O
got	O
out	O
by	O
her	O
assistance	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
dropped	O
it	O
again	O
,	O
most	O
ardently	O
wishing	O
for	O
fair	O
weather	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
get	O
the	O
ship	O
properly	O
moored	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
we	O
sounded	O
the	O
harbour	O
higher	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
the	O
ground	O
softer	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
water	O
not	O
so	O
deep	O
;	O
yet	O
the	O
wind	O
continued	O
to	O
blow	O
so	O
hard	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
venture	O
to	O
change	O
our	O
station	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
found	O
a	O
small	O
spring	O
of	O
water	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
inland	O
,	O
upon	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
had	O
a	O
brackish	O
taste	O
;	O
I	O
had	O
also	O
made	O
another	O
excursion	O
of	O
several	O
miles	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
found	O
barren	O
and	O
desolate	O
,	O
in	O
every	O
direction	O
,	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
eye	O
could	O
reach	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
seen	O
many	O
guanicoes	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
near	O
enough	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
shot	O
at	O
them	O
;	O
we	O
tracked	O
beasts	O
of	O
several	O
kinds	O
in	O
the	O
soil	O
,	O
near	O
a	O
pond	O
of	O
salt	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
among	O
them	O
a	O
very	O
large	O
tyger	O
:	O
we	O
found	O
also	O
a	O
nest	O
of	O
ostriches	O
eggs	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
eat	O
,	O
and	O
thought	O
very	O
good	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
probable	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
animals	O
which	O
had	O
left	O
marks	O
of	O
their	O
feet	O
near	O
the	O
salt	O
pond	O
,	O
drank	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
we	O
saw	O
no	O
fresh	O
water	O
for	O
them	O

The	O
spring	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
found	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
not	O
perfectly	O
fresh	O
,	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
kind	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
discover	O

On	O
the	O
24th	O
,	O
upon	O
slack	O
water	O
,	O
we	O
carried	O
both	O
the	O
ships	O
higher	O
up	O

we	O
had	O
however	O
at	O
last	O
the	O
good	O
fortune	O
to	O
save	O
him	O
.	O

This	O
day	O
I	O
was	O
again	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
walked	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
miles	O
up	O
the	O
country	O
:	O
I	O
saw	O
several	O
hares	O
as	O
large	O
as	O
a	O
fawn	O
;	O
I	O
shot	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
which	O
weighed	O
more	O
than	O
six	O
and	O
twenty	O
pounds	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
had	O
a	O
good	O
greyhound	O
,	O
I	O
dare	O
say	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O
might	O
have	O
lived	O
upon	O
hare	O
two	O
days	O
in	O
the	O
week	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
board	O
were	O
busy	O
in	O
getting	O
up	O
all	O
the	O
cables	O
upon	O
deck	O
,	O
and	O
clearing	O
the	O
hold	O
,	O
that	O
a	O
proper	O
quantity	O
of	O
ballast	O
might	O
be	O
taken	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
guns	O
lowered	O
into	O
it	O
,	O
except	O
a	O
few	O
which	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
thought	O
necessary	O
to	O
keep	O
above	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
25th	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
up	O
the	O
harbour	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
landed	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
,	O
we	O
soon	O
after	O
found	O
an	O
old	O
oar	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
singular	O
make	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
barrel	O
of	O
a	O
musquet	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
King	O
's	O
broad	O
arrow	O
upon	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
musquet	O
barrel	O
had	O
suffered	O
so	O
much	O
from	O
the	O
weather	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
crumbled	O
into	O
dust	O
between	O
the	O
fingers	O
:	O
I	O
imagined	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
left	O
there	O
by	O
the	O
Wager	O
's	O
people	O
,	O
or	O
perhaps	O
by	O
Sir	O
John	O
Narborough	O
.	O

Hitherto	O
we	O
had	O
found	O
no	O
kind	O
of	O
vegetables	O
except	O
a	O
species	O
of	O
wild	O
peas	O
;	O
but	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
no	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
places	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
made	O
their	O
fires	O
,	O
which	O
however	O
did	O
not	O
appear	O
to	O
be	O
recent	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
were	O
on	O
shore	O
we	O
shot	O
some	O
wild	O
ducks	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
hare	O
;	O
the	O
hare	O
ran	O
two	O
miles	O
after	O
he	O
was	O
wounded	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
appeared	O
when	O
he	O
was	O
taken	O
up	O
that	O
a	O
ball	O
had	O
passed	O
quite	O
through	O
his	O
body	O
.	O

I	O
went	O
this	O
day	O
many	O
miles	O
up	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
long	O
chace	O
after	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
guanicoes	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
largest	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
:	O
he	O
frequently	O
stopped	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
us	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
had	O
left	O
us	O
at	O
a	O
good	O
distance	O
behind	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
noise	O
that	O
resembled	O
the	O
neighing	O
of	O
a	O
horse	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
pretty	O
near	O
him	O
he	O
set	O
out	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
my	O
dog	O
being	O
so	O
tired	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
run	O
him	O
any	O
longer	O
,	O
he	O
got	O
quite	O
away	O
from	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
saw	O
him	O
no	O
more	O
.	O

We	O
shot	O
a	O
hare	O
however	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
ugly	O
animal	O
which	O
stunk	O
so	O
intolerably	O
that	O
none	O
of	O
us	O
could	O
go	O
near	O
him	O
.	O

The	O
flesh	O
of	O
the	O
hares	O
here	O
is	O
as	O
white	O
as	O
snow	O
,	O
and	O
nothing	O
can	O
be	O
better	O
tasted	O

A	O
Serjeant	O
of	O
marines	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
others	O
who	O
were	O
on	O
shore	O
at	O
another	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
had	O
better	O
success	O
than	O
fell	O
to	O
our	O
share	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
killed	O
two	O
old	O
guanicoes	O
and	O
a	O
fawn	O
;	O
they	O
were	O
however	O
obliged	O
to	O
leave	O
them	O
where	O
they	O
fell	O
,	O
not	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
bring	O
them	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
water	O
side	O
,	O
near	O
six	O
miles	O
,	O
without	O
farther	O
assistance	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
were	O
but	O
half	O
the	O
weight	O
of	O
those	O
that	O
are	O
mentioned	O
by	O
Sir	O
John	O
Narborough	O
;	O
some	O
however	O
I	O
saw	O
which	O
could	O
not	O
weigh	O
less	O
than	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
and	O
thirty	O
stone	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
about	O
three	O
hundred	O
pounds	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
returned	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
it	O
blew	O
very	O
hard	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
deck	O
being	O
so	O
full	O
of	O
lumber	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
hoist	O
the	O
boats	O
in	O
,	O
we	O
moored	O
them	O
astern	O
.	O

About	O
midnight	O
,	O
the	O
storm	O
continuing	O
,	O
our	O
six	O
oared	O
cutter	O
filled	O
with	O
water	O
and	O
broke	O
adrift	O
;	O
the	O
boat-keeper	O
,	O
by	O
whose	O
neglect	O
this	O
accident	O
happened	O
,	O
being	O
on	O
board	O
her	O
,	O
very	O
narrowly	O
escaped	O
drowning	O
by	O
catching	O
hold	O
of	O
the	O
stern	O
ladder	O
.	O

As	O
it	O
was	O
tide	O
of	O
flood	O
when	O
she	O
went	O
from	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
we	O
knew	O
that	O
she	O
must	O
drive	O
up	O
the	O
harbour	O
;	O
yet	O
as	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
her	O
would	O
be	O
an	O
irremediable	O
misfortune	O
,	O
I	O
suffered	O
much	O
anxiety	O
till	O
I	O
could	O
send	O
after	O
her	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
then	O
some	O
hours	O
before	O
she	O
was	O
brought	O
back	O
,	O
having	O
driven	O
many	O
miles	O
with	O
the	O
stream	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
another	O
party	O
to	O
fetch	O
the	O
guanicoes	O
which	O
our	O
people	O
had	O
shot	O
the	O
night	O
before	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
found	O
nothing	O
left	O
except	O
the	O
bones	O
,	O
the	O
tygers	O
having	O
eaten	O
the	O
flesh	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
cracked	O
the	O
bones	O
of	O
the	O
limbs	O
to	O
come	O
at	O
the	O
marrow	O
.	O

Several	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
had	O
been	O
fifteen	O
miles	O
up	O
the	O
country	O
in	O
search	O
of	O
fresh	O
water	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
not	O
find	O
the	O
least	O
rill	O
:	O
we	O
had	O
sunk	O
several	O
wells	O
to	O
a	O
considerable	O
depth	O
where	O
the	O
ground	O
appeared	O
moist	O
,	O
but	O
upon	O
visiting	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
mortification	O
to	O
find	O
that	O
,	O
all	O
together	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
yield	O
more	O
than	O
thirty	O
gallons	O
in	O
twenty	O
four	O
hours	O
:	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
discouraging	O
circumstance	O
,	O
especially	O
as	O
our	O
people	O
,	O
among	O
other	O
expedients	O
,	O
had	O
watched	O
the	O
guanicoes	O
,	O
and	O
seen	O
them	O
drink	O
at	O
the	O
salt	O
ponds	O
.	O

therefore	O
determined	O
to	O
leave	O
the	O
place	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
ship	O
could	O
be	O
got	O
into	O
a	O
little	O
order	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
six	O
oared	O
cutter	O
repaired	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
hauled	O
up	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
for	O
that	O
purpose	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
27th	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
ashore	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
to	O
try	O
for	O
more	O
guanicoes	O
,	O
found	O
the	O
scull	O
and	O
bones	O
of	O
a	O
man	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
brought	O
off	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
young	O
guanicoe	O
alive	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
all	O
agreed	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
beautiful	O
creatures	O
we	O
had	O
ever	O
seen	O
:	O
it	O
soon	O
grew	O
very	O
tame	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
suck	O
our	O
fingers	O
like	O
a	O
calf	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
all	O
our	O
care	O
and	O
contrivances	O
to	O
feed	O
it	O
,	O
it	O
died	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
of	O
this	O
day	O
it	O
blew	O
so	O
hard	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
keep	O
a	O
considerable	O
number	O
of	O
hands	O
continually	O
by	O
the	O
sheet	O
anchor	O
,	O
as	O
there	O
was	O
too	O
much	O
reason	O
to	O
fear	O
that	O
our	O
cables	O
would	O
part	O
,	O
which	O
however	O
did	O
not	O
happen	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
that	O
were	O
on	O
shore	O
with	O
the	O
carpenters	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
repairing	O
the	O
cutter	O
on	O
the	O
south	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
found	O
two	O
more	O
springs	O
of	O
tolerable	O
water	O
about	O
two	O
miles	O
from	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
direct	O
line	O
from	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
station	O
.	O

To	O
these	O
springs	O
I	O
sent	O
twenty	O
hands	O
early	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
with	O
some	O
small	O
casks	O
called	O
Barecas	PNM
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
turns	O
they	O
brought	O
on	O
board	O
a	O
tun	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
great	O
want	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
myself	O
about	O
twelve	O
miles	O
up	O
the	O
river	O
in	O
my	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
weather	O
then	O
growing	O
bad	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
:	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
see	O
,	O
was	O
very	O
broad	O
;	O
there	O
were	O
in	O
it	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
islands	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
which	O
were	O
very	O
large	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
make	O
no	O
doubt	O
but	O
that	O
it	O
penetrates	O
the	O
country	O
for	O
some	O
hundreds	O
of	O
miles	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
upon	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
islands	O
that	O
I	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
found	O
there	O
such	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
birds	O
,	O
that	O
when	O
they	O
rose	O
they	O
literally	O
darkened	O
the	O
sky	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
walk	O
a	O
step	O
without	O
treading	O
upon	O
their	O
eggs	O
.	O

As	O
they	O
kept	O
hovering	O
over	O
our	O
heads	O
at	O
a	O
little	O
distance	O
,	O
the	O
men	O
knocked	O
down	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
with	O
stones	O
and	O
sticks	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
off	O
several	O
hundreds	O
of	O
their	O
eggs	O
.	O

After	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
I	O
left	O
the	O
island	O
and	O
landed	O
upon	O
the	O
main	O
,	O
where	O
our	O
men	O
dressed	O
and	O
eat	O
their	O
eggs	O
,	O
though	O
there	O
were	O
young	O
birds	O
in	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
saw	O
no	O
traces	O
of	O
inhabitants	O
on	O
either	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
but	O
great	O
numbers	O
of	O
guanicoes	O
,	O
in	O
herds	O
of	O
sixty	O
or	O
seventy	O
together	O
:	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
however	O
suffer	O
us	O
to	O
approach	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
stood	O
and	O
gazed	O
at	O
us	O
from	O
the	O
hills	O

In	O
this	O
excursion	O
the	O
Surgeon	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
of	O
my	O
party	O
,	O
shot	O
a	O
tyger-cat	O
,	O
a	O
small	O
but	O
very	O
fierce	O
animal	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
much	O
wounded	O
,	O
it	O
maintained	O
a	O
very	O
sharp	O
contest	O
with	O
my	O
dog	O
for	O
a	O
considerable	O
time	O
before	O
it	O
was	O
killed	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
29th	O
,	O
we	O
completed	O
our	O
ballast	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
strength	O
of	O
the	O
tide	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
constant	O
gales	O
of	O
wind	O
rendered	O
a	O
very	O
difficult	O
and	O
laborious	O
task	O
:	O
we	O
also	O
got	O
on	O
board	O
another	O
ton	O
of	O
water	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
morning	O
of	O
the	O
30th	O
,	O
the	O
weather	O
was	O
so	O
bad	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
send	O
a	O
boat	O
on	O
shore	O
;	O
but	O
employed	O
all	O
hands	O
on	O
board	O
in	O
setting	O
up	O
the	O
rigging	O
.	O

It	O
grew	O
more	O
moderate	O
however	O
about	O
noon	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
then	O
sent	O
a	O
boat	O
to	O
procure	O

The	O
two	O

a	O
very	O
uncommon	O
and	O
beautiful	O
sight	O

The	O

At	O
break	O
of	O
day	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
20th	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
off	O
Cape	PNM
Fairweather	PNM
,	O
which	O
bore	O
about	O
west	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
four	O
leagues	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
here	O
but	O
thirteen	O
fathom	O
water	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
appears	O
necessary	O
to	O
give	O
that	O
Cape	O
a	O
good	O
birth	O
.	O

From	O
this	O
place	O
I	O
ran	O
close	O
in	O
shore	O
to	O
Cape	PNM
Virgin	PNM
Mary	PNM
,	O
but	O
I	O
found	O
the	O
coast	O
to	O
lie	O
S.S.E.	O
very	O
different	O
from	O

and	O
a	O
long	O
spit	O
of	O

running	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
of	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
for	O
above	O
a	O
league	O
:	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
I	O
worked	O
up	O
close	O
to	O
this	O
spit	O
of	O
sand	O
,	O
having	O
seen	O
many	O
guanicoes	O
feeding	O
in	O
the	O
vallies	O
as	O
we	O
went	O
along	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
smoke	O
all	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
about	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
leagues	O
up	O
the	O
streight	O
,	O
upon	O
the	O
north	O
shore	O

At	O
this	O
place	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
in	O
fifteen	O
fathom	O
water	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
Tamar	O
was	O
so	O
far	O
to	O
leeward	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
could	O
not	O
fetch	O
the	O
anchoring	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
kept	O
under	O
way	O
all	O
night	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
at	O
day-break	O
,	O
I	O
got	O
again	O
under	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
seeing	O
the	O
same	O
smoke	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
observed	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
,	O
I	O
stood	O
in	O
for	O
it	O

anchored	O
about	O
two	O

that	O
they	O
were	O
in	O

Just	O
as	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
,	O
I	O
saw	O
with	O
my	O
glass	O
exactly	O
what	O
was	O
seen	O
by	O
the	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
Wager	O
,	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
horsemen	O
riding	O
backward	O
and	O
forward	O

directly	O

of	O
the	O

somewhat	O

as	O
an	O
invitation	O
to	O
us	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
shore	O

As	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
desirous	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
these	O
people	O
were	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
out	O
my	O
twelve	O
oar	O
'd	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
towards	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
with	O
Mr.	O
Marshall	O
,	O
my	O
Second	O
Lieutenant	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
party	O
of	O

very	O
well	O
armed	O
;	O
Mr.	O
Cumming	O

my	O
First	O

,	O
following	O
in	O
the	O

.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
within	O
a	O
little	O
distance	O
of	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
,	O
as	O
near	O
as	O
I	O
can	O
guess	O
,	O
about	O
five	O
hundred	O
people	O
,	O
some	O
on	O
foot	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
greater	O
part	O
on	O
horseback	O
:	O
they	O
drew	O
up	O
upon	O
a	O
stoney	O
spit	O
,	O
which	O
ran	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
upon	O
which	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
bad	O
landing	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
water	O
was	O
shallow	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
stones	O
very	O
large	O
.	O

The	O
people	O
on	O
shore	O
kept	O
waving	O
and	O
hallooing	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
understood	O
,	O
were	O
invitations	O
to	O
land	O
;	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
perceive	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
any	O
weapons	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
however	O
I	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
retire	O
to	O
a	O
little	O
distance	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
they	O
immediately	O
complied	O
:	O
they	O
continued	O
to	O
shout	O
with	O
great	O
vociferation	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
we	O
landed	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
without	O
great	O
difficulty	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
's	O
crew	O
being	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
middle	O
in	O
water	O
.	O

I	O
drew	O
up	O
my	O
people	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
with	O
my	O
officers	O
at	O
their	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
orders	O
that	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
should	O
move	O
from	O
that	O
station	O
,	O
till	O
I	O
should	O
either	O
call	O
or	O
beckon	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
went	O
forward	O
alone	O
,	O
towards	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
but	O
perceiving	O
that	O
they	O
retired	O
as	O
I	O
advanced	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
should	O
come	O
near	O
:	O
as	O
it	O
happened	O
,	O
my	O
signals	O
were	O
understood	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
who	O
afterwards	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
Chief	O
,	O
came	O
towards	O
me	O
:	O
he	O
was	O
of	O
a	O
gigantic	O
stature	O
,	O
and	O
seemed	O
to	O
realize	O
the	O
tales	O
of	O
monsters	O
in	O
a	O
human	O
shape	O
:	O
he	O
had	O
the	O
skin	O
of	O
some	O
wild	O
beast	O
thrown	O
over	O
his	O
shoulders	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
Scotch	O
Highlander	O
wears	O
his	O
plaid	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
painted	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
most	O
hideous	O
appearance	O
I	O
ever	O
beheld	O
:	O
round	O
one	O
eye	O
was	O
a	O
large	O
circle	O
of	O
white	O
,	O
a	O
circle	O
of	O
black	O
surrounded	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
his	O
face	O
was	O
streaked	O
with	O
paint	O
of	O
different	O
colours	O
;	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
measure	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
if	O
I	O
may	O
judge	O
of	O
his	O
height	O
by	O
the	O
proportion	O
of	O
his	O
stature	O
to	O
my	O
own	O
,	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
much	O
less	O
than	O
seven	O
feet	O
.	O

When	O
this	O
frightful	O
Colossus	O
came	O
up	O
,	O
we	O
muttered	O
somewhat	O
to	O
each	O
other	O
as	O
a	O
salutation	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
then	O
walked	O
with	O
him	O
towards	O
his	O
companions	O
,	O
to	O
whom	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
advanced	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
sit	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
all	O
readily	O
complied	O
:	O
there	O
were	O
among	O
them	O
many	O
women	O
,	O
who	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
proportionably	O
large	O
;	O
and	O
few	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
were	O
less	O
than	O
the	O
Chief	O
who	O
had	O
come	O
forward	O
to	O
meet	O
me	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
heard	O
their	O
voices	O
very	O
loud	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
near	O
,	O
I	O
perceived	O
a	O
good	O
number	O
of	O
very	O
old	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
chanting	O
some	O
unintelligible	O
words	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
doleful	O
cadence	O
I	O
ever	O
heard	O
,	O
with	O
an	O
air	O
of	O
serious	O
solemnity	O
,	O
which	O
inclined	O
me	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
religious	O
ceremony	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
painted	O
and	O
clothed	O
nearly	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
manner	O
;	O
the	O
circles	O
round	O
the	O
two	O
eyes	O
were	O
in	O
no	O
instance	O
of	O
one	O
colour	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
universally	O
black	O
and	O
white	O
,	O
some	O
being	O
white	O
and	O
red	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
red	O
and	O
black	O
;	O
their	O
teeth	O
were	O
as	O
white	O
as	O
ivory	O
,	O
remarkably	O
even	O
and	O
well	O
set	O
;	O
but	O
except	O
the	O
skins	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
wore	O
with	O
the	O
hair	O
inwards	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
naked	O
,	O
a	O
few	O
only	O
having	O
upon	O
their	O
legs	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
boot	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
short	O
pointed	O
stick	O
fastened	O
to	O
each	O
heel	O
,	O
which	O
served	O
as	O
a	O
spur	O
.	O

Having	O
looked	O
round	O
upon	O
these	O
enormous	O
goblins	O
with	O
no	O
small	O
astonishment	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
some	O
difficulty	O
made	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
still	O
galloping	O
up	O
sit	O
down	O
with	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
out	O
a	O
quantity	O
of	O
yellow	O
and	O
white	O
beads	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
distributed	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
they	O
received	O
with	O
very	O
strong	O
expressions	O
of	O
pleasure	O
:	O
I	O
then	O
took	O
out	O
a	O
whole	O
piece	O
of	O
green	O
silk	O
riband	O
,	O
and	O
giving	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
it	O
into	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
the	O
person	O
that	O
sat	O
next	O
take	O
hold	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
on	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
it	O
would	O
reach	O
:	O
all	O
this	O
while	O
they	O
sat	O
very	O
quietly	O
,	O
nor	O
did	O
any	O
of	O
those	O
that	O
held	O
the	O
riband	O
attempt	O
to	O
pull	O
it	O
from	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
perceived	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
still	O
more	O
delighted	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
than	O
with	O
the	O
beads	O
.	O

While	O
the	O
riband	O
was	O
thus	O
extended	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
out	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
scissars	O
,	O
and	O
cut	O
it	O
between	O
each	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
that	O
held	O
it	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
left	O
about	O
a	O
yard	O
in	O
the	O
possession	O
of	O
every	O
one	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
afterwards	O
tied	O
about	O
their	O
heads	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
suffered	O
it	O
to	O
remain	O
without	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
touching	O
it	O
while	O
I	O
was	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

Their	O
peaceable	O
and	O
orderly	O
behaviour	O
on	O
this	O
occasion	O
certainly	O
did	O
them	O
honour	O
,	O
especially	O
as	O
my	O
presents	O
could	O
not	O
extend	O
to	O
the	O
whole	O
company	O
:	O
neither	O
impatience	O
to	O

the	O
new	O
finery	O

nor	O
curiosity	O
to	O
gain	O
a	O

of	O
me	O
and	O
what	O
I	O
was	O
doing	O

brought	O
any	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
from	O
the	O
station	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
allotted	O
him	O

It	O
would	O
be	O
very	O
natural	O
for	O
those	O
who	O
have	O
read	O
Gay	O
's	O
fables	O
;	O
if	O
they	O
form	O
an	O
idea	O
of	O
an	O

almost	O
naked	O
returning	O
to	O
his	O

in	O
the	O
woods	O
adorned	O
with	O
European	O
trinkets	O

to	O
think	O
of	O
the	O
monkey	O
that	O
had	O
seen	O
the	O
world	O
;	O
yet	O
before	O
we	O
despise	O
their	O
fondness	O
for	O
glass	O

beads	O

ribands	O
and	O
other	O
things	O
,	O
which	O
among	O
us	O
are	O
held	O
in	O
no	O

themselves	O

the	O

that	O
those	O

state	O
of	O

have	O
nothing	O
that	O
resembles	O
glass	O

so	O

as	O

resembles	O
a	O

;	O
the	O
value	O
which	O
we	O
set	O
upon	O
a	O

is	O
more	O

the	O

a	O

The	O
people	O

however	O

whom	O

had	O

were	O
not	O

strangers	O
to	O

for	O
upon	O
a	O
closer	O
attention	O

I	O
perceived	O
among	O
them	O
one	O
woman	O
who	O
had	O
bracelets	O
either	O
of	O
brass	O
,	O
or	O
very	O
pale	O
gold	O
,	O
upon	O
her	O
arms	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
beads	O
of	O
blue	O
glass	O

strung	O
upon	O
two	O
long	O
queues	O
of	O
hair	O
,	O
which	O
being	O
parted	O
at	O
the	O
top	O
,	O
hung	O
down	O
over	O

before	O
her	O
:	O
she	O
was	O
of	O
a	O
most	O
enormous	O
size	O

and	O
her	O
face	O
was	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
more	O
frightfully	O
painted	O
than	O
the	O
rest	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
desire	O
to	O
learn	O
where	O
she	O
got	O
her	O
beads	O
and	O
bracelets	O
,	O
and	O
enquired	O
by	O
all	O
the	O
signs	O
I	O
could	O
devise	O
,	O
but	O
found	O
it	O
impossible	O
to	O
make	O
myself	O
understood	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
shewed	O
me	O
the	O
bowl	O
of	O
a	O
tobacco	O
pipe	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
made	O
of	O
a	O
red	O
earth	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
soon	O
found	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
tobacco	O
among	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
person	O
made	O
me	O
understand	O
that	O
he	O
wanted	O
some	O
:	O
upon	O
this	O
I	O
beckoned	O
to	O
my	O
people	O
,	O
who	O
remained	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
drawn	O
up	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
left	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
three	O

The	O
Indians	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
observed	O
,	O
kept	O
their	O
eyes	O
almost	O
continually	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
no	O
sooner	O
saw	O
some	O

they	O
all	O
rose	O
up	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
clamour	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
leaving	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
supposed	O
to	O
get	O
their	O
arms	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
probably	O
left	O
at	O
a	O
little	O
distance	O
:	O
to	O
prevent	O
mischief	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
an	O
end	O
to	O
the	O
alarm	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
thus	O
accidentally	O
been	O
spread	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
ran	O
to	O
meet	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
were	O
,	O
in	O
consequence	O
of	O
my	O
signal	O
,	O
coming	O
from	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
within	O
hearing	O
I	O
hallooed	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
only	O
one	O
come	O
up	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
tobacco	O
that	O
he	O
could	O

from	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O

saw	O
this	O

they	O
recovered	O
from	O
their	O
surprize	O

and	O
every	O
one	O
returned	O
to	O
his	O
station	O

a	O
very	O

man	O

who	O
came	O
up	O

sung	O
a	O

I	O
much	O

I	O

smile	O
at	O

would	O
strike	O
us	O
rather	O
as	O

of	O
a	O

as	O
an	O

as	O

Upon	O

for	O

We	O
walked	O
more	O

twelve	O

found	O
great	O
plenty	O
of	O

not	O

We	O
fell	O
in	O
with	O
a	O
great	O

and	O
always	O
close	O

In	O
many	O

we	O
found	O
plenty	O

a	O
variety	O

probably	O
would	O

to	O

In	O
the	O

The	O

our	O

so	O
voraciously	O

that	O

found	O

that	O

had	O
no	O

The	O
water	O

the	O

I	O
went	O

about	O
four	O

the	O
fallen	O

I	O
found	O
it	O

indeed	O

not	O

difficult	O

dangerous	O
to	O
get	O
up	O

one	O

made	O

in	O
an	O

she	O
was	O
full	O
of	O
water	O

We	O
got	O
on	O

as	O
well	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
;	O
and	O
afterwards	O
,	O
with	O
great	O

hauled	O
her	O
up	O
upon	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O

here	O
we	O
contrived	O
to	O
stop	O
the	O
hole	O
in	O
her	O
bottom	O
,	O
so	O
as	O
that	O
we	O
made	O
a	O
shift	O
to	O
get	O
her	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
river	O

was	O

On	O
each	O

of	O
this	O

there	O
are	O
the	O
finest	O

I	O
ever	O
saw	O

and	O
I	O
make	O
no	O

that	O

the	O

a	O

on	O

one	O

I	O
had	O

they	O
slept	O

soon	O

out	O
of	O
their	O

by	O
the	O

the	O

the	O

horrid	O
beyond	O

:	O
the	O
tone	O
was	O
hollow	O

deep	O

so	O
that	O
the	O

of	O
whatever	O
kind	O

were	O
certainly	O
large	O

and	O
the	O

nearer	O

nearer	O

the	O

every	O

a	O

six	O
leagues	O
farther	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
saw	O
a	O
low	O
rocky	O
island	O
bearing	O
S.E.	O
by	O
E.	O
distant	O
about	O
five	O
miles	O
:	O
here	O
we	O
brought	O
to	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
sounded	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
forty	O
fathom	O
water	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
bottom	O
of	O
white	O
sand	O
.	O

This	O
island	O
is	O
about	O
three	O
leagues	O
distant	O
from	O
the	O
land	O
we	O
were	O
coasting	O
,	O
which	O
here	O
forms	O
a	O
very	O
deep	O
bay	O
,	O
and	O
bears	O
E.	O
by	O
N.	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
island	O
on	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
the	O
long	O
tufts	O
of	O
grass	O
:	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
sea	O
break	O
at	O
a	O
good	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
during	O
the	O
night	O
stood	O
off	O
and	O
on	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
at	O
three	O
o'clock	O
we	O
made	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
in	O
for	O
the	O
land	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
a	O
harbour	O
.	O

At	O
six	O
,	O
the	O
east	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
rocky	O
island	O
bore	O
W.S.W.	O
distant	O
about	O
three	O
miles	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
soundings	O
then	O
were	O
sixteen	O
fathom	O
,	O
with	O
rocky	O
ground	O
,	O
but	O
when	O
we	O
got	O
within	O
the	O
island	O
we	O
had	O
twenty	O
fathom	O
,	O
with	O
fine	O
white	O
sand	O
.	O

The	O
coast	O
from	O
this	O
rocky	O
island	O
lies	O
E.	O
by	O
S.	O
distant	O
about	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
leagues	O
,	O
where	O
there	O
are	O
two	O
low	O
islands	O
,	O
which	O
make	O
the	O
eastermost	O
land	O
in	O
sight	O
.	O

At	O
eight	O
o'clock	O
we	O
saw	O
an	O
opening	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
an	O
harbour	O
,	O
bearing	O
E.S.E.	O
and	O
being	O
between	O
two	O
and	O
three	O
leagues	O
distant	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
discovery	O
we	O
brought	O
to	O
,	O
and	O
sent	O
a	O
boat	O
from	O
each	O
of	O
the	O
ships	O
to	O
examine	O
the	O
opening	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
beginning	O
to	O
blow	O
very	O
hard	O
soon	O
after	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
weather	O
growing	O
thick	O
,	O
with	O
heavy	O
rain	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
stand	O
out	O
to	O
sea	O
with	O
both	O
the	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
without	O
great	O
difficulty	O
that	O
we	O
cleared	O
the	O
two	O
rocky	O
islands	O
which	O
were	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
of	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
now	O
a	O
great	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
under	O
much	O
concern	O
lest	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
blown	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
boats	O
left	O
behind	O
:	O
however	O
,	O
about	O
three	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
the	O
weather	O
clearing	O
up	O
,	O
I	O
tacked	O
and	O
stood	O
in	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
presently	O
after	O
had	O
the	O
satisfaction	O
to	O
see	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
boats	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
long	O
way	O
to	O
leeward	O
of	O
us	O
.	O

I	O
immediately	O
bore	O
down	O
to	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
her	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
Tamar	O
's	O
boat	O
,	O
with	O
Mr.	O
Hindman	O
,	O
the	O
Second	O
Lieutenant	O
,	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
who	O
having	O
been	O
on	O
shore	O
in	O
the	O
opening	O
,	O
had	O
ventured	O
off	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
the	O
great	O
sea	O
and	O
bad	O
weather	O
,	O
to	O
inform	O
me	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
found	O
a	O
fine	O
harbour	O
:	O
we	O
immediately	O
stood	O
in	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
it	O
equally	O
beyond	O
his	O
report	O
and	O
our	O
expectations	O
:	O
the	O
entrance	O
is	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
every	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
perfectly	O
safe	O
,	O
the	O
depth	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
being	O
from	O
ten	O
to	O
seven	O
fathom	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
this	O
harbour	O
to	O
consist	O
of	O
two	O
little	O
bays	O
on	O
the	O
starboard	O
side	O
,	O
where	O
ships	O
may	O
anchor	O
in	O
great	O
safety	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
each	O
of	O
which	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
fine	O
rivulet	O
of	O
fresh	O
water	O
.	O

Soon	O
after	O
we	O
entered	O
an	O
harbour	O
of	O
much	O
greater	O
extent	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
called	O
PORT	O
EGMONT	O
,	O
in	O
honour	O
of	O
the	O
earl	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
then	O
First	O
Lord	O
of	O
the	O
Admiralty	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
finest	O
harbours	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

The	O
mouth	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
S.E.	O
distant	O
seven	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
low	O
rocky	O
island	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
good	O
mark	O
to	O
know	O
it	O
by	O
:	O
within	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
about	O
two	O
miles	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
between	O
seventeen	O

eighteen	O

water	O
;	O
and	O
about	O
three	O
leagues	O
to	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

there	O
is	O
a	O
remarkable	O
white	O

off	O
which	O
a	O

may	O
anchor	O

there	O
is	O
an	O

In	O

in	O
for	O
this	O
sandy	O
beach	O
,	O
the	O
two	O
low	O
rocky	O
islands	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
difficult	O
to	O
clear	O
when	O
the	O
weather	O
obliged	O
us	O
to	O
stand	O
off	O
,	O
appear	O
to	O
the	O

and	O
Port	PNM

is	O
about	O
sixteen	O

of	O
these	O
islands	O

We	O
moored	O
in	O
ten	O

with	O
fine	O

ground	O
.	O

The	O
northermost	O
point	O
of	O
the	O

shore	O
was	O

two	O

Soon	O

In	O

there	O

about	O
seven	O

to	O

a	O
bite	O
of	O

Nor	O
were	O

out	O
one	O
day	O
to	O

reported	O

at	O
his	O

that	O
four	O
creatures	O
of	O
great	O
fierceness	O
,	O
resembling	O
wolves	O
,	O
ran	O
up	O
to	O
their	O
bellies	O
in	O
the	O
water	O
to	O
attack	O
the	O
people	O
in	O
his	O

that	O
as	O
they	O

they	O
had	O

The	O
next	O

after	O
this	O
happened	O

I	O
went	O
upon	O
the	O
southern	O
shore	O
myself	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
found	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
largest	O
sea	O
lions	O
I	O
had	O
ever	O
seen	O
:	O
as	O
the	O

crew	O
were	O
now	O
well	O
armed	O

they	O
immediately	O
engaged	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
during	O
the	O
contest	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
animals	O
was	O
seen	O
running	O
towards	O
us	O
:	O
he	O
was	O
fired	O
at	O
before	O
he	O
came	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
presently	O
killed	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
afterwards	O
wished	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
take	O
him	O
alive	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
aware	O
of	O
his	O
attack	O
,	O
I	O
dare	O
say	O
might	O
easily	O
have	O
been	O
done	O
.	O

When	O
any	O
of	O
these	O
creatures	O
got	O
sight	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
,	O
though	O
at	O
ever	O
so	O
great	O
a	O

ran	O
directly	O
at	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
five	O
of	O

in	O
their	O
size	O

and	O
the	O
shape	O
of	O
the	O
tail	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
they	O
bore	O
a	O
greater	O
resemblance	O
to	O
a	O

They	O
are	O

their	O

There	O
are	O
great	O
numbers	O
of	O
them	O
upon	O
this	O
coast	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
perhaps	O
easy	O
to	O
guess	O
how	O
they	O
first	O
came	O
hither	O

for	O
these	O

at	O

one	O
hundred	O
leagues	O

from	O
the	O
main	O
:	O
they	O
burrow	O
in	O
the	O
ground	O
like	O
a	O
fox	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
have	O
frequently	O
seen	O
pieces	O
of	O
seal	O
which	O
they	O
have	O
mangled	O

and	O
the	O

Port	PNM

till	O
Sunday	O
the	O
27th	O
of	O

we	O

again	O
at	O
eight	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O

with	O
the	O

we	O
were	O
scarcely	O
got	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
Port	O
before	O
it	O
began	O
to	O
blow	O
very	O
hard	O

and	O
the	O
weather	O
became	O
so	O
thick	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O

I	O
now	O
most	O
heartily	O
wished	O
myself	O
again	O
at	O
anchor	O
in	O
the	O
harbour	O
we	O
had	O
quitted	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
satisfaction	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
weather	O
become	O
clear	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
continued	O
to	O
blow	O
very	O

after	O

in	O

I	O

for	O
I	O
frequently	O

During	O

The	O

at	O

we	O

to	O
three	O
low	O

which	O
lie	O
about	O

From	O
these	O

four	O

to	O
two	O

I	O
called	O

In	O
the	O
south	O
part	O
of	O
this	O

there	O
is	O
an	O

which	O
has	O
the	O

about	O

there	O

When	O
we	O
were	O

we	O

The	O

at	O
a	O

The	O

;	O
the	O

As	O

in	O
which	O

there	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
very	O

,	O
Mr.	O
Dean	O
,	O
the	O
Master	O
of	O
the	O

came	O
on	O

finding	O
from	O

sprung	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
ship	O
little	O
better	O
than	O
a	O

I	O
determined	O
to	O
go	O
into	O
the	O
harbour	O

and	O
try	O
to	O
unload	O
her	O
there	O
,	O
although	O
the	O
narrowness	O
of	O
the	O

the	O
rapidity	O

it	O

very	O
hard	O
in	O
the	O

,	O
both	O
the	O
Tamar	O
and	O
the	O

made	O
signals	O
of	O

I	O
immediately	O
sent	O
my	O

who	O
found	O
that	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
they	O
were	O

they	O
had	O

were	O
in	O
the	O

the	O
very	O

were	O

the	O

from	O
the	O

As	O

now	O
found	O
that	O

every	O

gave	O
up	O

my	O
design	O
of	O
taking	O
the	O

sent	O
all	O

and	O
make	O

I	O
also	O
lent	O
her	O
my	O

to	O
complete	O
such	O

work	O
as	O
they	O
wanted	O

and	O
determined	O

the	O
moment	O
she	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
condition	O
to	O
put	O

this	O
was	O
doing	O
,	O
Captain	O
Mouat	O
,	O
who	O
commanded	O
the	O
Tamar	O
,	O
informed	O
me	O
that	O
his	O
rudder	O
was	O
sprung	O

and	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
fear	O
it	O
would	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
become	O
wholly	O
unserviceable	O

Upon	O
this	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
carpenter	O
of	O
the	O
Dolphin	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
Tamar	O
,	O
to	O
examine	O
the	O
rudder	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
reported	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
bad	O
that	O
in	O
his	O
opinion	O
the	O
vessel	O
could	O
not	O
proceed	O
in	O
her	O
voyage	O
without	O
a	O
new	O
one	O
.	O

A	O
new	O
one	O
however	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
in	O
our	O
power	O
to	O
procure	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
therefore	O
desired	O
Captain	O
Mouat	O
to	O
get	O
his	O
forge	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
secure	O
his	O
rudder	O
with	O
iron	O
clamps	O
in	O
the	O
best	O
manner	O
he	O
could	O
,	O
hoping	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
Streight	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
timber	O
might	O
be	O
found	O
which	O
would	O
furnish	O
him	O
with	O
a	O
better	O

On	O
Wednesday	O
the	O
13th	O
,	O
the	O
store-ship	O
being	O
ready	O
for	O
sea	O

I	O
put	O
on	O

her	O
one	O

was	O
well	O

three	O

four	O
of	O
my	O
seamen	O
to	O
assist	O

her	O

I	O

two	O

Saturday	O
the	O
16th	O

about	O
six	O

the	O
distance	O

five	O

at	O
nine	O

we	O
saw	O
a	O
strange	O

to	O
the	O

standing	O
after	O

On	O
the	O
17th	O

,	O
Cape	PNM

and	O
the	O
strange	O
ship	O
still	O
followed	O
us	O

On	O
the	O
18th	O
we	O
passed	O
the	O
first	O
Narrow	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
I	O
perceived	O
the	O
strange	O
ship	O
to	O
have	O
shaped	O
the	O

course	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
time	O
she	O
had	O

seen	O
us	O
,	O
shortening	O
or	O
making	O
sail	O
as	O
we	O
did	O
,	O
she	O
became	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
much	O
speculation	O
and	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
obliged	O
,	O
after	O
I	O
had	O
got	O
through	O
the	O
first	O
Narrow	O
,	O
to	O
bring	O
to	O
for	O
the	O
store-ship	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
astern	O
,	O
I	O
imagined	O
she	O
would	O
speak	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
I	O
put	O
the	O
ship	O
in	O
the	O
best	O
order	O
I	O
could	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
passed	O
the	O
Narrow	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
me	O
lying	O

he	O
did	O
the	O
same	O
about	O
four	O
miles	O

me	O

In	O
this	O
situation	O
we	O
remained	O

and	O
the	O
tide	O
setting	O
us	O
over	O
to	O
the	O

came	O
to	O

the	O
wind	O
however	O
shifted	O
before	O

and	O
at	O
day-break	O
I	O
saw	O
our	O

at	O

about	O
three	O

of	O
us	O

As	O
it	O
was	O
then	O
tide	O
of	O
flood	O

I	O
thought	O
of	O
working	O
through	O
the	O

but	O
seeing	O
the	O
stranger	O
get	O
under	O

,	O
and	O
work	O
up	O
towards	O
us	O
,	O
I	O
ran	O
directly	O
over	O
into	O
Gregory	PNM
Bay	PNM
,	O
and	O
brought	O
the	O
ship	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
spring	O
upon	O
our	O
cable	O
:	O
I	O
also	O
got	O
eight	O

were	O
all	O
we	O
could	O
get	O
at	O

out	O
of	O

brought	O
them	O
over	O
on	O

In	O
the	O

time	O
the	O
ship	O
continued	O
to	O
work	O
up	O
towards	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
various	O
were	O
our	O

about	O

showed	O
no	O

It	O
happened	O
about	O

the	O

as	O
she	O
was	O
endeavouring	O
to	O

Still	O

I	O
showed	O

a	O

the	O

At	O

the	O

On	O

and	O
then	O
returned	O

with	O
an	O

The	O

told	O
me	O

that	O
near	O

he	O
had	O
fallen	O
in	O
with	O
a	O
few	O

who	O
had	O
given	O
him	O
a	O
dog	O

and	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
women	O
had	O
offered	O
him	O
a	O
child	O
which	O
was	O
sucking	O
at	O
her	O
breast	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
scarcely	O
necessary	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
he	O
refused	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
offer	O
seems	O
to	O
degrade	O
these	O
poor	O
forlorn	O
savages	O
more	O
than	O
any	O
thing	O
in	O
their	O
appearance	O
or	O
manner	O
of	O
life	O
:	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
a	O
strange	O
depravity	O
of	O
nature	O
that	O
leaves	O
them	O
destitute	O
of	O

a	O
most	O

At	O
six	O

at	O

at	O
two	O

The	O

In	O

again	O
the	O

to	O

that	O

notwithstanding	O
all	O

On	O

At	O

the	O
day	O

though	O
the	O

at	O

at	O

At	O
six	O

This	O

,	O
a	O
remarkable	O
cape	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
shore	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
bearing	O
N.E.	O
distant	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
miles	O
.	O

This	O
cape	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
very	O
lofty	O
and	O
steep	O
,	O
lies	O
N.N.W.	O
by	O
compass	O
from	O
Cape	PNM
Upright	PNM
,	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
about	O
three	O
leagues	O
.	O

The	O
south	O
shore	O
in	O
this	O
place	O
had	O
a	O
very	O
bad	O
appearance	O
,	O
many	O
sunken	O
rocks	O
lying	O
about	O
it	O
to	O
a	O
considerable	O
distance	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
the	O
sea	O
breaks	O
very	O
high	O
.	O

At	O
four	O
the	O
weather	O
became	O
very	O
thick	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
south	O
shore	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
get	O
no	O
anchoring-place	O
;	O
we	O
therefore	O
tacked	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
shore	O
.	O

At	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
after	O
six	O
I	O
made	O
the	O
Tamar	O
's	O
signal	O
to	O
come	O
under	O
our	O
stern	O
,	O
and	O
ordered	O
her	O
to	O
keep	O
ahead	O
of	O
us	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
show	O
lights	O
,	O
and	O
fire	O
a	O
gun	O
every	O
time	O
she	O
changed	O
her	O
tack	O
.	O

At	O
seven	O
,	O
it	O
cleared	O
up	O
for	O
a	O
moment	O
just	O
to	O
show	O
us	O
the	O
north	O
shore	O
,	O
bearing	O
W.	O
by	O
N.	O
;	O
we	O
tacked	O
immediately	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
eight	O
the	O
wind	O
shifted	O
from	O
N.N.W.	O
to	O
W.N.W.	O
and	O
blew	O
with	O
great	O
violence	O
.	O

Our	O
situation	O
was	O
now	O
very	O
alarming	O
;	O
the	O
storm	O
increased	O
every	O
minute	O
,	O
the	O
weather	O
was	O
extremely	O
thick	O
,	O
the	O
rain	O
seemed	O
to	O
threaten	O
another	O
deluge	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
long	O
dark	O
night	O
before	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
a	O
narrow	O
channel	O
,	O
and	O
surrounded	O
on	O
every	O
side	O
by	O
rocks	O
and	O
breakers	O
.	O

We	O
attempted	O
to	O
clew	O
up	O
the	O
mizen-topsail	O
,	O
but	O
before	O
this	O
service	O
could	O
be	O
done	O
it	O
was	O
blown	O
all	O
to	O
rags	O
:	O
we	O
then	O
brought	O
to	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
main	O
and	O
fore-topsail	O
close	O
reefed	O
,	O
and	O
upon	O
the	O
cap	O
,	O
keeping	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
head	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
west	O
;	O
but	O
there	O
being	O
a	O
prodigious	O
sea	O
,	O
it	O
broke	O
over	O
us	O
so	O
often	O
that	O
the	O
whole	O
deck	O
was	O
almost	O
continually	O
under	O
water	O
.	O

At	O
nine	O
,	O
by	O
an	O
accidental	O
breaking	O
of	O
the	O
fog	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
high	O
Cape	PNM
on	O
the	O
north	O
shore	O
that	O
has	O
been	O
just	O
mentioned	O
,	O
bearing	O
east	O
,	O
at	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
distance	O
,	O
but	O
had	O
entirely	O
lost	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
Tamar	O
.	O

At	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
after	O
three	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
we	O
suddenly	O
perceived	O
ourselves	O
close	O
to	O
a	O
high	O
land	O
on	O
the	O
south	O
shore	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
we	O
wore	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
to	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
.	O

The	O
gale	O
still	O
continued	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
with	O
increasing	O
violence	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
rain	O
poured	O
down	O
in	O
torrents	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
manner	O
,	O
immersed	O
in	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
expected	O
every	O
moment	O
to	O
be	O
among	O
the	O
breakers	O
.	O

The	O
long	O
wished-for	O
day	O
at	O
length	O
broke	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
weather	O
was	O
still	O
so	O
thick	O
that	O
no	O
land	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
knew	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
far	O
distant	O
,	O
till	O
after	O
six	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
south	O
shore	O
at	O
about	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
two	O
miles	O
;	O
and	O
soon	O
after	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
Tamar	O
:	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
Cape	PNM
Monday	PNM
bore	O
S.E.	O
distant	O
about	O
four	O
miles	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
violence	O
of	O
the	O
gale	O
not	O
abating	O
,	O
we	O
bore	O
away	O
.	O

About	O
seven	O
,	O
both	O
ships	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
in	O
the	O
bay	O
which	O
lies	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
of	O
Cape	PNM
Monday	PNM
,	O
notwithstanding	O
the	O
sea	O
that	O
rolled	O
in	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
glad	O
to	O
get	O
anchorage	O
any	O
where	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
now	O
been	O
twice	O
within	O
four	O
leagues	O
of	O
Tuesday	PNM
's	PNM
Bay	PNM
,	O
at	O
the	O
western	O
entrance	O
of	O
the	O
Streight	O

and	O
had	O
been	O
twice	O
driven	O
back	O
ten	O
or	O
twelve	O
leagues	O
by	O
such	O
storms	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
now	O
just	O
experienced	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
season	O
is	O
so	O
far	O
advanced	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
when	O
we	O
attempted	O
the	O
passage	O
of	O
this	O
Streight	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
most	O
difficult	O
and	O
dangerous	O
undertaking	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
blows	O
a	O
hurricane	O
incessantly	O
night	O
and	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
rain	O
is	O
as	O
violent	O
and	O
constant	O
as	O
the	O
wind	O
,	O
with	O
such	O
fogs	O
as	O
often	O
render	O
it	O
impossible	O
to	O

any	O

This	O
day	O
our	O
best	O
bower	O
cable	O
being	O
quite	O
rubbed	O
to	O
pieces	O
,	O
we	O
cut	O
it	O
into	O
junk	O
,	O
and	O
bent	O
a	O
new	O
one	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
rounded	O
with	O
old	O
rigging	O
eight	O
fathom	O
from	O
the	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
following	O
,	O
the	O
Tamar	O
parted	O
a	O
new	O
best	O
bower	O
cable	O
,	O
it	O
being	O
cut	O
by	O
the	O
rock	O
,	O
and	O
drove	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
where	O
she	O
was	O
brought	O
up	O
at	O
a	O
very	O
little	O
distance	O
from	O
some	O
rocks	O
,	O
against	O
which	O
she	O
must	O
otherwise	O
have	O

.	O

At	O
seven	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
of	O
the	O
29th	O
,	O
we	O
weighed	O
and	O
found	O
our	O
small	O
bower	O
cable	O
very	O
much	O
rubbed	O
by	O
the	O
foul	O
ground	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
cut	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
six	O
and	O
twenty	O
fathom	O
of	O
it	O
off	O

it	O
again	O

In	O
about	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
the	O
Tamar	O
,	O
being	O
very	O
near	O
the	O
rocks	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
purchase	O
her	O
anchor	O
,	O
made	O
signals	O
of	O
distress	O

I	O
was	O
therefore	O
obliged	O
to	O
stand	O
into	O
the	O
bay	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
anchored	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
hawsers	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
Tamar	O
,	O
and	O
heaved	O
her	O
up	O
while	O
she	O
purchased	O
her	O
anchor	O
,	O
after	O
which	O
we	O
heaved	O
her	O
to	O
windward	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
noon	O
,	O
being	O
got	O
into	O
a	O
proper	O
birth	O
,	O
she	O
anchored	O
again	O

We	O
continued	O
in	O
our	O
station	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
a	O
gale	O
came	O
on	O
at	O
W.N.W.	O
which	O
was	O
still	O
more	O
violent	O
than	O
any	O
that	O
had	O
preceded	O
it	O
;	O
the	O
water	O
was	O
torn	O
up	O
all	O
round	O
us	O

and	O
carried	O
much	O
higher	O
than	O
the	O
masts	O

a	O
dreadful	O
sea	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
rolling	O
in	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
knowing	O
the	O
ground	O
to	O
be	O
foul	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
constant	O
apprehension	O
of	O
parting	O
our	O
cables	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
case	O
we	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
almost	O
instantly	O
dashed	O
to	O
atoms	O
against	O
the	O
rocks	O
that	O
were	O
just	O
to	O

of	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
upon	O
which	O
the	O
sea	O
broke	O
with	O
inconceivable	O
fury	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
noise	O
not	O
less	O
loud	O
than	O
thunder	O

We	O
lowered	O
all	O
the	O
main	O

let	O
go	O
the	O
small	O

on	O
the	O

midnight	O

the	O

up	O
our	O

About	O
one	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
the	O
weather	O
became	O
somewhat	O
more	O

continued	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
dark	O

tempestuous	O
,	O
till	O
midnight	O
,	O
when	O
the	O

the	O
S.W.	O
and	O
soon	O
afterwards	O
it	O
became	O
comparatively	O
calm	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
of	O
April	O

we	O
had	O
a	O
stark	O

with	O
now	O

then	O
some	O
light	O

from	O

but	O
the	O
weather	O
was	O
again	O
thick	O
with	O
hard	O
rain	O

and	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
current	O
setting	O
strongly	O
to	O
the	O

At	O
four	O
o'clock	O
we	O
got	O
up	O
the	O
lower	O
yards	O

unbent	O
the	O
sheet	O
cable	O
,	O
and	O
weighed	O
the	O
small	O
bower	O
;	O
at	O
eight	O
we	O
weighed	O
the	O
best	O
bower	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
the	O
cable	O
very	O
much	O
rubbed	O
in	O
several	O
places	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
considered	O
as	O
a	O
great	O
misfortune	O
,	O
it	O
being	O
a	O
fine	O
new	O
cable	O

which	O
never	O

At	O

soon	O

calm	O

and	O
a	O
thick	O
fog	O
coming	O
on	O
with	O
hard	O
rain	O

we	O
veered	O

the	O
stream	O
cable	O

and	O
with	O
a	O
warp	O
to	O
the	O
Tamar	O
,	O
heaved	O
the	O

upon	O
the	O

in	O
two	O

twenty	O

At	O
six	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O

we	O
had	O
strong	O
gales	O
at	O
W.N.W.	O
with	O
violent	O
squalls	O
and	O
much	O
rain	O
,	O
and	O
continued	O
in	O
our	O
station	O
till	O
the	O
morning	O
of	O
the	O
3d	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
sent	O
the	O

with	O
an	O

from	O

at	O
the	O

The	O

about	O
five	O

The	O

they	O
had	O
with	O
them	O
a	O
large	O
piece	O
of	O
whale	O
blubber	O

which	O
stunk	O
intolerably	O

and	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
tore	O
it	O
to	O
pieces	O
with	O
his	O

gave	O
it	O
about	O

who	O
devoured	O
it	O
with	O
the	O
voracity	O
of	O
a	O

They	O
did	O
not	O
however	O
look	O
upon	O
what	O
they	O
saw	O
in	O
the	O
possession	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
with	O
indifference	O
;	O
for	O
while	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
asleep	O
,	O
they	O
cut	O
off	O
the	O

his	O
jacket	O
with	O
a	O
sharp	O
flint	O
which	O
they	O
use	O
as	O
a	O

About	O
eight	O
o'clock	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
little	O
or	O
no	O

At	O
noon	O
,	O
Cape	PNM
Upright	PNM
bore	O
W.S.W.	O
distant	O
three	O
leagues	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
six	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
we	O
anchored	O
in	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
southern	O
shore	O
,	O
which	O
lies	O
about	O
a	O
league	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
of	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
,	O
and	O
had	O
fifteen	O
fathom	O
water	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
were	O
lying	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
taking	O
in	O
wood	O
and	O
water	O
,	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
Indians	O
in	O
a	O
canoe	O
came	O
round	O
the	O
western	O
point	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
landed	O
opposite	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
made	O
a	O
fire	O
.	O

We	O
invited	O
them	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
by	O
all	O
the	O
signs	O
we	O
could	O
devise	O
,	O
but	O
without	O
success	O
;	O
I	O
therefore	O
took	O
the	O
jolly	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
introduced	O
myself	O
by	O
making	O
them	O
presents	O
of	O
several	O
trifles	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
much	O
gratified	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
became	O
very	O
intimate	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
:	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
spent	O
some	O
time	O
together	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
away	O
my	O
people	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
for	O
some	O
bread	O
,	O
and	O
remained	O
on	O
shore	O
with	O
them	O
alone	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
boat	O
returned	O
with	O
the	O
bread	O
,	O
I	O
divided	O
it	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
remarked	O
with	O
equal	O
pleasure	O
and	O
surprise	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
the	O
biscuit	O
happened	O
to	O
fall	O
,	O
not	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
offered	O
to	O
touch	O
it	O
till	O
I	O
gave	O
my	O
consent	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
some	O
of	O
my	O
people	O
were	O
cutting	O
a	O
little	O
grass	O
for	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
sheep	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
still	O
left	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
length	O
the	O
Indians	O
perceiving	O
what	O
they	O
were	O
doing	O
,	O
ran	O
immediately	O
,	O
and	O
tearing	O
up	O
all	O
the	O
weeds	O
they	O
could	O
get	O
,	O
carried	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
which	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
short	O
time	O
was	O
filled	O
almost	O
up	O
to	O
her	O
gunwale	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
much	O
gratified	O
by	O
this	O
token	O
of	O
their	O
goodwill	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
could	O
perceive	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
pleased	O
with	O
the	O
pleasure	O
that	O
I	O
expressed	O
upon	O
the	O
occasion	O
:	O
they	O
had	O
indeed	O
taken	O
such	O
a	O
fancy	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
returned	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
they	O
all	O
got	O
into	O
their	O
canoe	O
,	O
and	O
followed	O
me	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
near	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
they	O
stopped	O
,	O
and	O
gazed	O
at	O
her	O
as	O
if	O
held	O
in	O
surprise	O
by	O
a	O
mixture	O
of	O
astonishment	O
and	O
terror	O
;	O
but	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
without	O
some	O
difficulty	O
,	O
I	O
prevailed	O
upon	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
of	O
them	O
to	O
venture	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
entered	O
the	O
ship	O
I	O
made	O
them	O
several	O
presents	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
little	O
time	O
they	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
perfectly	O
at	O
ease	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
desirous	O
to	O
entertain	O
them	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
midshipmen	O
played	O
upon	O
the	O
violin	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
my	O
people	O
danced	O
;	O
at	O
this	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
much	O
delighted	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
impatient	O
to	O
show	O
their	O
gratitude	O
,	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
went	O
over	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
side	O
into	O
the	O
canoe	O
,	O
and	O
fetched	O
up	O
a	O
seal	O
skin	O
bag	O
of	O
red	O
paint	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
smeared	O
the	O
fiddler	O
's	O
face	O
all	O
over	O
with	O
it	O
:	O
he	O
was	O
very	O
desirous	O
to	O
pay	O
me	O
the	O
same	O
compliment	O
,	O
which	O
however	O
I	O
thought	O
fit	O
to	O
decline	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
made	O
many	O
very	O
vigorous	O
efforts	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
better	O
of	O
my	O
modesty	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
without	O
some	O
difficulty	O
that	O
I	O
defended	O
myself	O
from	O
receiving	O
the	O
honour	O
he	O
designed	O
me	O
in	O
my	O
own	O
despight	O
.	O

After	O
having	O
diverted	O
and	O
entertained	O
them	O
several	O
hours	O
,	O
I	O
intimated	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
proper	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
;	O
but	O
their	O
attachment	O
was	O
such	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
an	O
easy	O
matter	O
to	O
get	O
them	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

Their	O
canoe	O
was	O
not	O
of	O
bark	O
,	O
but	O
of	O
planks	O
sewed	O
together	O

On	O
Sunday	O
the	O
7th	O
,	O
at	O
six	O

in	O
the	O

weighed	O

with	O
a	O

at	O

fine	O

At	O

At	O

and	O
the	O

us	O
to	O

we	O

as	O
we	O

that	O

the	O

When	O

spring	O
up	O

that	O
the	O

which	O
could	O

be	O

spread	O

also	O
placed	O

that	O
we	O

nothing	O

the	O
jolly	O
boat	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
alteration	O
which	O
this	O
made	O
in	O

inconceivable	O
:	O
for	O
the	O
weight	O
of	O
the	O

It	O
is	O
probable	O
,	O
that	O
whoever	O
shall	O
read	O
this	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
difficulties	O
and	O
dangers	O
which	O
attended	O
our	O
passage	O
through	O
the	O
Streight	PNM
of	PNM
Magellan	PNM
,	O
will	O
conclude	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
ought	O
never	O
to	O
be	O
attempted	O
again	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
all	O
ships	O
which	O
shall	O
hereafter	O
sail	O
a	O
western	O
course	O
from	O
Europe	PNM
into	O

I	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
who	O
have	O
been	O
twice	O
round	O
Cape	PNM
Horn	PNM
,	O
am	O
of	O
a	O
different	O
opinion	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
at	O
a	O
proper	O
season	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
,	O
not	O
only	O
a	O
single	O
vessel	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
large	O
squadron	O
might	O
pass	O
the	O
Streight	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
three	O
weeks	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
proper	O
season	O
,	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
at	O
the	O
eastern	O
entrance	O
some	O
time	O
in	O
the	O
month	O
of	O
December	O
.	O

One	O
great	O
advantage	O
of	O
this	O
passage	O
,	O
is	O
the	O
facility	O
with	O
which	O
fish	O
is	O
almost	O

and	O
many	O
other	O

in	O
great	O
abundance	O
;	O
for	O
to	O
this	O
I	O
impute	O
the	O
heathiness	O
of	O
my	O
ship	O

not	O
a	O

the	O
hardship	O
and	O
labour	O
which	O
they	O
endured	O
in	O
the	O
passage	O

which	O
cost	O
us	O
seven	O
weeks	O

at	O

At	O

About	O

the	O

This	O

the	O

When	O
the	O

the	O

The	O
boats	O
brought	O
off	O
a	O
great	O
quantity	O
of	O
very	O
fine	O
fish	O

which	O
they	O
had	O
caught	O
with	O

and	O
as	O
soon	O

them	O
on	O

At	O
seven	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
we	O
anchored	O
with	O
the	O
small	O
bower	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
bank	O
which	O
the	O

had	O

This	O

is	O
about	O

Soon	O
after	O
we	O
were	O
come	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O

I	O
sent	O
out	O
the	O

to	O
endeavour	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
wood	O
and	O
water	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
I	O
observed	O
the	O
shore	O
to	O
be	O
rocky	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
surf	O
to	O
break	O
with	O
great	O
violence	O
upon	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
all	O
the	O
men	O
to	O
put	O
on	O
cork	O
jackets	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
sent	O
with	O
us	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
use	O
of	O
upon	O
such	O
occasions	O

By	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
these	O
jackets	O
,	O
which	O
not	O
only	O
assisted	O
the	O
men	O
in	O
swimming	O
,	O
but	O
prevented	O
their	O
being	O
bruised	O
against	O
the	O
rocks	O
,	O
we	O
got	O
off	O
a	O
considerable	O
quantity	O
of	O
water	O
and	O
wood	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
without	O
such	O
assistance	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
done	O
:	O
there	O
was	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
another	O
species	O
of	O
danger	O
here	O
,	O
against	O
which	O
cork	O
jackets	O
afforded	O
no	O
defence	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
sea	O
abounded	O
with	O
sharks	O
of	O
an	O
enormous	O
size	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
saw	O
a	O
man	O
in	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
would	O
dart	O
into	O
the	O
very	O
surf	O
to	O
seize	O
him	O
:	O
our	O
people	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
happily	O
escaped	O
them	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
were	O
many	O
times	O
very	O
near	O
:	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
upwards	O
of	O
twenty	O
feet	O
long	O
,	O
came	O
close	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
boats	O
that	O
was	O
watering	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
seized	O
a	O
large	O
seal	O
,	O
instantly	O
devoured	O
it	O
at	O
one	O
mouthful	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
myself	O
saw	O
another	O
of	O
nearly	O
the	O

size	O

do	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
under	O
the	O
ship	O

Our	O
people	O
killed	O
and	O
sent	O
off	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
goats	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
thought	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
the	O
best	O
venison	O
in	O
England	PNM
;	O
and	O
I	O
observed	O

that	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
appeared	O
to	O

been	O
caught	O
and	O
marked	O

slit	O
in	O
a	O
manner	O
that	O
could	O
not	O

happened	O
by	O

We	O
had	O
also	O
fish	O
in	O
such	O
plenty	O

that	O
one	O

with	O

catch	O

in	O
a	O

would	O
serve	O
a	O
large	O

two	O

many	O

This	O
evening	O
,	O
the	O
surf	O
running	O
very	O
high	O

the	O
gunner	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
seamen	O
who	O
were	O
on	O
shore	O
with	O
the	O

were	O

the	O

therefore	O
,	O
when	O
she	O
came	O
on	O

the	O
last	O

left	O
them	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
more	O
convenient	O
watering-place	O
,	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
to	O
the	O

about	O
the	O
middle-way	O
between	O
the	O
north	O

points	O
of	O
the	O
island	O

there	O
being	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
less	O

where	O
the	O

first	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O

The	O
tide	O
here	O
set	O
twelve	O
hours	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
,	O
and	O
twelve	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
very	O
convenient	O
,	O
for	O
as	O
the	O
wind	O
was	O
southerly	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
swell	O
,	O
the	O
boats	O
could	O
not	O
otherwise	O
have	O
got	O
on	O
board	O
with	O
their	O
water	O
.	O

We	O
got	O
off	O
ten	O
tons	O
of	O
water	O
from	O
the	O
new	O
watering-place	O
this	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
a	O
boat	O
to	O
fetch	O
off	O
the	O
gunner	O
and	O
seaman	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
left	O
on	O
shore	O
at	O
the	O
old	O
watering-place	O
the	O
night	O
before	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
surf	O
was	O
still	O
so	O
great	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
seaman	O
,	O
who	O
could	O
not	O
swim	O
,	O
was	O
afraid	O
to	O
venture	O
:	O
he	O
was	O
therefore	O
again	O
left	O
behind	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
gunner	O
stayed	O
with	O
him	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
this	O
was	O
reported	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
another	O
boat	O
to	O
inform	O
them	O
that	O
as	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
appearances	O
of	O
the	O
weather	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
it	O
would	O
soon	O
blow	O
hard	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
afraid	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
driven	O
off	O
the	O
bank	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
the	O
consequence	O
of	O
which	O
would	O
be	O
that	O
they	O
must	O
be	O
left	O
behind	O
upon	O
the	O
island	O

When	O
the	O
boat	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
surf	O
,	O
the	O
people	O
on	O

delivered	O
my	O

upon	O
which	O
the	O
gunner	O
swam	O
through	O
the	O
surf	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
on	O

the	O
seaman	O
,	O
though	O
he	O

I	O
stood	O
for	O
the	O

which	O
as	O
we	O
drew	O

it	O
had	O
a	O

it	O
was	O
surrounded	O

judged	O
this	O

to	O
be	O
about	O
five	O
miles	O

and	O
from	O
each	O

a	O

running	O
out	O

the	O
surge	O
broke	O

there	O
was	O

a	O

We	O

perceived	O
that	O
it	O

appeared	O
upon	O

were	O
at	O

They	O
presently	O
made	O
several	O

fires	O

we	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
a	O

When	O
I	O
knew	O
the	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
forbear	O
standing	O
close	O
round	O
the	O
island	O
with	O
the	O

though	O
I	O
also	O
knew	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O
procure	O
any	O

the	O

The	O
natives	O
ran	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
abreast	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
shouting	O
and	O
dancing	O
;	O
they	O
also	O
frequently	O
brandished	O
their	O
long	O
spears	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
threw	O
themselves	O
backward	O
,	O
and	O
lay	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
motionless	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
dead	O
:	O
this	O
we	O
understood	O
as	O
a	O
menace	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
kill	O
us	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
ventured	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O

As	O
we	O
were	O
sailing	O
along	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
we	O
took	O
notice	O
that	O
in	O
one	O
place	O
the	O
natives	O
had	O
fixed	O
upright	O
in	O
the	O
sand	O
two	O
spears	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
fastened	O
several	O
things	O
that	O
fluttered	O
in	O
the	O
air	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
every	O
moment	O
kneeling	O
down	O
before	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
supposed	O
,	O
invoking	O
the	O
assistance	O
of	O
some	O
invisible	O
Being	O
to	O
defend	O
them	O
against	O
us	O

While	O
I	O
was	O
thus	O
circumnavigating	O
the	O
island	O
with	O
the	O

I	O
sent	O
the	O

when	O

the	O

set	O
up	O
one	O
of	O

heard	O
,	O
pointing	O
at	O

to	O
their	O
spears	O
,	O
and	O
poising	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O
large	O
stones	O
which	O
they	O
took	O
up	O
from	O
the	O
beach	O

Our	O
men	O
on	O
the	O

made	O
all	O
the	O
signs	O
of	O

and	O
good-will	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
devise	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
threw	O
them	O
bread	O
and	O
many	O
other	O
things	O
,	O
none	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
vouchsafed	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
to	O
touch	O
,	O
but	O
with	O
great	O
expedition	O
hauled	O
five	O

six	O
large	O

which	O
we	O
saw	O
lying	O
upon	O
the	O

up	O

When	O
this	O
was	O
done	O
,	O
they	O
waded	O
into	O
the	O
water	O

and	O
seemed	O
to	O
watch	O
for	O
an	O
opportunity	O
of	O
laying	O

Over	O

was	O
an	O
ensign	O
.	O

They	O
made	O
a	O
most	O
hideous	O
and	O
incessant	O
noise	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
many	O
large	O
canoes	O
came	O
down	O
the	O
lake	O
to	O
join	O
them	O
.	O

Our	O
boats	O
were	O
still	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
board	O
them	O
made	O
all	O
the	O
signs	O
of	O
friendship	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
invent	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
canoes	O
came	O
through	O
the	O
inlet	O
and	O
drew	O
near	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
now	O
began	O
to	O
hope	O
that	O
a	O
friendly	O
intercourse	O
might	O
be	O
established	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
soon	O
discovered	O
that	O
the	O
Indians	O
had	O
no	O
other	O
design	O
than	O
to	O
haul	O
the	O
boats	O
on	O
shore	O
:	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
leaped	O
off	O
the	O
rocks	O
,	O
and	O
swam	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
got	O
into	O
that	O
which	O
belonged	O
to	O
the	O
Tamar	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
twinkling	O
of	O
an	O
eye	O
seized	O
a	O
seaman	O
's	O
jacket	O
,	O
and	O
jumping	O
overboard	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
never	O
once	O
appeared	O
above	O
water	O
till	O
he	O
was	O
close	O
in	O
shore	O
among	O
his	O
companions	O
.	O

Another	O
of	O
them	O
got	O
hold	O
of	O
a	O
midshipman	O
's	O
hat	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
knowing	O
how	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
off	O
,	O
he	O
pulled	O
it	O
downward	O
instead	O
of	O
lifting	O
it	O
up	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
owner	O
had	O
time	O
to	O
prevent	O
its	O
being	O
taken	O
away	O
,	O
otherwise	O
it	O
would	O
probably	O
have	O
disappeared	O
as	O
suddenly	O
as	O
the	O
jacket	O
;	O
our	O
men	O
bore	O
all	O
this	O
with	O
much	O
patience	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Indians	O
seemed	O
to	O
triumph	O
in	O
their	O
impunity	O
.	O

About	O
noon	O
,	O
finding	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
anchorage	O
here	O
,	O
I	O
bore	O
away	O
and	O
steered	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
to	O
the	O
westermost	O
point	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
:	O
the	O
boats	O
immediately	O
followed	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
kept	O
sounding	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
get	O
no	O
ground	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
westermost	O
point	O
of	O
this	O
island	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
another	O
,	O
bearing	O
S.W.	O
by	O
W.	O
about	O
four	O
leagues	O
distant	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
about	O
a	O
league	O
beyond	O
the	O
inlet	O
where	O
we	O
had	O
left	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
satisfied	O
with	O
having	O
got	O
rid	O
of	O
us	O
quietly	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
now	O
perceived	O
two	O
large	O
double	O
canoes	O
sailing	O
after	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
with	O
about	O
thirty	O
men	O
in	O
each	O
,	O
all	O
armed	O
after	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
their	O
country	O
.	O

The	O
boats	O
were	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
to	O
leeward	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
canoes	O
,	O
passing	O
between	O
the	O
ship	O
and	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
seemed	O
very	O
eagerly	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
chace	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
I	O
made	O
the	O
signal	O
for	O
the	O
boats	O
to	O
speak	O
with	O
the	O
canoes	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
perceived	O
it	O
,	O
they	O
turned	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
towards	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
who	O
seeing	O
this	O
,	O
were	O
seized	O
with	O
a	O
sudden	O
pannic	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
hauling	O
down	O
their	O
sails	O
,	O
paddled	O
back	O
again	O
at	O
a	O
surprising	O
rate	O
.	O

Our	O
boats	O
however	O
came	O
up	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
notwithstanding	O
the	O
dreadful	O
surf	O
that	O
broke	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
the	O
canoes	O
pushed	O
through	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Indians	O
immediately	O
hauled	O
them	O
up	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
.	O

Our	O
boats	O
followed	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
dreading	O
an	O
invasion	O
of	O
their	O
coast	O
,	O
prepared	O
to	O
defend	O
it	O
with	O
clubs	O
and	O
stones	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
our	O
men	O
fired	O
,	O
and	O
killed	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
of	O
them	O
:	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
received	O
three	O
balls	O
which	O
went	O
quite	O
through	O
his	O
body	O
;	O
yet	O
he	O
afterwards	O
took	O
up	O
a	O
large	O
stone	O
,	O
and	O
died	O
in	O
the	O
action	O
of	O
throwing	O
it	O
against	O
his	O
enemy	O
.	O

This	O
man	O
fell	O
close	O
to	O
our	O
boats	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
Indians	O
who	O
remained	O
unhurt	O
did	O
not	O
dare	O
to	O
attempt	O
the	O
carrying	O
off	O
his	O
body	O
,	O
which	O
gave	O
us	O
an	O
opportunity	O
to	O
examine	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
carried	O
off	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
their	O
dead	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
their	O
way	O
back	O
to	O
their	O
companions	O
at	O
the	O
inlet	O
.	O

Our	O
boats	O
then	O
returned	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
off	O
the	O
two	O
canoes	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
pursued	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
thirty-two	O
feet	O
long	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
somewhat	O
less	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
both	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
curious	O
construction	O
,	O
and	O
must	O
have	O
cost	O
those	O
who	O
made	O
them	O
infinite	O
labour	O
.	O

They	O
consisted	O
of	O
planks	O
exceedingly	O
well	O
wrought	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
many	O
places	O
adorned	O
with	O
carving	O
;	O
these	O
planks	O
were	O
sewed	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
over	O
every	O
seam	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
ship	O
of	O
tortoiseshell	O
,	O
very	O
artificially	O
fastened	O
,	O
to	O
keep	O
out	O
the	O
weather	O
:	O
their	O
bottoms	O
were	O
as	O
sharp	O
as	O
a	O
wedge	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
narrow	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
joined	O
laterally	O
together	O
by	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
strong	O
spars	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
space	O
of	O
about	O
six	O
or	O
eight	O
feet	O
between	O
them	O
:	O
a	O
mast	O
was	O
hoisted	O
in	O
each	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sail	O
was	O
spread	O
between	O
the	O
masts	O
:	O
the	O
sail	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
preserved	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
is	O
now	O
in	O
my	O
possession	O
,	O
is	O
made	O
of	O
matting	O
,	O
and	O
is	O
as	O
neat	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
work	O
as	O
ever	O
I	O
saw	O
:	O
their	O
paddles	O
were	O
very	O
curious	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
cordage	O
was	O
as	O
good	O
and	O
as	O
well	O
laid	O
as	O
any	O
in	O
England	PNM
,	O
though	O
it	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
of	O
the	O
outer	O
covering	O
of	O
the	O
cocoa-nut	O
.	O

When	O
these	O
vessels	O
sail	O
,	O
several	O
men	O
sit	O
upon	O
the	O
spars	O
which	O
hold	O
the	O
canoes	O
together	O
.	O

As	O
the	O
surf	O
which	O
broke	O
very	O
high	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
rendered	O
it	O
impossible	O
to	O
procure	O
refreshments	O
for	O
the	O
sick	O
in	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
I	O
hauled	O
the	O
wind	O
,	O
and	O
worked	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
inlet	O
,	O
being	O
determined	O
to	O
try	O
once	O
more	O
what	O
could	O
be	O
done	O
there	O
.	O

I	O
recovered	O
that	O
station	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
sent	O
the	O
boats	O
to	O
sound	O
the	O
inlet	O
again	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
confirmed	O
the	O
account	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
made	O
before	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
afforded	O
no	O
anchorage	O
for	O
a	O
ship	O
.	O

While	O
the	O
boats	O
were	O
absent	O
,	O
I	O
observed	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
upon	O
the	O
point	O
near	O
the	O
spot	O
where	O
we	O
had	O
left	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
busy	O
in	O
loading	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
large	O
canoes	O
which	O
lay	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
thought	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
troublesome	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
unwilling	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
suffer	O
by	O
another	O
unequal	O
contest	O
with	O
our	O
people	O
,	O
I	O
fired	O
a	O
shot	O
over	O
their	O
heads	O
which	O
produced	O
the	O
effect	O
I	O
intended	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
all	O
disappeared	O
in	O
a	O
moment	O
.	O

Just	O
before	O
the	O
evening	O
closed	O
in	O
,	O
our	O
boats	O
landed	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
a	O
few	O
cocoa-nuts	O
which	O
they	O
brought	O
off	O
,	O
but	O
saw	O
none	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
during	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
rain	O
and	O
hard	O
squalls	O
,	O
I	O
stood	O
off	O
and	O
on	O
with	O
the	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
seven	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
brought	O
to	O
off	O
the	O
inlet	O
.	O

I	O
immediately	O
sent	O
the	O
boats	O
on	O
shore	O
in	O
search	O
of	O
refreshments	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
all	O
the	O
men	O
who	O
were	O
not	O
so	O
ill	O
of	O
the	O
scurvy	O
as	O
to	O
be	O
laid	O
up	O
,	O
go	O
in	O
them	O
;	O
I	O
also	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
myself	O
,	O
and	O
continued	O
there	O
the	O
whole	O
day	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
many	O
houses	O
or	O
wigwams	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
totally	O
deserted	O
,	O
except	O
by	O
the	O
dogs	O
,	O
who	O
kept	O
an	O
incessant	O
howling	O
from	O
the	O
time	O
we	O
came	O
on	O
shore	O
till	O
we	O
returned	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
low	O
mean	O
hovels	O
,	O
thatched	O
with	O
cocoa-nut	O
branches	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
most	O
delightfully	O
situated	O
in	O
a	O
fine	O
grove	O
of	O
stately	O
trees	O
,	O
many	O
of	O
which	O
were	O
the	O
cocoa-nut	O
,	O
and	O
many	O
such	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
utterly	O
unacquainted	O
with	O
.	O

The	O
cocoa-nut	O
trees	O
seem	O
to	O
furnish	O
them	O
with	O
almost	O
all	O
the	O
necessaries	O
of	O
life	O
;	O
particularly	O
food	O
,	O
sails	O
,	O
cordage	O
,	O
timber	O
,	O
and	O
vessels	O
to	O
hold	O
water	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
probably	O
these	O
people	O
always	O
fix	O
their	O
habitations	O
where	O
the	O
trees	O
abound	O
.	O

We	O
observed	O
the	O
shore	O
to	O
be	O
covered	O
with	O
coral	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
shells	O
of	O
very	O
large	O
pearl	O
oysters	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
make	O
no	O
doubt	O
but	O
that	O
as	O
profitable	O
a	O
pearl	O
fishery	O
might	O
be	O
established	O
here	O
as	O
any	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
but	O
little	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
except	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
;	O
we	O
could	O
however	O
perceive	O
that	O
the	O
women	O
had	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
cloth	O
of	O
some	O
kind	O
,	O
probably	O
fabricated	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
stuff	O
as	O
their	O
sail	O
,	O
hanging	O
from	O
the	O
waist	O
as	O
low	O
as	O
the	O
knee	O
;	O
the	O
men	O
were	O
naked	O
.	O

Our	O
people	O
,	O
in	O
rummaging	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
huts	O
,	O
found	O
the	O
carved	O
head	O
of	O
a	O
rudder	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
manifestly	O
belonged	O
to	O
a	O
Dutch	O
longboat	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
very	O
old	O
and	O
worm-eaten	O
.	O

They	O
found	O
also	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
hammered-iron	O
,	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
brass	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
small	O
iron	O
tools	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
ancestors	O
of	O
the	O
present	O
inhabitants	O
of	O
this	O
place	O
probably	O
obtained	O
from	O
the	O
Dutch	O
ship	O
to	O
which	O
the	O
longboat	O
had	O
belonged	O
,	O
all	O
which	O
I	O
brought	O
away	O
with	O
me	O
.	O

Whether	O
these	O
people	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
cut	O
off	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
or	O
whether	O
she	O
was	O
lost	O
upon	O
the	O
island	O
or	O
after	O
she	O
left	O
it	O
,	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
known	O
;	O
but	O
there	O
is	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
she	O
never	O
returned	O
to	O
Europe	PNM
,	O
because	O
no	O
account	O
of	O
her	O
voyage	O
,	O
or	O
of	O
any	O
discoveries	O
that	O
she	O
made	O
,	O
is	O
extant	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
ship	O
sailed	O
from	O
this	O
place	O
in	O
safety	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
perhaps	O
easy	O
to	O
account	O
for	O
her	O
leaving	O
the	O
rudder	O
of	O
her	O
longboat	O
behind	O
her	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
she	O
was	O
cut	O
off	O
by	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
there	O
must	O
be	O
much	O
more	O
considerable	O
remains	O
of	O
her	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
especially	O
of	O
her	O
iron-work	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
all	O
Indian	O
nations	O

who	O
have	O
no	O

me	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
tool	O
exactly	O
in	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
a	O
carpenter	O
's	O
adze	O
,	O
the	O
blade	O
of	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
pearl	O
oyster-shell	O
;	O
possibly	O
this	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
made	O
in	O
imitation	O
of	O
an	O
adze	O
which	O
had	O
belonged	O
to	O
the	O
carpenter	O
of	O
the	O
Dutch	O
Ship	O
,	O
for	O
among	O
the	O
tools	O
that	O
I	O
brought	O
away	O
there	O
was	O
one	O
which	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
remains	O
of	O
such	O
an	O
implement	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
worn	O
away	O
almost	O
to	O
nothing	O
.	O

Close	O
to	O
the	O
houses	O
of	O
these	O
people	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
buildings	O
of	O
another	O
kind	O
,	O
which	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
burying-places	O
,	O
and	O
from	O
which	O
we	O
judged	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
great	O
veneration	O
for	O
their	O
dead	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
situated	O
under	O
lofty	O
trees	O
,	O
that	O
gave	O
a	O
thick	O
shade	O
;	O
the	O
sides	O
and	O
tops	O
were	O
of	O
stone	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
their	O
figure	O
they	O
somewhat	O
resembled	O
the	O
square	O
tombs	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
flat	O
top	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
always	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
in	O
our	O
country	O
churchyards	O
.	O

Near	O
these	O
buildings	O
we	O
found	O
many	O
neat	O
boxes	O
full	O
of	O
human	O
bones	O
,	O
and	O
upon	O
the	O
branches	O
of	O
the	O
trees	O
which	O
shaded	O
them	O
,	O
hung	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
the	O
heads	O
and	O
bones	O
of	O
turtle	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
fish	O
,	O
inclosed	O
in	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
basketwork	O
of	O
reeds	O
:	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
fish	O
we	O
took	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
that	O
nothing	O
remained	O
but	O
the	O
skin	O
and	O
the	O
teeth	O
;	O
the	O
bones	O
and	O
entrails	O
seemed	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
extracted	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
muscular	O
flesh	O
dried	O
away	O
.	O

We	O
sent	O
off	O
several	O
boat-loads	O
of	O
cocoa-nuts	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
quantity	O
of	O
scurvy-grass	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
the	O
island	O
is	O
covered	O
;	O
refreshments	O
which	O
were	O
of	O
infinite	O
service	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
as	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
I	O
believe	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
man	O
among	O
us	O
wholly	O
untouched	O
by	O
the	O
scurvy	O
.	O

The	O
fresh	O
water	O
here	O
is	O
very	O
good	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
scarce	O
;	O
the	O
wells	O
which	O
supply	O
the	O
natives	O
are	O
so	O
small	O
,	O
that	O
when	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
cocoa-nut	O
shells	O
have	O
been	O
filled	O
from	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
are	O
dry	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
they	O
presently	O
fill	O
again	O
,	O
if	O
a	O
little	O
pains	O
were	O
taken	O
to	O
enlarge	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
abundantly	O
supply	O
any	O
ship	O
with	O
water	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
no	O
venomous	O
creature	O
here	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
flies	O
were	O
an	O
intolerable	O
torment	O
,	O
they	O
covered	O
us	O
from	O
head	O
to	O
foot	O
,	O
and	O
filled	O
not	O
only	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
ships	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
great	O
numbers	O
of	O
parrots	O
and	O
parroquets	O
,	O
and	O
several	O
other	O
birds	O
which	O
were	O
altogether	O
unknown	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
we	O
saw	O
also	O
a	O
beautiful	O
kind	O
of	O
dove	O
,	O
so	O
tame	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
frequently	O
came	O
close	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
followed	O
us	O
into	O
the	O
Indian	O
huts	O
.	O

All	O
this	O
day	O
the	O
natives	O
kept	O
themselves	O
closely	O
concealed	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
even	O
make	O
a	O
smoke	O
upon	O
any	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
islands	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
;	O
probably	O
fearing	O
that	O
a	O
smoke	O
might	O
discover	O
the	O
place	O
of	O
their	O
retreat	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
we	O
all	O
returned	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

This	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
lies	O
in	O

W.	O
and	O
after	O
I	O
got	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
I	O
hauled	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
farther	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
intending	O
to	O
visit	O
the	O
other	O
island	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
seen	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
of	O
that	O
before	O
which	O
the	O
ship	O
lay	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
is	O
distant	O
about	O
sixty-nine	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
Islands	O
of	O
Disappointment	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
direction	O
of	O
W.	O
1/2	O
S	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
at	O
six	O
o'clock	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
sail	O
for	O
the	O
island	O
which	O
I	O
intended	O
to	O
visit	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
reached	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
steered	O
S.W.	O
by	O
W.	O
close	O
along	O
the	O
north	O
east	O
side	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
get	O
no	O
soundings	O
:	O
this	O
side	O
is	O
about	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
leagues	O
long	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
whole	O
makes	O
much	O
the	O
same	O
appearance	O
as	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
having	O
a	O
large	O
salt	O
water	O
lake	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
ship	O
came	O
in	O
sight	O
,	O
the	O
natives	O
ran	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O
in	O
great	O
numbers	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
armed	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
manner	O
as	O
those	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
upon	O
the	O
other	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
kept	O
abreast	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
for	O
several	O
leagues	O
.	O

As	O
the	O
heat	O
of	O
this	O
climate	O
is	O
very	O
great	O
,	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
suffer	O
much	O
by	O
running	O
so	O
far	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
sometimes	O
plunged	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
fell	O
flat	O
upon	O
the	O
sand	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
surf	O
might	O
break	O
over	O
them	O
,	O
after	O
which	O
they	O
renewed	O
the	O
race	O
with	O
great	O
vigour	O
.	O

Our	O
boats	O
were	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
sounding	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
as	O
usual	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
had	O
given	O
strict	O
orders	O
to	O
the	O
officers	O
who	O
commanded	O
them	O
never	O
to	O
molest	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
except	O
it	O
should	O
become	O
absolutely	O
necessary	O
for	O
their	O
own	O
defence	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
try	O
all	O
possible	O
means	O
to	O
obtain	O
their	O
confidence	O
and	O
good-will	O
:	O
our	O
people	O
therefore	O
went	O
as	O
near	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
as	O
they	O
durst	O
for	O
the	O
surf	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
they	O
wanted	O
water	O
;	O
the	O
Indians	O
readily	O
understood	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
directed	O
them	O
to	O
run	O
down	O
farther	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
did	O
,	O
till	O
they	O
came	O
abreast	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
cluster	O
of	O
houses	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
just	O
left	O
upon	O
the	O
other	O
island	O
;	O
to	O
this	O
place	O
the	O
Indians	O
still	O
followed	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
there	O
joined	O
by	O
many	O
others	O
:	O
the	O
boats	O
immediately	O
hauled	O
close	O
into	O
the	O
surf	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
brought	O
to	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
ships	O
,	O
at	O
a	O
little	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
a	O
stout	O
old	O
man	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
long	O
white	O
beard	O
,	O
that	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
very	O
venerable	O
appearance	O
,	O
came	O
down	O
from	O
the	O
houses	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
attended	O
by	O
a	O
young	O
man	O
,	O
and	O
appeared	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
authority	O
of	O
a	O
Chief	O
or	O
King	O
:	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
at	O
a	O
signal	O
which	O
he	O
made	O
,	O
retired	O
to	O
a	O
little	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
then	O
advanced	O
quite	O
to	O
the	O
water	O
's	O
edge	O
;	O
in	O
one	O
hand	O
he	O
held	O
the	O
green	O
branch	O
of	O
a	O
tree	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
other	O
he	O
grasped	O
his	O
beard	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
pressed	O
to	O
his	O
bosom	O
;	O
in	O
this	O
attitude	O
he	O
made	O
a	O
long	O
oration	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
song	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
had	O
a	O
musical	O
cadence	O
which	O
was	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
disagreeable	O
.	O

We	O
regretted	O
infinitely	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
understand	O
what	O
he	O
said	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
less	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
understand	O
any	O
thing	O
which	O
we	O
should	O
say	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
to	O
shew	O
our	O
good-will	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
we	O
threw	O
him	O
some	O
trifling	O
presents	O
,	O
while	O
he	O
was	O
yet	O
speaking	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
would	O
neither	O
touch	O
them	O
himself	O
,	O
nor	O
suffer	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
touched	O
by	O
others	O
till	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
:	O
he	O
then	O
walked	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
threw	O
our	O
people	O
the	O
green	O
branch	O
,	O
after	O
which	O
he	O
took	O
up	O
the	O
things	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
thrown	O
from	O
the	O
boats	O
.	O

Every	O
thing	O
now	O
having	O
a	O
friendly	O
appearance	O
,	O
our	O
people	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
lay	O
down	O
their	O
arms	O
,	O
and	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
having	O
complied	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
midshipmen	O
,	O
encouraged	O
by	O
this	O
testimony	O
of	O
confidence	O
and	O
friendship	O
,	O
leaped	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
with	O
his	O
clothes	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
swam	O
through	O
the	O
surf	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

The	O
Indians	O
immediately	O
gathered	O
round	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
examine	O
his	O
clothes	O
with	O
great	O
curiosity	O
;	O
they	O
seemed	O
particularly	O
to	O
admire	O
his	O
waistcoat	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
willing	O
to	O
gratify	O
his	O
new	O
friends	O
,	O
he	O
took	O
it	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
presented	O
it	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
this	O
courtesy	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
produced	O
a	O
disagreeable	O
effect	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
sooner	O
given	O
away	O
his	O
waistcoat	O
,	O
than	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
very	O
ingeniously	O
untied	O
his	O
cravat	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
moment	O
snatched	O
it	O
from	O
his	O
neck	O
,	O
and	O
ran	O
away	O
with	O
it	O
.	O

Our	O
adventurer	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
to	O
prevent	O
his	O
being	O
stripped	O
by	O
piece-meal	O
,	O
made	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
his	O
way	O
back	O
again	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
:	O
still	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
upon	O
good	O
terms	O
,	O
and	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
swam	O
off	O
to	O
our	O
people	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
bringing	O
a	O
cocoa-nut	O
,	O
and	O
others	O
a	O
little	O
fresh	O
water	O
in	O
a	O
cocoa-nut	O
shell	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
principal	O
object	O
of	O
our	O
boats	O
,	O
was	O
to	O
obtain	O
some	O
pearls	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
to	O
assist	O
them	O
in	O
explaining	O
their	O
meaning	O
,	O
had	O
taken	O
with	O
them	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
pearl	O
oyster	O
shells	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
found	O
in	O
great	O
numbers	O
upon	O
the	O
coast	O
;	O
but	O
all	O
their	O
endeavours	O
were	O
ineffectual	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
,	O
even	O
with	O
this	O
assistance	O
,	O
at	O
all	O
make	O
themselves	O
understood	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
indeed	O
probable	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
succeeded	O
better	O
,	O
if	O
an	O
intercourse	O
of	O
any	O
kind	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
established	O
between	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
our	O
misfortune	O
that	O
no	O
anchorage	O
could	O
be	O
found	O
for	O
the	O
ships	O
.	O

As	O
all	O
Indians	O
are	O
fond	O
of	O
beads	O
,	O
it	O
can	O
scarcely	O
be	O
supposed	O
that	O
the	O
pearls	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
oysters	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
contained	O
,	O
were	O
overlooked	O
by	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
more	O
than	O
probable	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
have	O
continued	O
here	O
a	O
few	O
weeks	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
obtained	O
some	O
of	O
great	O
value	O
in	O
exchange	O
for	O
nails	O
,	O
hatchets	O
,	O
and	O
bill-hooks	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
with	O
more	O
reason	O
,	O
set	O
a	O
much	O
higher	O
value	O
.	O

We	O
observed	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
lake	O
,	O
or	O
lagoon	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
very	O
large	O
vessels	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
which	O
had	O
two	O
masts	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
cordage	O
aloft	O
to	O
support	O
them	O

To	O
these	O

I	O
could	O
account	O

the	O

a	O

upon	O
the	O
north	O

stretched	O

for	O
it	O
was	O
surrounded	O

rendered	O
the	O

more	O

to	O

who	O
were	O

which	O
were	O

at	O

discovered	O
an	O
island	O
bearing	O
north	O

distant	O
about	O

we	O
stood	O

we	O
found	O
it	O
a	O
low	O

island	O
,	O
of	O
a	O
most	O

appearance	O
,	O
and	O
full	O
of	O
wood	O
,	O
among	O
which	O
the	O
cocoa-nut	O
tree	O
was	O
very	O
conspicuous	O
:	O
we	O
saw	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
regret	O
,	O
much	O
foul	O
ground	O
about	O
it	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
the	O
sea	O
broke	O
with	O
a	O
dreadful	O

We	O
steered	O
along	O
the	O
south	O

side	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
judged	O
to	O
be	O
about	O
four	O
leagues	O
in	O
length	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
perceived	O
not	O
only	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
inhabited	O
,	O
but	O
very	O
populous	O
;	O
for	O
presently	O
after	O
the	O
ship	O
came	O
in	O
sight	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
at	O
least	O
a	O
thousand	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
assembled	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
short	O
time	O
more	O
than	O
sixty	O
canoes	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
proas	O
,	O
put	O
off	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
towards	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
lay	O
by	O
to	O
receive	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
soon	O
ranged	O
in	O
a	O
circle	O
round	O
us	O

These	O
vessels	O
were	O
very	O
neatly	O
made	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
clean	O
that	O
they	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
quite	O
new	O
:	O
none	O

them	O
had	O
fewer	O

three	O

some	O

one	O

suddenly	O
jumped	O
out	O

up	O

as	O
soon	O

had	O

upon	O
it	O

and	O
burst	O
into	O
a	O

of	O

started	O
up	O

ran	O

without	O

was	O
impossible	O
to	O

put	O
him	O

which	O
produced	O

after	O

a	O

he	O
leaped	O
overboard	O

all	O

immediately	O

We	O
steered	O
along	O

at	O

The	O

at	O

is	O
so	O
very	O

that	O
the	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
secured	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
to	O
fix	O
upon	O
a	O
place	O
where	O
tents	O
might	O
be	O
erected	O
for	O
the	O

which	O
were	O
now	O
very	O
numerous	O
;	O
not	O
a	O

man	O
being	O
wholly	O
free	O
from	O
the	O
scurvy	O
,	O
and	O
many	O
in	O
the	O
last	O
stage	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
several	O
huts	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
left	O
by	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
and	O
Indians	O
the	O
year	O
before	O
;	O
for	O
this	O
year	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
as	O
yet	O
been	O
at	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
nor	O
was	O
it	O
probable	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
come	O
for	O
some	O

the	O
sun	O
being	O
now	O
almost	O

and	O

set	O
in	O

After	O
I	O
had	O
fixed	O
upon	O
a	O
spot	O
for	O
the	O
tents	O
,	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
of	O
us	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
push	O
through	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
come	O
at	O
the	O
beautiful	O
lawns	O
and	O
meadows	O
of	O
which	O
there	O
is	O
so	O
luxuriant	O
a	O
description	O
in	O
the	O
Account	O
of	O
Lord	O
Anson	O
's	O
Voyage	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
possible	O
kill	O
some	O
cattle	O
.	O

The	O
trees	O
stood	O
so	O
thick	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
place	O
was	O
so	O
overgrown	O
with	O
underwood	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
see	O
three	O
yards	O
before	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
therefore	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
keep	O
continually	O
hallooing	O
to	O
each	O
other	O
,	O
to	O
prevent	O
our	O
being	O
separately	O
lost	O
in	O
this	O
trackless	O
wilderness	O
.	O

As	O
the	O
weather	O
was	O
intolerably	O
hot	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
nothing	O
on	O
besides	O
our	O
shoes	O
,	O
except	O
our	O
shirts	O
and	O
trowsers	O
,	O
and	O
these	O
were	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
short	O
time	O
torn	O
all	O
to	O
rags	O
by	O
the	O
bushes	O
and	O
brambles	O
;	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
with	O
incredible	O
difficulty	O
and	O
labour	O
,	O
we	O
got	O
through	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
surprise	O
and	O
disappointment	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
country	O
very	O
different	O
from	O
the	O
account	O
we	O
had	O
read	O
of	O
it	O
:	O
the	O
lawns	O
were	O
entirely	O
overgrown	O
with	O
a	O
stubborn	O
kind	O
of	O
reed	O
or	O
brush	O
,	O
in	O
many	O
places	O
higher	O
than	O
our	O
heads	O
,	O
and	O
no	O
where	O
lower	O
than	O
our	O
middles	O
,	O
which	O
continually	O
entangled	O
our	O
legs	O
,	O
and	O
cut	O
us	O
like	O
whipcord	O
;	O
our	O
stockings	O
perhaps	O
might	O
have	O
suffered	O
still	O
more	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
wore	O
none	O
.	O

During	O
this	O
march	O
we	O
were	O
also	O
covered	O
with	O
flies	O
from	O
head	O
to	O
foot	O
,	O
and	O
whenever	O
we	O
offered	O
to	O
speak	O
we	O
were	O
sure	O
of	O
having	O
a	O
mouthful	O
,	O
many	O
of	O
which	O
never	O
failed	O
to	O
get	O
down	O
our	O
throats	O
.	O

After	O
we	O
had	O
walked	O
about	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
miles	O
,	O
we	O
got	O
sight	O
of	O
a	O
bull	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
killed	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
before	O
night	O
got	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
as	O
wet	O
as	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
dipt	O
in	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
fatigued	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
scarcely	O
able	O
to	O
stand	O
.	O

We	O
immediately	O
sent	O
out	O
a	O
party	O
to	O
fetch	O
the	O
bull	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
that	O
during	O
our	O
excursion	O
some	O
tents	O
had	O
been	O
got	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sick	O
brought	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
our	O
people	O
were	O
employed	O
in	O
setting	O
up	O
more	O
tents	O
,	O
getting	O
the	O
water-casks	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
clearing	O
the	O
well	O
at	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
filled	O
.	O

This	O
well	O
I	O
imagined	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
same	O
that	O
the	O
Centurion	O
watered	O
at	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
worst	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
during	O
the	O
voyage	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
water	O
was	O
not	O
only	O
brackish	O
,	O
but	O
full	O
of	O
worms	O
.	O

The	O
Road	O
also	O
where	O
the	O
ships	O
lay	O
was	O
a	O
dangerous	O
situation	O
at	O
this	O
season	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
bottom	O
is	O
hard	O
sand	O
and	O
large	O
coral	O
rocks	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
anchor	O
having	O
no	O
hold	O
in	O
the	O
sand	O
,	O
is	O
in	O
perpetual	O
danger	O
of	O
being	O
cut	O
to	O
pieces	O
by	O
the	O
coral	O
;	O
to	O
prevent	O
which	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
possible	O
,	O
I	O
rounded	O
the	O
cables	O
,	O
and	O
buoyed	O
them	O
up	O
with	O
empty	O
water	O
casks	O
.	O

Another	O
precaution	O
also	O
was	O
taught	O
me	O
by	O
experience	O
,	O
for	O
at	O
first	O
I	O
moored	O
,	O
but	O
finding	O
the	O
cables	O
much	O
damaged	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
lie	O
single	O
for	O
the	O
future	O
,	O
that	O
by	O
veering	O
away	O
or	O
heaving	O
in	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
wind	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
always	O
keep	O
them	O
from	O
being	O
slack	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
from	O
rubbing	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
expedient	O
succeeded	O
to	O
my	O
wish	O

At	O
the	O
full	O
and	O
change	O
of	O
the	O
moon	O
,	O
a	O
prodigious	O
swell	O
tumbles	O
in	O
here	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
never	O
saw	O
ships	O
at	O
anchor	O
roll	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
ours	O
did	O
while	O
we	O
lay	O
here	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
once	O
drove	O
in	O
from	O
the	O
westward	O
with	O
such	O
violence	O
,	O
and	O
broke	O
so	O
high	O
upon	O
the	O
reef	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
put	O
to	O
sea	O
for	O
a	O
week	O
;	O
for	O
if	O
our	O
cable	O
had	O
parted	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
wind	O
had	O
been	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
which	O
sometimes	O
happens	O
for	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
together	O
,	O
the	O
ship	O
must	O
inevitably	O
have	O
been	O
lost	O
upon	O
the	O
rocks	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
was	O
myself	O
very	O
ill	O
with	O
the	O
scurvy	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
a	O
tent	O
to	O
be	O
pitched	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
up	O
my	O
residence	O
on	O
shore	O
;	O
where	O
we	O
also	O
erected	O
the	O
armourer	O
's	O
forge	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
repair	O
the	O
iron-work	O
of	O
both	O
the	O
ships	O
.	O

I	O
soon	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
island	O
produced	O
limes	O

sour	O
oranges	O
,	O
cocoa-nuts	O

bread-fruit	O

,	O
guavas	O

and	O
paupaus	O
in	O
great	O
abundance	O

but	O
we	O
found	O
no	O
water-melons	O
,	O
scurvy-grass	O
,	O
or	O
sorrel	O
.	O

Notwithstanding	O
the	O
fatigue	O
and	O
distress	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
endured	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
various	O
climates	O
we	O
had	O
passed	O
through	O
,	O
neither	O
of	O
the	O

had	O
yet	O

a	O

since	O
their	O
sailing	O
from	O
England	PNM
;	O
but	O
while	O
we	O
lay	O
here	O
two	O
died	O
of	O
fevers	O

a	O
disease	O
with	O
which	O
many	O
were	O
seized	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
all	O
recovered	O
very	O
fast	O
from	O
the	O
scurvy	O

I	O
am	O
indeed	O
of	O
opinion	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
unhealthy	O
spots	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
at	O

during	O
the	O
season	O
in	O
which	O
we	O

were	O
violent	O

the	O
heat	O
was	O
so	O
great	O
as	O
to	O
threaten	O
us	O

The	O

was	O

if	O
it	O

the	O

was	O
an	O

The	O
Author	O
of	O
the	O

says	O

that	O
the	O
people	O
on	O

thought	O
it	O
prudent	O
to	O
abstain	O
from	O
fish	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
few	O
which	O
they	O
caught	O
at	O
their	O
first	O
arrival	O
surfeited	O
those	O
who	O
eat	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

But	O
not	O
attending	O
sufficiently	O
to	O
this	O
caution	O
,	O
and	O
too	O
hastily	O
taking	O
the	O
word	O
surfeit	O
in	O
its	O
literal	O
and	O
common	O
acceptation	O
,	O
we	O
imagined	O
that	O
those	O
who	O
tasted	O
the	O
fish	O
when	O
Lord	O
Anson	O
first	O
came	O
hither	O
,	O
were	O
made	O
sick	O
merely	O
by	O
eating	O
too	O
much	O
;	O
whereas	O
,	O
if	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
the	O
case	O
,	O
there	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
no	O
reason	O
for	O
totally	O
abstaining	O
afterwards	O
,	O
but	O
only	O
eating	O
temperately	O
.	O

We	O
however	O
bought	O
our	O
knowlege	O
by	O
experience	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
had	O
cheaper	O
;	O
for	O

all	O
our	O

sparingly	O

were	O
all	O

Besides	O

this	O

The	O

walked	O
up	O

I	O
landed	O

a	O
surly	O

As	O
soon	O

came	O
down	O

a	O

other	O

demanded	O

as	O
we	O
had	O

were	O
at	O

at	O

we	O
bethought	O
ourselves	O
of	O
some	O
pocket	O

and	O
these	O

vouchsafed	O

was	O

somewhat	O
in	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
the	O

but	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
were	O
naked	O

a	O

they	O
wore	O

some	O

We	O

probably	O
some	O

any	O

some	O

The	O

told	O

that	O
none	O

worked	O
in	O
in	O
such	O

than	O
they	O
were	O
generally	O
able	O
to	O

when	O
the	O

was	O

The	O
next	O

,	O
I	O
waited	O
upon	O
the	O
Governor	O

who	O
had	O
sent	O
his	O
coach	O
and	O
six	O
to	O
the	O
water-side	O
for	O
me	O
.	O

He	O
is	O
an	O

man	O
,	O
but	O
is	O
a	O
favourite	O
with	O
all	O
ranks	O
of	O
people	O
:	O
he	O
received	O
me	O
with	O
the	O
greatest	O
politeness	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
only	O
offered	O
me	O
the	O
Company	O
's	O
house	O
in	O
the	O
garden	O
for	O
my	O
residence	O
while	O
I	O
should	O
continue	O
at	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
,	O
but	O
his	O
coach	O
whenever	O
I	O
should	O
think	O
fit	O
to	O
use	O
it	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
was	O
one	O
day	O
at	O
dinner	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
other	O
gentlemen	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
occasion	O
to	O
mention	O
the	O
smoke	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
upon	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
sandy	O
beaches	O
on	O
a	O
desolate	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
surprise	O
with	O
which	O
it	O
had	O
struck	O
me	O
:	O
they	O
then	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
another	O
ship	O
,	O
some	O
time	O
before	O
,	O
had	O
fallen	O
in	O
with	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
seen	O
large	O
smokes	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
although	O
the	O
place	O
was	O
uninhabited	O
,	O
and	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
island	O
:	O
to	O
account	O
for	O
the	O
smokes	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
they	O
told	O
me	O
also	O
,	O
that	O
two	O
Dutch	O
East	O
Indiamen	O
had	O
,	O
about	O
two	O
years	O
before	O
,	O
sailed	O
from	O
Batavia	PNM
for	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
,	PNM
and	O
had	O
never	O
afterwards	O
been	O
heard	O
of	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
supposed	O
that	O
one	O
or	O
both	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
been	O
shipwrecked	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
smokes	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
seen	O
,	O
were	O
made	O
by	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
unfortunate	O
crew	O
:	O
they	O
added	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
more	O
than	O
once	O
sent	O
out	O
vessels	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
there	O
broke	O
so	O
dreadful	O
a	O
sea	O
upon	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
return	O
without	O
attempting	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
heard	O
this	O
melancholy	O
account	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
only	O
regret	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
known	O
it	O
before	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
would	O
then	O
certainly	O
have	O
made	O
every	O
effort	O
in	O
my	O
power	O
to	O
have	O
found	O
these	O
unhappy	O
wretches	O
,	O
and	O
taken	O
them	O
from	O
a	O
place	O
where	O
now	O
,	O
in	O
all	O
probability	O
,	O
they	O
must	O
miserably	O
perish	O
.	O

The	O
Cape	PNM
is	O
certainly	O
a	O
most	O
excellent	O
place	O
for	O
ships	O
to	O
touch	O
at	O
;	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
healthy	O
climate	O

a	O
fine	O
country	O

and	O
abounds	O
with	O
refreshments	O
of	O
every	O
kind	O

The	O
Company	O

is	O
a	O
delightful	O
spot	O

and	O
at	O
the	O

of	O
it	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
paddock	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
Governor	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
are	O
kept	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O

curious	O
animals	O
,	O
and	O
among	O
others	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
was	O

were	O
three	O
fine	O
ostriches	O
,	O
and	O
four	O
zebras	O
of	O
an	O
uncommon	O

I	O
gave	O
all	O
the	O
people	O
leave	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
by	O
turns	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
always	O
contrived	O
to	O
get	O
very	O
drunk	O
with	O
Cape	O
wine	O
before	O
they	O
came	O
back	O

Many	O

came	O
in	O

three	O

during	O
that	O

refreshed	O
our	O

on	O
the	O
6th	O

,	O
and	O
on	O

sailed	O
out	O

with	O
a	O

On	O
Sunday	O
the	O
16th	O
,	O
at	O
six	O
in	O
the	O

,	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Saint	PNM

bearing	O

at	O
the	O
distance	O

about	O
sixteen	O

and	O
about	O
noon	O
,	O
a	O
large	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
shewed	O
French	O
colours	O

We	O
pursued	O
our	O
course	O

and	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
afterwards	O

as	O
we	O
were	O

and	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
from	O
land	O
,	O
the	O
ship	O
suddenly	O
received	O
a	O
rude	O
shock	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
she	O
had	O
struck	O
the	O
ground	O
:	O
this	O
instantly	O
brought	O
all	O
who	O
were	O
below	O
upon	O
the	O
deck	O
in	O
great	O
consternation	O
,	O
and	O
upon	O
looking	O
out	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
to	O
a	O
very	O
large	O
extent	O
,	O
tinged	O
with	O
blood	O
;	O
this	O
put	O
an	O
end	O
to	O
our	O
fears	O

and	O
we	O
concluded	O
that	O
we	O
must	O
have	O
struck	O
either	O
a	O
whale	O
or	O
a	O
grampus	O

three	O

broken	O
off	O

rendered	O
the	O

unserviceable	O

I	O
immediately	O
sent	O
the	O

on	O

who	O

the	O
condition	O

so	O
that	O

he	O
therefore	O
went	O

The	O

is	O
an	O
animal	O
that	O
in	O
size	O

colour	O

These	O

wear	O
also	O
a	O

which	O
they	O
pull	O
up	O

We	O
observed	O
that	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
had	O
a	O
red	O
circle	O
painted	O
round	O
the	O

the	O

of	O
all	O
the	O

were	O
painted	O
black	O

They	O
talked	O
much	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
called	O
out	O
Ca-pi-ta-ne	PNM

in	O

they	O
made	O
no	O

Of	O
their	O
own	O
language	O
we	O
could	O
distinguish	O
only	O
one	O
word	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
chevow	O

we	O
supposed	O
it	O
to	O

When	O
they	O
were	O

they	O
repeated	O
the	O

Every	O

While	O
we	O
stayed	O
on	O

we	O

just	O
turning	O

We	O
observed	O
among	O
them	O
several	O
beads	O

such	O
as	O
I	O
gave	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
two	O

After	O

had	O

about	O
four	O

with	O
these	O

I	O

that	O

did	O
not	O
chuse	O
to	O

more	O
than	O
eight	O
of	O
the	O
number	O

They	O
jumped	O
into	O
the	O
boats	O
with	O
the	O
joy	O

alacrity	O
of	O
children	O
going	O

They	O
sung	O
several	O
of	O
their	O
country	O
songs	O
while	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
on	O

did	O
not	O
express	O
either	O
the	O

wonder	O
which	O
the	O
multiplicity	O

that	O
at	O

I	O
took	O
them	O
down	O
into	O
the	O

where	O
they	O
looked	O
about	O
them	O
with	O
an	O

till	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
happened	O
to	O
cast	O
his	O
eyes	O
upon	O
a	O
looking-glass	O
:	O
this	O
however	O
excited	O
no	O
more	O
astonishment	O

the	O
prodigies	O
which	O
offer	O
themselves	O
to	O
our	O
imagination	O
in	O
a	O

when	O
we	O
converse	O
with	O
the	O

fly	O
in	O
the	O
air	O

and	O
walk	O
upon	O
the	O

without	O
reflecting	O
that	O
the	O
laws	O
of	O
nature	O
are	O
violated	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
afforded	O
them	O
infinite	O
diversion	O
:	O
they	O
advanced	O
,	O
retreated	O
,	O
and	O
played	O
a	O
thousand	O
tricks	O
before	O
it	O
,	O
laughing	O
violently	O
,	O
and	O
talking	O
with	O
great	O
emphasis	O
to	O
each	O

I	O
gave	O
them	O
Some	O
beef	O

pork	O

and	O
other	O
articles	O
of	O
the	O

they	O
eat	O

indiscriminately	O

whatever	O
was	O
offered	O
to	O
them	O

but	O
they	O
would	O
drink	O
nothing	O

water	O

From	O
the	O
cabbin	O
I	O
carried	O
them	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
looked	O
at	O
nothing	O
with	O
much	O
attention	O
,	O
except	O
the	O
animals	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
on	O
board	O
as	O
live	O
stock	O
:	O
they	O
examined	O
the	O
hogs	O
and	O
sheep	O
with	O
some	O
curiosity	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
exceedingly	O
delighted	O
with	O
the	O
Guinea	PNM
hens	O
and	O
turkies	O
;	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
seem	O
to	O

any	O

that	O
they	O
saw	O
except	O
our	O
apparel	O
,	O
and	O
only	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
an	O
old	O
man	O
asked	O
for	O
that	O
:	O
we	O
gratified	O
him	O
with	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
shoes	O
and	O
buckles	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
each	O
of	O
the	O
others	O
I	O
gave	O
a	O
canvas	O
bag	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
I	O
put	O
some	O
needles	O
ready	O
threaded	O
,	O
a	O
few	O

of	O

a	O

a	O

with	O
some	O
sixpences	O

halfpence	O

through	O
which	O
a	O

had	O
been	O
drilled	O

that	O
was	O
fitted	O
with	O
a	O
riband	O
to	O
hang	O
round	O
the	O
neck	O

We	O
offered	O
them	O
some	O
leaves	O
of	O
tobacco	O
,	O
rolled	O
up	O
into	O
what	O
are	O
called	O
Segars	O
and	O
they	O
smoked	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
seem	O
fond	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
showed	O
them	O
the	O
great	O
guns	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
appear	O
to	O
have	O
any	O
notion	O
of	O
their	O
use	O
.	O

After	O
I	O
had	O
carried	O
them	O
through	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
marines	O
to	O
be	O
drawn	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
go	O
through	O
part	O
of	O
their	O
exercise	O

When	O
the	O
first	O
volley	O
was	O
fired	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
struck	O
with	O
astonishment	O
and	O
terror	O
;	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
in	O
particular	O
,	O
threw	O
himself	O
down	O
upon	O
the	O
deck	O

pointed	O
to	O
the	O
muskets	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
striking	O
his	O
breast	O
with	O
his	O
hand	O
,	O
lay	O
some	O
time	O
motionless	O
,	O
with	O
his	O
eyes	O
shut	O
:	O
by	O
this	O
we	O
supposed	O
he	O
intended	O
to	O
shew	O
us	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
unacquainted	O
with	O
fire-arms	O

and	O
their	O
fatal	O
effect	O

The	O
rest	O
seeing	O
our	O
people	O
merry	O
,	O
and	O
finding	O
themselves	O
unhurt	O
,	O
soon	O
resumed	O
their	O
cheerfulness	O
and	O
good	O
humour	O
,	O
and	O
heard	O
the	O
second	O
and	O
third	O
volley	O
fired	O
without	O
any	O
such	O
emotion	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
continued	O
prostrate	O
upon	O
the	O
deck	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
never	O
recovered	O
his	O
spirits	O
till	O
the	O
firing	O
was	O
over	O
.	O

About	O
noon	O
,	O
the	O
tide	O
being	O
out	O
,	O
I	O
acquainted	O
them	O
by	O
signs	O
that	O
the	O
Ship	O
was	O
proceeding	O
farther	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
must	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
:	O
this	O
I	O
soon	O
perceived	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
unwilling	O
to	O
do	O
;	O
all	O
however	O
,	O
except	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
and	O
one	O
more	O
,	O
were	O
got	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
without	O
much-difficulty	O
;	O
buc	O
these	O
stopped	O
at	O
the	O
gang-way	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
turned	O
about	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
aft	O
to	O
the	O
companion	O
ladder	O
,	O
where	O
be	O
stood	O
some	O
time	O
without	O
speaking	O
a	O
word	O
;	O
he	O
then	O
uttered	O
what	O
we	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
prayer	O
;	O
for	O
he	O
many	O
times	O
lifted	O
up	O
his	O
hands	O
and	O
his	O
eyes	O
to	O
the	O
heavens	O
,	O
and	O
spoke	O
in	O
a	O
manner	O
and	O
tone	O
very	O
different	O
from	O
what	O
we	O
had	O
observed	O
in	O
their	O
conversation	O
;	O
his	O
oration	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
rather	O
sung	O
:	O
than	O
said	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
impossible	O
to	O
distinguish	O
one	O
word	O
from	O
another	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
again	O
intimated	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
proper	O
for	O
him	O
to	O
go	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
he	O
pointed	O
to	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
moving	O
his	O
hand	O
round	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
,	O
he	O
paused	O
looked	O
in	O
my	O
face	O
,	O
laughed	O
,	O
and	O
pointed	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
:	O
by	O
this	O
it	O
was	O
easy	O
to	O
understand	O
that	O
he	O
wished	O
to	O
stay	O
on	O
board	O
till	O
sun-set	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
took	O
no	O
little	O
pains	O
to	O
convince	O
him	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
stay	O
so	O
long	O
upon	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
before	O
he	O
could	O
be	O
prevailed	O
upon	O
to	O
go	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
;	O
at	O
length	O
however	O
he	O
went	O
over	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
side	O
with	O
his	O
companion	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
the	O
boat	O
put	O
off	O
they	O
all	O
began	O
to	O
sing	O
,	O
and	O
continued	O
their	O
merriment	O
till	O
they	O
got	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
landed	O
,	O
great	O
numbers	O
of	O
those	O
on	O
shore	O
pressed	O
eagerly	O
to	O
get	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
officer	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
having	O
positive	O
orders	O
to	O
bring	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
off	O
,	O
prevented	O
them	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
without	O
great	O
difficulty	O
,	O
and	O
apparently	O
to	O
their	O
extream	O
mortification	O
and	O
disappointment	O

When	O
the	O
boat	O
returned	O
on	O

I	O
sent	O
her	O
off	O
again	O
with	O
the	O

to	O
sound	O
the	O
shoal	O
that	O

it	O
about	O
three	O

that	O
to	O

We	O

we	O
had	O
an	O

the	O

climbed	O
one	O

hoping	O
that	O
from	O

should	O
obtain	O
a	O

he	O

on	O
the	O

:	O
before	O
he	O
descended	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
he	O
erected	O
pyramid	O

he	O
deposited	O
a	O

containing	O
a	O

In	O
the	O
morning	O
of	O
the	O
24th	O
we	O
took	O
two	O
boats	O
and	O
examined	O
Cordes	O
bay	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
very	O
much	O
inferior	O
to	O
that	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
ship	O
lay	O
;	O
it	O
had	O
indeed	O
a	O
larger	O
lagoon	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
entrance	O
of	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
narrow	O
,	O
and	O
barred	O
by	O
a	O
shoal	O
,	O
on	O
which	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
sufficient	O
depth	O
of	O
water	O
for	O
a	O
ship	O
of	O
burden	O
to	O
float	O
:	O
the	O
entrance	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
also	O
was	O
rocky	O

and	O
within	O
it	O
the	O
ground	O
was	O
foul	O

In	O
this	O
place	O
we	O
saw	O
an	O
animal	O
that	O
resembled	O

it	O
had	O
a	O
cloven	O

we	O

it	O

was	O
as	O
Swift	O

This	O
was	O

at	O

we	O
would	O
fain	O
have	O
trafficked	O
for	O

We	O
shot	O
at	O
this	O
creature	O

but	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
hit	O
it	O
;	O
probably	O
it	O

the	O

at	O
certain	O

I	O
now	O
sent	O
all	O

out	O

in	O
the	O

In	O
this	O
place	O
we	O
remained	O
till	O
Friday	O
the	O
20th	O
,	O
when	O
about	O
noon	O
the	O
clouds	O
gathered	O
very	O
thick	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O

and	O
before	O
one	O
it	O
blew	O
a	O
storm	O

with	O
such	O
rain	O
and	O
hail	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
scarcely	O
ever	O
seen	O

We	O
immediately	O
struck	O
the	O
yards	O

top-masts	O

and	O
having	O
run	O
out	O
two	O
hausers	O
to	O

,	O
we	O
hove	O
the	O

up	O

it	O

we	O
then	O
let	O
go	O
the	O
small	O
bower	O

veered	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
both	O
cables	O
a-head	O
;	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
we	O
carried	O
out	O
two	O
more	O
hausers	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
them	O
fast	O
to	O
two	O

making	O
use	O
of	O
every	O
expedient	O
in	O
our	O
power	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O

The	O
gale	O
continued	O
to	O
increase	O
till	O
six	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
astonishment	O
the	O
sea	O
broke	O
quite	O
over	O
the	O
fore-castle	O
in	O
upon	O

which	O
,	O
considering	O
the	O
narrowness	O
of	O

the	O
smallness	O
of	O
the	O

in	O
which	O
we	O
were	O

,	O
might	O
well	O
have	O
been	O
thought	O
impossible	O

Our	O
danger	O
here	O
was	O
very	O
great	O
,	O
for	O
if	O
the	O
cables	O
had	O
parted	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
run	O
out	O
with	O
a	O

and	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
room	O
to	O
bring	O
the	O

up	O
with	O
any	O

must	O
have	O
been	O
dashed	O
to	O

in	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
situation	O
it	O
is	O
highly	O
probable	O
that	O
every	O
foul	O
would	O
immediately	O
have	O
perished	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
by	O
eight	O
o'clock	O
the	O

was	O
become	O
some-what	O
more	O

the	O
night	O

we	O
had	O
tolerable	O
weather	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O

Upon	O
heaving	O
the	O
anchor	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
satisfaction	O
to	O
find	O
that	O
our	O
cable	O
was	O
found	O
,	O
though	O
our	O
hausers	O
were	O
much	O
rubbed	O
by	O

notwithstanding	O
they	O
were	O
parcelled	O
with	O
old	O

The	O
first	O
thing	O
I	O
did	O
after	O
performing	O
the	O
necessary	O
operations	O
about	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
was	O
to	O
send	O
a	O
boat	O
to	O
the	O
Swallow	O
to	O
enquire	O
how	O
she	O
had	O
fared	O
during	O
the	O
gale	O
:	O
the	O
boat	O
returned	O
with	O
an	O
account	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
felt	O
but	O
little	O
of	O
the	O
gale	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
very	O
near	O
being	O
loft	O
,	O
in	O
pushing	O
through	O
the	O
Islands	O
two	O
days	O
before	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
rapidity	O
of	O
the	O
tide	O
:	O
that	O
notwithstanding	O
an	O
alteration	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
made	O
in	O
her	O
rudder	O
,	O
she	O
steered	O
and	O
worked	O
so	O
ill	O
,	O
that	O
every	O
time	O
they	O
got	O
under	O
way	O
they	O
were	O
apprehensive	O
that	O
she	O
could	O
never	O
safely	O
be	O
brought	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
again	O
;	O
I	O
was	O
therefore	O
requested	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
to	O
consider	O
that	O
she	O
could	O
be	O
of	O
very	O
little	O
service	O
to	O
the	O
expedition	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
direct	O
what	O
I	O
thought	O
would	O
be	O
best	O
for	O
the	O
service	O
.	O

I	O
answered	O
,	O
that	O
as	O
the	O
Lords	O
of	O
the	O
Admiralty	O
had	O
appointed	O
her	O
to	O
accompany	O
the	O
Dolphin	O
,	O
she	O
must	O
continue	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
possible	O
;	O
that	O
as	O
her	O
condition	O
rendered	O
her	O
a	O
bad	O
sailer	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
wait	O
her	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
attend	O
her	O
motions	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
if	O
any	O
disaster	O
should	O
happen	O
to	O
either	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
should	O
be	O
ready	O
to	O
afford	O
such	O
assistance	O
as	O
might	O
be	O
in	O
her	O
power	O
.	O

We	O
continued	O
here	O
eight	O
days	O
,	O
during	O
which	O
time	O
we	O
completed	O
our	O
wood	O
and	O
water	O
,	O
dried	O
our	O
sails	O

and	O
sent	O
great	O

to	O
wash	O
their	O

which	O
was	O
the	O
more	O
necessary	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
cold	O

tempestuous	O

We	O
caught	O

The	O

many	O
of	O
them	O
being	O
from	O
five	O

six	O

we	O
caught	O
also	O
great	O
plenty	O
of	O
a	O

not	O

At	O
the	O

we	O
made	O
it	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
employment	O
of	O
every	O

to	O
try	O
the	O

The	O
master	O
having	O
been	O
sent	O
out	O
to	O

returned	O
with	O
an	O

in	O
cases	O

He	O
landed	O
upon	O
a	O

the	O

to	O

with	O
some	O

which	O
he	O

The	O
boats	O
that	O
were	O
sent	O
to	O
assist	O
the	O
Swallow	O
,	O
towed	O
her	O
into	O
a	O
small	O
bay	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
wind	O
was	O
southerly	O
,	O
and	O
blew	O
fresh	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
in	O
great	O
danger	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
Cove	O
was	O
not	O
only	O
small	O
,	O
but	O
full	O
of	O
rocks	O
,	O
and	O
open	O
to	O
the	O
south-easterly	O
winds	O
.	O

All	O
the	O
day	O
following	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
hard	O
gales	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
much	O
hail	O
and	O
rain	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
we	O
had	O
gusts	O
so	O
violent	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O
stand	O
the	O
deck	O
;	O
they	O
brought	O
whole	O
sheets	O
of	O
water	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
from	O
Cape	PNM
Notch	PNM
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
league	O
distant	O
,	O
quite	O
over	O
the	O
deck	O
.	O

They	O
did	O
not	O
last	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
minute	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
so	O
frequent	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
cables	O
were	O
kept	O
in	O
a	O
constant	O
strain	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
the	O
greatest	O
reason	O
to	O
fear	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
give	O
way	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
general	O
opinion	O
that	O
the	O
Swallow	O
could	O
not	O
possibly	O
ride	O
it	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
were	O
so	O
strongly	O
prepossessed	O
with	O
the	O
notion	O
of	O
her	O
being	O
lost	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
fancied	O
they	O
saw	O
some	O
of	O
her	O
people	O
coming	O
over	O
the	O
rocks	O
towards	O
our	O
ship	O
.	O

The	O
weather	O
continued	O
so	O
bad	O
,	O
till	O
Saturday	O
the	O
seventh	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
send	O
no	O
boat	O
to	O
enquire	O
after	O
her	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
gale	O
being	O
then	O
more	O
moderate	O
,	O
a	O
boat	O
was	O
dispatched	O
about	O
four	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
about	O
the	O
same	O
hour	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
returned	O
with	O
an	O
account	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
safe	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
fatigue	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
had	O
been	O
incredible	O
,	O
the	O
whole	O
crew	O
having	O
been	O
upon	O
the	O
deck	O
near	O
three	O
days	O
and	O
three	O
nights	O
.	O

At	O
midnight	O
the	O
gusts	O
returned	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
with	O
equal	O
violence	O
,	O
with	O
hail	O
,	O
sleet	O
and	O

The	O
weather	O
being	O
now	O
extremely	O
cold	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
people	O
never	O
dry	O
,	O
I	O
got	O
up	O
,	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
eleven	O
bales	O
of	O
thick	O
woollen	O
stuff	O
,	O
called	O
Fearnought	PNM
,	O
which	O
is	O
provided	O
by	O
the	O
government	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
all	O
the	O
taylors	O
to	O
work	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
into	O
jackets	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
every	O
man	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
had	O
one	O
.	O

I	O
ordered	O
these	O
jackets	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
very	O
large	O
,	O
allowing	O
,	O
one	O
with	O
another	O

two	O
yards	O
and	O
thirty-four	O
inches	O
of	O
the	O
cloth	O
to	O
each	O
jacket	O
.	O

I	O
sent	O
also	O
seven	O
bales	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
cloth	O
to	O
the	O
Swallow	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
every	O
man	O
on	O
board	O
a	O
jacket	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
kind	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
cut	O
up	O
three	O
bales	O
of	O
finer	O
cloth	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
jackets	O
for	O
the	O
officers	O
of	O
both	O
ships	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
pleasure	O
to	O
find	O
were	O
very	O
acceptable	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
situation	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
continue	O
a	O
week	O
,	O
during	O
which	O
time	O
,	O
I	O
put	O
both	O
my	O
own	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Swallow	O
,	O
upon	O
two-thirds	O
allowance	O
,	O
except	O
brandy	O
;	O
but	O
continued	O
the	O
breakfast	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
greens	O
and	O
water	O
were	O
plenty	O
.	O

On	O
Sunday	O
the	O
15th	O
,	O
about	O
noon	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
Swallow	O
under	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
being	O
calm	O
,	O
we	O
sent	O
our	O
launch	O
to	O
assist	O
her	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
the	O
launch	O
returned	O
,	O
having	O
towed	O
her	O
into	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
harbour	O
on	O
the	O
south	O
shore	O
,	O
opposite	O
to	O
where	O
we	O
lay	O
.	O

The	O
account	O
that	O
we	O
received	O
of	O
this	O
harbour	O
,	O
determined	O
us	O
to	O
get	O
into	O
it	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
possible	O
;	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
therefore	O
,	O
at	O
eight	O
o'clock	O
,	O
we	O
sailed	O
from	O
Good	PNM
Luck	PNM

,	O
and	O
thought	O
ourselves	O
happy	O
to	O
get	O
safe	O
out	O
of	O
it	O

When	O
we	O
got	O
a-breast	O
of	O
the	O
harbour	O
where	O
the	O
Swallow	O
lay	O
,	O
we	O
fired	O
several	O
guns	O
,	O
as	O
signals	O
for	O
her	O
boats	O
to	O
assist	O
us	O
in	O
getting	O
in	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
the	O
master	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
piloted	O
us	O
to	O
a	O
very	O
commodious	O
station	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
anchored	O
in	O
28	O
fathom	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
muddy	O
bottom	O

This	O
harbour	O

which	O
is	O
sheltered	O
from	O
all	O
winds	O
,	O
and	O
excellent	O
in	O
every	O
respect	O
,	O
we	O
called	O
SWALLOW	O
HARBOUR	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
two	O
channels	O
into	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
both	O
narrow	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
dangerous	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
rocks	O
are	O
easily	O
discovered	O
by	O
the	O

that	O

upon	O
them	O

At	O
nine	O
o'clock	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
coming	O
easterly	O
,	O
we	O
weighed	O
,	O
and	O
sailed	O
from	O
Swallow	O
harbour	O
.	O

At	O
noon	O
we	O
took	O
the	O
Swallow	O
in	O
tow	O
,	O
but	O
at	O
five	O
there	O
being	O
little	O
wind	O
,	O
we	O
cast	O
off	O
the	O

At	O
eight	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O

the	O
boats	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
sent	O
out	O
to	O
look	O
for	O

returned	O
with	O
an	O
account	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
find	O
none	O
:	O
at	O

we	O
had	O

At	O
seven	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
we	O
took	O
the	O
Swallow	O
again	O
in	O
tow	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
again	O
obliged	O
to	O
cast	O
her	O
off	O
and	O
tack	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
weather	O
became	O
very	O
thick	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
swell	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
saw	O
land	O
close	O
under	O
our	O
lee	O
.	O

As	O
no	O
place	O
for	O
anchorage	O
could	O
be	O
found	O
,	O
Captain	O
Carteret	O
advised	O
me	O
to	O
bear	O
away	O
for	O
Upright	PNM
bay	O
,	O
to	O
which	O
I	O
consented	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
acquainted	O
with	O
the	O
place	O

he	O
went	O
a-head	O

the	O

were	O
ordered	O
to	O
go	O
between	O
him	O
and	O
the	O
shore	O

and	O
we	O
followed	O
.	O

At	O
eleven	O
o'clock	O
,	O
there	O
being	O
little	O
wind	O
,	O
we	O
opened	O
a	O
large	O
lagoon	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
current	O
setting	O
strongly	O
into	O
it	O
,	O
the	O
Swallow	O
was	O
driven	O
among	O
the	O
breakers	O
close	O
upon	O
the	O
lee	O
shore	O
:	O
to	O
aggravate	O
the	O
misfortune	O
,	O
the	O
weather	O
was	O
very	O
hazey	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
anchorage	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
surf	O
ran	O
very	O
high	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
dreadful	O
situation	O
she	O
made	O
signals	O
of	O
distress	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
immediately	O
sent	O
our	O
launch	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
boats	O
,	O
to	O
her	O
assistance	O
:	O
the	O
boats	O
took	O
her	O
in	O
tow	O
,	O
but	O
their	O
utmost	O
efforts	O
to	O
save	O
her	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
ineffectual	O
,	O
if	O
a	O
breeze	O
had	O
not	O
suddenly	O
come	O
down	O
from	O
a	O
mountain	O
,	O
and	O
wafted	O
her	O
off	O
.	O

As	O
a	O
great	O
swell	O
came	O
on	O
about	O
noon	O
,	O
we	O
hauled	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
shore	O
.	O

We	O
soon	O
found	O
ourselves	O
surrounded	O
with	O
islands	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
fog	O
was	O
so	O
thick	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
nor	O
which	O
way	O
to	O

Among	O
these	O

the	O

were	O

to	O
cast	O
the	O

but	O
no	O
anchorage	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
;	O
we	O
then	O
conjectured	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
bay	O
of	O
islands	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
chance	O
to	O
escape	O

,	O
but	O
by	O
hauling	O
directly	O
out	O

this	O

however	O
,	O
was	O
no	O
easy	O

was	O

to	O
tack	O

almost	O

At	O
four	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
it	O
happily	O
cleared	O
up	O
for	O
a	O

just	O
to	O

us	O
Cape	PNM
Upright	PNM

for	O
which	O
we	O
directly	O
steered	O

and	O
at	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
after	O
five	O
anchored	O

with	O
the	O

,	O
in	O
the	O

When	O
we	O
dropped	O
the	O

we	O
were	O
in	O

after	O

a	O

Soon	O
after	O

the	O

notwithstanding	O
she	O
had	O
two	O

was	O

At	O
four	O
o'clock	O
in	O

When	O

it	O
was	O

On	O
the	O
18th	O
we	O
had	O

instantly	O
killed	O
it	O

by	O
giving	O
it	O
a	O
bite	O
near	O
the	O

he	O
then	O
proceeded	O
to	O

it	O

beginning	O
with	O
the	O

going	O
on	O

rejecting	O
either	O
the	O
bones	O

They	O
eat	O
every	O

that	O
was	O
given	O
them	O

indifferently	O

whether	O
salt	O

would	O

nothing	O

They	O
shivered	O
with	O
cold	O
,	O
yet	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
cover	O
them	O
but	O
a	O
seal	O
skin	O

thrown	O
loosely	O
over	O
their	O
shoulders	O
,	O
which	O
did	O
not	O
reach	O
to	O
their	O
middle	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
observed	O

that	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
rowing	O
,	O
they	O
threw	O
even	O
this	O
by	O

and	O
sat	O
stark	O

They	O
had	O
with	O
them	O
some	O
javelins	O
,	O
rudely	O
pointed	O
with	O
bone	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
used	O
to	O
strike	O
seals	O
,	O
fish	O
,	O
and	O
penguins	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
observed	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
iron	O
,	O
about	O
the	O
size	O
of	O
a	O
common	O
chissel	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
fastened	O
to	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
wood	O
,	O
and	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
intended	O
rather	O
for	O
a	O
tool	O
than	O
a	O
weapon	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
all	O
sore	O
eyes	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
imputed	O
to	O
their	O
sitting	O
over	O
the	O
smoke	O
of	O
their	O
fires	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
smelt	O
more	O
offensively	O
than	O
a	O
fox	O
,	O
which	O
perhaps	O
was	O
in	O
part	O
owing	O
to	O
their	O
diet	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
part	O
to	O
their	O
nastiness	O
.	O

Their	O
canoes	O
were	O
about	O
fifteen	O
foot	O
long	O
,	O
three	O
broad	O
,	O
and	O
nearly	O
three	O
deep	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
made	O
of	O
the	O
bark	O
of	O

sewn	O
together	O

either	O
with	O
the	O

of	O
some	O
beast	O

or	O
thongs	O
cut	O
out	O
of	O
a	O
hide	O

Some	O
kind	O
of	O
rush	O
was	O
laid	O
into	O
the	O
seams	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
outside	O
was	O
smeared	O
with	O
a	O
resin	O
,	O
or	O
gum	O

which	O
prevented	O
the	O
water	O
from	O

the	O
bark	O

Fifteen	O
slender	O

an	O

were	O
sewed	O
transversely	O
to	O
the	O

and	O
some	O

upon	O

however	O

it	O
was	O

these	O

any	O

among	O
them	O
in	O
which	O
there	O
was	O
the	O
least	O
appearance	O
of	O
ingenuity	O

I	O
gave	O
them	O
a	O
hatchet	O
or	O
two	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
beads	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
few	O
other	O
toys	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
they	O
went	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
saw	O
no	O
more	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
lay	O
here	O
,	O
we	O
sent	O
out	O
the	O
boats	O
,	O
as	O
usual	O
,	O
in	O
search	O
of	O
anchoring	O
places	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
been	O
10	O
leagues	O
to	O
the	O

two	O

of	O
Cape	PNM
Upright	PNM

in	O
the	O
Bay	PNM
of	PNM
Islands	PNM
,	O
but	O
was	O
very	O
difficult	O
to	O
enter	O
and	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
;	O
the	O
other	O
was	O
called	O
Dolphin	PNM
bay	O
,	O
at	O
10	O

which	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
harbour	O
,	O
with	O
even	O
ground	O
in	O
all	O
parts	O

They	O
saw	O
several	O
small	O
coves	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
all	O
dangerous	O
,	O
as	O
in	O
them	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
necessary	O
to	O
let	O
go	O
the	O
anchor	O
within	O
half	O

The	O
people	O
belonging	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
boats	O
,	O
spent	O
a	O
night	O
upon	O
an	O
island	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
,	O
while	O
they	O
were	O
there	O
,	O
six	O
canoes	O
landed	O
about	O
thirty	O
Indians	O
.	O

The	O
Indians	O
ran	O
immediately	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
carrying	O
away	O
every	O
thing	O
they	O
found	O
in	O
her	O
:	O
our	O
people	O
discovered	O
what	O
they	O
were	O
doing	O
,	O
just	O
time	O
enough	O
to	O
prevent	O
them	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
found	O
themselves	O
opposed	O
,	O
they	O
went	O
to	O
their	O
canoes	O
,	O
and	O
armed	O
themselves	O
with	O
long	O
poles	O
,	O
and	O
javelins	O
pointed	O
with	O
the	O
bones	O
of	O
fish	O

They	O
did	O
not	O
begin	O
an	O
attack	O
,	O
but	O
stood	O
in	O
a	O
threatening	O
manner	O
:	O
our	O
people	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
two	O
and	O
twenty	O
in	O
number	O
,	O
acted	O
only	O
on	O
the	O
defensive	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
parting	O
with	O
a	O
few	O
trifles	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
became	O
friends	O
,	O
and	O
behaved	O
peaceably	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
time	O
they	O
staid	O
.	O

For	O
many	O
days	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
hail	O
,	O
lightning	O
,	O
rain	O
,	O
and	O
hard	O
gales	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
heavy	O
sea	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
thought	O
it	O
impossible	O
for	O
the	O
ship	O
to	O
hold	O

though	O
she	O
had	O
two	O
anchors	O
a-head	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
cables	O
an	O
end	O

The	O
men	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
were	O
sent	O
frequently	O
on	O
shore	O
for	O
exercise	O
,	O
which	O
contributed	O
greatly	O
to	O
their	O
health	O
,	O
and	O
procured	O
an	O
almost	O
constant	O
supply	O
of	O
muscles	O

greens	O

Among	O
other	O
damages	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
sustained	O
,	O
our	O
fire-place	O
was	O
broken	O
to	O
pieces	O
,	O
we	O
therefore	O
found	O
it	O
necessary	O
to	O
set	O
up	O
the	O
forge	O

and	O
employ	O
the	O
armourers	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
new	O
back	O

we	O
also	O
made	O
lime	O

once	O

put	O
it	O
into	O
a	O
useful	O
condition	O

On	O
Monday	O
the	O
30th	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
first	O
interval	O
of	O
moderate	O
weather	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
improved	O
it	O
in	O
drying	O
the	O
sails	O

which	O

though	O
much	O
mildewed	O

we	O
had	O
not	O

to	O
loose	O

fear	O
of	O
setting	O
the	O
ship	O
adrift	O
:	O
we	O
also	O
aired	O
the	O
spare	O
sails	O

which	O
we	O
found	O
much	O
injured	O
by	O
the	O

employed	O
the	O

to	O

This	O
day	O
we	O
saw	O
several	O

full	O
of	O
Indians	O
,	O
put	O
to	O
shore	O
on	O
the	O
east	O

of	O
the	O

and	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
several	O
of	O
them	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
proved	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
same	O
that	O
our	O
people	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O

had	O
met	O
with	O
on	O

They	O
behaved	O
very	O
peaceably	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
dismissed	O
them	O
with	O
a	O
few	O

as	O

The	O
day	O
following	O

several	O

came	O
off	O

and	O
brought	O
with	O
them	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
birds	O
called	O
Race-Horses	PNM

Our	O
people	O
purchased	O
the	O

for	O
a	O

I	O
made	O

out	O
to	O

for	O

returned	O

and	O
reported	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
found	O
three	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
shore	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
very	O
good	O
;	O
one	O
about	O
four	O

to	O

about	O
four	O

in	O
under	O
Cape	PNM

the	O

This	O
day	O
two	O
canoes	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
with	O
four	O
men	O
and	O
three	O
young	O
children	O
in	O
each	O

The	O
men	O
were	O
somewhat	O
more	O
decently	O
dressed	O
than	O
those	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
before	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
children	O
were	O
stark	O
naked	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
somewhat	O
fairer	O
than	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
seemed	O
to	O
pay	O
a	O
very	O
tender	O
attention	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
especially	O
in	O
lifting	O
them	O
in	O
and	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
canoes	O
.	O

To	O
these	O
young	O
visitors	O
I	O
gave	O
necklaces	O
and	O
bracelets	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
they	O
seemed	O
mightily	O
pleased	O
.	O

It	O
happened	O
that	O
while	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
people	O
were	O
on	O

the	O
rest	O

in	O
their	O
canoes	O
by	O
the	O

the	O
boat	O
was	O
sent	O
on	O
shore	O
for	O
wood	O
and	O
water	O

The	O
Indians	O
who	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
canoes	O
,	O
kept	O
their	O
eyes	O
fixed	O
upon	O
the	O
boat	O
while	O
she	O
was	O
manning	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
moment	O
she	O
put	O
off	O
from	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
they	O
called	O
out	O
with	O
great	O
vociferation	O
to	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
who	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
much	O
alarmed	O
,	O
and	O
hastily	O
handing	O
down	O
the	O
children	O
,	O
leaped	O
into	O
their	O
canoes	O
,	O
without	O
uttering	O
a	O
word	O

None	O
of	O
us	O
could	O
guess	O
at	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
this	O
sudden	O
emotion	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
men	O
in	O
the	O
canoes	O
pull	O
after	O
the	O
boat	O
with	O
all	O
their	O
might	O
,	O
hallooing	O
and	O
shouting	O
with	O
great	O
appearance	O
of	O
perturbation	O
and	O
distress	O

The	O
boat	O
outrowed	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
she	O
came	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
board	O
discovered	O
some	O
women	O
gathering	O
muscles	O
among	O
the	O
rocks	O
.	O

This	O
at	O
once	O
explained	O
the	O
mystery	O
;	O
the	O
poor	O
Indians	O
were	O
afraid	O
that	O
the	O
strangers	O
,	O
either	O
by	O
force	O
or	O
favour	O
,	O
should	O
violate	O
the	O
prerogative	O
of	O
a	O
husband	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
jealous	O
than	O
the	O
natives	O
of	O
some	O
other	O
countries	O
,	O
who	O
in	O
their	O
appearance	O
are	O
less	O
savage	O
and	O
sordid	O

Our	O
people	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
easy	O
,	O
immediately	O
lay	O
upon	O
their	O
oars	O
,	O
and	O
suffered	O
the	O
canoes	O
to	O
pass	O
them	O

The	O
Indians	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
still	O
continued	O
to	O
call	O
out	O
to	O
their	O
women	O
,	O
till	O
they	O
took	O
the	O
alarm	O
and	O
ran	O
out	O
of	O
sight	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
got	O
to	O
land	O
,	O
drew	O
their	O
canoes	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
and	O
followed	O
them	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
expedition	O

We	O
continued	O
daily	O
to	O
gather	O
muscles	O
till	O
the	O
5th	O

when	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
being	O
seized	O
with	O
fluxes	O

the	O
surgeon	O
desired	O
that	O
no	O

into	O
the	O

The	O
weather	O

still	O
tempestuous	O

we	O
remained	O
at	O

10	O

some	O
of	O
them	O
advanced	O
a	O
few	O
steps	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
people	O
making	O
signs	O
that	O
they	O
wanted	O
cocoa	O
nuts	O
and	O
water	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
brought	O
down	O
a	O
small	O
quantity	O
of	O
both	O
,	O
and	O
ventured	O
to	O
hand	O
them	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
:	O
the	O
water	O
was	O
in	O
cocoa	O
nut-shells	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
fruit	O
was	O
stripped	O
of	O
its	O
outward	O
covering	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
probably	O
used	O
for	O
various	O
purposes	O
.	O

For	O
this	O
supply	O
they	O
were	O
paid	O
with	O
the	O
trinkets	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
shewed	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
nails	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
set	O
a	O
much	O
greater	O
value	O
.	O

During	O
this	O
traffick	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
steal	O
a	O
silk	O
handkerchief	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
small	O
merchandize	O
was	O
wrapped	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
it	O
clear	O
off	O
,	O
with	O
its	O
contents	O
,	O
so	O
dexterously	O
,	O
that	O
no	O
body	O
observed	O
him	O
.	O

Our	O
people	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
a	O
handkerchief	O
had	O
been	O
stolen	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
either	O
could	O
not	O
,	O
or	O
would	O
not	O
understand	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
boat	O
continued	O
about	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
sounding	O
for	O
anchorage	O
,	O
till	O
it	O
was	O
dark	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
many	O
times	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
persuade	O
the	O
natives	O
to	O
bring	O
down	O
some	O
scurvy-grass	O
,	O
without	O
success	O
,	O
she	O
returned	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

I	O
stood	O
off	O
and	O
on	O
with	O
the	O
ship	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
day	O
broke	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
the	O
boats	O
again	O
,	O
with	O
orders	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
landing	O
,	O
but	O
without	O
giving	O
any	O
offence	O
to	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
that	O
could	O
possibly	O
be	O
avoided	O
.	O

When	O
our	O
boats	O
came	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
the	O
officer	O
was	O
greatly	O
surprised	O
to	O
see	O
seven	O
large	O
canoes	O
,	O
with	O
two	O
stout	O
masts	O
in	O
each	O
,	O
lying	O
just	O
in	O
the	O
surf	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
ready	O
to	O
embark	O

They	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
our	O
people	O
to	O
go	O
higher	O
up	O
;	O
they	O
readily	O
complied	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
went	O
ashore	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
Indians	O
embarked	O
,	O
and	O
sailed	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
,	O
being	O
joined	O
by	O
two	O
other	O
canoes	O
at	O
the	O
west	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O

About	O
noon	O
,	O
the	O
boats	O
returned	O
,	O
laden	O
with	O
cocoa	O
nuts	O
,	O
palm	O
nuts	O

and	O
scurvy-grass	O
.	O

Mr.	O
Furneaux	O
,	O
who	O
commanded	O
the	O
expedition	O
,	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
the	O
Indians	O
had	O
left	O
nothing	O
behind	O
them	O
but	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
canoes	O
.	O

He	O
found	O
a	O
well	O
of	O
very	O
good	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
described	O
the	O
island	O
as	O
being	O
sandy	O
and	O
level	O
,	O
full	O
of	O
trees	O
,	O
but	O
without	O
underwood	O
,	O
and	O
abounding	O
with	O
scurvy-grass	O
.	O

The	O
canoes	O
,	O
which	O
steered	O
about	O
W.S.W.	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
be	O
seen	O
from	O
the	O
mast-head	O
,	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
about	O
thirty	O

long	O
,	O
four	O

,	O
and	O
three	O

Two	O

these	O

brought	O
along	O

in	O

near	O

The	O
inhabitants	O
of	O
this	O

were	O
of	O
a	O
middle	O
stature	O

and	O
dark	O

,	O
with	O
long	O
black	O
hair	O

which	O
hung	O
loose	O
over	O
their	O

The	O
men	O
were	O
well	O
made	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
women	O
handsome	O

Their	O
cloathing	O
was	O
a	O

which	O
was	O
fastened	O
about	O

and	O
seemed	O

of	O
being	O
brought	O
up	O
round	O
their	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
Lieutenant	O
Furneaux	O
with	O
the	O
boats	O
again	O
on	O

He	O
had	O
with	O
him	O
a	O

twenty	O

who	O
were	O
to	O
make	O
a	O

for	O
getting	O
the	O
casks	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O
from	O
the	O

I	O
gave	O
orders	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
take	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
name	O

QUEEN	O
CHARLOTTE	O

ISLAND	O

in	O
honour	O
of	O

The	O
boats	O
returned	O
freighted	O
with	O
cocoa	O
nuts	O
and	O
scurvy-grass	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
officer	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
found	O
two	O
more	O
wells	O
of	O
good	O
water	O
,	O
not	O
far	O
from	O
the	O
beach	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
very	O
ill	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
went	O
ashore	O
with	O
the	O
Surgeon	O
,	O
and	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
enfeebled	O
by	O
the	O
scurvy	O
,	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
walk	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
the	O
well	O
so	O
convenient	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
left	O
the	O
mate	O
and	O
twenty	O
men	O
on	O
shore	O
to	O
fill	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
ordered	O
a	O
week	O

provisions	O
to	O

sent	O

from	O
the	O

,	O
they	O
being	O
already	O
furnished	O
with	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
I	O
returned	O
on	O

with	O
the	O
Surgeon	O
and	O
the	O
sick	O
,	O
leaving	O
only	O
the	O
waterers	O
on	O

As	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
find	O
any	O
anchorage	O
,	O
I	O
stood	O
off	O
and	O
on	O
all	O
night	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
all	O
the	O
empty	O
water	O
casks	O
on	O
shore	O
:	O
the	O
Surgeon	O
and	O
the	O

were	O
also	O
sent	O
for	O
the	O
benefit	O
of	O
another	O
airing	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
gave	O
them	O
strict	O
orders	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
keep	O
near	O
the	O
water-side	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
shade	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
not	O
pull	O
down	O
or	O
injure	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
houses	O
,	O
nor	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
the	O
fruit	O
,	O
destroy	O
the	O
cocoa	O
trees	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
appointed	O
proper	O
persons	O
to	O
climb	O

At	O
noon	O
,	O
the	O
rolling-way	O
being	O
made	O
,	O
the	O
cutter	O
returned	O
laden	O
with	O
water	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
with	O
great	O
difficulty	O
got	O
off	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
all	O
rock	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
surf	O
that	O
breaks	O
upon	O
it	O
,	O
is	O
often	O
very	O
great	O
.	O

At	O
four	O
,	O
I	O
received	O
another	O
boat-load	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
fresh	O
supply	O
of	O
cocoa	O
nuts	O

and	O
scurvy-grass	O
;	O
the	O
Surgeon	O
also	O
returned	O
with	O
the	O
sick	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
received	O
much	O

from	O
their	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
light	O
,	O
I	O
dispatched	O

to	O
the	O

to	O
send	O
all	O
the	O
water	O
that	O
was	O
filled	O

to	O
be	O

off	O
with	O

when	O
the	O

should	O
return	O

bringing	O
with	O
them	O
as	O
many	O
cocoa	O
nuts	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
much	O
scurvy-grass	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
procure	O
.	O

About	O
eight	O
o'clock	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
boats	O
and	O
people	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
water	O
and	O
refreshments	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
cutter	O
,	O
in	O
coming	O
off	O
,	O
shipped	O
a	O
sea	O
,	O
which	O
almost	O
filled	O
her	O
with	O
water	O
:	O
the	O
barge	O
was	O
happily	O
near	O
enough	O
to	O
assist	O
her	O
,	O
by	O
taking	O
great	O
part	O
of	O
her	O

on	O
board	O

while	O

freed	O

of	O
the	O

that	O
were	O
on	O

At	O
noon	O

I	O
hoisted	O

there	O

in	O
upon	O
the	O

I	O
thought	O
it	O

to	O
leave	O
this	O

with	O
such	O

The	O

that	O
pass	O
transversely	O
along	O

up	O

They	O
saw	O
several	O

saw	O
an	O
island	O

At	O

her	O

off	O

At	O

we	O
saw	O
a	O
light	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
island	O
was	O
small	O
,	O
proved	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
inhabited	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
us	O
hopes	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
find	O
anchorage	O
near	O
it	O

We	O
observed	O
with	O
great	O
pleasure	O

that	O
the	O

was	O
very	O

covered	O
with	O

a	O

sign	O
that	O
there	O

The	O
next	O

,	O
I	O
sent	O
Lieutenant	O
Furneaux	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O

with	O
the	O
boats	O
manned	O

armed	O

all	O

to	O
establish	O

with	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
for	O
such	O
refreshment	O
as	O
the	O
place	O
would	O
afford	O

I	O
gave	O
him	O
orders	O
also	O
to	O
find	O

an	O

for	O

While	O
we	O
were	O

out	O
the	O

several	O

put	O
off	O
from	O
the	O

as	O
the	O

on	O
board	O
saw	O
them	O
make	O
towards	O
the	O
shore	O

they	O
put	O
back	O

At	O
noon	O
,	O
the	O
boats	O
returned	O

brought	O
with	O
them	O
a	O
pig	O

a	O
cock	O

with	O
a	O
few	O
plantains	O

Mr.	O
Furneaux	O
reported	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
seen	O
at	O
least	O
an	O
hundred	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
and	O
believed	O
there	O
were	O
many	O
more	O
upon	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
having	O
been	O
all	O
round	O
it	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
find	O
no	O
anchorage	O
,	O
nor	O
scarcely	O
a	O
landing-place	O
for	O
the	O
boat	O

When	O
he	O
reached	O
the	O
shore	O

he	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
grapling	O
,	O
and	O
threw	O
a	O
warp	O
to	O
the	O
Indians	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
who	O
caught	O
it	O
and	O
held	O
it	O
fast	O
.	O

He	O
then	O
began	O
to	O
converse	O
with	O
them	O
by	O
signs	O
,	O
and	O
observed	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
weapon	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
white	O
sticks	O

which	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
ensigns	O
of	O
authority	O
,	O
as	O

bore	O
them	O
kept	O

back	O

In	O
return	O
for	O
the	O
pig	O
and	O
the	O
cock	O
,	O
he	O
gave	O
them	O
some	O
beads	O
,	O
a	O
looking-glass	O
,	O
a	O
few	O
combs	O
,	O
with	O
several	O
other	O

The	O
women	O

who	O
had	O
been	O
kept	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
saw	O
the	O
trinkets	O
,	O
ran	O
down	O
in	O
a	O
croud	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
with	O
great	O
eagerness	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
soon	O
driven	O
away	O
by	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
at	O
which	O
they	O
expressed	O
much	O
disappointment	O
and	O
vexation	O
.	O

While	O
this	O
traffick	O
was	O
carrying	O
on	O
,	O
a	O
man	O
came	O
secretly	O
round	O
a	O
rock	O
,	O
and	O
diving	O
down	O
,	O
took	O
up	O
the	O
boat	O

grappling	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
shore	O
who	O
held	O
the	O
warp	O
,	O
made	O
an	O
effort	O
to	O
draw	O
her	O
into	O
the	O
surf	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
this	O
was	O
perceived	O
by	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
they	O
fired	O
a	O
musket	O
over	O
the	O
man	O
's	O
head	O
who	O
had	O
taken	O
up	O
the	O

upon	O

he	O
instantly	O
let	O
it	O
go	O

with	O
marks	O
of	O
great	O
terror	O
and	O
astonishment	O
;	O
the	O
people	O
on	O

also	O
let	O
go	O

lay	O
some	O

but	O
the	O

finding	O
that	O

could	O
get	O
nothing	O
more	O

returned	O
on	O

Mr.	O
Furneaux	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
both	O
the	O
men	O
and	O
women	O
were	O
cloathed	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
brought	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
their	O
cloth	O
away	O
with	O
him	O
.	O

The	O
inhabitants	O
appeared	O
to	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
numerous	O
than	O
the	O
island	O
could	O
support	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
this	O
reason	O
,	O
especially	O
as	O
he	O
saw	O
some	O
large	O
double	O
canoes	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
he	O
imagined	O
there	O
were	O
islands	O
of	O
larger	O
extent	O
,	O
not	O
far	O
distant	O
,	O
where	O
refreshments	O
in	O

might	O
be	O
procured	O

hoped	O

they	O
might	O
be	O

hoisted	O
in	O

distance	O
,	O
and	O
steered	O
directly	O
for	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
at	O
eight	O
o'clock	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
close	O
under	O
it	O
,	O
the	O
fog	O
obliged	O
us	O
again	O
to	O
lie	O
to	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
it	O
cleared	O
away	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
much	O
surprised	O
to	O
find	O
ourselves	O
surrounded	O
by	O
some	O
hundreds	O
of	O
canoes	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
of	O
different	O
sizes	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
on	O
board	O
different	O
numbers	O
,	O
from	O
one	O
to	O
ten	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
in	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
together	O
,	O
there	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
less	O
than	O
eight	O
hundred	O
people	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
came	O
within	O
pistol	O
shot	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
they	O
lay	O
by	O
,	O
gazing	O
at	O
us	O
with	O
great	O
astonishment	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
turns	O
conferring	O
with	O
each	O
other	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
we	O
shewed	O
them	O
trinkets	O
of	O
various	O
kinds	O
,	O
and	O
invited	O
them	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

Soon	O
after	O
,	O
they	O
drew	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
held	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
council	O
,	O
to	O
determine	O
what	O
should	O
be	O
done	O
:	O
then	O
they	O
all	O
paddled	O
round	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
making	O
signs	O
of	O
friendship	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
holding	O
up	O
a	O
branch	O
of	O
the	O
plantain	O
tree	O
,	O
made	O
a	O
speech	O
that	O
lasted	O
near	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
threw	O
it	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
.	O

Soon	O
after	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
continued	O
to	O
make	O
signs	O
of	O
invitation	O
,	O
a	O
fine	O
,	O
stout	O
,	O
lively	O
young	O
man	O
ventured	O
on	O
board	O
:	O
he	O
came	O
up	O
by	O
the	O
mizen	O
chains	O
,	O
and	O
jumped	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
shrouds	O
upon	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
awning	O
.	O

We	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
him	O
to	O
come	O
down	O
upon	O
the	O
quarter-deck	O
,	O
and	O
handed	O
up	O
some	O
trinkets	O
to	O
him	O
:	O
he	O
looked	O
pleased	O
,	O
but	O
would	O
accept	O
of	O
nothing	O
till	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
came	O
along	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
much	O
talk	O
,	O
threw	O
a	O
few	O
branches	O
of	O
plantain	O
tree	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

He	O
then	O
accepted	O
our	O
presents	O
,	O
and	O
several	O
others	O
very	O
soon	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
at	O
different	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
not	O
knowing	O
the	O
proper	O
entrance	O
.	O

As	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
Indians	O
was	O
standing	O
near	O
the	O
gang-way	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
larboard	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
quarter-deck	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
goats	O
butted	O
him	O
upon	O
the	O
haunches	O
:	O
being	O
surprised	O
at	O
the	O
blow	O
,	O
he	O
turned	O
hastily	O
about	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
the	O
goat	O
raised	O
upon	O
his	O
hind-legs	O
,	O
ready	O
to	O
repeat	O
the	O
blow	O
.	O

The	O
appearance	O
of	O
this	O
animal	O
,	O
so	O
different	O
from	O
any	O
he	O
had	O
ever	O
seen	O
,	O
struck	O
him	O
with	O
such	O
terror	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
instantly	O
leaped	O
over	O
board	O
;	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
upon	O
seeing	O
what	O
had	O
happened	O
,	O
followed	O
his	O
example	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
precipitation	O
:	O
they	O
recovered	O
however	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
,	O
from	O
their	O
fright	O
,	O
and	O
returned	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

After	O
having	O
a	O
little	O
reconciled	O
them	O
to	O
our	O
goats	O
and	O
sheep	O
,	O
I	O
shewed	O
them	O
our	O
hogs	O
and	O
poultry	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
immediately	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
such	O
animals	O
as	O
these	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
distributed	O
trinkets	O
and	O
nails	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
and	O
bring	O
us	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
hogs	O
,	O
fowls	O
and	O
fruit	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
seem	O
to	O
understand	O
my	O
meaning	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
,	O
watching	O
an	O
opportunity	O
to	O
steal	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
that	O
happened	O
to	O
lie	O
in	O
their	O
way	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
generally	O
detected	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
attempt	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
midshipmen	O
happened	O
to	O
come	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
standing	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
new	O
laced	O
hat	O
upon	O
his	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
talk	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
by	O
signs	O
:	O
while	O
he	O
was	O
thus	O
engaged	O
,	O
another	O
of	O
them	O
came	O
behind	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
suddenly	O
snatching	O
off	O
the	O
hat	O
,	O
leaped	O
over	O
the	O
taffarel	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
swam	O
away	O
with	O
it	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
anchorage	O
here	O
,	O
we	O
stood	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
sending	O
the	O
boats	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
to	O
sound	O
at	O
a	O
less	O
distance	O
.	O

As	O
none	O
of	O
these	O
canoes	O
had	O
sails	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
keep	O
up	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
soon	O
paddled	O
back	O
towards	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

The	O
country	O
has	O
the	O
most	O
delightful	O
and	O
romantic	O
appearance	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
imagined	O
:	O
towards	O
the	O
sea	O
it	O
is	O
level	O
,	O
and	O
is	O
covered	O
with	O
fruit	O
trees	O
of	O
various	O
kinds	O
,	O
particularly	O
the	O
cocoa	O
nut	O
.	O

Among	O
these	O
are	O
the	O
houses	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
consisting	O
only	O
of	O
a	O
roof	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
having	O
greatly	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
a	O
long	O
barn	O
.	O

The	O
country	O
within	O
,	O
at	O
about	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
three	O
miles	O
,	O
rises	O
into	O
lofty	O
hills	O
,	O
that	O
are	O
crowned	O
with	O
wood	O
,	O
and	O
terminate	O
in	O
peaks	O
,	O
from	O
which	O
large	O
rivers	O
are	O
precipitated	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
no	O
shoals	O
,	O
but	O
found	O
the	O
island	O
skirted	O
by	O
a	O
reef	O
of	O
rocks	O
,	O
through	O
which	O
there	O
are	O
several	O
openings	O
into	O
deep	O
water	O
.	O

About	O
three	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
we	O
brought	O
to	O
,	O
a-breast	O
of	O
a	O
large	O
bay	O
,	O
where	O
there	O
was	O
an	O
appearance	O
of	O
anchorage	O
.	O

The	O
boats	O
were	O
immediately	O
sent	O
to	O
sound	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
while	O
they	O
were	O
thus	O
employed	O
,	O
I	O
observed	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
canoes	O
gather	O
round	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
suspected	O
that	O
the	O
Indians	O
had	O
a	O
design	O
to	O
attack	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
desirous	O
to	O
prevent	O
mischief	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
the	O
signal	O
for	O
the	O
boats	O
to	O
come	O
aboard	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
to	O
intimidate	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
I	O
fired	O
a	O
nine	O
pounder	O
over	O
their	O
heads	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
cutter	O
began	O
to	O
stand	O
towards	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
the	O
Indians	O
in	O
their	O
canoes	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
startled	O
by	O
the	O
thunder	O
of	O
our	O
nine	O
pounder	O
,	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
cut	O
her	O
off	O
.	O

The	O
boat	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
sailing	O
faster	O
than	O
the	O
canoes	O
could	O
paddle	O
,	O
soon	O
got	O
clear	O
of	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
about	O
her	O
;	O
but	O
some	O
others	O
,	O
that	O
were	O
full	O
of	O
men	O
,	O
way-laid	O
her	O
in	O
her	O
course	O
,	O
and	O
threw	O
several	O
stones	O
into	O
her	O
,	O
which	O
wounded	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
,	O
the	O
officer	O
on	O
board	O
fired	O
a	O
musquet	O
,	O
loaded	O
with	O
buck-shot	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
man	O
who	O
threw	O
the	O
first	O
stone	O
,	O
and	O
wounded	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
shoulder	O
.	O

The	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
canoes	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
perceived	O
their	O
companion	O
wounded	O
,	O
leapt	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
canoes	O
paddled	O
away	O
,	O
in	O
great	O
terror	O
and	O
confusion	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
boats	O
reached	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
hoisted	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
just	O
as	O
she	O
was	O
about	O
to	O
stand	O
on	O
,	O
we	O
observed	O
a	O
large	O
canoe	O
,	O
under	O
sail	O
,	O
making	O
after	O
us	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
thought	O
she	O
might	O
have	O
some	O
Chief	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
or	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
dispatched	O
to	O
bring	O
me	O
a	O
message	O
from	O
some	O
Chief	O
,	O
I	O
determined	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
her	O
.	O

She	O
sailed	O
very	O
fast	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
soon	O
along	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
observe	O
among	O
those	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
any	O
one	O
that	O
seemed	O
to	O
have	O
an	O
authority	O
over	O
the	O
rest	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
stood	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
made	O
a	O
speech	O
,	O
which	O
continued	O
about	O
five	O
minutes	O
,	O
threw	O
on	O
board	O
a	O
branch	O
of	O
the	O
plantain	O
tree	O
.	O

We	O
understood	O
this	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
token	O
of	O
peace	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
returned	O
it	O
,	O
by	O
handing	O
over	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
branches	O
of	O
plantain	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
left	O
on	O
board	O
by	O
our	O
first	O
visitors	O
:	O
with	O
this	O
and	O
some	O
toys	O
,	O
that	O
were	O
afterwards	O
presented	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
much	O
gratified	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
,	O
went	O
away	O
.	O

The	O
officers	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
sent	O
out	O
with	O
the	O
boats	O
,	O
informed	O
me	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
sounded	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
reef	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
as	O
great	O
a	O
depth	O
of	O
water	O
as	O
at	O
the	O
other	O
islands	O
:	O
however	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
now	O
on	O
the	O
weather	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
expect	O
anchorage	O
in	O
running	O
to	O
leeward	O
.	O

I	O
therefore	O
took	O
this	O
course	O
,	O
but	O
finding	O
breakers	O
that	O
ran	O
off	O
to	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
south-end	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
I	O
hauled	O
the	O
wind	O
,	O
and	O
continued	O
turning	O
to	O
windward	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
run	O
down	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

At	O
five	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
sail	O
,	O
the	O
land	O
bearing	O
N.W.	O
by	O
W.	O
distant	O
10	O
leagues	O
;	O
and	O
there	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
land	O
five	O
leagues	O
beyond	O
it	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
N.E.	O
;	O
a	O
remarkable	O
peak	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
sugar	O
loaf	O
,	O
bore	O
N.N.E.	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
about	O
two	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
which	O
afforded	O
a	O
most	O
delightful	O
prospect	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
full	O
of	O
houses	O
and	O
inhabitants	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
several	O
large	O
canoes	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
under	O
sail	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
steer	O
towards	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

At	O
noon	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
within	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
miles	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
then	O
bore	O
from	O
S.	O
3/4	O
W.	O
to	O
N.W.	O
by	O
W	O
.	O

We	O
continued	O
our	O
course	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
sometimes	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
miles	O
,	O
but	O
hitherto	O
had	O
got	O
no	O
soundings	O

At	O
six	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
a-breast	O
of	O
a	O
fine	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
coast	O
having	O
a	O
better	O
appearance	O
here	O
than	O
in	O
any	O
other	O
part	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
,	O
I	O
determined	O
to	O
stand	O
off	O
and	O
on	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
try	O
for	O
anchorage	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
dark	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
lights	O
all	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

At	O
day-break	O
,	O
we	O
sent	O
out	O
the	O
boats	O
to	O
sound	O

and	O
soon	O
after	O

made	O

for	O
20	O

This	O
produced	O
an	O
universal	O
joy	O
,	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
easy	O
to	O
describe	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
immediately	O
ran	O
in	O

and	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
in	O
17	O
fathom	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
clear	O
sandy	O
bottom	O

We	O
lay	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
distant	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
opposite	O
to	O
a	O
fine	O
run	O
of	O
water	O

of	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
secured	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
the	O
boats	O
to	O
sound	O
along	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
and	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
water	O

At	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
a	O
considerable	O
number	O
of	O
canoes	O
came	O
off	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
with	O
them	O
hogs	O
,	O
fowls	O
,	O
and	O
fruit	O
in	O
great	O
plenty	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
purchased	O
for	O
trinkets	O
and	O
nails	O
.	O

But	O
when	O
the	O
boats	O
made	O
towards	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
the	O
canoes	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
which	O
were	O
double	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
large	O
,	O
sailed	O
after	O
them	O
.	O

At	O
first	O
they	O
kept	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
the	O
boats	O
approached	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
they	O
grew	O
bolder	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
three	O
of	O
the	O
largest	O
ran	O
at	O
the	O
cutter	O
,	O
staved	O
in	O
her	O
quarter	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
away	O
her	O
out-rigger	O
,	O
the	O
Indians	O
preparing	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
to	O
board	O
her	O
,	O
with	O
their	O
clubs	O
and	O
paddles	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O
.	O

Our	O
people	O
being	O
thus	O
pressed	O
,	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
fire	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
assailants	O
was	O
killed	O
,	O
and	O
another	O
much	O
wounded	O
.	O

Upon	O
receiving	O
the	O
shot	O
,	O
they	O
both	O
fell	O
overboard	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
canoe	O
,	O
instantly	O
leaped	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
after	O
them	O
:	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
canoes	O
dropped	O
a-stern	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
boats	O
went	O
on	O
without	O
any	O
farther	O
interruption	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
saw	O
that	O
the	O
boats	O
stood	O
on	O
without	O
attempting	O
to	O
do	O
them	O
any	O
farther	O
hurt	O
,	O
they	O
recovered	O
their	O
canoe	O
,	O
and	O
hauled	O
in	O
their	O
wounded	O
companions	O
.	O

They	O
set	O
them	O
both	O
upon	O
their	O
feet	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
stand	O
,	O
and	O
finding	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
,	O
they	O
tried	O
whether	O
they	O
could	O
sit	O
upright	O
:	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
could	O
,	O
and	O
him	O
they	O
supported	O
in	O
that	O
posture	O
,	O
but	O
perceiving	O
that	O
the	O
other	O
was	O
quite	O
dead	O
,	O
they	O
laid	O
the	O
body	O
along	O
at	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
the	O
canoe	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
canoes	O
went	O
ashore	O
,	O
and	O
others	O
returned	O
again	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
to	O
traffick	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
proof	O
that	O
our	O
conduct	O
had	O
convinced	O
them	O
that	O
while	O
they	O
behaved	O
peaceably	O
they	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
fear	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
conscious	O
they	O
had	O
brought	O
the	O
mischief	O
which	O
had	O
just	O
happened	O
upon	O
themselves	O
.	O

The	O
boats	O
continued	O
sounding	O
till	O
noon	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
returned	O
with	O
an	O
account	O
that	O
the	O
ground	O
was	O
very	O
clear	O
;	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
at	O
the	O
depth	O
of	O
five	O
fathom	O
,	O
within	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
of	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
surf	O
where	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
the	O
water	O
.	O

The	O
officers	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
swarmed	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
swam	O
off	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
with	O
fruit	O
,	O
and	O
bamboos	O
filled	O
with	O
water	O
.	O

They	O
said	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
importunate	O
with	O
them	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
particularly	O
the	O
women	O
,	O
who	O
came	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
and	O
stripping	O
themselves	O
naked	O
,	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
allure	O
them	O
by	O
many	O
wanton	O
gestures	O
,	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
which	O
could	O
not	O
possibly	O
be	O
mistaken	O
.	O

At	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
our	O
people	O
resisted	O
the	O
temptation	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
the	O
boats	O
again	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
barecas	O
,	O
or	O
small	O
casks	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
filled	O
at	O
the	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
have	O
a	O
handle	O
by	O
which	O
they	O
are	O
carried	O
,	O
to	O
endeavour	O
to	O
procure	O
some	O
water	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
great	O
want	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
,	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
canoes	O
continued	O
about	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
Indians	O
had	O
been	O
guilty	O
of	O
so	O
many	O
thefts	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
suffer	O
any	O
more	O
of	O
them	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

At	O
five	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
the	O
boats	O
returned	O
with	O
only	O
two	O
barecas	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
natives	O
had	O
filled	O
for	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
a	O
compensation	O
for	O
their	O
trouble	O
,	O
they	O
thought	O
fit	O
to	O
detain	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
.	O

Our	O
people	O
,	O
who	O
did	O
not	O
leave	O
their	O
boat	O
,	O
tried	O
every	O
expedient	O
they	O
could	O
think	O
of	O
to	O
induce	O
the	O
Indians	O
to	O
return	O
their	O
water	O
vessels	O
,	O
but	O
without	O
success	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
in	O
their	O
turn	O
,	O
were	O
very	O
pressing	O
for	O
our	O
people	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
thought	O
it	O
prudent	O
to	O
decline	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
many	O
thousands	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
of	O
both	O

and	O
a	O

number	O
of	O

when	O
our	O
boats	O
came	O
away	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
the	O

on	O

again	O
for	O
water	O

with	O
nails	O

hatchets	O

such	O

as	O
I	O
thought	O
most	O
likely	O
to	O

the	O

of	O

In	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O

a	O
great	O

for	O
the	O
number	O

that	O

the	O

Fruit	O

the	O

the	O

our	O

therefore	O
weighed	O

At	O

we	O

the	O

upon	O

Our	O

the	O

continued	O
beating	O
against	O

we	O
were	O
surrounded	O

In	O
the	O

that	O
the	O

ran	O
down	O
to	O

about	O
a	O
mile	O
and	O
a	O
half	O

and	O
that	O

was	O
a	O

The	O
master	O

after	O
having	O
placed	O
a	O
boat	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
reef	O

and	O
furnished	O
the	O
long-boat	O
with	O
anchor	O

hausers	O

and	O
a	O
guard	O
to	O
defend	O
her	O
from	O
an	O
attack	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
piloted	O
the	O
ship	O
round	O
the	O
reef	O
into	O
the	O
harbour	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
about	O
twelve	O
o'clock	O
,	O
she	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
in	O
17	O
fathom	O
water	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
fine	O
bottom	O
of	O
black	O
sand	O

The	O
place	O
where	O
the	O
ship	O
struck	O
appeared	O
,	O
upon	O
farther	O
examination	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
reef	O
of	O
sharp	O
coral	O
rock	O
,	O
with	O
very	O
unequal	O
soundings	O
,	O
from	O
six	O
fathom	O
to	O
two	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
happened	O
unfortunately	O
to	O
lie	O
between	O
the	O
two	O
boats	O
that	O
were	O
placed	O
as	O
a	O
direction	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
the	O
weathermost	O
boat	O
having	O
12	O
fathom	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
leewardmost	O
nine	O
.	O

The	O
wind	O
freshened	O
almost	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
got	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
though	O
it	O
soon	O
became	O
calm	O
again	O
,	O
the	O
surf	O
ran	O
so	O
high	O
,	O
and	O
broke	O
with	O
such	O
violence	O
upon	O
the	O
rock	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
ship	O
had	O
continued	O
fast	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
longer	O
,	O
she	O
must	O
inevitably	O
have	O
been	O
beaten	O
to	O
pieces	O
.	O

Upon	O
examining	O
her	O
bottom	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
discover	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
received	O
any	O
damage	O
,	O
except	O
that	O
a	O
small	O
piece	O
was	O
beaten	O
off	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
the	O
rudder	O
.	O

She	O
did	O
not	O
appear	O
to	O
admit	O
any	O
water	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
trussle-trees	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
masts	O
,	O
were	O
broken	O
short	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
supposed	O
to	O
have	O
happened	O
while	O
she	O
was	O
beating	O
against	O
the	O
rock	O
.	O

Our	O
boats	O
lost	O
their	O
grapplings	O
upon	O
the	O
reef	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
hope	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
sound	O
,	O
they	O
gave	O
us	O
very	O
little	O
concern	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
secured	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
the	O
master	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
boats	O
manned	O
and	O
armed	O
,	O
to	O
sound	O
the	O
upper	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
found	O
good	O
anchorage	O
we	O
might	O
warp	O
the	O
ship	O
up	O
within	O
the	O
reef	O
;	O
and	O
anchor	O
her	O
in	O
safety	O
.	O

The	O
weather	O
was	O
now	O
very	O
pleasant	O
,	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
canoes	O
were	O
upon	O
the	O
reef	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
shore	O
was	O
crouded	O
with	O
people	O

About	O
four	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
the	O
master	O
returned	O
,	O
and	O
reported	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
every	O
where	O
good	O
anchorage	O
;	O
I	O
therefore	O
determined	O
to	O
warp	O
the	O

up	O
the	O
bay	O
early	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O

I	O
put	O
the	O

at	O
four	O

ordered	O
all	O
the	O

who	O
were	O
not	O
upon	O
the	O

,	O
to	O
repair	O
to	O
the	O

assigned	O
them	O

at	O
a	O
moment	O

a	O

with	O
hogs	O

of	O
both	O

at	O
sun-set	O

all	O
the	O

in	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O

At	O
six	O
o'clock	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
warp	O
the	O
ship	O
up	O
the	O
harbour	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
after	O
,	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O

came	O
under	O

As	O

that	O
they	O
had	O
hogs	O

and	O
fruit	O
on	O

I	O
ordered	O
the	O

them	O
for	O

By	O
eight	O
o'clock	O
,	O
the	O

was	O
greatly	O

and	O
those	O
that	O

size	O
,	O
with	O
twelve	O
or	O
fifteen	O
stout	O
men	O
in	O

I	O
observed	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
concern	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
furnished	O
rather	O
for	O
war	O
than	O

,	O
having	O
very	O
little	O
on	O

except	O
round	O

;	O
I	O
therefore	O
sent	O
for	O
Mr.	O
Furneaux	O
,	O
my	O
first	O
lieutenant	O
being	O
still	O
very	O
ill	O
,	O

ordered	O
him	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
fourth	O

constantly	O
at	O
their	O
arms	O
,	O
while	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O

were	O
warping	O
the	O
ship	O

In	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
more	O
canoes	O
were	O
continually	O
coming	O
off	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
freighted	O
very	O
differently	O
from	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
on	O
board	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
women	O
who	O
were	O
placed	O
in	O
a	O
row	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
near	O
the	O
ship	O

made	O
all	O
the	O
wanton	O
gestures	O
that	O
can	O

While	O
these	O

were	O

their	O
allurements	O
,	O
the	O
large	O
canoes	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
freighted	O
with	O
stones	O

drew	O
together	O
very	O
close	O
round	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
on	O

in	O
a	O

some	O
blowing	O

on	O

After	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
a	O
man	O
who	O
sat	O
upon	O
a	O
canopy	O
that	O
was	O
fixed	O
on	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
large	O
double	O
canoes	O

made	O
signs	O
that	O
he	O
wished	O
to	O

up	O
to	O
the	O

I	O
immediately	O

my	O

when	O

one	O

a	O

I	O
received	O
it	O
with	O
expressions	O

,	O
and	O
immediately	O
got	O
some	O
trinkets	O
to	O

him	O
in	O

but	O
to	O
my	O
great	O
surprise	O
he	O
had	O
put	O
off	O
a	O

distance	O
from	O
the	O

and	O
upon	O
throwing	O
up	O
the	O
branch	O
of	O
a	O
cocoa-nut	O

there	O
was	O
an	O
universal	O
shout	O
from	O
all	O
the	O

which	O
at	O
once	O
moved	O
towards	O
the	O

and	O
a	O
shower	O
of	O
stones	O
was	O
poured	O
into	O
her	O
on	O

As	O
an	O
attack	O
was	O
now	O

in	O
which	O

into	O
some	O

in	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O

they	O
renewed	O
the	O

all	O
our	O

that	O
were	O

upon	O
deck	O
,	O
having	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
got	O
to	O
their	O

I	O
ordered	O
them	O
to	O
fire	O
the	O
great	O

and	O
to	O
play	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
constantly	O
at	O
a	O
place	O
on	O

where	O
a	O

taking	O
in	O
men	O

and	O
pushing	O
off	O
towards	O
the	O
ship	O
with	O
the	O

expedition	O

When	O
the	O
great	O
guns	O
began	O
to	O
fire	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
not	O
less	O
than	O
three	O

canoes	O
about	O

having	O
on	O

at	O

two	O

canoes	O

from	O

put	O
a	O

As	O

some	O

the	O
rest	O

I	O
ordered	O

In	O
this	O

a	O

with	O

by	O
the	O

of	O

from	O

weighed	O
about	O
two	O

the	O

and	O
about	O
two	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
of	O
the	O

We	O
had	O
here	O
nine	O
fathom	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
there	O
were	O

We	O
moored	O
the	O

carried	O
out	O

with	O
the	O

we	O
also	O
got	O
up	O
and	O
mounted	O
the	O
eight	O

which	O
had	O

into	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
this	O
was	O
done	O
,	O
the	O
boats	O
were	O
employed	O
in	O
sounding	O
all	O

the	O

and	O
in	O
examining	O
the	O

All	O
the	O
afternoon	O

Soon	O
after	O
the	O

had	O
brought	O
me	O
this	O
account	O

I	O
sent	O
Mr.	O
Furneaux	O
again	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
boats	O
manned	O
and	O
armed	O
,	O
the	O

being	O
also	O
put	O
on	O

with	O
orders	O
to	O

and	O
secure	O

and	O
the	O

,	O
in	O

About	O
two	O
o'clock	O
the	O
boats	O
landed	O
without	O
any	O
opposition	O
,	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Furneaux	O
stuck	O
up	O
a	O
staff	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
he	O
hoisted	O
a	O
pendant	O
,	O
turned	O
a	O
turf	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
in	O
his	O
Majesty	O
's	O
name	O
,	O
in	O
honour	O
of	O
whom	O
he	O
called	O
it	O
KING	O
GEORGE	O
THE	O
THIRD	O
'S	O
ISLAND	O
:	O
he	O
then	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
tasted	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
found	O
excellent	O
,	O
and	O
mixing	O
some	O
of	O
it	O
with	O
rum	O
,	O
every	O
man	O
drank	O
his	O
Majesty	O
's	O
health	O
.	O

While	O
he	O
was	O
at	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
about	O
twelve	O
yards	O
wide	O
,	O
and	O
fordable	O
,	O
he	O
saw	O
two	O
old	O
men	O
on	O
the	O
opposite	O
side	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
who	O
perceiving	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
discovered	O
,	O
put	O
themselves	O
in	O
a	O
supplicatory	O
posture	O
,	O
and	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
great	O
terror	O
and	O
confusion	O
.	O

Mr.	O
Furneaux	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
come	O
over	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
complied	O
.	O

When	O
he	O
landed	O
,	O
he	O
came	O
forward	O
,	O
creeping	O
upon	O
his	O
hands	O
and	O
knees	O
,	O
but	O
Mr.	O
Furneaux	O
raised	O
him	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
while	O
he	O
stood	O
trembling	O
,	O
shewed	O
him	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
stones	O
that	O
were	O
thrown	O
at	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
make	O
him	O
apprehend	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
natives	O
attempted	O
no	O
mischief	O
against	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
do	O
no	O
harm	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

He	O
ordered	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
casks	O
to	O
be	O
filled	O
,	O
to	O
shew	O
the	O
Indian	O
that	O
we	O
wanted	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
produced	O
some	O
hatchets	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
things	O
,	O
to	O
intimate	O
that	O
he	O
wished	O
to	O
trade	O
for	O
provisions	O
.	O

The	O
old	O
man	O
,	O
during	O
this	O
pantomimical	O
conversation	O
,	O
in	O
some	O
degree	O
recovered	O
his	O
spirits	O
;	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Furneaux	O
,	O
to	O
confirm	O
his	O
professions	O
of	O
friendship	O
,	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
hatchet	O
,	O
some	O
nails	O
,	O
beads	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
trifles	O
;	O
after	O
which	O
he	O
reimbarked	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
boats	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
the	O
pendant	O
flying	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
boats	O
were	O
put	O
off	O
,	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
went	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
pendant	O
,	O
and	O
danced	O
round	O
it	O
a	O
considerable	O
time	O
:	O
he	O
then	O
retired	O
,	O
but	O
soon	O
after	O
returned	O
with	O
some	O
green	O
boughs	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
threw	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
retired	O
a	O
second	O
time	O
:	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
long	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
before	O
he	O
appeared	O
again	O
,	O
with	O
about	O
a	O
dozen	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
and	O
putting	O
themselves	O
in	O
a	O
supplicating	O
posture	O
,	O
they	O
all	O
approached	O
the	O
pendant	O
in	O
a	O
slow	O
pace	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
wind	O
happening	O
to	O
move	O
it	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
got	O
close	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
they	O
suddenly	O
retreated	O
with	O
the	O
greatest	O
precipitation	O
.	O

After	O
standing	O
some	O
time	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
gazing	O
at	O
it	O
,	O
they	O
went	O
away	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
came	O
back	O
,	O
with	O
two	O
large	O
hogs	O
alive	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
laid	O
down	O
at	O
the	O
foot	O
of	O
the	O
staff	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
length	O
taking	O
courage	O
,	O
they	O
began	O
to	O
dance	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
had	O
performed	O
this	O
ceremony	O
,	O
they	O
brought	O
the	O
hogs	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
water	O
side	O
,	O
launched	O
a	O
canoe	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
them	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

The	O
old	O
man	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
a	O
large	O
white	O
beard	O
,	O
then	O
embarked	O
with	O
them	O
alone	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
:	O
when	O
he	O
came	O
along	O
side	O
,	O
he	O
made	O
a	O
set	O
speech	O
,	O
and	O
afterwards	O
handed	O
in	O
several	O
green	O
plantain	O
leaves	O
,	O
one	O
by	O
one	O
,	O
uttering	O
a	O
sentence	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
solemn	O
slow	O
tone	O
,	O
with	O
each	O
of	O
them	O
as	O
he	O
delivered	O
it	O
;	O
after	O
this	O
he	O
sent	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
two	O
hogs	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
turning	O
round	O
,	O
pointed	O
to	O
the	O
land	O
.	O

I	O
ordered	O
some	O
presents	O
to	O
be	O
given	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
would	O
accept	O
of	O
nothing	O
;	O
and	O
soon	O
after	O
put	O
off	O
his	O
canoe	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

At	O
night	O
,	O
soon	O
after	O
it	O
was	O
dark	O
,	O
we	O
heard	O
the	O
noise	O
of	O
many	O
drums	O
,	O
with	O
conchs	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
wind	O
instruments	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
a	O
multitude	O
of	O
lights	O
all	O
along	O
the	O
coast	O
.	O

At	O
six	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
seeing	O
none	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
observing	O
that	O
the	O
pendant	O
was	O
taken	O
away	O
,	O
which	O
probably	O
they	O
had	O
learnt	O
to	O
despise	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
frogs	O
in	O
the	O
fable	O
did	O
King	O
Log	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
lieutenant	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
guard	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
all	O
was	O
well	O
,	O
to	O
send	O
off	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
begin	O
watering	O
:	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
satisfaction	O
to	O
find	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
sent	O
off	O
for	O
water	O
casks	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
eight	O
o'clock	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
four	O
tons	O
of	O
water	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

While	O
our	O
people	O
were	O
employed	O
in	O
filling	O
the	O
casks	O
,	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
appeared	O
on	O
the	O
opposite	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
whom	O
the	O
officer	O
had	O
seen	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
;	O
and	O
soon	O
after	O
he	O
came	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
with	O
him	O
a	O
little	O
fruit	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
few	O
fowls	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
also	O
sent	O
off	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

At	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
very	O
ill	O
for	O
near	O
a	O
fortnight	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
so	O
weak	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
scarcely	O
crawl	O
about	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
employed	O
my	O
glasses	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
was	O
doing	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

At	O
near	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
after	O
eight	O
o'clock	O
,	O
I	O
perceived	O
a	O
multitude	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
coming	O
over	O
a	O
hill	O
at	O
about	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
canoes	O
making	O
round	O
the	O
western	O
point	O
,	O
and	O
keeping	O
close	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
looked	O
at	O
the	O
watering-place	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
at	O
the	O
back	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
clear	O
,	O
a	O
very	O
numerous	O
party	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
creeping	O
along	O
behind	O
the	O
bushes	O
;	O
I	O
saw	O
also	O
many	O
thousands	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
pushing	O
along	O
towards	O
the	O
watering-place	O
,	O
and	O
canoes	O
coming	O
very	O
fast	O
round	O
the	O
other	O
point	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
.	O

Being	O
alarmed	O
at	O
these	O
appearances	O
,	O
I	O
dispatched	O
a	O
boat	O
,	O
to	O
acquaint	O
the	O
officer	O
on	O
shore	O
with	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
,	O
and	O
order	O
him	O
immediately	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
with	O
his	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
leave	O
the	O
casks	O
behind	O
him	O
:	O
he	O
had	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
discovered	O
his	O
danger	O
,	O
and	O
embarked	O
before	O
the	O
boat	O
reached	O
him	O
.	O

Having	O
perceived	O
the	O
Indians	O
that	O
were	O
creeping	O
towards	O
him	O
under	O
shelter	O
of	O
the	O
wood	O
,	O
he	O
immediately	O
dispatched	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
making	O
signs	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
keep	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
wanted	O
nothing	O
but	O
water	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
perceived	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
discovered	O
,	O
they	O
began	O
to	O
shout	O
,	O
and	O
advanced	O
with	O
greater	O
speed	O
.	O

The	O
officer	O
immediately	O
repaired	O
to	O
the	O
boats	O
with	O
his	O
people	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
having	O
crossed	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
took	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
casks	O
,	O
with	O
great	O
appearance	O
of	O
exultation	O
and	O
joy	O

The	O
canoes	O
now	O
pulled	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O

towards	O
the	O
place	O

with	O
the	O

expedition	O
,	O
all	O

with	O
them	O

except	O
a	O

of	O

themselves	O
upon	O
a	O

which	O
overlooked	O
the	O

the	O

The	O

from	O

the	O

was	O
at	O

off	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
within	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
now	O
made	O
towards	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
doubt	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
intended	O
to	O
try	O
their	O
fortune	O
in	O
a	O
second	O
attack	O
.	O

As	O
to	O
shorten	O
the	O
contest	O
would	O
certainly	O
lessen	O
the	O
mischief	O
,	O
I	O
determined	O
to	O
make	O
this	O
action	O
decisive	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
an	O
end	O
to	O
hostilities	O
at	O
once	O
;	O
I	O
therefore	O
ordered	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
all	O
at	O
their	O
quarters	O
,	O
to	O
fire	O
first	O
upon	O
the	O
canoes	O
which	O
were	O
drawn	O
together	O
in	O
groups	O
:	O
this	O
was	O
immediately	O
done	O
so	O
effectually	O
,	O
that	O
those	O
which	O
were	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
made	O
towards	O
the	O
shore	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
possible	O
,	O
and	O
those	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
,	O
getting	O
round	O
the	O
reef	O
,	O
were	O
soon	O
beyond	O
the	O
reach	O
of	O
our	O
guns	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
directed	O
the	O
fire	O
into	O
the	O
wood	O
in	O
different	O
parts	O
,	O
which	O
soon	O
drove	O
the	O
Indians	O
out	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
who	O
ran	O
up	O
the	O
hill	O
where	O
the	O
women	O
and	O
children	O
had	O
seated	O
themselves	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
battle	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
hill	O
there	O
were	O
now	O
several	O
thousands	O
who	O
thought	O
themselves	O
in	O
perfect	O
security	O
;	O
but	O
to	O
convince	O
them	O
of	O
the	O
contrary	O
,	O
and	O
hoping	O
that	O
when	O
they	O
saw	O
the	O
shot	O
fall	O
much	O
farther	O
than	O
they	O
could	O
think	O
possible	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
suppose	O
it	O
could	O
reach	O
them	O
at	O
any	O
distance	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
guns	O
to	O
be	O
let	O
down	O
as	O
low	O
as	O
they	O
would	O
admit	O
,	O
and	O
fired	O
four	O
shot	O
towards	O
them	O
.	O

Two	O
of	O
the	O
balls	O
fell	O
close	O
by	O
a	O
tree	O
where	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
these	O
people	O
were	O
sitting	O
,	O
and	O
struck	O
them	O
with	O
such	O
terror	O
and	O
consternation	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
two	O
minutes	O
not	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
.	O

Having	O
thus	O
cleared	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
I	O
manned	O
and	O
armed	O
the	O
boats	O
,	O
and	O
putting	O
a	O
strong	O
guard	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
all	O
the	O
carpenters	O
with	O
their	O
axes	O
,	O
and	O
ordered	O
them	O
to	O
destroy	O
every	O
canoe	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
run	O
ashore	O
.	O

Before	O
noon	O
,	O
this	O
service	O
was	O
effectually	O
performed	O
,	O
and	O
more	O
than	O
fifty	O
canoes	O
,	O
many	O
of	O
which	O
were	O
sixty	O
feet	O
long	O
,	O
and	O
three	O
broad	O
,	O
and	O
lashed	O
together	O
,	O
were	O
cut	O
to	O
pieces	O
.	O

Nothing	O
was	O
found	O
in	O
them	O
but	O
stones	O
and	O
slings	O
,	O
except	O
a	O
little	O
fruit	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
few	O
fowls	O
and	O
hogs	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
on	O
board	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
canoes	O
of	O
a	O
much	O
smaller	O
size	O
.	O

At	O
two	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
about	O
ten	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
came	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
wood	O
with	O
green	O
boughs	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
stuck	O
up	O
near	O
the	O
water	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
retired	O
.	O

After	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
,	O
they	O
appeared	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
with	O
them	O
several	O
hogs	O
,	O
with	O
their	O
legs	O
tied	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
placed	O
near	O
the	O
green	O
boughs	O
,	O
and	O
retired	O
a	O
second	O
time	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
they	O
brought	O
down	O
several	O
more	O
hogs	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
dogs	O
,	O
with	O
their	O
fore	O
legs	O
tied	O
over	O
their	O
heads	O
,	O
and	O
going	O
again	O
into	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
brought	O
back	O
several	O
bundles	O
of	O
the	O
cloth	O
which	O
they	O
use	O
for	O
apparel	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
has	O
some	O
resemblance	O
to	O
Indian	O
paper	O
.	O

These	O
they	O
placed	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
and	O
called	O
to	O
us	O
on	O
board	O
to	O
fetch	O
them	O
away	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
about	O
three	O
cables	O
'	O
length	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
then	O
perfectly	O
discover	O
of	O
what	O
this	O
peace-offering	O
consisted	O
:	O
we	O
guessed	O
at	O
the	O
hogs	O
and	O
the	O
cloth	O
,	O
but	O
seeing	O
the	O
dogs	O
,	O
with	O
their	O
fore	O
legs	O
appearing	O
over	O
the	O
hinder	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
neck	O
,	O
rise	O
up	O
several	O
times	O
,	O
and	O
run	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
in	O
an	O
erect	O
posture	O
,	O
we	O
took	O
them	O
for	O
some	O
strange	O
unknown	O
animal	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
very	O
impatient	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
nearer	O
view	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
boat	O
was	O
therefore	O
sent	O
on	O
shore	O
with	O
all	O
expedition	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
wonder	O
was	O
soon	O
at	O
an	O
end	O
.	O

Our	O
people	O
found	O
nine	O
good	O
hogs	O
,	O
besides	O
the	O
dogs	O
and	O
the	O
cloth	O
:	O
the	O
hogs	O
were	O
brought	O
off	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
dogs	O
were	O
turned	O
loose	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
the	O
cloth	O
left	O
behind	O
.	O

In	O
return	O
for	O
the	O
hogs	O
,	O
our	O
people	O
left	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
some	O
hatchets	O
,	O
nails	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
things	O
,	O
making	O
signs	O
to	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
who	O
were	O
in	O
sight	O
,	O
to	O
take	O
them	O
away	O
with	O
their	O
cloth	O
.	O

Soon	O
after	O
the	O
boat	O
had	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
the	O
Indians	O
brought	O
down	O
two	O
more	O
hogs	O
,	O
and	O
called	O
to	O
us	O
to	O
fetch	O
them	O
;	O
the	O
boat	O
therefore	O
returned	O
,	O
and	O
fetched	O
off	O
the	O
two	O
hogs	O
,	O
but	O
still	O
left	O
the	O
cloth	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
Indians	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
take	O
it	O
.	O

Our	O
people	O
reported	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
not	O
touched	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
left	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
somebody	O
suggesting	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
take	O
our	O
offering	O
because	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
accepted	O
their	O
cloth	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
orders	O
that	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
fetched	O
away	O
.	O

The	O
event	O
proved	O
that	O
the	O
conjecture	O
was	O
true	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
moment	O
the	O
boat	O
had	O
taken	O
the	O
cloth	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
the	O
Indians	O
came	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
every	O
possible	O
demonstration	O
of	O
joy	O
,	O
carried	O
away	O
all	O
I	O
had	O
sent	O
them	O
into	O
the	O
wood	O
.	O

Our	O
boats	O
then	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
watering-place	O
,	O
and	O
filled	O
and	O
brought	O
off	O
all	O
the	O
casks	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
about	O
six	O
tons	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
suffered	O
no	O
injury	O
while	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
the	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
but	O
some	O
leathern	O
buckets	O
and	O
funnels	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
taken	O
away	O
with	O
the	O
casks	O
,	O
were	O
not	O
returned	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
I	O
sent	O
the	O
boats	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
guard	O
,	O
to	O
fill	O
some	O
more	O
casks	O
with	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
after	O
the	O
people	O
were	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
the	O
same	O
old	O
man	O
who	O
had	O
come	O
over	O
the	O
river	O
to	O
them	O
the	O
first	O
day	O
,	O
came	O
again	O
to	O
the	O
farther	O
side	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
where	O
he	O
made	O
a	O
long	O
speech	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
crossed	O
the	O
water	O
.	O

When	O
he	O
came	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
waterers	O
,	O
the	O
officer	O
shewed	O
him	O
the	O
stones	O
that	O
were	O
piled	O
up	O
like	O
cannon	O
balls	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
been	O
brought	O
thither	O
since	O
our	O
first	O
landing	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
bags	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
taken	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
canoes	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
ordered	O
to	O
be	O
destroyed	O
,	O
filled	O
with	O
stones	O
,	O
and	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
make	O
him	O
understand	O
that	O
the	O
Indians	O
had	O
been	O
the	O
aggressors	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
mischief	O
we	O
had	O
done	O
them	O
was	O
in	O
our	O
own	O
defence	O
.	O

The	O
old	O
man	O
seemed	O
to	O
apprehend	O
his	O
meaning	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
to	O
admit	O
it	O
:	O
he	O
immediately	O
made	O
a	O
speech	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
pointing	O
to	O
the	O
stones	O
,	O
slings	O
,	O
and	O
bags	O
,	O
with	O
great	O
emotion	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
his	O
looks	O
,	O
gestures	O
,	O
and	O
voice	O
were	O
so	O
furious	O
as	O
to	O
be	O
frightful	O
.	O

His	O
passions	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
subsided	O
by	O
degrees	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
officer	O
,	O
who	O
to	O
his	O
great	O
regret	O
could	O
not	O
understand	O
one	O
word	O
of	O
all	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
said	O
,	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
convince	O
him	O
,	O
by	O
all	O
the	O
signs	O
he	O
could	O
devise	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
wished	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
friendship	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
disposed	O
to	O
shew	O
them	O
every	O
mark	O
of	O
kindness	O
in	O
our	O
power	O
.	O

He	O
then	O
shook	O
hands	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
embraced	O
him	O
,	O
giving	O
him	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
several	O
such	O
trinkets	O
as	O
he	O
thought	O
would	O
be	O
most	O
acceptable	O
.	O

He	O
contrived	O
also	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
understand	O
that	O
we	O
wished	O
to	O
traffick	O
for	O
provisions	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
Indians	O
should	O
not	O
come	O
down	O
in	O
great	O
numbers	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
keep	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
and	O
we	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
went	O
away	O
with	O
great	O
appearance	O
of	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
and	O
before	O
noon	O
a	O
trade	O

This	O
threw	O
them	O
into	O
a	O
panic	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
all	O
ran	O
away	O
:	O
when	O
they	O
got	O
to	O
some	O
distance	O
they	O
stopped	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
bring	O
the	O
duck	O
over	O
:	O
this	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
at	O
last	O
ventured	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
pale	O
and	O
trembling	O
,	O
laid	O
it	O
down	O
at	O
his	O
feet	O

Several	O
other	O
ducks	O
happening	O
at	O
the	O
instant	O
to	O
fly	O
over	O
the	O
spot	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
standing	O
,	O
he	O
fired	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
fortunately	O
brought	O
down	O
three	O

This	O
incident	O
gave	O
the	O
natives	O
such	O
a	O
dread	O
of	O
a	O
gun	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
a	O
musquet	O
was	O
pointed	O
at	O
a	O
thousand	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
all	O
run	O
away	O
like	O
a	O
flock	O
of	O
sheep	O
;	O
and	O
probably	O
the	O
ease	O
with	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
afterwards	O
kept	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
orderly	O
behaviour	O
in	O
their	O
traffick	O
,	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
measure	O
owing	O
to	O
their	O
having	O
upon	O
this	O
occasion	O
seen	O
the	O
instrument	O
of	O
which	O
before	O
they	O
had	O
only	O
felt	O
the	O
effects	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
foresaw	O
that	O
a	O
private	O
traffick	O
would	O
probably	O
commence	O
between	O
such	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
as	O
were	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
left	O
to	O
their	O
own	O
caprice	O
,	O
perpetual	O
quarrels	O
and	O
mischief	O
would	O
ensue	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
that	O
all	O
matters	O
of	O
traffick	O
should	O
be	O
transacted	O
by	O
the	O
gunner	O
,	O
on	O
behalf	O
of	O
both	O
parties	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
directed	O
him	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
no	O
injury	O
was	O
done	O
to	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
either	O
by	O
violence	O
or	O
fraud	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
all	O
possible	O
means	O
to	O
attach	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
to	O
his	O
interest	O
.	O

This	O
service	O
he	O
performed	O
with	O
great	O
diligence	O
and	O
fidelity	O
,	O
nor	O
did	O
he	O
neglect	O
to	O
complain	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
transgressed	O
my	O
orders	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
of	O
infinite	O
advantage	O
to	O
all	O
parties	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
I	O
punished	O
the	O
first	O
offenders	O
with	O
a	O
necessary	O
severity	O
,	O
many	O
irregularities	O
,	O
that	O
would	O
otherwise	O
have	O
produced	O
the	O
most	O
disagreeable	O
consequences	O
,	O
were	O
prevented	O
:	O
we	O
were	O
also	O
indebted	O
for	O
many	O
advantages	O
to	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
,	O
whose	O
caution	O
kept	O
our	O
people	O
perpetually	O
upon	O
their	O
guard	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
brought	O
back	O
those	O
who	O
straggled	O
from	O
the	O
party	O
.	O

The	O
natives	O
would	O
indeed	O
sometimes	O
pilfer	O
,	O
but	O
by	O
the	O
terror	O
of	O
a	O
gun	O
,	O
without	O
using	O
it	O
,	O
he	O
always	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
bring	O
back	O
what	O
was	O
stolen	O
.	O

A	O
fellow	O
had	O
one	O
day	O
the	O
dexterity	O
and	O
address	O
to	O
cross	O
the	O
river	O
unperceived	O
,	O
and	O
steal	O
a	O
hatchet	O
;	O
the	O
gunner	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
missed	O
it	O
,	O
made	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
understand	O
what	O
had	O
happened	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
his	O
party	O
ready	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
gone	O
into	O
the	O
woods	O
after	O
the	O
thief	O
:	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
save	O
him	O
the	O
trouble	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
setting	O
off	O
,	O
returned	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
short	O
time	O
with	O
the	O
hatchet	O
.	O

The	O
gunner	O
then	O
insisted	O
that	O
the	O
offender	O
should	O
be	O
delivered	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
this	O
also	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
without	O
great	O
reluctance	O
,	O
complied	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
fellow	O
was	O
brought	O
down	O
,	O
the	O
gunner	O
knew	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
old	O
offender	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
sent	O
him	O
prisoner	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
no	O
intention	O
to	O
punish	O
him	O
otherwise	O
,	O
than	O
by	O
the	O
fear	O
of	O
punishment	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
,	O
after	O
great	O
entreaty	O
and	O
intercession	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
him	O
his	O
liberty	O
,	O
and	O
sent	O
him	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
natives	O
saw	O
him	O
return	O
in	O
safety	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
hard	O
to	O
say	O
whether	O
their	O
astonishment	O
or	O
joy	O
was	O
greatest	O
;	O
they	O
received	O
him	O
with	O
universal	O
acclamations	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
carried	O
him	O
off	O
into	O
the	O
woods	O
:	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
he	O
returned	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
a	O
propitiation	O
to	O
the	O
gunner	O
,	O
he	O
brought	O
him	O
a	O
considerable	O
quantity	O
of	O
breadfruit	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
large	O
hog	O
,	O
ready	O
roasted	O
.	O

At	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
board	O
were	O
employed	O
in	O
caulking	O
and	O
painting	O
the	O
weather-work	O
,	O
over-hauling	O
the	O
rigging	O
,	O
stowing	O
the	O
hold	O
,	O
and	O
doing	O
other	O
necessary	O
business	O
,	O
but	O
my	O
disorder	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
bilious	O
cholic	O
,	O
increased	O
so	O
much	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
day	O
I	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
take	O
to	O
my	O
bed	O
;	O
my	O
First	O
Lieutenant	O
also	O
still	O
continued	O
very	O
ill	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Purser	O
was	O
incapable	O
of	O
his	O
duty	O
.	O

The	O
whole	O
command	O
devolved	O
upon	O
Mr.	O
Furneaux	O
,	O
the	O
Second	O
Lieutenant	O
,	O
to	O
whom	O
I	O
gave	O
general	O
directions	O
,	O
and	O
recommended	O
a	O
particular	O
attention	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

I	O
also	O
ordered	O
that	O
fruit	O
and	O
fresh	O
provisions	O
should	O
be	O
served	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
be	O
procured	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
boats	O
should	O
never	O
be	O
absent	O
from	O
the	O
ship	O
after	O
sun-set	O
.	O

These	O
directions	O
were	O
fulfilled	O
with	O
such	O
prudence	O
and	O
punctuality	O
,	O
that	O
during	O
all	O
my	O
sickness	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
troubled	O
with	O
any	O
business	O
,	O
nor	O
had	O
the	O
mortification	O
to	O
hear	O
a	O
single	O
complaint	O
or	O
appeal	O
.	O

The	O
men	O
were	O
constantly	O
served	O
with	O
fresh	O
pork	O
,	O
fowls	O
,	O
and	O
fruit	O
,	O
in	O
such	O
plenty	O
,	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
left	O
my	O
bed	O
,	O
after	O
having	O
been	O
confined	O
to	O
it	O
near	O
a	O
fortnight	O
,	O
my	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O
looked	O
so	O
fresh	O
and	O
healthy	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
scarcely	O
believe	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
same	O
people	O
.	O

Sunday	O
the	O
28th	O
was	O
marked	O
by	O
no	O
incident	O
;	O
but	O
on	O
Monday	O
the	O
29th	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
gunner	O
's	O
party	O
found	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
saltpetre	O
near	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
an	O
egg	O
.	O

As	O
this	O
was	O
an	O
object	O
of	O
equal	O
curiosity	O
and	O
importance	O
,	O
diligent	O
enquiry	O
was	O
immediately	O
made	O
from	O
whence	O
it	O
came	O
.	O

The	O
surgeon	O
asked	O
every	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
separately	O
,	O
whether	O
he	O
had	O
brought	O
it	O
from	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
every	O
one	O
on	O
board	O
also	O
was	O
asked	O
whether	O
he	O
had	O
carried	O
it	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
but	O
all	O
declared	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
never	O
had	O
such	O
a	O
thing	O
in	O
their	O
possession	O
.	O

Application	O
was	O
then	O
made	O
to	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
both	O
parties	O
was	O
so	O
imperfectly	O
conveyed	O
by	O
signs	O
,	O
that	O
nothing	O
could	O
be	O
learnt	O
of	O
them	O
about	O
it	O
:	O
during	O
our	O
whole	O
stay	O
here	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
this	O
one	O
piece	O
.	O

While	O
the	O
gunner	O
was	O
trafficking	O
for	O
provisions	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
we	O
sometimes	O
hauled	O
the	O
seine	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
caught	O
no	O
fish	O
;	O
we	O
also	O
frequently	O
trawled	O
,	O
but	O
with	O
no	O
better	O
success	O
:	O
the	O
disappointment	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
was	O
not	O
felt	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
produce	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
enabled	O
our	O
people	O
to	O
``	O
fare	O
sumptuously	O
every	O
day	O
.	O
''	O

All	O
matters	O
continued	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
situation	O
till	O
the	O
2d	O
of	O
July	O
,	O
when	O
our	O
old	O
man	O
being	O
absent	O
,	O
the	O
supply	O
of	O
fresh	O
provisions	O
and	O
fruit	O
fell	O
short	O
;	O
we	O
had	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
enough	O
to	O
serve	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
messes	O
,	O
reserving	O
plenty	O
for	O
the	O
sick	O
and	O
convalescent	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
3d	O
,	O
we	O
heeled	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
looked	O
at	O
her	O
bottom	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
as	O
clean	O
as	O
when	O
she	O
came	O
out	O
of	O
dock	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
as	O
sound	O
.	O

During	O
all	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
none	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
came	O
near	O
our	O
boats	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
in	O
their	O
canoes	O
.	O

This	O
day	O
,	O
about	O
noon	O
,	O
we	O
caught	O
a	O
very	O
large	O
shark	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
the	O
boats	O
went	O
to	O
fetch	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
board	O
to	O
dinner	O
,	O
we	O
sent	O
it	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
boats	O
were	O
putting	O
off	O
again	O
,	O
the	O
gunner	O
seeing	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
beckoned	O
them	O
to	O
come	O
over	O
;	O
they	O
immediately	O
complied	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
gave	O
them	O
the	O
shark	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
soon	O
cut	O
to	O
pieces	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
away	O
with	O
great	O
appearance	O
of	O
satisfaction	O
.	O

On	O
Sunday	O
the	O
5th	O
,	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
returned	O
to	O
the	O
market-tent	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
the	O
gunner	O
understand	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
up	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
to	O
prevail	O
upon	O
the	O
people	O
to	O
bring	O
down	O
their	O
hogs	O
,	O
poultry	O
,	O
and	O
fruit	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
the	O
parts	O
near	O
the	O
watering-place	O
were	O
now	O
nearly	O
exhausted	O
.	O

The	O
good	O
effects	O
of	O
his	O
expedition	O
soon	O
appeared	O
,	O
for	O
several	O
Indians	O
,	O
whom	O
our	O
people	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
before	O
,	O
came	O
in	O
with	O
some	O
hogs	O
that	O
were	O
larger	O
than	O
any	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
yet	O
brought	O
to	O
market	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
,	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
ventured	O
off	O
in	O
his	O
canoe	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
present	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
a	O
hog	O
ready	O
roasted	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
much	O
pleased	O
with	O
his	O
attention	O
and	O
liberality	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
him	O
,	O
in	O
return	O
for	O
his	O
hog	O
,	O
an	O
iron	O
pot	O
,	O
a	O
looking-glass	O
,	O
a	O
drinking-glass	O
,	O
and	O
several	O
other	O
things	O
,	O
which	O
no	O
man	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
was	O
in	O
possession	O
of	O
but	O
himself	O
.	O

While	O
our	O
people	O
were	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
several	O
young	O
women	O
were	O
permitted	O
to	O
cross	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
averse	O
to	O
the	O
granting	O
of	O
personal	O
favours	O
,	O
knew	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
them	O
too	O
well	O
not	O
to	O
stipulate	O
for	O
a	O
consideration	O
:	O
the	O
price	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
was	O
not	O
great	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
was	O
such	O
as	O
our	O
men	O
were	O
not	O
always	O
able	O
to	O
pay	O
,	O
and	O
under	O
this	O
temptation	O
they	O
stole	O
nails	O
and	O
other	O
iron	O
from	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

The	O
nails	O
that	O
we	O
brought	O
for	O
traffick	O
,	O
were	O
not	O
always	O
in	O
their	O
reach	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
they	O
drew	O
several	O
out	O
of	O
different	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
vessel	O

particularly	O
those	O
that	O
fastened	O
the	O
cleats	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
side	O

This	O
was	O
productive	O
of	O
a	O
double	O
mischief	O
;	O
damage	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
considerable	O
rise	O
at	O
market	O

When	O
the	O
gunner	O
offered	O

as	O
usual	O

small	O
nails	O
for	O
hogs	O
of	O
a	O

the	O
natives	O
refused	O
to	O
take	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
produced	O
large	O
spikes	O
,	O
intimating	O
that	O
they	O
expected	O
such	O
nails	O
as	O
these	O
.	O

A	O
most	O
diligent	O
enquiry	O
was	O
set	O
on	O
foot	O
to	O
discover	O
the	O
offenders	O
,	O
but	O
all	O
to	O
no	O
purpose	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
a	O
large	O
reward	O
was	O
offered	O
to	O
procure	O
intelligence	O
,	O
none	O
was	O
obtained	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
mortified	O
at	O
the	O
disappointment	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
still	O
more	O
mortified	O
at	O
a	O
fraud	O
which	O
I	O
found	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
had	O
practised	O
upon	O
the	O
natives	O
.	O

When	O
no	O
nails	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
procured	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
stolen	O
lead	O
,	O
and	O
cut	O
it	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
shape	O
of	O
nails	O
.	O

Many	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
paid	O
with	O
this	O
base	O
money	O
,	O
brought	O
their	O
leaden	O
nails	O
,	O
with	O
great	O
simplicity	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
gunner	O
,	O
and	O
requested	O
him	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
iron	O
in	O
their	O
stead	O
.	O

With	O
this	O
request	O
,	O
however	O
reasonable	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
comply	O
;	O
because	O
,	O
by	O
rendering	O
lead	O
current	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
encouraged	O
the	O
stealing	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
market	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
as	O
effectually	O
spoiled	O
by	O
those	O
who	O
could	O
not	O
procure	O
nails	O
,	O
as	O
by	O
those	O
who	O
could	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
therefore	O
necessary	O
,	O
upon	O
every	O
account	O
,	O
to	O
render	O
this	O
leaden	O
currency	O
of	O
no	O
value	O
,	O
though	O
for	O
our	O
honour	O
I	O
should	O
have	O

glad	O

have	O
called	O
it	O
in	O

On	O
Tuesday	O
the	O
7th	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
mates	O
,	O
with	O
thirty	O
men	O
,	O
to	O
a	O
village	O
at	O
a	O
little	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
market	O
,	O
hoping	O
that	O
refreshments	O
might	O
there	O
be	O
bought	O
at	O
the	O
original	O
price	O
;	O
but	O
here	O
they	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
give	O
still	O
more	O
than	O
at	O
the	O
water-side	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
,	O
being	O
this	O
day	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
up	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
weather	O
being	O
fine	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
into	O
a	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
rowed	O
about	O
four	O
miles	O
down	O
the	O
coast	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
the	O
country	O
populous	O
,	O
and	O
pleasant	O
in	O
the	O
highest	O
degree	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
many	O
canoes	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
but	O
not	O
one	O
came	O
off	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
nor	O
did	O
the	O
people	O
seem	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
least	O
notice	O
of	O
us	O
as	O
we	O
passed	O
along	O
.	O

About	O
noon	O
I	O
returned	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

The	O
commerce	O
which	O
our	O
men	O
had	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
establish	O
with	O
the	O
women	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
rendered	O
them	O
much	O
less	O
obedient	O
to	O
the	O
orders	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
given	O
for	O
the	O
regulation	O
of	O
their	O
conduct	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
than	O
they	O
were	O
at	O
first	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
it	O
necessary	O
therefore	O
,	O
to	O
read	O
the	O
articles	O
of	O
war	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
punished	O
James	O
Proctor	O
,	O
the	O
corporal	O
of	O
marines	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
not	O
only	O
quitted	O
his	O
station	O
,	O
and	O
insulted	O
the	O
officer	O
,	O
but	O
struck	O
the	O
Master	O
at	O
Arms	O
such	O
a	O
blow	O
as	O
brought	O
him	O
to	O
the	O
ground	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
a	O
party	O
up	O
the	O
country	O
to	O
cut	O
wood	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
met	O
with	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
who	O
treated	O
them	O
with	O
great	O
kindness	O
and	O
hospitality	O
.	O

Several	O
of	O
these	O
friendly	O
Indians	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
in	O
our	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
seemed	O
,	O
both	O
by	O
their	O
dress	O
and	O
behaviour	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
of	O
a	O
superior	O
rank	O
.	O

To	O
these	O
people	O
I	O
paid	O
a	O
particular	O
attention	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
discover	O
what	O
present	O
would	O
most	O
gratify	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
laid	O
down	O
before	O
them	O
a	O
Johannes	O
,	O
a	O
guinea	O
,	O
a	O
crown	O
piece	O
,	O
a	O
Spanish	O
dollar	O
,	O
a	O
few	O
shillings	O
,	O
some	O
new	O
halfpence	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
large	O
nails	O
,	O
making	O
signs	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
take	O
what	O
they	O
liked	O
best	O
.	O

The	O
nails	O
were	O
first	O
seized	O
,	O
with	O
great	O
eagerness	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
a	O
few	O
of	O
the	O
halfpence	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
silver	O
and	O
gold	O
lay	O
neglected	O
.	O

Having	O
presented	O
them	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
nails	O
and	O
halfpence	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
them	O
on	O
shore	O
superlatively	O
happy	O
.	O

From	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
our	O
market	O
was	O
very	O
ill	O
supplied	O
,	O
the	O
Indians	O
refusing	O
to	O
sell	O
provisions	O
at	O
the	O
usual	O
price	O
,	O
and	O
making	O
signs	O
for	O
large	O
nails	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
now	O
thought	O
necessary	O
to	O
look	O
more	O
diligently	O
about	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
to	O
discover	O
what	O
nails	O
had	O
been	O
drawn	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
soon	O
found	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
belaying	O
cleats	O
had	O
been	O
ripped	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
scarcely	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
hammock	O
nails	O
left	O
.	O

All	O
hands	O
were	O
now	O
ordered	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
practised	O
every	O
artifice	O
I	O
could	O
think	O
of	O
to	O
discover	O
the	O
thieves	O
,	O
but	O
without	O
success	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
till	O
the	O
thieves	O
were	O
discovered	O
,	O
not	O
a	O
single	O
man	O
should	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
:	O
this	O
however	O
produced	O
no	O
effect	O
,	O
except	O
that	O
Proctor	O
,	O
the	O
corporal	O
,	O
behaved	O
in	O
a	O
mutinous	O
manner	O
,	O
for	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
instantly	O
punished	O
.	O

On	O
Saturday	O
the	O
11th	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
the	O
gunner	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
with	O
a	O
tall	O
woman	O
,	O
who	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
about	O
five	O
and	O
forty	O
years	O
of	O
age	O
,	O
of	O
a	O
pleasing	O
countenance	O
and	O
majestic	O
deportment	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
but	O
just	O
come	O
into	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
seeing	O
great	O
respect	O
paid	O
her	O
by	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
made	O
her	O
some	O
presents	O
;	O
in	O
return	O
for	O
which	O
she	O
had	O
invited	O
him	O
to	O
her	O
house	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
about	O
two	O
miles	O
up	O
the	O
valley	O
,	O
and	O
given	O
him	O
some	O
large	O
hogs	O
;	O
after	O
which	O
she	O
returned	O
with	O
him	O
to	O
the	O
watering-place	O
,	O
and	O
expressed	O
a	O
desire	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
thought	O
it	O
proper	O
,	O
on	O
all	O
accounts	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
should	O
be	O
gratified	O
.	O

She	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
under	O
no	O
restraint	O
,	O
either	O
from	O
diffidence	O
or	O
fear	O
,	O
when	O
she	O
first	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
and	O
she	O
behaved	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
while	O
she	O
was	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
with	O
an	O
easy	O
freedom	O
,	O
that	O
always	O
distinguishes	O
conscious	O
superiority	O
and	O
habitual	O
command	O
.	O

I	O
gave	O
her	O
a	O
large	O
blue	O
mantle	O
,	O
that	O
reached	O
from	O
her	O
shoulders	O
to	O
her	O
feet	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
threw	O
over	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
tied	O
on	O
with	O
ribands	O
;	O
I	O
gave	O
her	O
also	O
a	O
looking-glass	O
,	O
beads	O
of	O
several	O
sorts	O
,	O
and	O
many	O
other	O
things	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
she	O
accepted	O
with	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
grace	O
,	O
and	O
much	O
pleasure	O
.	O

She	O
took	O
notice	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
ill	O
,	O
and	O
pointed	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

I	O
understood	O
that	O
she	O
meant	O
I	O
should	O
go	O
thither	O
to	O
perfect	O
my	O
recovery	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
thither	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
.	O

When	O
she	O
intimated	O
an	O
inclination	O
to	O
return	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
gunner	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
her	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
having	O
set	O
her	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
attended	O
her	O
to	O
her	O
habitation	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
described	O
as	O
being	O
very	O
large	O
and	O
well	O
built	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
this	O
house	O
she	O
had	O
many	O
guards	O
and	O
domesticks	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
another	O
at	O
a	O
little	O
distance	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
enclosed	O
in	O
lattice-work	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
I	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
princess	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
queen	O
,	O
for	O
such	O
by	O
her	O
authority	O
she	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
,	O
soon	O
after	O
came	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
followed	O
by	O
many	O
of	O
her	O
attendants	O
.	O

As	O
she	O
perceived	O
that	O
my	O
disorder	O
had	O
left	O
me	O
very	O
weak	O
,	O
she	O
ordered	O
her	O
people	O
to	O
take	O
me	O
in	O
their	O
arms	O
,	O
and	O
carry	O
me	O
not	O
only	O
over	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
but	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
her	O
house	O
;	O
and	O
observing	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
were	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
particularly	O
the	O
First	O
Lieutenant	O
and	O
Purser	O
,	O
had	O
also	O
been	O
sick	O
,	O
she	O
caused	O
them	O
also	O
to	O
be	O
carried	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
manner	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
guard	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
ordered	O
out	O
upon	O
the	O
occasion	O
,	O
followed	O
.	O

In	O
our	O
way	O
,	O
a	O
vast	O
multitude	O
crouded	O
about	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
upon	O
her	O
waving	O
her	O
hand	O
,	O
without	O
speaking	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
they	O
withdrew	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
us	O
a	O
free	O
passage	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
approached	O
near	O
her	O
house	O
,	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
both	O
sexes	O
came	O
out	O
to	O
meet	O
her	O
:	O
these	O
she	O
presented	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
after	O
having	O
intimated	O
by	O
signs	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
her	O
relations	O

and	O
taking	O
hold	O
of	O
my	O
hand	O
,	O
she	O
made	O
them	O
kiss	O
it	O
.	O

We	O
then	O
entered	O
the	O
house	O
,	O
which	O
covered	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
ground	O
327	O
feet	O
long	O

and	O
42	O
feet	O

It	O
consisted	O
of	O
a	O

thatched	O
with	O

raised	O
upon	O
39	O

The	O

the	O

on	O
the	O

all	O

the	O
roof	O
being	O
open	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
entered	O
the	O
house	O
,	O
she	O
made	O
us	O
sit	O
down	O

and	O
then	O
calling	O
four	O
young	O

she	O
assisted	O
them	O
to	O

off	O
my	O

draw	O
down	O
my	O

and	O
pull	O
off	O
my	O

and	O
then	O
directed	O
them	O
to	O
smooth	O
down	O
the	O

and	O
gently	O
chafe	O
it	O
with	O
their	O
hands	O
:	O
the	O

operation	O

upon	O
the	O

our	O

off	O

a	O

in	O

they	O
had	O
discovered	O
that	O
our	O

limbs	O
had	O
been	O
screwed	O
on	O
to	O
the	O
trunk	O
;	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
the	O
young	O
women	O
who	O
were	O
chafing	O
us	O
,	O
resumed	O
their	O
employment	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
continued	O
it	O
for	O
about	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
they	O
dressed	O
us	O
again	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
this	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
as	O
may	O
easily	O
be	O
imagined	O
,	O
very	O
aukward	O
;	O
I	O
found	O
great	O
benefit	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
chafing	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
did	O
the	O
Lieutenant	O
and	O
Purser	O
.	O

After	O
a	O
little	O
time	O
,	O
our	O
generous	O
benefactress	O
ordered	O
some	O
bales	O
of	O
Indian	O
cloth	O
to	O
be	O
brought	O
out	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
she	O
clothed	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
that	O
were	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
fashion	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
.	O

At	O
first	O
I	O
declined	O
the	O
acceptance	O
of	O
this	O
favour	O
,	O
but	O
being	O
unwilling	O
not	O
to	O
seem	O
pleased	O
with	O
what	O
was	O
intended	O
to	O
please	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
acquiesced	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
went	O
away	O
,	O
she	O
ordered	O
a	O
very	O
large	O
sow	O
,	O
big	O
with	O
young	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
accompanied	O
us	O
thither	O
herself	O
.	O

She	O
had	O
given	O
directions	O
to	O
her	O
people	O
to	O
carry	O
me	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
done	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
I	O
chose	O
rather	O
to	O
walk	O
,	O
she	O
took	O
me	O
by	O
the	O
arm	O
,	O
and	O
whenever	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
plash	O
of	O
water	O
or	O
dirt	O
,	O
she	O
lifted	O
me	O
over	O
with	O
as	O
little	O
trouble	O
as	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
cost	O
me	O
to	O
have	O
lifted	O
over	O
a	O
child	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
well	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
I	O
sent	O
her	O
by	O
the	O
gunner	O
,	O
six	O
hatchets	O
,	O
six	O
bill-hooks	O
,	O
and	O
several	O
other	O
things	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
he	O
returned	O
,	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
he	O
found	O
her	O
giving	O
an	O
entertainment	O
to	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
people	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
he	O
supposed	O
,	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
less	O
than	O
a	O
thousand	O
.	O

The	O
messes	O
were	O
all	O
brought	O
to	O
her	O
by	O
the	O
servants	O
that	O
prepared	O
them	O
,	O
the	O
meat	O
being	O
put	O
into	O
the	O
shells	O
of	O
cocoa	O
nuts	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
shells	O
into	O
wooden	O
trays	O
,	O
somewhat	O
like	O
those	O
used	O
by	O
our	O
butchers	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
distributed	O
them	O
with	O
her	O
own	O
hands	O
to	O
the	O
guests	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
seated	O
in	O
rows	O
round	O
the	O
great	O
house	O
.	O

When	O
this	O
was	O
done	O
,	O
she	O
sat	O
down	O
herself	O
,	O
upon	O
a	O
place	O
somewhat	O
elevated	O
above	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
women	O
,	O
placing	O
themselves	O
one	O
on	O
each	O
side	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
fed	O
her	O
,	O
she	O
opening	O
her	O
mouth	O
as	O
they	O
brought	O
their	O
hands	O
up	O
with	O
the	O
food	O
.	O

When	O
she	O
saw	O
the	O
gunner	O
,	O
she	O
ordered	O
a	O
mess	O
for	O
him	O
;	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
certainly	O
tell	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
believed	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
fowl	O
picked	O
small	O
,	O
with	O
apples	O
cut	O
among	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
seasoned	O
with	O
salt	O
water	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
very	O
well	O
tasted	O
.	O

She	O
accepted	O
the	O
things	O
that	O
I	O
sent	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
much	O
pleased	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
correspondence	O
was	O
established	O
with	O
the	O
queen	O
,	O
provisions	O
of	O
every	O
kind	O
became	O
much	O
more	O
plenty	O
at	O
market	O
;	O
but	O
though	O
fowls	O
and	O
hogs	O
were	O
every	O
day	O
brought	O
in	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
still	O
obliged	O
to	O
pay	O
more	O
for	O
them	O
than	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
,	O
the	O
market	O
having	O
been	O
spoiled	O
by	O
the	O
nails	O
which	O
our	O
men	O
had	O
stolen	O
and	O
given	O
to	O
the	O
women	O
;	O
I	O
therefore	O
gave	O
orders	O
that	O
every	O
man	O
should	O
be	O
searched	O
before	O
he	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
no	O
woman	O
should	O
be	O
suffered	O
to	O
cross	O
the	O
river	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
14th	O
,	O
the	O
gunner	O
being	O
on	O
shore	O
to	O
trade	O
,	O
perceived	O
an	O
old	O
woman	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
weeping	O
bitterly	O
:	O
when	O
she	O
saw	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
drawn	O
his	O
attention	O
upon	O
her	O
,	O
she	O
sent	O
a	O
young	O
man	O
,	O
who	O
stood	O
by	O
her	O
,	O
over	O
the	O
river	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
branch	O
of	O
the	O
plantain	O
tree	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
.	O

When	O
he	O
came	O
up	O
,	O
he	O
made	O
a	O
long	O
speech	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
laid	O
down	O
his	O
bough	O
at	O
the	O
gunner	O
's	O
feet	O
:	O
after	O
this	O
he	O
went	O
back	O
and	O
brought	O
over	O
the	O
old	O
woman	O
,	O
another	O
man	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
bringing	O
over	O
two	O
large	O
fat	O
hogs	O
.	O

The	O
woman	O
looked	O
round	O
upon	O
our	O
people	O
with	O
great	O
attention	O
,	O
fixing	O
her	O
eyes	O
sometimes	O
upon	O
one	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
upon	O
another	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
burst	O
into	O
tears	O
.	O

The	O
young	O
man	O
who	O
brought	O
her	O
over	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
perceiving	O
the	O
gunner	O
's	O
concern	O
and	O
astonishment	O
,	O
made	O
another	O
speech	O
,	O
longer	O
than	O
the	O
first	O
:	O
still	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
the	O
woman	O
's	O
distress	O
was	O
a	O
mystery	O
,	O
but	O
at	O
length	O
she	O
made	O
him	O
understand	O
that	O
her	O
husband	O
,	O
and	O
three	O
of	O
her	O
sons	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
killed	O
in	O
the	O
attack	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

During	O
this	O
explanation	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
so	O
affected	O
that	O
at	O
last	O
she	O
sunk	O
down	O
unable	O
to	O
speak	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
two	O
young	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
support	O
her	O
,	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
nearly	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
condition	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
probably	O
two	O
more	O
of	O
her	O
sons	O
,	O
or	O
some	O
very	O
near	O
relations	O
.	O

The	O
gunner	O
did	O
all	O
in	O
his	O
power	O
to	O
sooth	O
and	O
comfort	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
she	O
had	O
in	O
some	O
measure	O
recovered	O
her	O
recollection	O
,	O
she	O
ordered	O
the	O
two	O
hogs	O
to	O
be	O
delivered	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
him	O
her	O
hand	O
in	O
token	O
of	O
friendship	O
,	O
but	O
would	O
accept	O
nothing	O
in	O
return	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
offered	O
her	O
ten	O
times	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
would	O
have	O
purchased	O
the	O
hogs	O
at	O
market	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
the	O
Second	O
Lieutenant	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
boats	O
,	O
and	O
sixty	O
men	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
,	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
try	O
what	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
got	O
.	O

About	O
noon	O
he	O
returned	O
,	O
having	O
marched	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
near	O
six	O
miles	O
.	O

He	O
found	O
the	O
country	O
very	O
pleasant	O
and	O
populous	O
,	O
and	O
abounding	O
as	O
well	O
with	O
hogs	O
and	O
fowls	O
,	O
as	O
fruit	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
vegetables	O
of	O
various	O
kinds	O
.	O

The	O
inhabitants	O
offered	O
him	O
no	O
molestation	O
,	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
seem	O
willing	O
to	O
part	O
with	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
provisions	O
which	O
our	O
people	O
were	O
most	O
desirous	O
to	O
purchase	O
:	O
they	O
gave	O
them	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
a	O
few	O
cocoa-nuts	O
and	O
plantains	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
length	O
sold	O
them	O
nine	O
hogs	O
and	O
a	O
few	O
fowls	O
.	O

The	O
Lieutenant	O
was	O
of	O
opinion	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
brought	O
to	O
trade	O
freely	O
by	O
degrees	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
so	O
great	O
,	O
that	O
too	O
many	O
men	O
would	O
be	O
necessary	O
,	O
for	O
a	O
guard	O
.	O

He	O
saw	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
very	O
large	O
canoes	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
that	O
were	O
building	O
.	O

He	O
observed	O
that	O
all	O
their	O
tools	O
were	O
made	O
of	O
stone	O
,	O
shells	O
,	O
and	O
bone	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
justly	O
inferred	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
metal	O
of	O
any	O
kind	O
.	O

He	O
found	O
no	O
quadrupeds	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
besides	O
hogs	O
and	O
dogs	O
,	O
nor	O
any	O
earthen	O
vessel	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
all	O
their	O
food	O
is	O
either	O
baked	O
or	O
roasted	O
.	O

Having	O
no	O
vessel	O
in	O
which	O
water	O
could	O
be	O
subjected	O
to	O
the	O
action	O
of	O
fire	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
more	O
idea	O
that	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
made	O
hot	O
,	O
than	O
that	O
it	O

As	O
the	O

one	O
morning	O

one	O
of	O
those	O
that	O

the	O
Surgeon	O

the	O

by	O
turning	O
the	O
cock	O
of	O
an	O

that	O
stood	O

the	O

having	O
remarked	O
this	O
with	O
great	O
curiosity	O

attention	O
,	O
he	O
presently	O
turned	O
the	O
cock	O
,	O
and	O
received	O
the	O
water	O
upon	O
his	O
hand	O
:	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
felt	O
himself	O
scalded	O
,	O
he	O
roared	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
dance	O
about	O
the	O
cabbin	O
with	O
the	O
most	O
extravagant	O
and	O
ridiculous	O
expressions	O
of	O
pain	O

astonishment	O

the	O

not	O
being	O

to	O

what	O
was	O
the	O
matter	O
with	O
him	O

at	O
him	O
in	O

not	O

The	O

however	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
innocently	O
been	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
the	O

On	O
Thursday	O
the	O
I6th	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Furneaux	O
,	O
my	O
Second	O
Lieutenant	O
,	O
was	O
taken	O
very	O
ill	O
,	O
which	O
distressed	O
me	O
greatly	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
First	O
Lieutenant	O
was	O
not	O
yet	O
recovered	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
still	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
weak	O
state	O
myself	O
:	O
I	O
was	O
this	O
day	O
also	O
obliged	O
once	O
more	O
to	O
punish	O
Proctor	O
,	O
the	O
corporal	O
of	O
marines	O
,	O
for	O
mutinous	O
behaviour	O

The	O
queen	O
had	O
now	O
been	O
absent	O
several	O
days	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
natives	O
made	O
us	O
understand	O
,	O
by	O
signs	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
she	O
would	O
be	O
with	O
us	O
again	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
she	O
came	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
after	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
people	O
,	O
whom	O
we	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
before	O
,	O
brought	O
to	O
market	O
provisions	O
of	O
every	O

;	O
and	O
the	O
gunner	O
sent	O
off	O
fourteen	O
hogs	O

fruit	O
in	O
great	O
plenty	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
of	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
the	O
queen	O
came	O
on	O
board	O

with	O
a	O
present	O
of	O
two	O
large	O
hogs	O

for	O
she	O
never	O

to	O

,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
she	O
returned	O
on	O
shore	O

I	O
sent	O
a	O
present	O
with	O
her	O

by	O
the	O
Master	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
landed	O

she	O
took	O
him	O
by	O
the	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
made	O
a	O
long	O
speech	O
to	O
the	O

that	O
flocked	O
round	O
them	O

she	O
led	O
him	O
to	O
her	O

The	O
next	O

off	O
a	O

On	O
the	O
20th	O

we	O
continued	O
to	O
trade	O
with	O
good	O
success	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
it	O
was	O
discovered	O
that	O
Francis	O
Pinckney	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
seamen	O
,	O
had	O
drawn	O
the	O
cleats	O
to	O
which	O
the	O
main	O
sheet	O
was	O
belayed	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
after	O
stealing	O
the	O
spikes	O
,	O
thrown	O
them	O
over	O
board	O

Having	O
secured	O
the	O
offender	O
,	O
I	O
called	O
all	O
the	O
people	O
together	O
upon	O
the	O
deck	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
taking	O
some	O
pains	O
to	O
explain	O
his	O
crime	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
its	O
aggravations	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
whipped	O
with	O
nettles	O
while	O
he	O
ran	O
the	O
gauntlet	O
thrice	O
round	O
the	O
deck	O
:	O
my	O
rhetoric	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
had	O
very	O
little	O
effect	O
,	O
for	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
crew	O
being	O
equally	O
criminal	O
with	O
himself	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
handled	O
so	O
tenderly	O
,	O
that	O
others	O
were	O
rather	O
encouraged	O
to	O
repeat	O
the	O
offence	O
by	O
the	O
hope	O
of	O
impunity	O
,	O
than	O
deterred	O
by	O
the	O
fear	O
of	O
punishment	O
.	O

To	O
preserve	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
from	O
being	O
pulled	O
to	O
pieces	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
price	O

from	O
being	O
raised	O
so	O
high	O
as	O
soon	O
to	O
exhaust	O
our	O
articles	O
of	O
trade	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
that	O
no	O
man	O
,	O
except	O
the	O
wooders	O
and	O
waterers	O
,	O
with	O
their	O
guard	O
,	O
should	O
be	O
permitted	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O

On	O
the	O
21st	O
,	O
the	O
queen	O
came	O
again	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
several	O
large	O
hogs	O
as	O
a	O
present	O
,	O
for	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
usual	O
,	O
she	O
would	O
accept	O
of	O
no	O

.	O

When	O
she	O
was	O
about	O
to	O
leave	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
she	O
expressed	O
a	O
desire	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
with	O
her	O
,	O
to	O
which	O
I	O
consented	O
,	O
taking	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
officers	O
with	O
me	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
arrived	O
at	O
her	O

she	O
made	O
us	O
all	O
sit	O
down	O

and	O
taking	O
off	O
my	O
hat	O
,	O
she	O
tied	O
to	O
it	O
a	O
bunch	O
or	O
tuft	O
of	O

of	O
various	O
colours	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
no	O
person	O
on	O

wear	O
but	O
herself	O
,	O
which	O
produced	O
by	O
no	O

a	O
disagreeable	O
effect	O

She	O
also	O
tied	O
round	O
my	O

and	O
the	O
hats	O

those	O
who	O
were	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
wreaths	O
of	O
braided	O

plaited	O

and	O
gave	O
us	O
to	O
understand	O
that	O
both	O
the	O
hair	O
and	O
workmanship	O
were	O
her	O
own	O
:	O
she	O
also	O
presented	O
us	O
with	O
some	O
matts	O
,	O
that	O
were	O
very	O
curiously	O
wrought	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
she	O
accompanied	O
us	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
getting	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
she	O
put	O
on	O

a	O
fine	O

sow	O
,	O
big	O
with	O
young	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
quantity	O
of	O

As	O
we	O
were	O
parting	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
quit	O
the	O
island	O
in	O
seven	O
days	O
:	O
she	O
immediately	O
comprehended	O
my	O
meaning	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
stay	O
twenty	O

that	O
I	O
should	O
go	O

a	O

,	O
and	O
after	O
that	O

the	O

I	O
again	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
I	O
must	O
go	O
in	O
seven	O
days	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
she	O
burst	O
into	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
without	O
great	O
difficulty	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
pacified	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
the	O

sent	O
off	O
no	O

twenty	O
hogs	O

we	O
found	O

to	O
our	O

mortification	O

that	O
neither	O

,	O
be	O
brought	O
to	O
eat	O
any	O

fruit	O

which	O
made	O
it	O
necessary	O
to	O

them	O
faster	O

On	O

When	O

I	O

neither	O

came	O
down	O

put	O
the	O

``	O
As	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
got	O
on	O
shore	O

I	O
called	O
upon	O
our	O

man	O

took	O
him	O
with	O
us	O

we	O
then	O
followed	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
in	O
two	O
parties	O
,	O
one	O
marching	O
on	O
each	O
side	O

For	O
the	O
first	O
two	O
miles	O
it	O
flowed	O
through	O
a	O
valley	O
of	O
considerable	O
width	O

in	O
which	O
were	O
many	O
habitations	O

with	O

of	O

the	O

be	O
a	O
rich	O
fat	O
earth	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
of	O
a	O
blackish	O
colour	O

After	O
this	O
the	O
valley	O
became	O
very	O
narrow	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
ground	O
rising	O
abruptly	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O

we	O
were	O
all	O

to	O
march	O

Where	O
the	O
stream	O
was	O
precipitated	O
from	O

had	O
been	O

into	O

plantations	O
of	O

in	O
these	O

we	O

an	O

which	O
had	O

down	O

the	O
water-side	O

which	O
we	O

I	O
tasted	O
it	O

and	O
found	O
it	O
pleasant	O

its	O
flavour	O
somewhat	O
resembling	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
West	O
Indian	O
spinnage	O

called	O
Calleloor	PNM

its	O

was	O
fenced	O
off	O

to	O
make	O
a	O
very	O
pretty	O
appearance	O
;	O
the	O
bread-fruit	O

were	O

at	O
the	O

there	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
grass	O

no	O

As	O
we	O
advanced	O
,	O
the	O
windings	O
of	O
the	O
stream	O
became	O
innumerable	O
,	O
the	O

Travelling	O
now	O

about	O
four	O

the	O
road	O
for	O
the	O

having	O

down	O

rest	O
ourselves	O

take	O
the	O
refreshment	O

in	O
a	O

but	O
just	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
about	O

our	O

we	O
were	O
suddenly	O

of	O
many	O
voices	O

and	O
a	O
great	O
shouting	O

presently	O
afterwards	O
saw	O
a	O
multitude	O
of	O
men	O

children	O
upon	O
the	O
hill	O
above	O
us	O

our	O

man	O
seeing	O
us	O
rise	O
hastily	O

and	O
look	O
to	O
our	O
arms	O
,	O
beckoned	O
to	O
us	O
to	O
sit	O
still	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
went	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
that	O
had	O
surprised	O
us	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
joined	O
them	O
they	O
were	O
silent	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
after	O
disappeared	O
;	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
they	O
returned	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
with	O
them	O
a	O
large	O
hog	O
ready	O
roasted	O
,	O
with	O
plenty	O
of	O
bread-fruit	O
,	O
yams	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
refreshments	O

which	O
they	O
gave	O
to	O
the	O

man	O

distributed	O
them	O
among	O
our	O
people	O

In	O
return	O
for	O
this	O

I	O
gave	O

some	O

other	O

with	O
which	O
they	O
were	O

After	O
this	O
we	O
proceeded	O
up	O
the	O
valley	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
searching	O
all	O
the	O

all	O
the	O

where	O

had	O
run	O

for	O
appearances	O

metal	O

could	O
find	O
none	O

except	O
what	O
I	O
have	O
brought	O
back	O

I	O
shewed	O
all	O

the	O
piece	O

up	O

none	O

could	O
I	O
learn	O
from	O
them	O
any	O
thing	O
about	O
it	O

The	O
old	O
man	O
began	O
now	O
to	O
be	O
weary	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
being	O
a	O
mountain	O
before	O
us	O
,	O
he	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
go	O
home	O
:	O
before	O
he	O
left	O
us	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
he	O
made	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
had	O
so	O
liberally	O
supplied	O
us	O
with	O
provisions	O
,	O
take	O
the	O
baggage	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
fruit	O
that	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
eaten	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
cocoa	O
nut-shells	O
full	O
of	O
fresh	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
follow	O
us	O
up	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
mountain	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
gone	O
,	O
they	O
gathered	O
green	O
branches	O
from	O
the	O
neighbouring	O
trees	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
many	O
ceremonies	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
the	O
meaning	O
,	O
laid	O
them	O
down	O
before	O
us	O
:	O
after	O
this	O
they	O
took	O
some	O
small	O
berries	O
with	O
which	O
they	O
painted	O
themselves	O
red	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
bark	O
of	O
a	O
tree	O
that	O
contained	O
a	O
yellow	O
juice	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
they	O
stained	O
their	O
garments	O
in	O
different	O
parts	O
.	O

We	O
began	O
to	O
climb	O
the	O
mountain	O
while	O
our	O
old	O
man	O
was	O
still	O
in	O
sight	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
,	O
perceiving	O
that	O
we	O
made	O
our	O
way	O
with	O
difficulty	O
through	O
the	O
weeds	O
and	O
brush-wood	O
,	O
which	O
grew	O
very	O
thick	O
,	O
turned	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
something	O
to	O
the	O
natives	O
in	O
a	O
firm	O
loud	O
tone	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
twenty	O
or	O
thirty	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
went	O
before	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
cleared	O
us	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
path	O
;	O
they	O
also	O
refreshed	O
us	O
with	O
water	O
and	O
fruit	O
as	O
we	O
went	O
along	O
,	O
and	O
assisted	O
us	O
to	O
climb	O
the	O
most	O
difficult	O
places	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
should	O
otherwise	O
have	O
found	O
altogether	O
impracticable	O
.	O

We	O
began	O
to	O
ascend	O
this	O
hill	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
about	O
six	O
miles	O
from	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
landed	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
reckoned	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
near	O
a	O
mile	O
above	O
the	O
river	O
that	O
runs	O
through	O
the	O
valley	O
below	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
arrived	O
at	O
the	O
summit	O
,	O
we	O
again	O
sat	O
down	O
to	O
rest	O
and	O
refresh	O
ourselves	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
were	O
climbing	O
we	O
flattered	O
ourselves	O
that	O
from	O
the	O
top	O
we	O
should	O
command	O
the	O
whole	O
island	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
now	O
saw	O
mountains	O
before	O
us	O
so	O
much	O
higher	O
than	O
our	O
situation	O
,	O
that	O
with	O
respect	O
to	O
them	O
we	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
valley	O
;	O
towards	O
the	O
ship	O
indeed	O
the	O
view	O
was	O
enchanting	O
:	O
the	O
sides	O
of	O
the	O
hills	O
were	O
beautifully	O
clothed	O
with	O
wood	O
,	O
villages	O
were	O
every	O
where	O
interspersed	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
vallies	O
between	O
them	O
afforded	O
a	O
still	O
richer	O
prospect	O
;	O
the	O
houses	O
stood	O
thicker	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
verdure	O
was	O
more	O
luxuriant	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
very	O
few	O
habitations	O
above	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
discovered	O
smoke	O
in	O
many	O
places	O
ascending	O
from	O
between	O
the	O
highest	O
hills	O
that	O
were	O
in	O
sight	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
I	O
conjecture	O
that	O
the	O
most	O
elevated	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
are	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
without	O
inhabitants	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
ascended	O
the	O
mountain	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
many	O
springs	O
gush	O
from	O
fissures	O
on	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
we	O
had	O
reached	O
the	O
summit	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
many	O
houses	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
discover	O
as	O
we	O
passed	O
them	O
.	O

No	O
part	O
of	O
these	O
mountains	O
is	O
naked	O
;	O
the	O
summits	O
of	O
the	O
highest	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
were	O
crowned	O
with	O
wood	O
,	O
but	O
of	O
what	O
kind	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
:	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
height	O
with	O
that	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
climbed	O
,	O
were	O
woody	O
on	O
the	O
sides	O
,	O
but	O
on	O
the	O
summit	O
were	O
rocky	O
and	O
covered	O
with	O
fern	O
.	O

Upon	O
the	O
flats	O
that	O
appeared	O
below	O
these	O
,	O
there	O
grew	O
a	O
sedgy	O
kind	O
of	O
grass	O
and	O
weeds	O
:	O
in	O
general	O
the	O
soil	O
here	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
in	O
the	O
valley	O
,	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
rich	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
several	O
bushes	O
of	O
sugar-cane	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
very	O
large	O
and	O
very	O
good	O
,	O
growing	O
wild	O
,	O
without	O
the	O
least	O
culture	O
.	O

I	O
likewise	O
found	O
ginger	O
and	O
turmerick	O
,	O
and	O
have	O
brought	O
samples	O
of	O
both	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
not	O
procure	O
seeds	O
of	O
any	O
tree	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
being	O
in	O
blossom	O
.	O

After	O
traversing	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
this	O
mountain	O
to	O
a	O
good	O
distance	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
tree	O
exactly	O
like	O
a	O
fern	O
,	O
except	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
14	O
or	O
15	O
feet	O
high	O
.	O

This	O
tree	O
I	O
cut	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
the	O
inside	O
of	O
it	O
also	O
like	O
a	O
fern	O
:	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
brought	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
it	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
but	O
found	O
it	O
too	O
cumbersome	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
difficulties	O
we	O
might	O
meet	O
with	O
before	O
we	O
got	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
judged	O
to	O
be	O
now	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
.	O

After	O
having	O
again	O
recruited	O
our	O
strength	O
by	O
refreshment	O
and	O
rest	O
,	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
descend	O
the	O
mountain	O
,	O
being	O
still	O
attended	O
by	O
the	O
people	O
to	O
whose	O
care	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
recommended	O
by	O
our	O
old	O
man	O
.	O

We	O
kept	O
our	O
general	O
direction	O
towards	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
but	O
sometimes	O
deviated	O
a	O
little	O
to	O
the	O
right	O
and	O
left	O
in	O
the	O
plains	O
and	O
vallies	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
saw	O
any	O
houses	O
that	O
were	O
pleasantly	O
situated	O
,	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
being	O
every	O
where	O
ready	O
to	O
accommodate	O
us	O
with	O
whatever	O
they	O
had	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
no	O
beast	O
,	O
except	O
a	O
few	O
hogs	O
,	O
nor	O
any	O
birds	O
,	O
except	O
parrots	O

and	O
green	O
doves	O
;	O
by	O
the	O
river	O

there	O
was	O
plenty	O
of	O
ducks	O

and	O
every	O
place	O
that	O
was	O
planted	O
and	O
cultivated	O
,	O
appeared	O
to	O
flourish	O
with	O
great	O
luxuriance	O

though	O
in	O
the	O

with	O
a	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
we	O
arrived	O
at	O
a	O
very	O
pleasant	O
spot	O
,	O
within	O
about	O
three	O
miles	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O

where	O
we	O
procured	O
two	O
hogs	O

some	O
fowls	O

which	O
the	O
natives	O
dressed	O
for	O
us	O
very	O
well	O

and	O
with	O
great	O
expedition	O

Here	O
we	O
continued	O
till	O
the	O
cool	O
of	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
made	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
our	O
way	O
for	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
having	O
liberally	O
rewarded	O
our	O

the	O
people	O
who	O
had	O
provided	O
us	O
so	O
good	O
a	O
dinner	O

Our	O

behaved	O
through	O
the	O
whole	O
day	O
with	O
the	O
greatest	O
decency	O
and	O
order	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
parted	O
with	O
our	O

in	O
perfect	O

About	O
10	O
o'clock	O
,	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
the	O
queen	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
according	O
to	O
her	O
promise	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
present	O
of	O
hogs	O
and	O
fowls	O
,	O
but	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
again	O
soon	O
afterwards	O
.	O

This	O
day	O
,	O
the	O
Gunner	O
sent	O
off	O
near	O
thirty	O
hogs	O
,	O
with	O
great	O
plenty	O
of	O
fowls	O
and	O
fruit	O

We	O
completed	O
our	O
wood	O
and	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
all	O
ready	O
for	O
sea	O

More	O
inhabitants	O
came	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
inland	O
country	O
,	O
than	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
appeared	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
respect	O
that	O
was	O
paid	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
of	O
a	O
superior	O
rank	O

About	O
three	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
the	O
queen	O
came	O
again	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
very	O
well	O
dressed	O
,	O
and	O
followed	O
by	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
people	O

Having	O
crossed	O
the	O
river	O
with	O
her	O
attendants	O
and	O
our	O
old	O
man	O
,	O
she	O
came	O
once	O
more	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

She	O
brought	O
with	O
her	O
some	O
very	O
fine	O
fruit	O
,	O
and	O
renewed	O
her	O
solicitation	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
stay	O
ten	O
days	O
longer	O
,	O
with	O
great	O
earnestness	O
,	O
intimating	O
that	O
she	O
would	O
go	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
bring	O
me	O
plenty	O
of	O
hogs	O
,	O
fowls	O
,	O
and	O
fruit	O
.	O

I	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
express	O
a	O
proper	O
sense	O
of	O
her	O
kindness	O
and	O
bounty	O
,	O
but	O
assured	O
her	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
certainly	O
sail	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
.	O

This	O
,	O
as	O
usual	O
,	O
threw	O
her	O
into	O
tears	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
she	O
recovered	O
,	O
she	O
enquired	O
by	O
signs	O
when	O
I	O
should	O
return	O
:	O
I	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
express	O
fifty	O
days	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
made	O
signs	O
for	O
thirty	O
:	O
but	O
the	O
sign	O
for	O
fifty	O
being	O
constantly	O
repeated	O
,	O
she	O
seemed	O
satisfied	O
.	O

She	O
stayed	O
on	O
board	O
till	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
then	O
with	O
the	O
greatest	O
difficulty	O
that	O
she	O
could	O
be	O
prevailed	O
upon	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

When	O
she	O
was	O
told	O
that	O
the	O
boat	O
was	O
ready	O
,	O
she	O
threw	O
herself	O
down	O
upon	O
the	O
arm-chest	O
,	O
and	O
wept	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
with	O
an	O
excess	O
of	O
passion	O
that	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
pacified	O
;	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
though	O
with	O
the	O
greatest	O
reluctance	O
,	O
she	O
went	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
followed	O
by	O
her	O
attendants	O
and	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
.	O

The	O
old	O
man	O
had	O
often	O
intimated	O
that	O
his	O
son	O
,	O
a	O
lad	O
about	O
fourteen	O
years	O
of	O
age	O
,	O
should	O
go	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
boy	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
willing	O
:	O
he	O
had	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
now	O
disappeared	O
for	O
two	O
days	O
;	O
I	O
enquired	O
after	O
him	O
when	O
I	O
first	O
missed	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
gave	O
me	O
to	O
understand	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
gone	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
to	O
see	O
his	O
friends	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
return	O
time	O
enough	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
have	O
reason	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
time	O
drew	O
near	O
,	O
the	O
father	O
's	O
courage	O
failed	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
to	O
keep	O
his	O
child	O
he	O
secreted	O
him	O
till	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
gone	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
never	O
saw	O
him	O
afterwards	O
.	O

At	O
break	O
of	O
day	O
,	O
on	O
Monday	O
the	O
27th	O
,	O
we	O
unmoored	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
I	O
sent	O
the	O
barge	O
and	O
cutter	O
to	O
fill	O
the	O
few	O
water-casks	O
that	O
were	O
now	O
empty	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
came	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
they	O
saw	O
,	O
to	O
their	O
great	O
surprise	O
,	O
the	O
whole	O
beach	O
covered	O
with	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
some	O
doubt	O
whether	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
prudent	O
to	O
venture	O
themselves	O
among	O
such	O
a	O
multitude	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
about	O
to	O
pull	O
back	O
again	O
for	O
the	O
ship	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
this	O
was	O
perceived	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
the	O
queen	O
came	O
forward	O
,	O
and	O
beckoned	O
them	O
;	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
guessing	O
the	O
reason	O
of	O
what	O
had	O
happened	O
,	O
she	O
made	O
the	O
natives	O
retire	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
:	O
the	O
boats	O
then	O
proceeded	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
filled	O
the	O
casks	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
she	O
put	O
some	O
hogs	O
and	O
fruit	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
putting	O
off	O
would	O
fain	O
have	O
returned	O
with	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

The	O
officer	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
received	O
orders	O
to	O
bring	O
off	O
none	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
would	O
not	O
permit	O
her	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
she	O
presently	O
launched	O
a	O
double	O
canoe	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
rowed	O
off	O
by	O
her	O
own	O
people	O
.	O

Her	O
canoe	O
was	O
immediately	O
followed	O
by	O
fifteen	O
or	O
sixteen	O
more	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
came	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O

The	O
queen	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
speak	O
,	O
she	O
sat	O
down	O
and	O
gave	O
vent	O
to	O
her	O
passion	O
by	O
weeping	O
.	O

After	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
on	O
board	O
about	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
a	O
breeze	O
springing	O
up	O
,	O
we	O
weighed	O
anchor	O
and	O
made	O
sail	O
.	O

Finding	O
it	O
now	O
necessary	O
to	O
return	O
into	O
her	O
canoe	O
,	O
she	O
embraced	O
us	O
all	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
affectionate	O
manner	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
many	O
tears	O
;	O
all	O
her	O
attendants	O
also	O
expressed	O
great	O
sorrow	O
at	O
our	O
departure	O
.	O

Soon	O
after	O
it	O
fell	O
calm	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
sent	O
the	O
boats	O
a-head	O
to	O
tow	O

upon	O
which	O
all	O
the	O
canoes	O
returned	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O

and	O
that	O
which	O
had	O
the	O
queen	O
on	O

came	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
gun-room	O

where	O
her	O
people	O
made	O
it	O
fast	O

In	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
she	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
bow	O
of	O
her	O
canoe	O
,	O
where	O
she	O
sat	O
weeping	O
with	O
inconsolable	O
sorrow	O
.	O

I	O
gave	O
her	O
many	O
things	O
which	O
I	O
thought	O
would	O
be	O
of	O
great	O
use	O
to	O
her	O

and	O
some	O
for	O
ornament	O
;	O
she	O
silently	O
accepted	O
of	O
all	O
,	O
but	O
took	O
little	O
notice	O
of	O
any	O
thing	O

About	O
10	O

our	O

the	O

This	O
commerce	O
was	O
carried	O
on	O
a	O
considerable	O
time	O
before	O
the	O
officers	O
discovered	O
it	O

for	O

When	O
I	O
was	O
acquainted	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
no	O
longer	O
wondered	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
in	O
danger	O
of	O
being	O
pulled	O
to	O
pieces	O
for	O
the	O
nails	O

iron	O
that	O
held	O
her	O
together	O

which	O
I	O
had	O
before	O
puzzled	O
myself	O
to	O
account	O
for	O
in	O

the	O
whole	O
ship	O

daily	O

Both	O
men	O
and	O
women	O
are	O
not	O
only	O
decently	O
but	O
gracefully	O
clothed	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
white	O
cloth	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
made	O
of	O
the	O
bark	O
of	O
a	O
shrub	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
much	O
resembles	O
coarse	O
China	PNM
paper	O

Their	O
dress	O
consists	O
of	O
two	O
pieces	O
of	O
this	O
cloth	O
:	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
a	O
hole	O

down	O
from	O
the	O
shoulders	O
to	O
the	O
mid-leg	O
before	O
and	O
behind	O

another	O
piece	O

which	O
is	O
between	O
four	O

five	O
yards	O

and	O
about	O
one	O

they	O
wrap	O
round	O
the	O

in	O
a	O
very	O
easy	O

This	O
cloth	O
is	O
not	O
woven	O

but	O
is	O
made	O
,	O
like	O
paper	O

of	O
the	O

an	O

the	O

are	O
worn	O

by	O
the	O
women	O

from	O
whom	O
I	O
purchased	O
about	O
two	O

they	O
were	O
of	O

Mr.	O

saw	O
several	O
in	O
his	O

he	O
could	O
purchase	O
none	O
with	O
any	O

he	O
had	O
to	O
offer	O
.	O

I	O
observed	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
here	O
a	O
universal	O
custom	O
both	O
for	O
men	O
and	O
women	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
hinder	O
part	O
of	O
their	O
thighs	O
and	O
loins	O
marked	O
very	O
thick	O
with	O
black	O
lines	O
in	O
various	O
forms	O
.	O

These	O
marks	O
were	O
made	O
by	O
striking	O
the	O
teeth	O
of	O
an	O
instrument	O
,	O
somewhat	O
like	O
a	O
comb	O
,	O
just	O
through	O
the	O
skin	O
,	O
and	O
rubbing	O
into	O
the	O
punctures	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
paste	O
made	O
of	O
soot	O

oil	O

The	O

girls	O
under	O
twelve	O
years	O
of	O
age	O
,	O
are	O
not	O
marked	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
observed	O
a	O
few	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
whose	O
legs	O
were	O
marked	O
in	O
chequers	O
by	O
the	O

and	O
they	O
appeared	O
to	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
principal	O

upon	O

appeared	O
much	O
more	O
disposed	O

our	O

the	O

and	O
our	O
people	O

with	O
whom	O
he	O

became	O
a	O

him	O

Jonathan	PNM

This	O

Mr.	O

Our	O

were	O
always	O
carried	O
on	O

some	O
of	O

carry	O
him	O
on	O

in	O
the	O

He	O
very	O
soon	O
attempted	O
to	O
use	O
a	O
knife	O
and	O
fork	O
at	O
his	O
meals	O
,	O
but	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
had	O
stuck	O
a	O
morsel	O
upon	O
his	O
fork	O
,	O
and	O
tried	O
to	O
feed	O
himself	O
with	O
that	O
instrument	O

he	O
could	O
not	O
guide	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
by	O
the	O
mere	O
force	O
of	O
habit	O
his	O
hand	O
came	O
to	O
his	O
mouth	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
victuals	O
at	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

went	O

a	O

which	O

gives	O
an	O

to	O
roasted	O
bread-fruit	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
frequently	O

They	O
have	O
abundance	O
of	O
rats	O

,	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
discover	O

these	O
make	O
no	O

of	O
their	O

The	O
river	O

them	O
good	O
mullet	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
are	O
neither	O
large	O
nor	O
in	O

.	O

They	O
find	O
conchs	O
,	O
muscles	O

and	O
other	O
shell-fish	O
on	O
the	O
reef	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
gather	O
at	O
low	O

and	O
eat	O
raw	O
with	O
bread-fruit	O
before	O
they	O
come	O
on	O

They	O
have	O
also	O
very	O
fine	O
cray-fish	O

they	O
catch	O
with	O

at	O
a	O

parrot-fish	O

and	O
many	O

of	O
which	O
they	O
are	O
so	O
fond	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
seldom	O
prevail	O
upon	O
them	O
to	O
sell	O
us	O
a	O

They	O

also	O
nets	O
of	O
an	O
enormous	O

with	O
very	O
small	O

with	O
these	O
they	O

abundance	O
of	O
small	O
fish	O
about	O
the	O

while	O
they	O
were	O
using	O
both	O
nets	O

great	O
success	O

we	O
could	O
not	O

a	O

with	O
either	O

We	O
procured	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
hooks	O

but	O
for	O

of	O
their	O

The	O
manner	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
dress	O
their	O
food	O
is	O
this	O

they	O
kindle	O
a	O

in	O
the	O

our	O

two	O

called	O
over	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
countrymen	O
that	O
was	O
standing	O
on	O
the	O
opposite	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
who	O
having	O
looked	O
at	O
the	O
seaman	O
's	O
foot	O
,	O
went	O
immediately	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
and	O
taking	O
up	O
a	O
shell	O
,	O
broke	O
it	O
to	O
a	O
point	O
with	O
his	O
teeth	O
;	O
with	O
this	O
instrument	O
,	O
in	O
little	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
minute	O
,	O
he	O
laid	O
open	O
the	O
place	O

and	O
extracted	O
the	O

;	O
in	O
the	O

the	O
old	O
man	O

who	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
called	O
the	O
other	O
over	O
,	O
went	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
into	O
the	O
wood	O
,	O
returned	O
with	O
some	O
gum	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
applied	O
to	O
the	O
wound	O
upon	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
the	O
cloth	O
that	O
was	O
wrapped	O
round	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
two	O
days	O
time	O
it	O
was	O
perfectly	O
healed	O
.	O

We	O
afterwards	O
learned	O
that	O
this	O
gum	O
was	O
produced	O
by	O
the	O
apple	O
tree	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
Surgeon	O
procured	O
some	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
used	O
it	O
as	O
a	O
vulnerary	O
balsam	O
with	O
great	O
success	O
.	O

The	O
habitations	O
of	O
these	O
happy	O
people	O
I	O
have	O
described	O
already	O
;	O
and	O
besides	O
these	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
several	O
sheds	O
inclosed	O
within	O
a	O
wall	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
outside	O
of	O
which	O
there	O
were	O
several	O
uncouth	O
figures	O
of	O
men	O
,	O
women	O
,	O
hogs	O
,	O
and	O
dogs	O
,	O
carved	O
on	O
posts	O
,	O
that	O
were	O
driven	O
into	O
the	O
ground	O
.	O

Several	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
were	O
from	O
time	O
to	O
time	O
seen	O
to	O
enter	O
these	O
places	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
slow	O
pace	O
and	O
dejected	O
countenance	O
,	O
from	O
which	O
we	O
conjectured	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
repositories	O
of	O
the	O
dead	O
.	O

The	O
area	O
within	O
the	O
walls	O
of	O
these	O
places	O
,	O
was	O
generally	O
well	O
paved	O
with	O
large	O
round	O
stones	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
appeared	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
much	O
trodden	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
grass	O
every	O
where	O
grew	O
up	O
between	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
endeavoured	O
,	O
with	O
particular	O
attention	O
,	O
to	O
discover	O
whether	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
religious	O
worship	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
never	O
could	O
find	O
the	O
least	O
traces	O
of	O
any	O
.	O

The	O
boats	O
or	O
canoes	O
of	O
these	O
people	O
,	O
are	O
of	O
three	O
different	O
sorts	O
.	O

Some	O
are	O
made	O
out	O
of	O
a	O
single	O
tree	O
,	O
and	O
carry	O
from	O
two	O
to	O
six	O
men	O
:	O
these	O
are	O
used	O
chiefly	O
for	O
fishing	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
constantly	O
saw	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
busy	O
upon	O
the	O
reef	O
:	O
some	O
were	O
constructed	O
of	O
planks	O
,	O
very	O
dexterously	O
sewed	O
together	O
:	O
these	O
were	O
of	O
different	O
sizes	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
carry	O
from	O
ten	O
to	O
forty	O
men	O
.	O

Two	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
generally	O
lashed	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
masts	O
set	O
up	O
between	O
them	O
;	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
single	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
an	O
out-rigger	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
only	O
one	O
mast	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
.	O

With	O
these	O
vessels	O
they	O
sail	O
far	O
beyond	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
land	O
,	O
probably	O
to	O
other	O
islands	O
,	O
and	O
bring	O
home	O
plantains	O
,	O
bananas	O
,	O
and	O
yams	O
,	O
which	O
seem	O
also	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
plenty	O
upon	O
other	O
parts	O
of	O
this	O
island	O
,	O
than	O
that	O
off	O
which	O
the	O
ship	O
lay	O
.	O

A	O
third	O
sort	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
intended	O
principally	O
for	O
pleasure	O
and	O
show	O
:	O
they	O
are	O
very	O
large	O
,	O
but	O
have	O
no	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
shape	O
resemble	O
the	O
gondolas	O
of	O
Venice	PNM
:	O
the	O
middle	O
is	O
covered	O
with	O
a	O
large	O
awning	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
sit	O
upon	O
it	O
,	O
some	O
under	O
it	O
.	O

None	O
of	O
these	O
vessels	O
came	O
near	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
except	O
on	O
the	O
first	O
and	O
second	O
day	O
after	O
our	O
arrival	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
saw	O
,	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
times	O
a	O
week	O
,	O
a	O
procession	O
of	O
eight	O
or	O
ten	O
of	O
them	O
passing	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
with	O
streamers	O
flying	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
small	O
canoes	O
attending	O
them	O
,	O
while	O
many	O
hundreds	O
of	O
people	O
ran	O
abreast	O
of	O
them	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

They	O
generally	O
rowed	O
to	O
the	O
outward	O
point	O
of	O
a	O
reef	O
which	O
lay	O
about	O
four	O
miles	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
stayed	O
about	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
returned	O
.	O

These	O
processions	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
are	O
never	O
made	O
but	O
in	O
fine	O
weather	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
board	O
are	O
dressed	O
;	O
though	O
in	O
the	O
other	O
canoes	O
they	O
have	O
only	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
cloth	O
wrapped	O
round	O
their	O
middle	O
.	O

Those	O
who	O
rowed	O
and	O
steered	O
were	O
dressed	O
in	O
white	O
;	O
those	O
who	O
sat	O
upon	O
the	O
awning	O
and	O
under	O
it	O
in	O
white	O
and	O
red	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
men	O
who	O
were	O
mounted	O
on	O
the	O
prow	O
of	O
each	O
vessel	O
,	O
were	O
dressed	O
in	O
red	O
only	O
.	O

We	O
sometimes	O
went	O
out	O
to	O
observe	O
them	O
in	O
our	O
boats	O
,	O
and	O
though	O
we	O
were	O
never	O
nearer	O
than	O
a	O
mile	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
them	O
with	O
our	O
glasses	O
as	O
distinctly	O
as	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
upon	O
the	O
spot	O
.	O

The	O
plank	O
of	O
which	O
these	O
vessels	O
are	O
constructed	O
,	O
is	O
made	O
by	O
splitting	O
a	O
tree	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
grain	O
,	O
into	O
as	O
many	O
thin	O
pieces	O
as	O
they	O
can	O
.	O

They	O
first	O
fell	O
the	O
tree	O
with	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
hatchet	O
,	O
or	O
adze	O
,	O
made	O
of	O
a	O
tough	O
greenish	O
kind	O
of	O
stone	O
,	O
very	O
dexterously	O
fitted	O
into	O
a	O
handle	O
;	O
it	O
is	O
then	O
cut	O
into	O
such	O
lengths	O
as	O
are	O
required	O
for	O
the	O
plank	O
,	O
one	O
end	O
of	O
which	O
is	O
heated	O
till	O
it	O
begins	O
to	O
crack	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
with	O
wedges	O
of	O
hard	O
wood	O
they	O
split	O
it	O
down	O
:	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
planks	O
are	O
two	O
feet	O
broad	O
,	O
and	O
from	O
15	O
to	O
20	O
feet	O
long	O
.	O

The	O
sides	O
are	O
smoothed	O
with	O
adzes	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
materials	O
and	O
construction	O
,	O
but	O
of	O
a	O
smaller	O
size	O
.	O

Six	O
or	O
eight	O
men	O
are	O
sometimes	O
at	O
work	O
upon	O
the	O
same	O
plank	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
their	O
tools	O
presently	O
lose	O
their	O
edge	O
,	O
every	O
man	O
has	O
by	O
him	O
a	O
cocoa	O
nut-shell	O
filled	O
with	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
flat	O
stone	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
he	O
sharpens	O
his	O
adze	O
almost	O
every	O
minute	O
.	O

These	O
planks	O
are	O
generally	O
brought	O
to	O
the	O
thickness	O
of	O
about	O
an	O
inch	O
,	O
and	O
are	O
afterwards	O
fitted	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
exactness	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
expected	O
from	O
an	O
expert	O
joiner	O
.	O

To	O
fasten	O
these	O
planks	O
together	O
,	O
holes	O
are	O
bored	O
with	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
bone	O
that	O
is	O
fixed	O
into	O
a	O
stick	O
for	O
that	O
purpose	O
,	O
a	O
use	O
to	O
which	O
our	O
nails	O
were	O
afterwards	O
applied	O
with	O
great	O
advantage	O
,	O
and	O
through	O
these	O
holes	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
plaited	O
cordage	O
is	O
passed	O
,	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
hold	O
the	O
planks	O
strongly	O
together	O
:	O
the	O
seams	O
are	O
caulked	O
with	O
dried	O
rushes	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
whole	O
outside	O
of	O
the	O
vessel	O
is	O
paid	O
with	O
a	O
gummy	O
juice	O
,	O
which	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
trees	O
produce	O
in	O
great	O
plenty	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
succedaneum	O
for	O
pitch	O
.	O

The	O
wood	O
which	O
they	O
use	O
for	O
their	O
large	O
canoes	O
,	O
is	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
apple	O
tree	O
,	O
which	O
grows	O
very	O
tall	O
and	O
strait	O
.	O

Several	O
of	O
them	O
that	O
we	O
measured	O
,	O
were	O
near	O
eight	O
feet	O
in	O
the	O
girth	O
,	O
and	O
from	O
20	O
to	O
40	O
to	O
the	O
branches	O
,	O
with	O
very	O
little	O
diminution	O
in	O
the	O
size	O
.	O

Our	O
carpenter	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
other	O
respects	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
good	O
wood	O
for	O
the	O
purpose	O
,	O
being	O
very	O
light	O
.	O

The	O
small	O
canoes	O
are	O
nothing	O
more	O
than	O
the	O
hollowed	O
trunk	O
of	O
the	O
bread-fruit	O
tree	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
still	O
more	O
light	O
and	O
spongy	O

The	O
trunk	O
of	O
the	O

is	O
six	O
feet	O
in	O

and	O
about	O
20	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
see	O
one	O
turtle	O
all	O
the	O
while	O
I	O
lay	O
off	O
this	O
island	O
,	O
but	O
upon	O
shewing	O
some	O
small	O

which	O
I	O
brought	O
from	O
Queen	PNM
Charlotte	PNM
's	PNM
Island	PNM
,	O
to	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
they	O
made	O

that	O
they	O
had	O
them	O
of	O
a	O
much	O
larger	O
size	O

I	O
very	O
much	O
regretted	O
my	O
having	O
lost	O
our	O
he-goat	O
,	O
which	O
died	O
soon	O
after	O
we	O
left	O
Saint	PNM
Iago	PNM
,	O
and	O
that	O
neither	O
of	O
our	O
she-goats	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
two	O
,	O
were	O
with	O
kid	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
he-goat	O
had	O
lived	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
put	O
them	O
all	O
on	O
shore	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
left	O
a	O
she-goat	O
here	O
if	O
either	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
been	O
with	O
kid	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
doubt	O
not	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
years	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
stocked	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

The	O
climate	O
here	O
appears	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
good	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
island	O
to	O
be	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
healthy	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
delightful	O
spots	O
in	O
the	O

We	O
saw	O
no	O
appearance	O
of	O
disease	O
among	O
the	O

The	O
hills	O
are	O
covered	O
with	O

the	O

and	O
the	O

kept	O
very	O
well	O
two	O

The	O
south-east	O
part	O
of	O
the	O

seems	O
to	O
be	O
better	O
cultivated	O

inhabited	O
than	O
where	O
we	O

from	O
thence	O
laden	O
with	O
plantains	O

we	O
always	O
found	O
greater	O

and	O
a	O
lower	O

very	O

the	O

While	O

they	O
put	O
off	O

hauled	O
up	O

At	O

we	O
were	O

the	O

that	O
ran	O
two	O

three	O
miles	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O

As	O
we	O
sailed	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
covered	O
with	O
cocoa-nut	O
trees	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
few	O
huts	O

and	O
smoke	O
in	O
several	O
parts	O
up	O
the	O
country	O

Soon	O
after	O
we	O
hauled	O
without	O
a	O
reef	O
of	O
rocks	O
,	O
to	O
get	O
round	O
the	O
lee-side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O

and	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
sent	O
out	O
the	O

to	O
sound	O

and	O
examine	O

Having	O
received	O
this	O
account	O
,	O
I	O
considered	O
that	O
the	O
watering	O
here	O
would	O
be	O
tedious	O
,	O
and	O
attended	O
with	O
great	O
fatigue	O
:	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
now	O
the	O
depth	O
of	O
winter	O
in	O
the	O
southern	O
hemisphere	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
leaky	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
rudder	O
shook	O
the	O
stern	O
very	O
much	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
what	O
other	O
damage	O
she	O
might	O
have	O
received	O
in	O
her	O
bottom	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
known	O
.	O

That	O
for	O
these	O
reasons	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
very	O
unfit	O
for	O
the	O
bad	O
weather	O
which	O
she	O
would	O
certainly	O
meet	O
with	O
either	O
in	O
going	O
round	O
Cape	PNM
Horn	PNM
,	O
or	O
through	O
the	O
Streight	PNM
of	PNM
Magellan	PNM
:	O
that	O
if	O

should	O
get	O
safely	O
through	O
the	O
Streight	O
,	O
or	O
round	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
absolutely	O
necessary	O
for	O
her	O
to	O
refresh	O
in	O
some	O
port	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
that	O
case	O
no	O
port	O
would	O
be	O
in	O
her	O
reach	O
;	O
I	O
therefore	O
determined	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
my	O
way	O
to	O
Tinian	PNM

Batavia	PNM

By	O
this	O
rout	O
,	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
judge	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
sooner	O
be	O
at	O

;	O
and	O
if	O
the	O

should	O
prove	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
condition	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
whole	O
voyage	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
still	O
save	O
our	O
lives	O
,	O
as	O
from	O
this	O
place	O
to	O
Batavia	PNM
we	O
should	O
probably	O
have	O
a	O
calm	O

and	O
be	O
not	O

from	O
a	O
port	O

The	O
boats	O
rowed	O
close	O
along	O
the	O

and	O
found	O
it	O
rocky	O
,	O
with	O
trees	O
growing	O
close	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
water-side	O
.	O

These	O
trees	O
were	O
of	O
different	O
sorts	O
,	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
very	O
large	O
,	O
but	O
had	O
no	O
fruit	O
:	O
on	O
the	O
lee-side	O

however	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
a	O
few	O
cocoa-nuts	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
a	O
single	O
habitation	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
.	O

They	O
discovered	O
several	O
small	O
rills	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
by	O
clearing	O
,	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
made	O
to	O
run	O
in	O
a	O
larger	O
stream	O
.	O

Soon	O
after	O
they	O
had	O
got	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
several	O
canoes	O
came	O
up	O
to	O
them	O

each	O
having	O
six	O
or	O
eight	O
men	O
on	O
board	O

They	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
robust	O
,	O
active	O
people	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
quite	O
naked	O
,	O
except	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
mat	O
that	O
was	O
wrapped	O
round	O
their	O
middle	O

They	O
were	O
armed	O
with	O
large	O
maces	O
or	O
clubs	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
Hercules	O
is	O
represented	O
with	O

two	O

which	O
they	O
sold	O
to	O
the	O
Master	O
for	O
a	O
nail	O
or	O
two	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
trinkets	O

As	O
our	O

had	O
seen	O
no	O
animal	O
,	O
either	O
bird	O
or	O
beast	O
,	O
except	O
seafowl	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
desirous	O
to	O
learn	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
whether	O
they	O
had	O
either	O

but	O
could	O
not	O
make	O
themselves	O
understood	O
.	O

It	O
appears	O
that	O
during	O
this	O
conference	O
,	O
a	O
design	O
was	O
formed	O
to	O
seize	O
our	O
cutter	O
,	O
for	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
suddenly	O
laid	O
hold	O
of	O
her	O
painter	O
,	O
and	O
hauled	O
her	O
upon	O
the	O
rocks	O
.	O

Our	O
people	O
endeavoured	O
,	O
in	O
vain	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
desist	O
,	O
till	O
they	O
fired	O
a	O
musket	O
cross	O
the	O
nose	O
of	O
the	O
man	O
that	O
was	O
most	O
active	O
in	O
the	O
mischief	O
.	O

No	O
hurt	O
was	O
done	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
fire	O
and	O
report	O
so	O
affrighted	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
made	O
off	O
with	O
great	O
precipitation	O
.	O

Both	O
our	O
boats	O
then	O
put	O
off	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
water	O
had	O
fallen	O
so	O
suddenly	O
that	O
they	O
found	O
it	O
very	O
difficult	O
to	O
get	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
for	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
into	O
deep	O
water	O
they	O
found	O
the	O
points	O
of	O
rocks	O
standing	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
whole	O
reef	O
,	O
except	O
in	O
one	O
part	O
,	O
was	O
now	O
dry	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
sea	O
broke	O
over	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
Indians	O
probably	O
perceived	O
their	O
distress	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
turned	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
followed	O
them	O
in	O
their	O
canoes	O
all	O
along	O
the	O
reef	O
till	O
they	O
got	O
to	O
the	O
breach	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
seeing	O
them	O
clear	O
,	O
and	O
making	O
way	O
fast	O
towards	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
they	O
returned	O

About	O
six	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
it	O
being	O
then	O
dark	O
,	O
the	O
boats	O
returned	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Master	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
all	O
within	O
the	O
reef	O
was	O
rocky	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
in	O
two	O

at	O
about	O

upon	O

The	O
breach	O
in	O
the	O
reef	O
he	O
found	O
to	O
be	O
about	O
60	O
fathom	O
broad	O
,	O
and	O
here	O
,	O
if	O
pressed	O
by	O

he	O
said	O
a	O

might	O
anchor	O

moor	O
in	O
8	O

that	O

We	O
immediately	O
took	O

perceived	O
that	O

although	O
we	O
had	O

with	O
great	O
care	O
before	O
we	O
anchored	O

the	O

the	O

a	O

in	O
hopes	O
to	O
get	O
up	O

recover	O
the	O

I	O
found	O
at	O

that	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O

without	O
anchoring	O

being	O
afraid	O
of	O
the	O

I	O

to	O

were	O

the	O
next	O

when	O

about	O
three	O

at	O

ordered	O

at	O

I	O
called	O
the	O

told	O

that	O
I	O
would	O
not	O

any	O

to	O
come	O
on	O

would	O

I	O
took	O
some	O

this	O

by	O
assuring	O
them	O
that	O
in	O
this	O

As	O
a	O
further	O

,	O
I	O
suffered	O
not	O
a	O
man	O
to	O
go	O
on	O

except	O
those	O
who	O
were	O

took	O
care	O
that	O
none	O
even	O

these	O
straggled	O

On	O
the	O
2d	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
the	O
boatswain	O
and	O
the	O
carpenter	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
carpenter	O
of	O
the	O
Falmouth	O
,	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
such	O
of	O
her	O
stores	O
as	O
had	O
been	O
landed	O
at	O
Onrust	PNM
,	O
with	O
orders	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
any	O
were	O

for	O
our	O
use	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
bought	O
.	O

At	O
their	O
return	O
,	O
they	O
informed	O
me	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
stores	O
they	O
had	O
seen	O
were	O
rotten	O
,	O
and	O
unfit	O
for	O
use	O
,	O
except	O
one	O
pair	O
of	O

which	O
they	O
brought	O
with	O
them	O
:	O
the	O
masts	O
,	O
yards	O
,	O
and	O
cables	O
were	O
all	O
dropping	O
to	O
pieces	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
the	O
iron	O
work	O
was	O
so	O
rusty	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
worth	O
nothing	O
.	O

They	O
also	O
went	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
Falmouth	O
to	O
examine	O
her	O
hulk	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
her	O
in	O
so	O
shattered	O
a	O
condition	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
their	O
opinion	O
she	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
kept	O
together	O
during	O
the	O
next	O
monsoon	O
.	O

Many	O
of	O
her	O
ports	O
were	O
washed	O
into	O
one	O
,	O
the	O
stern-post	O
was	O
quite	O
decayed	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
place	O
in	O
her	O
where	O
a	O
man	O
could	O
be	O
sheltered	O
from	O
the	O
weather	O

The	O
few	O
people	O
who	O
belonged	O
to	O
her	O
were	O
in	O
as	O
bad	O
a	O
state	O
as	O
their	O
vessel	O
,	O
being	O
quite	O
broken	O
and	O
worn	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
expecting	O
to	O
be	O
drowned	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
monsoon	O
should	O
set	O
in	O
.	O

Among	O
other	O
necessaries	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
want	O
of	O
an	O
anchor	O
,	O
having	O
lost	O
two	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
three	O
inch	O
rope	O
for	O
rounding	O
the	O
cables	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
officers	O
whom	O
I	O
had	O
sent	O
to	O
procure	O
these	O
articles	O
,	O
reported	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
price	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
demanded	O
for	O
them	O
was	O
so	O
exorbitant	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
not	O
agreed	O
to	O
give	O
it	O
.	O

On	O
Saturday	O
the	O
5th	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
myself	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
visited	O
the	O
different	O
storehouses	O
and	O
arsenals	O
,	O
but	O
found	O
it	O
impossible	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
better	O
bargain	O
than	O
my	O
officers	O
.	O

I	O
suspected	O
that	O
the	O
dealers	O
took	O
advantage	O
of	O
our	O
apparent	O
necessity	O
,	O
and	O
supposing	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
sail	O
without	O
what	O
we	O
had	O
offered	O
to	O
purchase	O
,	O
determined	O
to	O
extort	O
from	O
us	O
more	O
than	O
four	O
times	O
its	O
value	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
resolved	O
to	O
make	O
any	O
shift	O
rather	O
than	O
submit	O
to	O
what	O
I	O
thought	O
a	O
shameful	O
imposition	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
certainly	O
sail	O
on	O
the	O
next	O
Tuesday	O
;	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
agree	O
to	O
my	O
terms	O
in	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
take	O
the	O
things	O
I	O
had	O
treated	O
for	O
;	O
if	O
not	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
sail	O
without	O
them	O
.	O

Soon	O
after	O
I	O
returned	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
I	O
received	O
a	O
petition	O
from	O
the	O
Warrant-Officers	O
of	O
the	O
Falmouth	O
,	O
representing	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
nothing	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
look	O
after	O
:	O
that	O
the	O
Gunner	O
had	O
been	O
long	O
dead	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
stores	O
spoiled	O
,	O
particularly	O
the	O
powder	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
by	O
order	O
of	O
the	O
Dutch	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
thrown	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
:	O
that	O
the	O
boatswain	O
,	O
by	O
vexation	O
and	O
distress	O
,	O
had	O
lost	O
his	O
senses	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
then	O
a	O
deplorable	O
object	O
in	O
a	O
Dutch	O
hospital	O
:	O
that	O
all	O
his	O
stores	O
had	O
been	O
long	O
spoiled	O
and	O
rotten	O
,	O
the	O
roof	O
of	O
the	O
storehouse	O
having	O
fallen	O
in	O
during	O
a	O
wet	O
monsoon	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
them	O
exposed	O
many	O
months	O
,	O
all	O
endeavours	O
to	O
procure	O
another	O
place	O
to	O
put	O
them	O
in	O
being	O
ineffectual	O
:	O
that	O
the	O
carpenter	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
dying	O
condition	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
cook	O
a	O
wounded	O
cripple	O
.	O

For	O
these	O
reasons	O
,	O
they	O
requested	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
take	O
them	O
home	O
,	O
or	O
at	O
least	O
dismiss	O
them	O
from	O
their	O
charge	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
with	O
the	O
greatest	O
regret	O
and	O
compassion	O
that	O
I	O
told	O
these	O
unhappy	O
people	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
in	O
my	O
power	O
to	O
relieve	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
received	O
charge	O
of	O
stores	O
,	O
they	O
must	O
wait	O
orders	O
from	O
home	O
.	O

They	O
replied	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
never	O
received	O
a	O
single	O
order	O
from	O
England	PNM
since	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
left	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
earnestly	O
intreated	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
make	O
their	O
distress	O
known	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
relieved	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
,	O
they	O
said	O
,	O
ten	O
years	O
pay	O
due	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
expectation	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
grown	O
old	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
now	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
content	O
to	O
forfeit	O

and	O
go	O
home	O
sweepers	O
,	O
rather	O
than	O
continue	O
to	O
suffer	O
the	O
miseries	O
of	O
their	O
present	O
situation	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
indeed	O
very	O
great	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
not	O
suffered	O
to	O
spend	O
a	O
single	O
night	O
on	O
shore	O

whatever	O
was	O
their	O

when	O
they	O
were	O
sick	O

no	O
one	O
visited	O
them	O

they	O
were	O

and	O
in	O
perpetual	O
dread	O
of	O

as	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
before	O

the	O

I	O

do	O
my	O

to	O

them	O
relief	O

with	O

As	O
I	O
heard	O
nothing	O
more	O

the	O

for	O

I	O
had	O
been	O
in	O

I	O

all	O

The	O

our	O

a	O

8th	O
of	O
December	O

after	O
a	O
stay	O
of	O
just	O
one	O

,	O
we	O
set	O
sail	O

On	O
the	O
11th	O
,	O
at	O
noon	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
off	O
a	O
small	O

called	O
the	O

between	O
the	O
coasts	O
of	O

and	O
several	O

fell	O
down	O
with	O

The	O
next	O

,	O
a	O
Dutch	O

on	O

sold	O

some	O

At	O

at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
about	O
two	O
miles	O
from	O
the	O
Java	O

we	O
saw	O
an	O
incredible	O
number	O
of	O
lights	O
upon	O
the	O

which	O
we	O

the	O

appearance	O
at	O

On	O
Monday	O
the	O
14th	O
,	O
we	O
anchored	O
off	O
Prince	PNM

began	O
to	O

The	O

the	O
19th	O

was	O
so	O

hurt	O
that	O
he	O
continued	O

1st	O
of	O
July	O
1766	O
;	O
the	O
Swallow	O
then	O
lay	O
at	O
Chatham	PNM
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
ordered	O
to	O
fit	O
her	O
out	O
with	O
all	O
possible	O
expedition	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
an	O
old	O
ship	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
in	O
the	O
service	O
thirty	O
years	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
fit	O
for	O
a	O
long	O
voyage	O
,	O
having	O
only	O
a	O
slight	O
thin	O
sheathing	O
upon	O
her	O
bottom	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
not	O
even	O
filled	O
with	O
nails	O
to	O
supply	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
a	O
covering	O
that	O
would	O
more	O
effectually	O
keep	O
out	O
the	O
worm	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
been	O
given	O
to	O
understand	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
with	O
the	O
Dolphin	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
disparity	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
difference	O
in	O
their	O
equipment	O
,	O
made	O
me	O
think	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
intended	O
for	O
the	O
same	O
duty	O
;	O
the	O
Dolphin	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
sheathed	O
with	O
copper	O
,	O
being	O
supplied	O
with	O
every	O
thing	O
that	O
was	O
requisite	O
for	O
a	O
long	O
and	O
dangerous	O
navigation	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
Swallow	O
having	O
only	O
a	O
scanty	O
supply	O
of	O
common	O
necessaries	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
ventured	O
to	O
apply	O
for	O
a	O
forge	O
,	O
some	O
iron	O
,	O
a	O
small	O
skiff	O
,	O
and	O
several	O
other	O
things	O
which	O
I	O
knew	O
by	O
experience	O
would	O
be	O
of	O
the	O
utmost	O
importance	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
intended	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
make	O
another	O
voyage	O
round	O
the	O
world	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
told	O
that	O
the	O
vessel	O
and	O
her	O
equipment	O
were	O
very	O
fit	O
for	O
the	O
service	O
she	O
was	O
to	O
perform	O
,	O
and	O
none	O
of	O
the	O
requisites	O
for	O
which	O
I	O
applied	O
were	O
allowed	O
me	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
therefore	O
confirmed	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
Dolphin	O
was	O
to	O
go	O
round	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
it	O
could	O
never	O
be	O
intended	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
go	O
farther	O
than	O
Falkland	PNM
's	PNM
Islands	PNM
,	O
where	O
the	O
Jason	O
,	O
a	O
fine	O
frigate	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
Dolphin	O
,	O
sheathed	O
with	O
copper	O
,	O
and	O
amply	O
equipped	O
,	O
would	O
supply	O
my	O
place	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
however	O
deficient	O
in	O
junk	O
,	O
an	O
article	O
which	O
is	O
essentially	O
necessary	O
in	O
every	O
voyage	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
this	O
I	O
applied	O
when	O
I	O
got	O
to	O
Plymouth	PNM
,	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
told	O
that	O
a	O
quantity	O
sufficient	O
for	O
both	O
the	O
ships	O
had	O
been	O
put	O
on	O
board	O
the	O

22d	O

the	O

the	O
evening	O
before	O

I	O
weighed	O

We	O
proceeded	O
together	O
without	O
any	O
remarkable	O
incident	O
till	O
the	O
7th	O
of	O
September	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
an	O

While	O
I	O
lay	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
,	O
not	O
being	O
yet	O
acquainted	O
with	O
my	O

I	O
represented	O
my	O

and	O
the	O
reply	O
that	O
had	O

to	O
my	O

for	O
a	O

by	O
the	O

who	O
sent	O
me	O
five	O
hundred	O
weight	O
.	O

This	O
quantity	O
however	O
was	O
so	O
inadequate	O
to	O
my	O
wants	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
soon	O
afterwards	O
reduced	O
to	O
the	O
disagreeable	O
necessity	O
of	O
cutting	O
off	O
some	O
of	O
my	O

On	O

very	O
early	O
in	O

the	O
Lieutenant	O
acquainted	O
me	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
nine	O
of	O
my	O
best	O
men	O
had	O
secretly	O
set	O
off	O
from	O
the	O
ship	O
to	O
swim	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
having	O
stripped	O
themselves	O
naked	O
and	O
left	O
all	O
their	O
clothes	O
behind	O
them	O
,	O
taking	O
only	O
their	O
money	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
secured	O
in	O
a	O
handkerchief	O
that	O
was	O
tied	O
round	O
their	O
wa1st	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
proceeded	O
together	O
till	O
they	O
came	O
very	O
near	O
the	O
surf	O
,	O
which	O
breaks	O
high	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
being	O
then	O
terrified	O
at	O
the	O
sound	O
,	O
had	O
swum	O
back	O
again	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
been	O
taken	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
rest	O
had	O
ventured	O
through	O
.	O

As	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
these	O
men	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
severely	O
felt	O
,	O
I	O
immediately	O
sat	O
down	O
to	O
write	O
a	O
letter	O
to	O
the	O
Consul	O
,	O
entreating	O
his	O
assistance	O
to	O
recover	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
before	O
I	O
had	O
finished	O
it	O
,	O
he	O
sent	O
me	O
word	O
,	O
that	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
having	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
great	O
astonishment	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
been	O
found	O
naked	O
on	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
taken	O
into	O
custody	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
be	O
delivered	O
up	O
to	O
my	O
order	O
.	O

The	O
boat	O
was	O
dispatched	O
immediately	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
heard	O
they	O
were	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
upon	O
the	O
deck	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
greatly	O
pleased	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
contrition	O
in	O
their	O
countenances	O
,	O
which	O
at	O
once	O
secretly	O
determined	O
me	O
not	O
to	O
inflict	O
the	O
punishment	O
by	O
which	O
they	O
seemed	O
most	O
heartily	O
willing	O
to	O
expiate	O
their	O
fault	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
asked	O
them	O
what	O
could	O
have	O
induced	O
them	O
to	O
quit	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
desert	O
the	O
service	O
of	O
their	O
country	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
risk	O
of	O
being	O
devoured	O
by	O
sharks	O
,	O
or	O
dashed	O
to	O
pieces	O
by	O
the	O
surf	O
against	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

They	O
answered	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
they	O
had	O
indeed	O
at	O
such	O
risks	O
ventured	O
to	O
swim	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
they	O
never	O
had	O
any	O
intention	O
of	O
deserting	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
determined	O
to	O
stand	O
by	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
she	O
could	O
swim	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
being	O
well	O
assured	O
they	O
were	O
going	O
a	O
long	O
voyage	O
,	O
and	O
none	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
tell	O
who	O
might	O
live	O
,	O
or	O
who	O
might	O
die	O
,	O
they	O
thought	O
it	O
hard	O
not	O
to	O
have	O
an	O
opportunity	O
of	O
spending	O
their	O
own	O
money	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
determined	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
said	O
,	O
once	O
more	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
skinful	O
of	O
liquor	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
swim	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
hoped	O
to	O
have	O
done	O
before	O
they	O
were	O
missed	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
had	O
resolved	O
to	O
remit	O
their	O
punishment	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
too	O
severely	O
scrutinize	O
their	O
apology	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O
,	O
who	O
stood	O
round	O
them	O
,	O
seemed	O
very	O
much	O
to	O
approve	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
observing	O
that	O
with	O
a	O
skinful	O
of	O
liquor	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
unfit	O
condition	O
to	O
swim	O
through	O
the	O
surf	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
hoping	O
they	O
would	O
for	O
the	O
future	O
expose	O
their	O
lives	O
only	O
upon	O
more	O
important	O
occasions	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
their	O
conduct	O
would	O
thenceforward	O
give	O
me	O
no	O
cause	O
of	O
complaint	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
for	O
this	O
time	O
be	O
satisfied	O
with	O
the	O
shame	O
and	O
regret	O
which	O
I	O
perceived	O
they	O
suffered	O
from	O
a	O
sense	O
of	O
their	O
misbehaviour	O
:	O
I	O
then	O
admonished	O
them	O
to	O
put	O
on	O
their	O
clothes	O
,	O
and	O
lie	O
down	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
confident	O
they	O
wanted	O
rest	O
;	O
and	O
added	O
,	O
that	O
as	O
I	O
might	O
possibly	O
during	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
the	O
voyage	O
have	O
occasion	O
for	O
good	O
swimmers	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
glad	O
that	O
I	O
knew	O
to	O
whom	O
I	O
might	O
apply	O
.	O

Having	O
thus	O
dismissed	O
these	O
honest	O
fellows	O
from	O
their	O
fears	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
infinitely	O
gratified	O
by	O
the	O
murmur	O
of	O
satisfaction	O
which	O
instantly	O
ran	O
through	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O
;	O
and	O
was	O
afterwards	O
amply	O
rewarded	O
for	O
my	O
lenity	O
,	O
there	O
being	O
no	O
service	O
during	O
all	O
the	O
toils	O
and	O
dangers	O
of	O
the	O
voyage	O
which	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
perform	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
zeal	O
and	O
alacrity	O
that	O
were	O
much	O
to	O
their	O
honour	O
and	O
my	O
advantage	O
,	O
as	O
an	O
example	O
to	O
the	O
rest	O
.	O

We	O
sailed	O
again	O
on	O
the	O
12th	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
then	O
first	O
acquainted	O
with	O
the	O
particulars	O
of	O
our	O
voyage	O
by	O
Captain	O
Wallis	O
,	O
who	O
gave	O
me	O
a	O
copy	O
of	O
his	O
instructions	O
,	O
and	O
appointed	O
Port	PNM
Famine	PNM
in	O
the	O
Streight	PNM
of	PNM
Magellan	PNM
to	O
be	O
the	O
place	O
of	O
rendezvous	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
should	O
happen	O
to	O
be	O
separated	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
now	O
convinced	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
sent	O
upon	O
a	O
service	O
to	O
which	O
my	O
vessel	O
and	O
her	O
equipment	O
were	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
equal	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
determined	O
at	O
all	O
events	O
to	O
perform	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
best	O
manner	O
I	O
was	O
able	O
.	O

We	O
proceeded	O
on	O
our	O
voyage	O
without	O
any	O
remarkable	O
event	O
till	O
we	O
anchored	O
off	O
Cape	PNM
Virgin	PNM
Mary	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
Patagonians	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
have	O
given	O
some	O
account	O
in	O
a	O
letter	O
to	O
Dr.	O
Matty	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
published	O
in	O
the	O
sixtieth	O
volume	O
of	O
the	O
Transactions	O
of	O
the	O
Royal	PNM
Society	PNM
,	PNM
and	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
necessary	O
here	O
to	O
repeat	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
in	O
general	O
the	O
same	O
as	O
those	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
given	O
by	O
Commodore	O
Byron	O
and	O
Captain	O
Wallis	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
entered	O
the	O
Streight	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
ordered	O
to	O
keep	O
ahead	O
of	O
the	O
Dolphin	O
and	O
the	O
storeship	O
,	O
to	O
pilot	O
them	O
through	O
the	O
shoals	O
;	O
but	O
my	O
ship	O
worked	O
so	O
ill	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
but	O
very	O
seldom	O
make	O
her	O
tack	O
without	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
a	O
boat	O
to	O
tow	O
her	O
round	O
:	O
however	O
,	O
with	O
much	O
labour	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
no	O
inconsiderable	O
risk	O
,	O
we	O
anchored	O
in	O
Port	PNM
Famine	PNM
on	O
Friday	O
the	O
26th	O
of	O
December	O
.	O

At	O
this	O
place	O
we	O
unhung	O
our	O
rudder	O
,	O
and	O
added	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
wood	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
in	O
hopes	O
that	O
by	O
making	O
it	O
broader	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
obtain	O
some	O
advantage	O
in	O
working	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
in	O
which	O
however	O
we	O
were	O
altogether	O
disappointed	O
.	O

After	O
many	O
difficulties	O
and	O
dangers	O
,	O
we	O
got	O
into	O
Island	PNM
Bay	PNM
on	O
the	O
17th	O
of	O
February	O
;	O
and	O
before	O
we	O
made	O
sail	O
again	O
,	O
I	O
represented	O
the	O
condition	O
of	O
my	O
ship	O
by	O
letter	O
to	O
Captain	O
Wallis	O
,	O
and	O
requested	O
him	O
to	O
consider	O
what	O
was	O
best	O
for	O
his	O
Majesty	O
's	O
service	O
,	O
whether	O
she	O
should	O
be	O
dismissed	O
,	O
or	O
continue	O
the	O
voyage	O
.	O

Captain	O
Wallis	O
replied	O
,	O
that	O
as	O
the	O
Lords	O
of	O
the	O
Admiralty	O
had	O
ordered	O
the	O
Swallow	O
on	O
this	O
service	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
well	O
acquainted	O
,	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
himself	O
at	O
liberty	O
to	O
alter	O
her	O
destination	O

We	O
continued	O
therefore	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
to	O
navigate	O
the	O
Streight	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
passed	O
it	O
before	O

I	O
was	O

to	O
keep	O
ahead	O

with	O

I	O
thought	O
proper	O
;	O
but	O
perceiving	O
that	O
the	O
bad	O
sailing	O
of	O
the	O
Swallow	O
would	O
so	O
much	O
retard	O
the	O

as	O
probably	O
to	O
make	O

the	O

and	O
defeat	O
the	O

I	O
proposed	O
to	O
Captain	O
Wallis	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
lay	O
the	O
Swallow	O
up	O
in	O
some	O
cove	O
or	O
bay	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
attend	O
and	O
assist	O
him	O
with	O
her	O
boats	O
till	O
the	O
Streight	O
should	O
be	O
passed	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
probably	O
be	O
in	O
much	O
less	O
time	O
than	O
if	O
he	O
continued	O
to	O
be	O
retarded	O
by	O
my	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
urged	O
as	O
an	O
additional	O
advantage	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
complete	O
not	O
only	O
his	O
stock	O
of	O
provisions	O
and	O
stores	O
,	O
but	O
his	O
company	O
,	O
out	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
send	O
her	O
back	O
to	O
England	PNM
,	O
with	O
such	O
of	O
his	O
crew	O
as	O
sickness	O
had	O
rendered	O
unfit	O
for	O
the	O
voyage	O
:	O
proposing	O
also	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
my	O
way	O
home	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
examine	O
the	O
eastern	O
coast	O
of	O
Patagonia	PNM
,	O
or	O
attempt	O
such	O
other	O
discoveries	O
as	O
he	O
should	O
think	O
proper	O

If	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
approved	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
knowlege	O
of	O
the	O
South	PNM

was	O
thought	O
necessary	O
to	O
the	O
success	O
of	O
the	O
voyage	O
,	O
I	O
offered	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
him	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
Dolphin	O
and	O
give	O
up	O
the	O
Swallow	O
to	O
be	O
commanded	O
by	O
his	O
First	O

whose	O
duty	O

would	O

or	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
voyage	O
myself	O

the	O
Dolphin	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
take	O
the	O
Swallow	O
back	O
to	O
Europe	PNM
;	O
but	O
Captain	O
Wallis	O
was	O
still	O
of	O
opinion	O
that	O
the	O
voyage	O
should	O
be	O
prosecuted	O
by	O
the	O
two	O
ships	O
jointly	O
,	O
pursuant	O
to	O
the	O
orders	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
given	O

The	O
Swallow	O
was	O
now	O
become	O
so	O
foul	O
,	O
that	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
sails	O
she	O
could	O
set	O
she	O
could	O
not	O
make	O
so	O
much	O
way	O
as	O
the	O
Dolphin	O
,	O
with	O
only	O
her	O
top-sails	O
and	O
a	O
reef	O
in	O
them	O
:	O
we	O
continued	O
in	O
company	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
till	O
Friday	O
the	O
10th	O
of	O
April	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
western	O
entrance	O
of	O
the	O

was	O
open	O

and	O
the	O

in	O

Hitherto	O
I	O
had	O
,	O
pursuant	O
to	O

kept	O
ahead	O

now	O
the	O
Dolphin	O
being	O
nearly	O
abreast	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
set	O
her	O
foresails	O
,	O
which	O
soon	O
carried	O
her	O
ahead	O
of	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
before	O
nine	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
as	O
she	O
shewed	O
no	O

,	O
we	O
lost	O
sight	O
of	O
her	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
fine	O
eastern	O

of	O
which	O
we	O
made	O
the	O
best	O
use	O
we	O
could	O
during	O
the	O

,	O
carrying	O
all	O
our	O
small	O

,	O
even	O
to	O
the	O
top-gallant	O
studding	O
sails	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
the	O
danger	O
to	O
which	O
it	O
exposed	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
at	O
day-break	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
but	O
just	O
see	O
the	O
Dolphin	O
's	O
top-sail	O
's	O
above	O
the	O
horizon	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
perceive	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
studding	O
sails	O
set	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
nine	O
o'clock	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
entirely	O
lost	O
sight	O
of	O
her	O
;	O
we	O
judged	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
then	O
clear	O
of	O
the	O
Streight	O

mouth	O
,	O
but	O
we	O

who	O
were	O

had	O
but	O
light	O
and	O

From	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
up	O
all	O
hope	O
of	O
seeing	O
the	O
Dolphin	O
again	O
till	O
we	O
should	O
arrive	O
in	O

as	O
had	O
been	O

from	O

to	O
the	O

I	O
thought	O
myself	O
the	O
more	O
unfortunate	O
in	O
this	O

as	O

absolutely	O

to	O
the	O

of	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
satisfaction	O

however	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
no	O
marks	O
of	O
despondency	O
among	O
my	O
peoples	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
encouraged	O
,	O
by	O
telling	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
although	O
the	O
Dolphin	O
was	O
the	O
best	O
ship	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
doubt	O
but	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
find	O
more	O
than	O

advantages	O
in	O

and	O
good	O

At	O
noon	O

this	O

we	O
were	O

when	O

a	O

springing	O
up	O
at	O

down	O
our	O

freshened	O
to	O
the	O
W.S.W.	O

right	O
in	O
from	O
the	O

and	O
after	O

we	O

the	O

that	O

we	O
therefore	O
got	O
close	O
under	O

sent	O
our	O

a-head	O

out	O
Tuesday	PNM

At	O

with	O

I	O
fired	O

at	O

had	O
the	O
satisfaction	O

made	O

as	O
soon	O

it	O

the	O

I	O

in	O
search	O
of	O

I	O

of	O
the	O

for	O
her	O

to	O
keep	O
out	O
in	O
this	O
dangerous	O
pass	O
another	O
night	O

I	O
then	O
saw	O
her	O
sounding	O
a	O

in	O

the	O

this	O

with	O
the	O

about	O
six	O

and	O
I	O
went	O
down	O

tumult	O
among	O
the	O
people	O

all	O
that	O
were	O
below	O

hastily	O
upon	O
the	O
deck	O

and	O
joining	O
the	O
clamour	O
of	O
those	O
above	O

I	O
instantly	O
started	O
up	O

imagining	O
that	O
a	O

and	O
that	O

but	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
upon	O
the	O

I	O
heard	O
the	O
people	O
cry	O
out	O

the	O
Dolphin	O

the	O
Dolphin	O
!	O

in	O
a	O
transport	O
of	O
surprize	O
and	O
joy	O
which	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
little	O
short	O
of	O
distraction	O
:	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
convinced	O
us	O
that	O
what	O
had	O
been	O
taken	O
for	O
a	O
sail	O
was	O
nothing	O
more	O
than	O
the	O
water	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
forced	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
whirled	O
about	O
in	O
the	O

,	O
by	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
violent	O
gusts	O
that	O
were	O
continually	O

off	O
the	O
high	O
land	O

and	O
which	O
,	O
through	O
the	O
haze	O

had	O
a	O
most	O
deceitful	O
appearance	O

The	O
people	O
were	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
somewhat	O
dejected	O
by	O
their	O
disappointment	O

but	O
before	O
I	O

down	O

The	O

we	O

the	O

the	O

the	O

the	O

On	O
the	O
5th	O

we	O
were	O
again	O

by	O
a	O

such	O

that	O
we	O

no	O

During	O
this	O
storm	O
,	O
two	O
of	O
our	O

were	O
broken	O

we	O
continued	O
toiling	O
in	O
a	O

midnight	O

when	O
a	O
light	O

up	O
at	O

blew	O
very	O
hard	O

at	O
two	O
in	O
the	O

we	O
were	O

by	O
a	O
sudden	O

violent	O
squall	O
at	O

at	O

before	O

the	O

With	O
this	O
gale	O
we	O
stood	O
north	O

and	O
in	O
the	O
forenoon	O
the	O

This	O

the	O

The	O

continued	O
in	O
this	O

eight	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
of	O
the	O
7th	O

On	O
the	O

The	O
next	O

we	O
made	O
the	O

and	O
on	O
the	O
10th	O
,	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Juan	PNM

:	O
in	O
the	O

we	O
got	O
close	O
to	O
the	O

of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
after	O
hauled	O
round	O
the	O

opened	O
Cumberland	PNM

As	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
that	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
had	O
fortified	O
this	O
island	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
greatly	O
surprized	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
considerable	O
number	O
of	O
men	O
about	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
house	O
and	O
four	O
pieces	O
of	O
cannon	O
near	O
the	O
water-side	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
fort	O
about	O
three	O
hundred	O
yards	O
farther	O
from	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
just	O
upon	O
the	O

with	O

on	O
the	O

This	O
fort	O

which	O
is	O

with	O
stone	O
,	O
has	O
eighteen	O
or	O
twenty	O
embrasures	O
,	O
and	O
within	O
it	O
a	O
long	O
house	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
barracks	O
for	O
the	O
garrison	O
:	O
five	O
and	O
twenty	O
or	O
thirty	O
houses	O
of	O
different	O
kinds	O
are	O
scattered	O
round	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
saw	O
much	O
cattle	O
feeding	O
on	O
the	O
brow	O
of	O
the	O
hills	O
,	O
which	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
cultivated	O
,	O
as	O
many	O
spots	O
were	O
divided	O
by	O
enclosures	O
from	O
each	O
other	O
;	O
we	O
saw	O
also	O
two	O
large	O
boats	O
lying	O
on	O
the	O
beach	O

The	O
gusts	O
of	O
wind	O
which	O
came	O
right	O
out	O
of	O
this	O
bay	O
,	O
prevented	O
my	O
going	O
so	O
near	O
as	O
I	O
intended	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
violent	O
as	O
to	O
oblige	O
us	O
many	O
times	O
to	O
let	O
fly	O
our	O
top-sail	O
sheets	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
sails	O
were	O
close	O
reefed	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
impossible	O
to	O
work	O
a	O
ship	O
into	O
this	O
bay	O
when	O
the	O
wind	O
blows	O
hard	O
from	O
the	O
southward	O

As	O
we	O
stood	O
cross	O
the	O
bay	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
boats	O
put	O
off	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
rowed	O
towards	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
perceiving	O
that	O
the	O
gusts	O
,	O
or	O
flaws	O
,	O
made	O
us	O
lie	O
at	O
a	O
considerable	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
she	O
went	O
in	O
again	O

We	O
then	O
opened	O
Weft	O
Bay	O

on	O
the	O
east	O
part	O
of	O
which	O
,	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
sea	O

is	O
a	O
small	O
house	O

which	O
I	O
took	O
for	O
a	O
guard-house	O

mounted	O
upon	O
their	O

We	O
now	O

stood	O
again	O
for	O
Cumberland	PNM

,	O
but	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
opened	O
it	O
,	O
the	O

again	O
put	O
off	O

made	O
towards	O

as	O
the	O

would	O
not	O

us	O
to	O
come	O
any	O

was	O
very	O

out	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
:	O
at	O

it	O
grew	O
dark	O

and	O
we	O
lost	O
fight	O
of	O
her	O

upon	O
which	O
we	O
made	O
all	O
the	O
sail	O
we	O
could	O
to	O
the	O

During	O
all	O
this	O

I	O
hoisted	O

none	O

at	O

I	O
did	O
not	O

On	O
the	O
12th	O
of	O

we	O
arrived	O
off	O
the	O

but	O
it	O
blowing	O
hard	O

with	O
a	O

we	O
did	O
not	O
dare	O
to	O
come	O
near	O
it	O
on	O
this	O
side	O

and	O
therefore	O
went	O
round	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
we	O
cast	O

an	O

next	O
morning	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
light	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
the	O
boats	O
out	O
again	O
,	O
to	O
examine	O
any	O
place	O
where	O
they	O
could	O
get	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

They	O
returned	O
with	O
a	O
few	O
casks	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
filled	O
at	O
a	O
small	O
rill	O
,	O
and	O
reported	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
wind	O
being	O
at	O
S.E.	O
blew	O
so	O
strong	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
raised	O
so	O
great	O
a	O
sea	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
come	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

We	O
continued	O
here	O
till	O
the	O
15th	O
,	O
at	O
day-break	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
the	O
weather	O
becoming	O
more	O
moderate	O
,	O
we	O
weighed	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
just	O
at	O
sun-set	O
,	O
we	O
anchored	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
place	O
where	O
Commodore	O
Byron	O
had	O
anchored	O
about	O
two	O
years	O
before	O
.	O

We	O
lost	O
no	O
time	O
,	O
but	O
immediately	O
got	O
off	O
fifteen	O
casks	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
sent	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
men	O
on	O
shore	O
with	O
others	O
,	O
that	O
were	O
empty	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
filled	O
against	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
strong	O
party	O
to	O
cut	O
wood	O
:	O
but	O
it	O
happened	O
that	O
about	O
two	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
a	O
hard	O
gale	O
of	O
wind	O
came	O
on	O
from	O
the	O
N.W.	O
with	O
violent	O
gusts	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
which	O
drove	O
us	O
off	O
the	O
bank	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
two	O
anchors	O
ahead	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
utmost	O
danger	O
of	O
being	O
lost	O
;	O
we	O
got	O
them	O
up	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
with	O
great	O
difficulty	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
set	O
the	O
sails	O
,	O
and	O
worked	O
under	O
the	O
lee	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
keeping	O
as	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
;	O
the	O
weather	O
soon	O
afterwards	O
became	O
more	O
moderate	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
carry	O
double	O
reefed	O
top-sails	O
;	O
we	O
had	O
also	O
very	O
smooth	O
water	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
make	O
the	O
ship	O
tack	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
wear	O
her	O
every	O
time	O
we	O
wanted	O
to	O
go	O
about	O
.	O

At	O
day-break	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
a	O
good	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
the	O
cutter	O
to	O
get	O
off	O
a	O
load	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
before	O
the	O
surf	O
should	O
be	O
so	O
great	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
as	O
to	O
prevent	O
her	O
landing	O
.	O

About	O
ten	O
o'clock	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
N.N.E.	O
which	O
enabled	O
us	O
to	O
get	O
within	O
a	O
little	O
distance	O
of	O
the	O
watering-place	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
recovered	O
our	O
anchoring	O
ground	O
upon	O
the	O
bank	O
from	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
driven	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
weather	O
had	O
so	O
bad	O
an	O
appearance	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
gale	O
freshened	O
so	O
fast	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
it	O
prudent	O
to	O
venture	O
:	O
we	O
brought	O
to	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
as	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
as	O
possible	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
advantage	O
of	O
smooth	O
water	O
to	O
unload	O
the	O
cutter	O
,	O
which	O
soon	O
after	O
came	O
along-side	O
with	O
twelve	O
casks	O
of	O
water	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
taken	O
these	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
the	O
cutter	O
again	O
for	O
another	O
freight	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
a	O
very	O
little	O
distance	O
from	O
land	O
,	O
I	O
ventured	O
to	O
send	O
our	O
long-boat	O
,	O
a	O
clumsey	O
,	O
heavy	O
,	O
four-oared	O
vessel	O
,	O
with	O
provisions	O
for	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
orders	O
to	O
bring	O
back	O
a	O
load	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
if	O
she	O
could	O
get	O
it	O
:	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
these	O
boats	O
were	O
dispatched	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
a	O
tack	O
off	O
to	O
keep	O
our	O
ground	O
.	O

At	O
noon	O
it	O
blew	O
hard	O
,	O
with	O
heavy	O
rain	O
and	O
thick	O
weather	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
one	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
standing	O
in	O
again	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
boats	O
running	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
lee	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
this	O
side	O
being	O
open	O
to	O
the	O
wind	O
;	O
we	O
therefore	O
followed	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
to	O
as	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
as	O
possible	O
,	O
to	O
favour	O
their	O
coming	O
on	O
board	O
:	O
they	O
presently	O
made	O
towards	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
hoisted	O
them	O
in	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
sea	O
was	O
now	O
risen	O
so	O
high	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
doing	O
it	O
they	O
received	O
considerable	O
damage	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
soon	O
learnt	O
that	O
they	O
found	O
the	O
surf	O
so	O
great	O
as	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
even	O
to	O
land	O
their	O
empty	O
water	O
casks	O
.	O

We	O
continued	O
to	O
lie	O
to	O
,	O
under	O
a	O
balanced	O
mizen	O
,	O
off	O
the	O
lee	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
all	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
and	O
although	O
all	O
hands	O
had	O
been	O
constantly	O
employed	O
ever	O
since	O
the	O
ship	O
had	O
been	O
driven	O
off	O
her	O
anchoring	O
ground	O
,	O
the	O
carpenters	O
worked	O
all	O
night	O
in	O
repairing	O
the	O
boats	O
.	O

At	O
four	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
the	O
island	O
bore	O
west	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
being	O
four	O
leagues	O
distant	O
,	O
and	O
right	O
to	O
windward	O
:	O
we	O
had	O
now	O
a	O
fine	O
gale	O
and	O
smooth	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
ten	O
o'clock	O
we	O
fetched	O
very	O
near	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
made	O
the	O
ship	O
tack	O
.	O

As	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
probable	O
that	O
with	O
such	O
a	O
vessel	O
we	O
could	O
regain	O
the	O
anchoring-ground	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
advantage	O
of	O
our	O
being	O
so	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
though	O
at	O
a	O
good	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
watering-place	O
,	O
to	O
send	O
the	O
cutter	O
for	O
another	O
load	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
I	O
stood	O
on	O
and	O
off	O
with	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
four	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
the	O
cutter	O
brought	O
her	O
freight	O
of	O
water	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

I	O
enquired	O
of	O
the	O
Lieutenant	O
after	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
violent	O
rain	O
which	O
had	O
fallen	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
had	O
suddenly	O
brought	O
down	O
such	O
torrents	O
of	O
water	O
through	O
the	O
hollow	O
or	O
gully	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
taken	O
up	O
their	O
station	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
utmost	O
danger	O
of	O
being	O
swept	O
away	O
before	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
though	O
with	O
great	O
difficulty	O
they	O
saved	O
themselves	O
,	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
casks	O
were	O
intirely	O
lost	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
now	O
too	O
late	O
for	O
the	O
boat	O
to	O
make	O
another	O
turn	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
had	O
hitherto	O
got	O
our	O
water	O
;	O
but	O
Mr.	O
Erasmus	O
Gower	O
,	O
the	O
Lieutenant	O
,	O
whose	O
diligence	O
and	O
ability	O
in	O
all	O
our	O
dangers	O
and	O
distress	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
sufficiently	O
commend	O
,	O
having	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
returned	O
with	O
the	O
cutter	O
,	O
observed	O
that	O
many	O
runs	O
of	O
water	O
had	O
been	O
made	O
by	O
the	O
night	O
's	O
rain	O
,	O
on	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
which	O
was	O
nearest	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
knowing	O
how	O
impatient	O
I	O
was	O
of	O
delay	O
,	O
offered	O
to	O
go	O
thither	O
with	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
fill	O
as	O
many	O
casks	O
as	O
she	O
could	O
bring	O
back	O
.	O

I	O
gladly	O
accepted	O
this	O
offer	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Gower	O
went	O
away	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
tack	O
off	O
with	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
but	O
before	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
gone	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
the	O
weather	O
began	O
to	O
grow	O
gloomy	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
wind	O
to	O
freshen	O
,	O
a	O
heavy	O
black	O
cloud	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
settled	O
over	O
the	O
island	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
hide	O
the	O
tops	O
of	O
the	O
hills	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
after	O
it	O
began	O
to	O
thunder	O
and	O
lighten	O
at	O
a	O
dreadful	O
rate	O
:	O
as	O
these	O
appearances	O
were	O
very	O
threatening	O
,	O
I	O
stood	O
in	O
again	O
towards	O
the	O
island	O
in	O
hopes	O
of	O
meeting	O
with	O
the	O
boat	O
;	O
but	O
though	O
we	O
ran	O
in	O
as	O
close	O
as	O
we	O
durst	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
nothing	O
of	O
her	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
night	O
came	O
on	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
thickness	O
of	O
the	O
weather	O
rendered	O
extremely	O
dark	O
,	O
the	O
gale	O
increased	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
began	O
to	O
rain	O
with	O
great	O
violence	O
:	O
in	O
this	O
situation	O
I	O
lay	O
to	O
under	O
a	O
balanced	O
mizen	O
,	O
firing	O
guns	O
,	O
and	O
burning	O
false	O
fires	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
guide	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
;	O
and	O
not	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
account	O
for	O
her	O
delay	O
,	O
I	O
suffered	O
the	O
most	O
distressful	O
anxiety	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
indeed	O
but	O
too	O
much	O
reason	O
to	O
fear	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
lost	O
.	O

About	O
seven	O
o'clock	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
to	O
my	O
unspeakable	O
satisfaction	O
she	O
came	O
safe	O
alongside	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
long	O
seen	O
a	O
storm	O
gathering	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
expected	O
every	O
moment	O
to	O
burst	O
upon	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
got	O
her	O
in	O
with	O
all	O
possible	O
expedition	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
indeed	O
happy	O
for	O
us	O
all	O
that	O
no	O
time	O
was	O
lost	O
,	O
for	O
before	O
she	O
could	O
be	O
got	O
into	O
her	O
place	O
,	O
the	O
squall	O
came	O
on	O
,	O
which	O
in	O
a	O
moment	O
laid	O
the	O
ship	O
down	O
in	O
a	O
surprising	O
manner	O
,	O
and	O
broke	O
the	O
mizen	O
gaff	O
just	O
where	O
the	O
sail	O
was	O
reefed	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
if	O
another	O
minute	O
had	O
passed	O
before	O
the	O
boat	O
had	O
been	O
got	O
in	O
,	O
we	O
must	O
inevitably	O
have	O
lost	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
every	O
foul	O
on	O
board	O
would	O
have	O
perished	O
.	O

This	O
wind	O
and	O
weather	O
continued	O
till	O
midnight	O
,	O
when	O
it	O
became	O
somewhat	O
more	O
moderate	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
set	O
our	O
courses	O
and	O
top-sails	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
I	O
had	O
enquired	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Gower	O
how	O
it	O
came	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
long	O
before	O
he	O
returned	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
after	O
he	O
had	O
got	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
he	O
intended	O
to	O
fill	O
the	O

three	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O

swum	O
ashore	O

them	O
for	O
that	O
purpose	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
within	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
,	O
the	O
surf	O
had	O
risen	O
so	O
high	O
,	O
and	O
broke	O
with	O
such	O
fury	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
get	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
:	O
that	O
being	O
unwilling	O
to	O
leave	O
them	O
behind	O
,	O
especially	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
stark	O
naked	O

that	O
an	O
opportunity	O
might	O
be	O
found	O
for	O
their	O
coming	O
on	O

that	O

by	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

the	O
uncommon	O
darkness	O
of	O

The	O

with	O

in	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
of	O
the	O
19th	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
satisfaction	O
to	O

them	O
on	O

and	O
to	O
hear	O
an	O
account	O

from	O
their	O
own	O
lips	O

As	O
long	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
light	O
they	O
flattered	O
themselves	O
,	O
like	O
their	O
friends	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
find	O
an	O
opportunity	O
to	O
return	O
on	O
board	O
her	O
;	O
but	O
afterwards	O
when	O
the	O
darkness	O
of	O
the	O
night	O
was	O
broken	O
only	O
by	O
the	O
flashes	O
of	O
lightning	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
tempest	O
became	O
every	O
moment	O
more	O
violent	O
,	O
they	O
knew	O
that	O
to	O
reach	O
the	O
boat	O
was	O
impossible	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
still	O
remained	O
in	O
its	O
station	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
most	O
probably	O
the	O
people	O
on	O

had	O
provided	O
for	O
their	O

safety	O
,	O
by	O
returning	O
on	O

the	O
ship	O
:	O
to	O

the	O
tent	O
of	O
their	O
ship-mates	O
,	O
during	O
the	O
darkness	O
and	O
tempest	O
,	O
was	O
equally	O
beyond	O
their	O
power	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
reduced	O
to	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
passing	O
such	O
a	O
night	O
,	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
place	O

without	O
the	O
least	O
defence	O
against	O
either	O
the	O
rain	O
or	O
the	O

which	O
now	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
severely	O

Necessity	O

said	O
to	O
be	O
ingenious	O

they	O

to	O
procure	O
a	O

in	O
this	O
situation	O
it	O
may	O
easily	O
be	O
believed	O
that	O
they	O
longed	O
most	O
ardently	O
for	O
the	O
dawn	O

and	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
it	O
appeared	O
they	O
set	O
out	O
for	O
the	O
tent	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
obliged	O
however	O
to	O
make	O
their	O
way	O
along	O
the	O
sea	O
shore	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
inland	O
country	O
was	O
impassable	O
;	O
nor	O
was	O
this	O
the	O
worst	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
frequently	O
stopped	O
by	O
high	O
steep	O
bluff	O
points	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
swim	O
round	O
at	O
a	O
considerable	O
distance	O
,	O
for	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
not	O
taken	O
a	O
compass	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
dashed	O
to	O
pieces	O
against	O
the	O
rocks	O
by	O
the	O
surf	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
every	O
moment	O
in	O
danger	O
of	O
being	O
devoured	O
by	O
a	O
shark	O
.	O

About	O
ten	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
they	O
reached	O
the	O
tents	O
,	O
almost	O
perished	O
with	O
hunger	O
and	O
cold	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
received	O
with	O
equal	O
surprise	O
and	O
joy	O
by	O
their	O
ship-mates	O
,	O
who	O
immediately	O
shared	O
with	O
them	O
such	O
provisions	O
and	O
clothes	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
orders	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
have	O
such	O
refreshments	O
as	O
were	O
proper	O
,	O
and	O
remain	O
in	O
their	O
hammocks	O
the	O
whole	O
night	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
they	O
were	O
as	O
hearty	O
as	O
if	O
nothing	O
had	O
happened	O
,	O
nor	O
did	O
they	O
suffer	O
any	O
farther	O
inconvenience	O
from	O
the	O

These	O
were	O
three	O
of	O
the	O
honest	O

who	O
had	O
swum	O
naked	O
from	O
the	O

I	O
now	O
return	O
to	O
my	O
narrative	O
in	O
the	O
order	O
of	O
time	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
18th	O
,	O
the	O
weather	O
was	O
moderate	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
we	O
were	O
within	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
of	O
the	O
anchoring-ground	O
from	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
driven	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
wind	O
suddenly	O
sailing	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
current	O
making	O
against	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
reach	O
it	O
:	O
we	O
took	O
advantage	O
however	O
of	O
being	O
so	O
near	O
the	O
waterer	O
's	O
tent	O
to	O
send	O
a	O
boat	O
on	O
shore	O
to	O
enquire	O
after	O
the	O
three	O
men	O
whose	O
adventure	O
has	O
been	O
just	O
related	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
after	O
she	O
brought	O
them	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

The	O
carpenters	O
were	O
all	O
this	O
time	O
employed	O
in	O
making	O
a	O
new	O
mizen-gaff	O
,	O
out	O
of	O
a	O
gib-boom	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
mean	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
make	O
shift	O
with	O
the	O
old	O
one	O
,	O
keeping	O
the	O
sail	O
balanced	O
.	O

It	O
continued	O
a	O
stark	O
calm	O
all	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
current	O
and	O
the	O
swell	O
had	O
driven	O
us	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
nine	O
miles	O
from	O
the	O
land	O
:	O
the	O
weather	O
however	O
being	O
good	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
the	O
cutter	O
for	O
a	O
load	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
which	O
she	O
brought	O
on	O
board	O
about	O
one	O
o'clock	O
.	O

Soon	O
after	O
a	O
breeze	O
sprung	O
up	O
at	O
N.N.W.	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
now	O
approached	O
the	O
land	O
very	O
fast	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
the	O
boat	O
on	O
shore	O
again	O
for	O
water	O
;	O
it	O
happened	O
however	O
that	O
before	O
we	O
could	O
reach	O
our	O
anchoring-ground	O
,	O
it	O
again	O
fell	O
calm	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
again	O
kept	O
off	O
by	O
the	O
current	O
:	O
the	O
boat	O
in	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
,	O
as	O
she	O
rowed	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
caught	O
as	O
much	O
fish	O
with	O
hook	O
and	O
line	O
as	O
served	O
all	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
some	O
alleviation	O
of	O
our	O
disappointment	O
.	O

At	O
eight	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
it	O
began	O
again	O
to	O
blow	O
hard	O
with	O
sudden	O
squalls	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
passed	O
another	O
toilsome	O
and	O
dangerous	O
night	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
having	O
a	O
stiff	O
gale	O
at	O
N.W.	O
we	O
made	O
towards	O
our	O
anchoring-ground	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
sail	O
we	O
could	O
spread	O
,	O
and	O
happily	O
regained	O
it	O
about	O
four	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
anchored	O
,	O
at	O
two	O
cables	O
'	O
length	O
from	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
in	O
eighteen	O
fathom	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
bottom	O
of	O
fine	O
sand	O
,	O
and	O
moored	O
with	O
a	O
small	O
anchor	O
in	O
shore	O
.	O

By	O
the	O
time	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
properly	O
secured	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
late	O
to	O
proceed	O
with	O
our	O
watering	O
;	O
the	O
long-boat	O
however	O
was	O
sent	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
to	O
fish	O
,	O
and	O
though	O
before	O
seven	O
o'clock	O
it	O
blew	O
so	O
hard	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
return	O
,	O
she	O
brought	O
fish	O
enough	O
on	O
board	O
to	O
serve	O
all	O
the	O
people	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
night	O
we	O
had	O
foul	O
weather	O
,	O
with	O
hard	O
squalls	O
and	O
much	O
rain	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
blowing	O
with	O
great	O
violence	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
we	O
frequently	O
drove	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
less	O
than	O
two	O
hundred	O
fathom	O
of	O
cable	O
out	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
bank	O
is	O
a	O
loose	O
fine	O
sand	O
that	O
easily	O
give	O
's	O
way	O

We	O
rode	O
out	O
the	O
storm	O
however	O
without	O
damage	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
rain	O
was	O
so	O
violent	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sea	O
ran	O
so	O
high	O
,	O
that	O
nothing	O
could	O
be	O
done	O
with	O
the	O
boats	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
more	O
mortifying	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
for	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
completing	O
our	O
watering	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
endured	O
almost	O
incessant	O
labour	O
for	O
five	O
days	O
and	O
nights	O
to	O
regain	O
the	O
situation	O
in	O
which	O
we	O
now	O
lay	O
.	O

About	O
eight	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
became	O
more	O
moderate	O
,	O
and	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
then	O
too	O
late	O
to	O
fetch	O
off	O
any	O
water	O
,	O
we	O
got	O
out	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
boats	O
,	O
and	O
sent	O
three	O
men	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
right	O
abreast	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
to	O
kill	O

for	O
burning	O
in	O
lamps	O
and	O
other	O
uses	O
on	O

the	O
ship	O

The	O
wind	O
blew	O
very	O
hard	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
had	O
done	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
but	O
being	O
at	O
W.N.W.	O
which	O
was	O
off	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
we	O
sent	O
the	O
boats	O
away	O
soon	O
after	O
it	O
was	O
light	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
ten	O
,	O
they	O
returned	O
with	O
each	O
of	O
them	O
a	O
load	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
pintado	O
birds	O
:	O
these	O
birds	O
they	O
got	O
from	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
who	O
told	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
when	O
a	O
gale	O
of	O
wind	O
happened	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
they	O
flew	O
faster	O
into	O
their	O
fire	O
than	O
they	O
could	O
well	O
take	O
them	O
out	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
during	O
the	O
gale	O
of	O
the	O
last	O
night	O
,	O
they	O
got	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
seven	O
hundred	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
boats	O
were	O
employed	O
in	O
getting	O
water	O
on	O
board	O
all	O
this	O
day	O
,	O
although	O
the	O
surf	O
was	O
so	O
great	O
that	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
casks	O
were	O
staved	O
and	O
lost	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
sent	O
out	O
again	O
a	O
little	O
before	O
it	O
was	O
light	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
seven	O
o'clock	O
a	O
few	O
casks	O
only	O
were	O
wanting	O
to	O
complete	O
our	O
stock	O
.	O

The	O
threatening	O
appearances	O
of	O
the	O
weather	O
made	O
me	O
now	O
very	O
impatient	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
casks	O
that	O
were	O
still	O
at	O
the	O
watering-place	O
;	O
as	O
soon	O
therefore	O
as	O
the	O
boats	O
were	O
cleared	O
of	O
their	O
loading	O
,	O
I	O
dispatched	O
them	O
again	O
,	O
with	O
orders	O
to	O
bring	O
off	O
all	O
the	O
hands	O
,	O
with	O
the	O

every	O
thing	O
else	O
that	O
was	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
possible	O
expedition	O
.	O

From	O
this	O
time	O
the	O
wind	O
increased	O
,	O
very	O
fast	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
eleven	O
o'clock	O
it	O
blew	O
so	O
hard	O
,	O
with	O
violent	O
gusts	O
from	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
began	O
to	O
drive	O
off	O
the	O
bank	O
;	O
we	O
heaved	O
the	O
small	O
anchor	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
it	O
in	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
;	O
the	O
gale	O
still	O
increased	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
right	O
off	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
no	O
pain	O
about	O
the	O
ship	O

which	O
continued	O
to	O
drive	O

still	O
dragging	O
the	O

through	O
the	O
sand	O
,	O
with	O
two	O
hundred	O
fathom	O
of	O
cable	O
out	O

for	O
being	O
very	O
solicitous	O
to	O
give	O
the	O

time	O
to	O
bring	O
all	O
on	O

before	O
we	O
were	O
quite	O
off	O
the	O

I	O
would	O
not	O

At	O
two	O
o'clock	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
the	O
anchor	O
was	O
quite	O
off	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
in	O
deep	O
water	O
;	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
therefore	O
obliged	O
to	O
bring	O
the	O
cable	O
to	O
the	O
capstern	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
great	O
difficulty	O
we	O
got	O
the	O
anchor	O
up	O

The	O
gusts	O
off	O
the	O

were	O
so	O
violent	O
that	O
,	O
not	O
daring	O
to	O
show	O
any	O
canvas	O
,	O
we	O
lay	O
to	O
under	O
our	O
bare	O
poles	O

the	O

was	O
frequently	O
torn	O
up	O

whirled	O
round	O
in	O
the	O

much	O
higher	O
than	O

As	O
the	O
ship	O
now	O
drove	O

the	O

a	O
great	O

on	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
great	O
pain	O
for	O
the	O
boats	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
,	O
besides	O
my	O
Lieutenant	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
eight	O
and	O
twenty	O
of	O
my	O
best	O
men	O
;	O
but	O
just	O
in	O
the	O
dusk	O
of	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
I	O
perceived	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
scudding	O
before	O
the	O
seas	O
and	O
making	O
towards	O
the	O
ship	O
:	O
this	O
proved	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
longboat	O
,	O
which	O
in	O
spight	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
efforts	O
of	O
those	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
forced	O
from	O
her	O
grappling	O
,	O
and	O
driven	O
off	O
the	O
land	O
.	O

We	O
took	O
the	O
best	O
opportunity	O
that	O
offered	O
to	O
get	O
her	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
but	O
notwithstanding	O
all	O
our	O
care	O
,	O
she	O
received	O
considerable	O
damage	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
hoisting	O
her	O
in	O
.	O

She	O
had	O
on	O
board	O
ten	O
of	O
my	O
people	O
,	O
who	O
informed	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
first	O
driven	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
some	O
fire	O
wood	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
throw	O
that	O
,	O
and	O
every	O
thing	O
else	O
,	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
to	O
lighten	O
the	O
boat	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
had	O
yet	O
seen	O
nothing	O
of	O
the	O
cutter	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
fear	O
that	O
she	O
also	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
tents	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
eighteen	O
people	O
,	O
besides	O
the	O
Lieutenant	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
driven	O
off	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
her	O
up	O
for	O
lost	O
;	O
knowing	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
now	O
at	O
hand	O
,	O
should	O
overtake	O
her	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
storm	O
she	O
must	O
inevitably	O
perish	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
however	O
possible	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
might	O
be	O
ashore	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
boat	O
should	O
be	O
lost	O
,	O
they	O
might	O
still	O
be	O
preserved	O
;	O
for	O
this	O
reason	O
,	O
I	O
determined	O
to	O
regain	O
the	O
land	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
possible	O
.	O

At	O
midnight	O
,	O
the	O
weather	O
became	O
more	O
moderate	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
carry	O
our	O
courses	O
and	O
topsails	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
four	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
we	O
crowded	O
all	O
the	O
sail	O
we	O
could	O
make	O
.	O

At	O
ten	O
o'clock	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
concern	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
nothing	O
of	O
the	O
cutter	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
continued	O
to	O
stand	O
on	O
till	O
about	O
noon	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
happily	O
discovered	O
her	O
at	O
a	O
grappling	O
,	O
close	O
under	O
the	O
land	O
:	O
we	O
immediately	O
ran	O
to	O
our	O
glasses	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
people	O
getting	O
into	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
three	O
o'clock	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
mutual	O
and	O
inexpressible	O
joy	O
,	O
she	O
came	O
safe	O
on	O
board	O
with	O
all	O
her	O
people	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
however	O
so	O
exhausted	O
with	O
fatigue	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
scarcely	O
get	O
up	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
side	O

The	O
Lieutenant	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
night	O
before	O
he	O
had	O
attempted	O
to	O
come	O
off	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
left	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
a	O
sudden	O
squall	O
so	O
nearly	O
filled	O
the	O
boat	O
with	O
water	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
very	O
near	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
bottom	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
all	O
hands	O
bailing	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
diligence	O
and	O
activity	O
,	O
they	O
happily	O
cleared	O
her	O
:	O
that	O
he	O
then	O
made	O
for	O
the	O
land	O
again	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
difficulty	O
,	O
he	O
regained	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
left	O
a	O
sufficient	O
number	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
to	O
watch	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
keep	O
her	O
free	O
from	O
water	O
,	O
he	O
with	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O

That	O
having	O
passed	O
the	O
night	O
in	O
a	O
state	O
of	O
inexpressible	O
anxiety	O
and	O
distress	O
,	O
they	O
looked	O
out	O
for	O
the	O
ship	O
with	O
the	O
first	O
dawn	O
of	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
seeing	O
nothing	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
concluded	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
perished	O
in	O
the	O
storm	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
exceeded	O
.	O

They	O
did	O
not	O
however	O
fit	O
down	O
torpid	O
in	O
despair	O
,	O
but	O
began	O
immediately	O
to	O
clear	O
the	O
ground	O
near	O
the	O
beach	O
of	O
brushes	O
and	O
weeds	O
,	O
and	O
cut	O
down	O
several	O
trees	O
of	O

they	O
made	O

to	O
assist	O
them	O
in	O
hauling	O
up	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
secure	O
her	O
;	O

as	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
hope	O
of	O

The	O

the	O

Soon	O
after	O
I	O
had	O
dispatched	O
the	O

on	O
this	O
expedition	O

I	O
sent	O
the	O

with	O
ten	O

on	O

,	O
well	O
armed	O
to	O
the	O

who	O
before	O
eight	O

brought	O
off	O
a	O

of	O
water	O

About	O
nine	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
her	O
off	O
again	O
,	O
but	O
soon	O
after	O
seeing	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
advancing	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
towards	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
the	O
men	O
landed	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
the	O
signal	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
return	O
,	O
not	O
knowing	O
to	O
what	O
number	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
exposed	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
no	O
boat	O
to	O
send	O
off	O
with	O
assistance	O
if	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
attacked	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
had	O
not	O
long	O
returned	O
on	O
board	O
;	O
when	O
we	O
saw	O
three	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
sit	O
down	O
under	O
the	O
trees	O
abreast	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O

As	O
they	O
continued	O
there	O
gazing	O
at	O
us	O
till	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
cutter	O
came	O
in	O
sight	O
,	O
not	O
caring	O
that	O
both	O
the	O
boats	O
should	O
be	O
absent	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
my	O
Lieutenant	O
in	O
the	O
longboat	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
few	O
beads	O
,	O
ribbons	O
,	O
and	O
trinkets	O
,	O
to	O
endeavour	O
to	O
establish	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
intercourse	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
their	O
means	O
with	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
;	O
these	O
men	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
before	O
the	O
boat	O
could	O
reach	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
quitted	O
their	O
station	O
,	O
and	O
proceeded	O
along	O
the	O
beach	O
.	O

As	O
the	O
trees	O
would	O
soon	O
prevent	O
their	O
being	O
seen	O
by	O
our	O
people	O
who	O
were	O
making	O
towards	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
we	O
kept	O
our	O
eyes	O
fixed	O
upon	O
them	O
from	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
soon	O
perceived	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
met	O
by	O
three	O
others	O
.	O

After	O
some	O
conversation	O
,	O
the	O
first	O
three	O
went	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
those	O
who	O
met	O
them	O
proceeded	O
towards	O
the	O
boat	O
with	O
a	O
hasty	O
pace	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
I	O
made	O
the	O
signal	O
to	O
the	O
Lieutenant	O
to	O
be	O
upon	O
his	O
guard	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
saw	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
observing	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
three	O
,	O
he	O
backed	O
the	O
boat	O
in	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
making	O
signs	O
of	O
friendship	O
,	O
held	O
up	O
to	O
them	O
the	O
beads	O
and	O
ribbons	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
given	O
him	O
as	O
presents	O
,	O
our	O
people	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
carefully	O
concealing	O
their	O
arms	O

The	O
Indians	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
taking	O
no	O
notice	O
of	O
the	O
beads	O
and	O
ribbons	O
,	O
resolutely	O
advanced	O
within	O
bow-shot	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
suddenly	O
discharged	O
their	O
arrows	O
,	O
which	O
happily	O
went	O
over	O
the	O
boat	O
without	O
doing	O
any	O
mischief	O
;	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
prepare	O
for	O
a	O
second	O
discharge	O
,	O
but	O
instantly	O
ran	O
away	O
into	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
people	O
discharged	O
some	O
musquets	O
after	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
wounded	O
by	O
the	O
shot	O

Soon	O
after	O
this	O
happened	O

the	O

the	O
first	O

the	O

,	O
with	O
three	O
arrows	O
sticking	O
in	O
his	O
body	O
.	O

No	O
other	O

was	O
necessary	O
to	O
convict	O
him	O
of	O
having	O
acted	O
contrary	O
to	O
my	O
orders	O
,	O
which	O
appeared	O
indeed	O
more	O
fully	O
from	O
his	O

account	O
of	O
the	O
matter	O
,	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
reasonable	O
to	O

was	O
as	O
favourable	O
to	O
himself	O

he	O
could	O

it	O

He	O
said	O

that	O

some	O

houses	O
with	O
only	O
five	O

six	O
of	O

he	O
came	O
to	O
a	O

and	O
veered	O
the	O

to	O
the	O

where	O
he	O
landed	O
with	O
four	O
men	O

armed	O
with	O
musquets	O

pistols	O
:	O
that	O
the	O
Indians	O
at	O
first	O
were	O
afraid	O
of	O
him	O

and	O
retired	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
soon	O
after	O
they	O
came	O
down	O
to	O
him	O

and	O
he	O
gave	O
them	O
some	O

trifles	O

with	O
which	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
much	O
pleased	O
:	O
that	O
he	O
then	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
them	O
for	O
some	O
cocoa-nuts	O

which	O
they	O
brought	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
great	O
appearance	O
of	O
friendship	O
and	O

,	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
broiled	O

some	O

:	O
that	O
he	O
then	O
proceeded	O
with	O
his	O

to	O
the	O

among	O
the	O

with	O

that	O

As	O
the	O
expedition	O
to	O
find	O
a	O
better	O
place	O
for	O
the	O
ship	O
had	O
issued	O
thus	O
unhappily	O

I	O
determined	O
to	O

what	O
could	O
be	O
done	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
lay	O
;	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
therefore	O
,	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
brought	O
down	O
by	O
the	O
stern	O

as	O
far	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
effect	O
it	O

only	O

was	O
in	O

caulked	O

as	O
far	O
down	O
as	O
he	O
could	O
come	O
at	O
the	O

;	O
and	O
though	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
quite	O
stop	O
the	O

he	O
very	O
much	O
reduced	O
it	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
a	O
fresh	O
gale	O
set	O
right	O
into	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
the	O
ship	O
ride	O
with	O
her	O
stern	O
very	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
observed	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
sculking	O
among	O
the	O
trees	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
who	O
probably	O
expected	O
that	O
the	O
wind	O
would	O
have	O
forced	O
the	O
ship	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
the	O
weather	O
being	O
fine	O
,	O
we	O
veered	O
the	O
ship	O
close	O
in	O
shore	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
spring	O
upon	O
our	O
cable	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
brought	O
our	O
broadside	O
to	O
bear	O
upon	O
the	O
watering-place	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
protection	O
of	O
the	O
boats	O
that	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
employed	O
there	O
.	O

As	O
there	O
was	O
reason	O
to	O
suppose	O
that	O
the	O
natives	O
whom	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
among	O
the	O
trees	O
the	O
night	O
before	O
,	O
were	O
not	O
now	O
far	O
distant	O
,	O
I	O
fired	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
shot	O
into	O
the	O
wood	O
,	O
before	O
I	O
sent	O
the	O
waterers	O
ashore	O
;	O
I	O
also	O
sent	O
the	O
Lieutenant	O
in	O
the	O
cutter	O
,	O
well	O
manned	O
and	O
armed	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
boat	O
that	O
carried	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
ordered	O
him	O
and	O
his	O
people	O
to	O
keep	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
lie	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O
to	O
cover	O
the	O
watering-boat	O
while	O
she	O
was	O
loading	O

and	O
to	O
keep	O
discharging	O
musquets	O
into	O
the	O
wood	O
on	O
each	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
party	O
that	O
were	O
filling	O
the	O
water	O

These	O
orders	O
were	O
well	O
executed	O
,	O
the	O
beach	O
was	O
steep	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
boats	O
could	O
lie	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
that	O
were	O
at	O
work	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Lieutenant	O
from	O
the	O
cutter	O
fired	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
vollies	O
of	O
small	O
arms	O
into	O
the	O
woods	O
before	O
any	O
of	O
the	O

went	O
on	O

and	O
none	O

the	O

the	O

went	O
to	O

But	O
notwithstanding	O
all	O
these	O
precautions	O
,	O
before	O
they	O

been	O
on	O
shore	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
a	O
flight	O
of	O
arrows	O
was	O
discharged	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
which	O
dangerously	O
wounded	O
a	O

that	O
was	O

in	O
the	O

and	O
another	O
stuck	O
into	O
a	O

on	O
which	O
Mr.	O
Pitcairn	O
was	O
sitting	O

The	O
people	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
cutter	O
immediately	O
fired	O
several	O
vollies	O
of	O
small	O
arms	O
into	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
wood	O
from	O
which	O
the	O
arrows	O
came	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
recalled	O
the	O

that	O
I	O
might	O
more	O

Indians	O
from	O
their	O
ambuscades	O
with	O

from	O
the	O

When	O
the	O
boats	O
and	O
people	O
were	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
fire	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
after	O
saw	O
about	O
two	O
hundred	O
men	O
rush	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
and	O
run	O
along	O
the	O
beach	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
precipitation	O

We	O
judged	O
the	O
coast	O
to	O
be	O
now	O
effectually	O
cleared	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
time	O
we	O
perceived	O
that	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
had	O
got	O
together	O
on	O
the	O
westermost	O
point	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
probably	O
thought	O
themselves	O
beyond	O
our	O
reach	O
:	O
to	O
convince	O
them	O
therefore	O
of	O
the	O
contrary	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
a	O
gun	O
to	O
be	O
fired	O
at	O
them	O
with	O
round	O
shot	O
;	O
the	O
ball	O
just	O
grazing	O
the	O
water	O
rose	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
fell	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
they	O
dispersed	O
with	O
great	O
hurry	O
and	O
confusion	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
saw	O
no	O
more	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
we	O
watered	O
without	O
any	O
farther	O
molestation	O
,	O
but	O
all	O
the	O
while	O
our	O
boats	O
were	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
precaution	O
to	O
keep	O
firing	O
the	O

into	O
the	O

on	O
both	O

which	O
lay	O
close	O

as	O
she	O
did	O
before	O

As	O
we	O
saw	O
none	O
of	O
the	O

all	O
this	O

we	O
should	O
have	O
thought	O
that	O
none	O

had	O
ventured	O
back	O
into	O

small	O
island	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
called	O
PORTLAND	PNM
S	PNM
ISLAND	PNM
.	O

On	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
of	O
this	O
island	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
reef	O
of	O
rocks	O
that	O
runs	O
to	O
the	O
main	O
,	O
the	O
passage	O
into	O
the	O
harbour	O
therefore	O
is	O
on	O
the	O
east	O

of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
runs	O
in	O
and	O
out	O
E.N.E.	O
and	O
W.S.W.	O
:	O
it	O
is	O
about	O
two	O
cables	O
'	O
length	O
wide	O
,	O
and	O
has	O
about	O
eight	O
fathom	O
water	O
.	O

I	O
believe	O
the	O
harbour	O
within	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
good	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
ship	O
would	O
be	O
obliged	O
to	O
warp	O
both	O
in	O
and	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
after	O
all	O
be	O
in	O
danger	O
of	O
an	O
attack	O
by	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
who	O
are	O
bold	O
even	O
to	O
temerity	O
,	O
and	O
have	O
a	O
perseverance	O
which	O
is	O
not	O
common	O
among	O
undisciplined	O
savages	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
ground	O
with	O
fifty	O

About	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
miles	O
west	O
from	O
Portlands	PNM
Island	PNM
,	O
is	O
a	O
fine	O
,	O
small	O
,	O
round	O
harbour	O
,	O
just	O
big	O
enough	O
to	O
receive	O
three	O
ships	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
called	O
BYRON	PNM
S	PNM
HARBOUR	PNM

When	O
we	O
were	O
abreast	O

the	O

it	O

Our	O
boat	O
entered	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
two	O
runs	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
one	O
fresh	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
salt	O
;	O
by	O
the	O
run	O
of	O
salt	O
water	O
we	O
judged	O
that	O
it	O
had	O
a	O
communication	O
with	O
Carlisle	O
Harbour	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
proceeded	O
about	O
three	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
harbour	O
,	O
we	O
opened	O
the	O
bay	O
where	O
the	O
cutter	O
had	O
been	O
attacked	O
by	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
to	O
which	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
reason	O
,	O
we	O
gave	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
BLOODY	PNM
BAY	PNM

In	O
this	O
Bay	O
is	O
a	O
small	O
rivulet	O
of	O
fresh	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
here	O
we	O
saw	O
many	O
houses	O
regularly	O
built	O
:	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
water-side	O
stood	O
one	O
much	O
longer	O
than	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
rest	O

which	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
common-hall	O
,	O
or	O
council-house	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
neatly	O
built	O
and	O
thatched	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
building	O
in	O
which	O
our	O
people	O
had	O
been	O
received	O
who	O
were	O
on	O
shore	O
here	O
with	O
the	O
Master	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
both	O
the	O
sides	O
and	O
floor	O
were	O
lined	O
with	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
fine	O
matting	O

and	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
arrows	O

made	O
up	O
into	O
bundles	O

were	O
hung	O
up	O
in	O
it	O
ready	O

They	O
told	O
me	O
also	O
,	O
that	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
there	O
were	O
many	O
gardens	O

or	O

which	O
were	O
enclosed	O
by	O
a	O

the	O

from	O

in	O

About	O
three	O
miles	O
to	O
the	O

of	O
this	O

we	O
saw	O
another	O

in	O
the	O

of	O
which	O
,	O
next	O
to	O
the	O
water-side	O

there	O
was	O
a	O

about	O
four	O

not	O
in	O
a	O

but	O
in	O
angles	O

like	O
a	O
fortification	O
;	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
great	O
reason	O
to	O
suppose	O

from	O
the	O
weapons	O
of	O
these	O
people	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
military	O

which	O
must	O
in	O
great	O
measure	O
be	O
the	O
effect	O
of	O

that	O
they	O
have	O

As	O
we	O
proceeded	O
westward	O
from	O
this	O

we	O
found	O

at	O
the	O

Upon	O

of	O
this	O

from	O
the	O

at	O
the	O
entrance	O

at	O

an	O

came	O
out	O

Upon	O
this	O

we	O

a	O
large	O
canoe	O

with	O
an	O
awning	O

built	O
over	O

a	O

here	O
also	O
the	O

was	O
passing	O

performed	O
the	O

of	O

After	O
a	O
little	O
time	O
they	O
launched	O
several	O
canoes	O

and	O
made	O
towards	O
us	O
;	O
upon	O

we	O
lay	O
to	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
time	O
to	O

we	O

should	O
prevail	O
upon	O

to	O
come	O
on	O

when	O

came	O
near	O
enough	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
more	O

view	O
of	O
us	O

they	O
lay	O
upon	O
their	O

but	O
seemed	O
to	O
have	O
no	O

therefore	O
we	O
made	O

About	O
half	O
a	O

From	O

therefore	O
sent	O

we	O
continued	O
to	O
stand	O
along	O

We	O
sent	O
a	O

I	O
therefore	O
ordered	O

notwithstanding	O

when	O
I	O
sailed	O
from	O

into	O
any	O
gulph	O

our	O

was	O

About	O
eight	O

in	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
22d	O

fell	O
into	O

we	O
instantly	O
threw	O
overboard	O
the	O
canoe	O

we	O
had	O
seized	O
at	O
Gowers	PNM
island	O

brought	O
the	O

hoisted	O
out	O

sunk	O
at	O

We	O
took	O
the	O

on	O

In	O
the	O
night	O
of	O
Monday	O
the	O
24th	O
,	O
we	O
fell	O
in	O
with	O
nine	O

they	O
stretch	O
nearly	O
N.W.	O
by	O

according	O
to	O
the	O

I	O
imagine	O
these	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
islands	O
which	O
are	O
called	O
Ohang	PNM
Java	PNM
,	O
and	O
were	O
discovered	O
by	O

;	O
for	O
the	O
situation	O
answers	O
very	O
nearly	O
to	O
their	O
place	O
in	O
the	O

in	O
the	O

The	O

I	O
believe	O
had	O
never	O

by	O
an	O

There	O
is	O
certainly	O
much	O
land	O
in	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
ocean	O
not	O
yet	O
known	O

One	O
of	O
these	O
islands	O
is	O
of	O
considerable	O
extent	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
eight	O
are	O
scarcely	O
better	O
than	O
large	O
rocks	O
;	O
but	O
though	O
they	O
are	O
low	O

,	O
they	O
are	O
well	O
covered	O
with	O
wood	O
,	O
and	O
abound	O
with	O
inhabitants	O

The	O
people	O
are	O
black	O
,	O
and	O
woolly-headed	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
Negroes	O
of	O
Africa	PNM
:	O
their	O
weapons	O
are	O
bows	O
and	O
arrows	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
have	O
large	O
canoes	O
which	O
they	O
navigate	O
with	O
a	O
sail	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
which	O
came	O
near	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
would	O
not	O
venture	O
on	O
board	O

We	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
of	O
these	O
islands	O
,	O
and	O
steered	O
W.	O
by	O
S.	O
with	O
a	O
strong	O
south	O

At	O
eleven	O
o'clock	O
at	O
night	O
,	O
we	O
fell	O
in	O
with	O
another	O
island	O
of	O
a	O
considerable	O

,	O
flat	O
,	O
green	O

and	O
of	O
a	O
pleasant	O
appearance	O
;	O
we	O
saw	O
none	O
of	O
its	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
appeared	O
by	O
the	O
many	O
fires	O
which	O
we	O
saw	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
to	O
be	O
well	O
peopled	O

It	O
lies	O
in	O
latitude	O

fifteen	O

and	O
we	O
called	O

SIR	O
CHARLES	O
HARDY	O
S	O
ISLAND	O
.	O

At	O
day-break	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
we	O
discovered	O
another	O
large	O
high	O
island	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
rising	O
in	O
three	O
considerable	O
hills	O
,	O
had	O
,	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
three	O
islands	O
.	O

We	O
gave	O
it	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
WINCHELSEA	PNM
S	PNM
ISLAND	PNM
;	O
it	O
is	O
distant	O
from	O
Sir	O
Charles	O

about	O
ten	O
leagues	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
direction	O
of	O
S.	O
by	O

We	O
had	O
here	O
the	O
wind	O
squally	O
,	O
with	O
unsettled	O
weather	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
very	O
strong	O
westerly	O
current	O
.	O

About	O
ten	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
of	O
the	O
26th	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
another	O
large	O
island	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
same	O
that	O
was	O
discovered	O
by	O
Schouten	O
,	O
and	O
called	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Saint	PNM
John	PNM
.	O

Soon	O
after	O
we	O
saw	O
high	O
land	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
,	O
which	O
proved	O
to	O
be	O
Nova	PNM
Britannia	PNM
,	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
approached	O
it	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
very	O
strong	O
S.S.	O
westerly	O
current	O
,	O
setting	O
at	O
the	O
rate	O
of	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
thirty-two	O
miles	O
a	O
day	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
having	O
only	O
light	O
winds	O
,	O
a	O
north	O
westerly	O
current	O
set	O
us	O
into	O
a	O
deep	O
bay	O
or	O
gulph	O
,	O
which	O
proved	O
to	O
be	O
that	O
which	O
Dampier	O
has	O
distinguished	O
by	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
Saint	PNM
Georges	PNM
Bay	PNM
.	O

On	O
the	O
28th	O
,	O
we	O
anchored	O
in	O
a	O
bay	O
near	O
a	O
little	O
island	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
about	O
three	O
leagues	O
to	O
the	O
N.W.	O
of	O
Cape	PNM
Saint	PNM
George	PNM
,	O
which	O
was	O
called	O
WALLIS	PNM
S	PNM
ISLAND	PNM
.	O

I	O
found	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
this	O
Cape	O
to	O
be	O
about	O
5	O

S.	O
and	O
its	O
longitude	O
by	O

152	O

which	O
is	O
about	O
two	O
thousand	O
five	O

due	O
west	O

the	O

and	O
about	O
one	O

an	O

its	O
place	O
in	O
the	O
French	O
chart	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
just	O
mentioned	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
I	O
sent	O
the	O
cutter	O
to	O
examine	O
the	O
coast	O

and	O
the	O
other	O
boat	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
cocoa-nuts	O
,	O
and	O

The	O
people	O
in	O
this	O
boat	O
caught	O
no	O
fish	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
brought	O
on	O
board	O
about	O
an	O
hundred	O

fifty	O
cocoa-nuts	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
distributed	O
to	O
the	O
men	O
at	O
the	O

discretion	O

We	O
had	O
seen	O
some	O
turtle	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
coming	O
into	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
and	O
hoping	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
might	O
repair	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
especially	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
sandy	O

and	O
uninhabited	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
places	O

I	O
sent	O
a	O
few	O

on	O

they	O
returned	O

we	O
now	O

with	O
the	O

strength	O
of	O
our	O

this	O
was	O
an	O
alarming	O
proof	O
of	O
our	O
debility	O

and	O
with	O
heavy	O

we	O
had	O
recourse	O
to	O
an	O
additional	O
purchase	O
;	O
with	O
this	O
assistance	O

and	O
our	O

we	O
got	O
the	O

casting	O
in	O

it	O
almost	O

Our	O

was	O
now	O
to	O
begin	O
again	O

and	O
though	O
all	O

that	O

we	O
were	O
not	O

we	O
were	O

it	O

at	O
this	O

we	O

we	O
much	O
wanted	O

We	O
therefore	O
,	O
with	O
whatever	O
reluctance	O

desisted	O
for	O
the	O

and	O
the	O

having	O
a	O
little	O
recruited	O
our	O

we	O
were	O
more	O
successful	O
;	O
we	O
got	O
the	O

up	O

we	O
found	O
it	O
so	O

as	O
to	O

the	O

From	O
this	O

about	O
three	O

we	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
catch	O
very	O
little	O
;	O
a	O
misfortune	O
which	O
was	O
probably	O
owing	O
in	O

to	O
the	O

the	O

in	O

to	O
the	O

perhaps	O
in	O

notwithstanding	O

at	O

We	O
saw	O
a	O

were	O
so	O
shy	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
catch	O
one	O

them	O
;	O
here	O
therefore	O

these	O

perhaps	O
that	O
is	O
owing	O

that	O

the	O

which	O
now	O

was	O
of	O
such	O
importance	O
to	O
the	O

that	O
I	O
determined	O
to	O
go	O
into	O

early	O

and	O
at	O
very	O
little	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O

Here	O
we	O
procured	O
above	O
a	O
thousand	O
cocoa-nuts	O

as	O
many	O
of	O
the	O

as	O
we	O
could	O
use	O

they	O
were	O

I	O
would	O
have	O
staid	O

all	O
the	O

the	O

There	O
was	O
too	O
much	O
reason	O
to	O
suppose	O
that	O
the	O

depended	O
upon	O
our	O

for	O
any	O

to	O
have	O
gone	O
three	O
times	O
the	O
distance	O

I	O
knew	O
it	O
was	O
scarcely	O
sufficient	O
for	O
the	O
Swallow	O
in	O
her	O
present	O
condition	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
obliged	O
to	O
continue	O
here	O
another	O
season	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
probably	O
become	O
impossible	O
to	O
navigate	O
her	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
especially	O
as	O
she	O
had	O
but	O
a	O
single	O
sheathing	O

and	O
her	O
bottom	O
was	O
not	O
filled	O

so	O
that	O
the	O

would	O

that	O
our	O

I	O
therefore	O
weighed	O

at	O

fifty	O

on	O

none	O

it	O

it	O
had	O
some	O

the	O

is	O

were	O

They	O
were	O

long	O
sticks	O

we	O

they	O

near	O
enough	O
to	O

made	O

several	O

we	O
could	O
not	O
perfectly	O

repeated	O

as	O
near	O

we	O
could	O
,	O
to	O
shew	O
that	O
whatever	O
they	O
meant	O
to	O
us	O
we	O
meant	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
the	O
better	O
to	O
bespeak	O
their	O
good-will	O
,	O
and	O
invite	O
them	O
on	O

we	O
held	O
up	O
to	O
them	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
few	O
trifles	O
we	O
had	O
:	O
upon	O
this	O
they	O
drew	O
nearer	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
flattered	O
myself	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
coming	O
on	O
board	O
;	O
but	O
on	O
the	O
contrary	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
came	O
within	O

of	O

they	O
threw	O
their	O

with	O
great	O
force	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
stood	O
thickest	O
upon	O

As	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
better	O
to	O
prevent	O
than	O
to	O
repress	O
a	O
general	O
attack	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
number	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
,	O
the	O
mischief	O
would	O
be	O
greater	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
now	O
no	O
doubt	O
of	O
their	O
hostile	O
intentions	O
,	O
I	O
fired	O
some	O
muskets	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
swivel	O
guns	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
being	O
killed	O
or	O
wounded	O
,	O
they	O
rowed	O
off	O

joined	O
the	O

of	O

there	O
were	O
twelve	O

fourteen	O

I	O
then	O
brought	O

for	O
the	O

had	O
the	O

made	O
for	O

that	O
I	O
might	O
still	O
farther	O
intimidate	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
more	O
effectually	O
prevent	O
their	O
return	O
,	O
I	O
fired	O
a	O
round	O
shot	O
from	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
six-pounders	O
,	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
fall	O
into	O
the	O

this	O
seemed	O
to	O
have	O
a	O

for	O

used	O
their	O

nimbly	O

hoisted	O

still	O
standing	O
towards	O
the	O

Soon	O
after	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
several	O
more	O

put	O
off	O
from	O

them	O

them	O

our	O

was	O
to	O
no	O

as	O
they	O
came	O

they	O

in	O
a	O

,	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
did	O
us	O
no	O

We	O
returned	O
the	O

by	O

some	O

one	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O

was	O
deserted	O

we	O
got	O
out	O
our	O

brought	O
it	O
on	O

it	O
was	O
full	O

out	O

it	O
had	O
a	O

was	O

from	O
every	O

either	O
before	O

it	O
was	O

but	O
much	O
better	O
boiled	O
,	O
or	O
roasted	O
in	O
the	O

we	O
found	O
also	O
two	O
large	O

with	O

From	O
the	O
contents	O
of	O
this	O

we	O
judged	O
that	O
it	O
had	O

we	O
observed	O
that	O

When	O

were	O
the	O

that	O

on	O
the	O

with	O

chew	O

which	O
they	O
wear	O
round	O
their	O

they	O
were	O
also	O
powdered	O

I	O
did	O

Having	O
disengaged	O
ourselves	O
from	O

we	O
pursued	O
our	O

I	O
called	O
them	O
the	O
ADMIRALTY	O

and	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
glad	O
to	O

be	O
more	O

than	O
to	O

On	O

we	O

to	O
be	O
three	O

;	O
and	O
before	O
it	O

dark	O

we	O
got	O
pretty	O

Several	O
canoes	O

came	O

with	O
the	O
natives	O

who	O
,	O
after	O

came	O
on	O

without	O

:	O
they	O
had	O
nothing	O
with	O
them	O
but	O
a	O
few	O
cocoa-nuts	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
sold	O
with	O
great	O
joy	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
pieces	O
of	O
an	O
iron	O
hoop	O
;	O
we	O
soon	O
found	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
unacquainted	O
with	O
:	O
that	O
metal	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
called	O
Parram	PNM
,	O
and	O
they	O
made	O
us	O
understand	O
,	O
by	O
signs	O
,	O
that	O
a	O
ship	O
like	O
ours	O
sometimes	O
touched	O
at	O
their	O
islands	O
for	O
refreshment	O
.	O

I	O
gave	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
three	O
pieces	O
of	O
an	O
old	O
iron	O
hoop	O
,	O
each	O
about	O
four	O
inches	O
long	O
,	O
which	O
threw	O
him	O
into	O
an	O
extasy	O
little	O
short	O
of	O
distraction	O
:	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
but	O
sympathize	O
in	O
his	O
joy	O
,	O
nor	O
observe	O
,	O
without	O
great	O

the	O

and	O
extravagance	O
of	O

,	O
by	O
which	O
it	O
was	O
expressed	O

All	O
these	O
people	O
indeed	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
fond	O
of	O
iron	O
than	O
any	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
,	O
that	O
for	O
iron	O
tools	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
purchased	O
every	O
thing	O
upon	O
the	O
islands	O
which	O
we	O
could	O
have	O
brought	O
away	O

They	O

the	O
first	O
of	O
that	O

with	O
fine	O
long	O
black	O
hair	O
,	O
and	O
little	O

,	O
for	O

observed	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
continually	O
plucking	O
the	O
hair	O
from	O
their	O
chin	O
and	O
upper	O

by	O
the	O

Their	O
features	O
are	O
pleasing	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
teeth	O
remarkably	O
white	O
and	O
even	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
of	O
the	O
common	O

but	O
nimble	O
,	O
vigorous	O
,	O
and	O
active	O
in	O
a	O

running	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
mast-head	O
much	O
faster	O
than	O
our	O
own	O
people	O

Their	O
disposition	O
was	O
free	O
and	O
open	O
,	O
they	O
eat	O
and	O
drank	O
whatever	O
was	O
given	O
them	O
,	O
went	O
without	O
hesitation	O
into	O
every	O

the	O

,	O
and	O
were	O
as	O
familiar	O

merry	O
with	O
the	O
crew	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
of	O
long	O
and	O
intimate	O

They	O
were	O
not	O

that	O
we	O
had	O
visited	O

quite	O

though	O
they	O
had	O
only	O
a	O
slight	O
covering	O
for	O

waist	O
,	O
which	O
consisted	O
of	O
a	O
narrow	O
piece	O
of	O
fine	O

Their	O
canoes	O
were	O
very	O
well	O

neatly	O
made	O

having	O
a	O
hollow	O
tree	O
for	O

an	O
outrigger	O
:	O
their	O
ropes	O
and	O

were	O
also	O
very	O
good	O

They	O
urged	O
us	O
strongly	O
to	O
go	O
on	O

,	O
offering	O
to	O
leave	O
an	O
equal	O

their	O

behind	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
pledge	O
of	O
their	O
safe	O
return	O
;	O
and	O
indeed	O
I	O
would	O
gladly	O
have	O
consented	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
my	O
power	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
strong	O
westerly	O
current	O
hurried	O
me	O
to	O
so	O
great	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
opportunity	O
to	O
seek	O
for	O
anchorage	O
,	O
and	O
night	O
coming	O
on	O

we	O
pursued	O
our	O
course	O

When	O
our	O

perceived	O
this	O

of	O

I	O
did	O
not	O

him	O
ashore	O

but	O
indulged	O
him	O
in	O
his	O
desire	O

we	O
learnt	O
from	O
him	O
that	O
there	O
were	O

It	O
was	O
with	O

not	O

we	O

the	O

I	O
then	O
found	O
the	O

effect	O
of	O
the	O

had	O

We	O
now	O
knew	O
that	O
the	O
land	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
was	O
the	O
north	O
east	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Mindanao	PNM
:	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
many	O
sick	O
people	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
pressing	O
need	O
of	O
refreshments	O
,	O
I	O
determined	O
to	O
try	O
what	O
could	O
be	O
procured	O
in	O
a	O
bay	O
which	O
Dampier	O
has	O
described	O
as	O
lying	O
on	O
the	O
south	O
east	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
,	O
he	O
says	O
,	O
furnished	O
him	O
with	O
great	O
plenty	O
of	O
deer	O
from	O
a	O
savannah	O
.	O

I	O
therefore	O
coasted	O
that	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
sure	O
not	O
to	O
miss	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
out	O
the	O
Lieutenant	O
with	O
the	O
boat	O
and	O
a	O
proper	O
number	O
of	O
hands	O
,	O
to	O
keep	O
in	O
shore	O
ahead	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

No	O
such	O
bay	O
however	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
,	O
but	O
at	O
the	O
very	O
southermost	O
extremity	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
they	O
opened	O
a	O
little	O
nook	O
at	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
town	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
fort	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
our	O
boat	O
was	O
discovered	O
by	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
they	O
fired	O
a	O
great	O
gun	O
,	O
and	O
sent	O
off	O
three	O
boats	O
or	O
canoes	O
full	O
of	O
people	O
.	O

As	O
the	O
Lieutenant	O
had	O
not	O
a	O
sufficient	O
force	O
to	O
oppose	O
them	O
,	O
he	O
immediately	O
made	O
towards	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
canoes	O
chaced	O
him	O
till	O
they	O
came	O
within	O
fight	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
then	O
over-matched	O
in	O
their	O
turn	O
,	O
they	O
thought	O
fit	O
to	O
go	O
back	O

thus	O
disappointed	O
in	O
my	O

on	O

came	O
to	O
an	O

in	O
a	O

having	O
a	O

of	O

Before	O
it	O
was	O
dark	O
the	O
same	O
day	O
,	O
our	O
two	O
boats	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
off	O
their	O
loads	O
of	O
water	O
:	O
they	O
saw	O
no	O
signs	O
of	O
inhabitants	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
observed	O
a	O
canoe	O
come	O
round	O
the	O
westermost	O
point	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
supposed	O
had	O
been	O
dispatched	O
from	O
the	O
town	O
,	O
to	O
learn	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
or	O
at	O
least	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
doing	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
discovered	O
this	O
canoe	O
,	O
I	O
hoisted	O
English	O
colours	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
not	O
without	O
hope	O
that	O
she	O
would	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
but	O
after	O
viewing	O
us	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
she	O
returned	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
no	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
nor	O
any	O
signs	O
of	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
got	O
our	O
water	O
,	O
I	O
intended	O
to	O
procure	O
a	O
further	O
supply	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
from	O
the	O
fame	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
endeavour	O
also	O
to	O
recruit	O
our	O
wood	O
;	O
but	O
about	O
nine	O
o'clock	O
at	O
night	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
suddenly	O
surprised	O
by	O
a	O
loud	O
noise	O
on	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
shore	O
which	O
was	O
abreast	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
:	O
it	O
was	O
made	O
by	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
human	O
voices	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
much	O
resembled	O
the	O
war-whoop	O
of	O
the	O
American	O
Savages	O
,	O
a	O
hideous	O
shout	O
which	O
they	O
give	O
at	O
the	O
moment	O
of	O
their	O
attack	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
which	O
all	O
who	O
have	O
heard	O
it	O
agree	O
there	O
is	O
something	O
inexpressibly	O
terrifying	O
and	O
horrid	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
was	O
now	O
farther	O
convinced	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
necessary	O
to	O
dispose	O
of	O
our	O
little	O
force	O
to	O
the	O
greatest	O
advantage	O
,	O
we	O
began	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
by	O
getting	O
the	O
guns	O
up	O
from	O
the	O
hold	O
,	O
and	O
making	O
the	O
necessary	O
repairs	O
to	O
our	O
rigging	O
.	O

At	O
eleven	O
o'clock	O
,	O
not	O
having	O
seen	O
any	O
thing	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
terrify	O
us	O
by	O
their	O
yells	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
the	O
longboat	O
on	O
shore	O
for	O
more	O
water	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
probable	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
concealed	O
,	O
themselves	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
I	O
kept	O
the	O
cutter	O
manned	O
and	O
armed	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
Lieutenant	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
that	O
immediate	O
succour	O
might	O
be	O
sent	O
to	O
the	O
waterers	O
,	O
if	O
any	O
danger	O
should	O
threaten	O
them	O
.	O

It	O
soon	O
appeared	O
that	O
my	O
conjectures	O
were	O
well	O
sounded	O
;	O
for	O
our	O
people	O
had	O
no	O
sooner	O
left	O
their	O
boat	O
,	O
than	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
armed	O
men	O
rushed	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
whom	O
held	O
up	O
somewhat	O
white	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
took	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
signal	O
of	O
peace	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
occasion	O
I	O
was	O
again	O
sensible	O
of	O
the	O
mortifying	O
deficiency	O
in	O
the	O
ships	O
equipment	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
so	O
often	O
experienced	O
before	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
,	O
no	O
white	O
flag	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
as	O
the	O
best	O
expedient	O
in	O
my	O
power	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
Lieutenant	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
sent	O
on	O
shore	O
in	O
the	O
cutter	O
,	O
to	O
display	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
tablecloths	O
:	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
officer	O
landed	O
,	O
the	O
standard-bearer	O
and	O
another	O
came	O
down	O
to	O
him	O
unarmed	O
,	O
and	O
received	O
him	O
with	O
great	O
appearance	O
of	O
friendship	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
them	O
addressed	O
him	O
in	O
Dutch	O
,	O
which	O
none	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
understood	O
;	O
he	O
then	O
spoke	O
a	O
few	O
words	O
in	O
Spanish	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
persons	O
of	O
the	O
cutter	O
was	O
a	O
considerable	O
proficient	O
:	O
the	O
Indian	O
however	O
spoke	O
it	O
so	O
very	O
imperfectly	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
with	O
great	O
difficulty	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
many	O
signs	O
,	O
be	O
made	O
himself	O
understood	O
;	O
possibly	O
if	O
any	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
had	O
spoken	O
Dutch	O
,	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
found	O
equally	O
deficient	O
in	O
that	O
language	O
.	O

He	O
asked	O
for	O
the	O
Captain	O
however	O
by	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
the	O
skipper	O
,	O
and	O
enquired	O
whether	O
we	O
were	O
Hollanders	O
;	O
whether	O
our	O
ship	O
was	O
intended	O
for	O
merchandize	O
or	O
for	O
war	O
;	O
how	O
many	O
guns	O
and	O
men	O
she	O
carried	O
;	O
and	O
whether	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
,	O
or	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
Batavia	PNM
.	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
satisfied	O
him	O
in	O
all	O
these	O
particulars	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
town	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
introduce	O
us	O
to	O
the	O
Governor	O
,	O
whom	O
he	O
distinguished	O
by	O
the	O
title	O
of	O
Raja	PNM
.	O

The	O
Lieutenant	O
then	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
intended	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
town	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
immediate	O
want	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
desired	O
permission	O
to	O
fill	O
some	O
casks	O
;	O
he	O
also	O
requested	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
were	O
armed	O
with	O
bows	O
and	O
arrows	O
might	O
be	O
ordered	O
to	O
a	O
greater	O
distance	O
.	O

With	O
both	O
there	O
requisitions	O
the	O
Indian	O
,	O
who	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
invested	O
with	O
considerable	O
authority	O
,	O
complied	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
he	O
seemed	O
to	O
take	O
particular	O
notice	O
of	O
a	O
silk	O
handkerchief	O
which	O
the	O
Lieutenant	O
had	O
tied	O
round	O
his	O
neck	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
immediately	O
presented	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
in	O
return	O
for	O
which	O
he	O
desired	O
him	O
to	O
accept	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
cravat	O
,	O
made	O
of	O
coarse	O
callico	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
tied	O
round	O
his	O
own	O
,	O
his	O
dress	O
being	O
somewhat	O
after	O
the	O
Dutch	O
fashion	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
interchange	O
of	O
cravats	O
,	O
he	O
enquired	O
of	O
the	O
officer	O
whether	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
furnished	O
with	O
any	O
articles	O
for	O
trade	O
;	O
to	O
which	O
he	O
answered	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
sufficiently	O
furnished	O
to	O
trade	O
for	O
provisions	O
,	O
but	O
nothing	O
more	O
:	O
the	O
Chief	O
replied	O
,	O
that	O
whatever	O
we	O
wanted	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
conference	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
considered	O
as	O
an	O
earnest	O
of	O
every	O
advantage	O
which	O
this	O
place	O
could	O
afford	O
us	O
,	O
the	O
boats	O
returned	O
on	O
board	O
laden	O
with	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
went	O
cheerfully	O
on	O
with	O
our	O
business	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

In	O
about	O
two	O
hours	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
,	O
with	O
equal	O
surprise	O
and	O
concern	O
,	O
many	O
hundreds	O
of	O
armed	O
men	O
,	O
posting	O
themselves	O
in	O
parties	O
at	O
different	O
places	O
among	O
the	O
trees	O
,	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
abreast	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
their	O
weapons	O
were	O
musquets	O
,	O
bows	O
and	O
arrows	O
,	O
long	O

or	O
spears	O
,	O
broad	O

,	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
hanger	O
called	O
a	O
cress	O
,	O
and	O
targets	O
:	O
we	O
observed	O
also	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
hauled	O
a	O
canoe	O
,	O
which	O
lay	O
under	O
a	O
shed	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
up	O
into	O
the	O

These	O
were	O
not	O

appearances	O

and	O
they	O
were	O
succeeded	O
by	O
others	O
that	O
were	O
still	O

;	O
for	O
these	O

we	O
got	O

before	O

,	O
being	O

I	O
determined	O

to	O
get	O
another	O

with	O

on	O

the	O
reason	O

unaccountable	O
a	O
change	O
of	O

The	O
Lieutenant	O
therefore	O
was	O
again	O
dispatched	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
a	O
testimony	O
that	O
our	O
disposition	O
was	O
still	O
peaceable	O
,	O
the	O
tablecloth	O
was	O
again	O
displayed	O
as	O
a	O
flag	O
of	O

.	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
precaution	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
to	O
order	O
the	O
boat	O
to	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
beach	O
which	O
was	O
clear	O
of	O
wood	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
board	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
liable	O
to	O
mischief	O
from	O
enemies	O
whom	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
see	O
;	O
I	O
also	O
ordered	O
that	O
nobody	O
should	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
Indians	O
saw	O
the	O
boat	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
and	O
observed	O
that	O
nobody	O
landed	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
came	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
wood	O
with	O
a	O
bow	O
and	O
arrows	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
signs	O
for	O
the	O
boat	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
he	O
stood	O
.	O

This	O
the	O
officer	O
very	O
prudently	O
declined	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
would	O
then	O
have	O
been	O
within	O
bow-shot	O
of	O
an	O
ambuscade	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
waiting	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
finding	O
that	O
a	O
conference	O
could	O
be	O
procured	O
upon	O
no	O
other	O

,	O
he	O
returned	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
certainly	O
in	O
my	O
power	O
to	O
have	O
destroyed	O
many	O
of	O
these	O
unfriendly	O
people	O
,	O
by	O
firing	O
my	O
great	O
guns	O
into	O
the	O
wood	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
answered	O
no	O
good	O
purpose	O
:	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
afterwards	O
have	O
procured	O
wood	O
and	O
water	O
here	O
without	O
risking	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
our	O
own	O
people	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
still	O
hoped	O
that	O
refreshment	O
might	O
be	O
procured	O
upon	O
friendly	O
terms	O
at	O
the	O
town	O

I	O
was	O
in	O

I	O

betweeen	O

a	O

and	O
which	O
for	O
that	O
reason	O
I	O
called	O
HUMMOCK	PNM
ISLAND	PNM

All	O
this	O

is	O
very	O
high	O

one	O

so	O
that	O
at	O
a	O

it	O
appears	O
not	O

several	O

After	O
our	O
first	O
discovery	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
we	O
kept	O
turning	O

and	O
as	O
we	O
approached	O
the	O
land	O

we	O
stood	O
in	O
for	O
an	O
opening	O
which	O
had	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
a	O
good	O
bay	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
intended	O
to	O
anchor	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
deep	O
for	O
our	O
purpose	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
some	O
shoals	O
rendered	O
the	O
entrance	O

When	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
the	O

standing	O
in	O
for	O
this	O
Bay	O
,	O
we	O
observed	O
a	O
large	O
hummock	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
an	O
island	O

which	O
I	O
believe	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
peninsula	O
,	O
joined	O
by	O
a	O
low	O
isthmus	O
to	O
the	O
main	O
;	O
this	O
hummock	O
formed	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

and	O
another	O
high	O

only	O
one	O
of	O
which	O
can	O

On	O
this	O

of	O
the	O

we	O
saw	O
no	O

the	O

made	O
two	O

the	O
additional	O
misfortune	O
to	O

:	O
that	O
this	O
unexpected	O
mischief	O
might	O
lose	O
none	O
of	O
its	O

it	O
happened	O
at	O
midnight	O

This	O

attempted	O

us	O

before	O
we	O
could	O
have	O
the	O
least	O
apprehension	O
that	O
an	O
enemy	O
was	O

defeated	O

swivel-guns	O

;	O
but	O
though	O
he	O
had	O
the	O

we	O
soon	O
returned	O
his	O
salute	O
with	O
such	O
effect	O

that	O
shortly	O
after	O
he	O
sunk	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
unhappy	O

It	O
was	O
a	O

vessel	O

but	O
of	O
what	O

or	O
how	O

The	O

We	O
knew	O
this	O

to	O

seen	O
in	O
the	O
dusk	O

we	O

learnt	O
that	O

who	O
had	O
more	O
than	O
thirty	O
such	O

under	O

The	O
smallness	O
of	O
our	O
vessel	O
encouraged	O
the	O
attack	O

and	O
her	O
strength	O
being	O

much	O
more	O
than	O
in	O

On	O
Saturday	O
the	O
12th	O

we	O
fell	O
in	O
with	O
the	O
dangerous	O
shoals	O
called	O
the	O
Spera	PNM
Mondes	PNM
,	O
and	O
had	O
the	O
mortification	O
to	O
find	O
that	O
the	O

now	O
set	O
in	O

the	O

it	O

impossible	O
for	O
any	O

to	O
get	O
as	O

as	O

it	O

the	O

the	O

I	O

After	O

the	O

came	O

of	O

me	O
the	O

letter	O

but	O
it	O
proved	O
to	O
be	O
written	O
in	O
Dutch	O
,	O
a	O
language	O
which	O
not	O
a	O
single	O
person	O
on	O

could	O
understand	O
:	O
the	O
two	O
gentlemen	O
who	O
brought	O
it	O

both	O
spoke	O

and	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
interpreted	O
the	O
contents	O
to	O
me	O
in	O
that	O
language	O
.	O

The	O
purport	O
of	O
it	O
was	O
``	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
instantly	O
depart	O
from	O
the	O

that	O

should	O
not	O

permit	O
any	O
of	O

that	O
was	O
under	O
his	O

''	O

Before	O
I	O
made	O
any	O
reply	O
to	O
this	O
letter	O
,	O
I	O
shewed	O
the	O
gentlemen	O
who	O
brought	O
it	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
my	O
sick	O
:	O
at	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
so	O
many	O
unhappy	O
wretches	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
dying	O
of	O
languor	O
and	O
disease	O
,	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
much	O
affected	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
then	O
urged	O
again	O
the	O
pressing	O
necessity	O
I	O
was	O
under	O
of	O
procuring	O
refreshment	O
,	O
to	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
witnesses	O
,	O
the	O
cruelty	O
and	O
injustice	O
of	O
refusing	O
to	O
supply	O
me	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
not	O
only	O
contrary	O
to	O
treaty	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
a	O
Kings	O
ship	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
the	O
laws	O
of	O
Nature	PNM
as	O
we	O
were	O
human	O
beings	O
:	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
admit	O
the	O
force	O
of	O
this	O
reasoning	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
short	O
and	O
final	O
answer	O
ready	O
,	O
``	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
absolute	O
and	O
indispensible	O
orders	O
from	O

that	O
these	O

To	O
this	O
I	O
replied	O

that	O

in	O
our	O
situation	O
had	O
nothing	O
worse	O
to	O

than	O
what	O
they	O
suffered	O

that	O
therefore	O

that	O

should	O
find	O
myself	O
unable	O

requisitions	O

the	O

of	O
which	O
could	O

I	O
would	O
run	O
the	O

and	O
,	O
after	O
selling	O
our	O

we	O
could	O

bring	O
upon	O

the	O

At	O
this	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
alarmed	O
,	O
as	O
our	O
situation	O
alone	O
was	O
sufficient	O
to	O
convince	O
them	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
in	O

,	O
and	O
urged	O
me	O
with	O
great	O
emotion	O
to	O
remain	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
,	O
at	O

till	O
I	O

from	O

all	O

in	O
a	O
state	O

not	O

greatly	O
aggravated	O

very	O
early	O

we	O
had	O
the	O

Very	O
soon	O
after	O
we	O
had	O

under	O

a	O
handsome	O

with	O
a	O
band	O
of	O

several	O
gentlemen	O
on	O

made	O
up	O
to	O

told	O
us	O
that	O
they	O
were	O

the	O

could	O
not	O

;	O
our	O
anchor	O
therefore	O
was	O
immediately	O
dropped	O

and	O
the	O
gentlemen	O
came	O
on	O

they	O
proved	O
to	O

Mr.	O

the	O

Mr.	O
Voll	O

the	O

and	O
Mr.	O
Douglas	O
the	O
writer	O
,	O
who	O
has	O
been	O

already	O

They	O
expressed	O
some	O
surprize	O
at	O
my	O
having	O
got	O
under	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
asked	O
me	O
what	O
I	O
intended	O
to	O
have	O
done	O
;	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
I	O
intended	O
,	O
neither	O
more	O
nor	O
less	O
than	O
to	O
fulfill	O
the	O
declarations	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
;	O
that	O
justified	O
by	O
the	O
common	O
rights	O
of	O
mankind	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
superior	O
to	O
every	O
other	O
law	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
,	O
rather	O
than	O
have	O
put	O
again	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
where	O
our	O
destruction	O
either	O
by	O
shipwreck	O
,	O
sickness	O
,	O
or	O
famine	O
,	O
was	O
inevitable	O
,	O
have	O
come	O
up	O
to	O
their	O
walls	O
,	O
and	O
either	O
have	O
compelled	O
them	O
to	O
furnish	O
the	O
necessaries	O
we	O
wanted	O
,	O
or	O
have	O
run	O
the	O
ship	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
since	O
it	O
was	O
better	O
to	O
perish	O
at	O
once	O
in	O
a	O
just	O
contest	O
,	O
than	O
to	O
suffer	O
the	O
lingering	O
misery	O
of	O
anticipating	O
the	O
perdition	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
avoid	O
.	O

I	O
observed	O
also	O
,	O
that	O
no	O
civilized	O
people	O
had	O
ever	O
suffered	O
even	O
the	O
captives	O
of	O
war	O
to	O
perish	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
the	O
necessaries	O
of	O
life	O
,	O
much	O
less	O
the	O
subjects	O
of	O
an	O
ally	O
,	O
who	O
asked	O
nothing	O
but	O
permission	O
to	O
purchase	O
food	O
with	O
their	O
money	O
.	O

They	O
readily	O
allowed	O
the	O
truth	O
of	O
all	O
I	O
had	O
said	O
,	O
but	O
seemed	O
to	O
think	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
too	O
hasty	O
:	O
I	O
then	O
observed	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
waited	O
the	O
full	O
time	O
of	O
my	O
stipulation	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
in	O
return	O
made	O
some	O
excuse	O
for	O
their	O
not	O
having	O
come	O
sooner	O
,	O
telling	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
proof	O
of	O
their	O
having	O
admitted	O
my	O
claim	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
brought	O
me	O
such	O
provisions	O
as	O
their	O
country	O
would	O
afford	O
.	O

These	O
were	O
immediately	O
taken	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
consisted	O
of	O
two	O
sheep	O
,	O
an	O
elk	O
ready	O
killed	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
few	O
fowls	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
vegetables	O
and	O
fruit	O
.	O

This	O
most	O
welcome	O
supply	O
was	O
divided	O
among	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
most	O
salutary	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
us	O
exquisite	O
dainty	O
,	O
broth	O
,	O
made	O
for	O
the	O
sick	O
.	O

Another	O
letter	O
from	O
the	O
Governor	O
was	O
then	O
produced	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
,	O
to	O
my	O
great	O
disappointment	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
again	O
ordered	O
to	O
leave	O
the	O
port	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
justify	O
the	O
order	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
alleged	O
,	O
that	O
to	O
suffer	O
a	O
ship	O
of	O
any	O
nation	O
to	O
stay	O
and	O
trade	O
either	O
at	O
this	O
port	O
,	O
or	O
any	O
other	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
was	O
contrary	O
to	O
the	O
agreement	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
made	O
by	O
the	O
East	O
India	PNM
Company	O
with	O
the	O
native	O
Kings	O
and	O
Governors	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
already	O
expressed	O
some	O
displeasure	O
on	O
our	O
account	O
;	O
and	O
for	O
farther	O
particulars	O
I	O
was	O
referred	O
to	O
the	O
gentlemen	O
that	O
brought	O
the	O
letter	O
,	O
whom	O
the	O
Governor	O
stiled	O
his	O
commissaries	O
.	O

To	O
these	O
gentlemen	O
I	O
immediately	O
observed	O
,	O
that	O
no	O
stipulation	O
concerning	O
trade	O
could	O
affect	O
us	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
a	O
Kings	O
ship	O
;	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
I	O
produced	O
my	O
commission	O
,	O
it	O
not	O
being	O
possible	O
to	O
bring	O
under	O
the	O
article	O
of	O
trade	O
the	O
selling	O
us	O
food	O
,	O
and	O
refreshments	O
for	O
our	O
money	O
,	O
without	O
the	O
utmost	O
violence	O
to	O
language	O
and	O
common	O
sense	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
they	O
made	O
me	O
several	O
propositions	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
I	O
rejected	O
,	O
because	O
my	O
departure	O
from	O
this	O
place	O
,	O
before	O
the	O
return	O
of	O
the	O
season	O
,	O
was	O
included	O
in	O
them	O
all	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
recurred	O
to	O
my	O
former	O
declaration	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
enforce	O
it	O
,	O
shewed	O
them	O
the	O
corpse	O
of	O
a	O
man	O
who	O
had	O
died	O
that	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
whose	O
life	O
would	O
probably	O
have	O
been	O
saved	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
afforded	O
us	O
refreshments	O
when	O
we	O
first	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
upon	O
their	O
coast	O
.	O

This	O
put	O
them	O
to	O
a	O
stand	O
,	O
but	O
after	O
a	O
short	O
pause	O
,	O
they	O
enquired	O
very	O
particularly	O
whether	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
among	O
the	O
spice	O
islands	O
;	O
I	O
answered	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
negative	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
convinced	O
that	O
I	O
spoke	O
truth	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
better	O
understanding	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
,	O
without	O
disobedience	O
to	O
the	O
most	O
direct	O
and	O
positive	O
orders	O
of	O
the	O
Company	O
,	O
suffer	O
us	O
to	O
remain	O
here	O
yet	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
welcome	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
a	O
little	O
bay	O
not	O
far	O
distant	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
should	O
find	O
effectual	O
shelter	O
from	O
the	O
bad	O
monsoon	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
erect	O
an	O
hospital	O
for	O
my	O
sick	O
,	O
assuring	O
me	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
that	O
provision	O
and	O
refreshments	O
were	O
more	O
plenty	O
there	O
than	O
at	O
Macassar	PNM
,	O
from	O
whence	O
,	O
whatever	O
else	O
I	O
wanted	O
should	O
be	O
sent	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
offering	O
me	O
a	O
good	O
pilot	O
to	O
carry	O
me	O
to	O
my	O
station	O
.	O

To	O
this	O
I	O
gladly	O
consented	O
,	O
upon	O
condition	O
that	O
what	O
they	O
had	O
offered	O
should	O
be	O
confirmed	O
to	O
me	O
by	O
the	O
Governor	O
and	O
Council	O
of	O
Macassar	PNM
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
considered	O
as	O
under	O
the	O
protection	O
of	O
the	O
Dutch	O
nation	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
no	O
violence	O
should	O
be	O
offered	O
to	O
my	O
people	O
:	O
for	O
all	O
this	O
they	O
engaged	O
their	O
honour	O
on	O
behalf	O
of	O
the	O
Governor	O
and	O
Council	O
,	O
promising	O
me	O
the	O
assurance	O
I	O
had	O
required	O
on	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
requesting	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
I	O
would	O
remain	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
enquired	O
why	O
the	O
two	O
vessels	O
which	O
were	O
at	O
anchor	O
under	O
our	O
bows	O
were	O
allotted	O
to	O
that	O
station	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
for	O
no	O
other	O
reason	O
than	O
to	O
protect	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
from	O
offering	O
us	O
any	O
violence	O
.	O

When	O
matters	O
were	O
thus	O
far	O
settled	O
between	O
us	O
,	O
I	O
expressed	O
my	O
concern	O
that	O
,	O
except	O
a	O
glass	O
of	O
wine	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
present	O
them	O
with	O
nothing	O
better	O
then	O
bad	O
salt	O
meat	O
,	O
and	O
bread	O
full	O
of	O
weavels	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
they	O
very	O
politely	O
desired	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
permit	O
their	O
servants	O
to	O
bring	O
in	O
the	O
victuals	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
dressing	O
in	O
their	O
own	O
vessel	O
;	O
I	O
readily	O
consented	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
very	O
genteel	O
dinner	O
was	O
soon	O
served	O
up	O
,	O
consisting	O
of	O
fish	O
,	O
flesh	O
,	O
vegetables	O
,	O
and	O
fruit	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
with	O
the	O
greatest	O
pleasure	O
that	O
I	O
take	O
this	O
opportunity	O
of	O
acknowledging	O
my	O
obligations	O
to	O
these	O
Gentlemen	O
for	O
the	O
politeness	O
and	O
humanity	O
of	O
their	O
behaviour	O
in	O
their	O
private	O
capacity	O
,	O
and	O
particularly	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Douglas	O
,	O
who	O
being	O
qualified	O
by	O
his	O
knowlege	O
of	O
the	O
French	O
language	O
to	O
interpret	O
between	O
us	O
,	O
undertook	O
that	O
office	O
with	O
a	O
courtesy	O
and	O
politeness	O
which	O
very	O
much	O
increased	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
the	O
favour	O

After	O
this	O
we	O
parted	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
their	O
leaving	O
the	O

I	O
saluted	O
them	O
with	O
nine	O

The	O

the	O

the	O

Every	O

To	O

the	O
day	O

in	O

were	O
immediately	O
moored	O

who	O
spoke	O

very	O

all	O

a	O

the	O
only	O
one	O
in	O

I	O
converted	O

under	O
the	O
direction	O
of	O
the	O
Surgeon	O
;	O
to	O
this	O

I	O
immediately	O
sent	O
all	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
were	O
thought	O
incapable	O

on	O

,	O
was	O
set	O
over	O

none	O

to	O
go	O
more	O

thirty	O
yards	O
from	O

nor	O
were	O
any	O

them	O
any	O
thing	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
our	O

got	O
nothing	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
through	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
the	O
Dutch	O
soldiers	O
,	O
who	O
abused	O
their	O
power	O
very	O
shamefully	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
saw	O
any	O
of	O

carrying	O
what	O
they	O
thought	O
our	O

first	O
took	O
it	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
asked	O
the	O
price	O
:	O
what	O
was	O
demanded	O
signified	O
little	O
,	O
the	O
soldier	O
gave	O
what	O
he	O
thought	O
proper	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
seldom	O
one	O
fourth	O
of	O
the	O
value	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
the	O
countryman	O
ventured	O
to	O
express	O
any	O
discontent	O
,	O
he	O
gave	O
him	O
immediately	O
an	O
earnest	O
of	O
perfect	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
by	O
flourishing	O
his	O
broad-sword	O
over	O
his	O
head	O
;	O
this	O
was	O
always	O
sufficient	O
to	O
silence	O
complaint	O
,	O
and	O
send	O
the	O
sufferer	O
quietly	O
away	O
;	O
after	O
which	O
the	O
soldier	O
sold	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
thus	O
acquired	O
for	O
profit	O
of	O
sometimes	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
thousand	O
per	O
Cent	O
.	O

This	O
behaviour	O
was	O
so	O
cruel	O
to	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
injurious	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
ventured	O
to	O
complain	O
of	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
Resident	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
Gentlemen	O
,	O
Le	O
Cerf	O
and	O
the	O
Secretary	O
.	O

The	O
Resident	O
,	O
with	O
becoming	O
spirit	O
,	O
reprimanded	O
the	O
soldiers	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
produced	O
so	O
little	O
effect	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
help	O
entertaining	O
suspicions	O
that	O
le	O
Cerf	O
connived	O
at	O
these	O
practises	O
,	O
and	O
shared	O
the	O
advantages	O
which	O
they	O
produced	O
.	O

I	O
suspected	O
him	O
also	O
of	O
selling	O
arrack	O
to	O
my	O
people	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
complained	O
,	O
but	O
without	O
redress	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
know	O
that	O
his	O
slaves	O
were	O
employed	O
to	O
buy	O
things	O
at	O
the	O
market	O
which	O
his	O
wife	O
afterwards	O
sold	O
to	O
us	O
for	O
more	O
than	O
twice	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
they	O
cost	O
.	O

The	O
soldiers	O
were	O
indeed	O
guilty	O
of	O
many	O
other	O
irregularities	O
:	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
duty	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
by	O
rotation	O
to	O
procure	O
the	O
days	O
provision	O
for	O
the	O
whole	O
guard	O
,	O
a	O
service	O
which	O
he	O
constantly	O
performed	O
by	O
going	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
with	O
his	O
musquet	O
and	O
a	O
bag	O
;	O
nor	O
was	O
the	O
honest	O
providetor	O
always	O
content	O
with	O
what	O
the	O
bag	O
would	O
contain	O
,	O
for	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
without	O
any	O
ceremony	O
,	O
drove	O
down	O
a	O
young	O
buffalo	O
that	O
belonged	O
to	O
some	O
of	O
the	O

and	O
his	O

not	O

wood	O
at	O

themselves	O
by	O
pulling	O
down	O
some	O
of	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

When	O
this	O
was	O
reported	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
so	O
extraordinary	O
that	O
I	O
went	O
on	O

to	O
see	O
the	O

found	O

On	O

a	O

but	O
after	O

attempted	O
it	O
three	O

was	O
forced	O
to	O

The	O

the	O

to	O
our	O

she	O
appeared	O

our	O

without	O
either	O

This	O

was	O
a	O

How	O

the	O
intelligence	O

contained	O

true	O

I	O

whether	O
either	O

true	O

we	O

we	O
rigged	O

towards	O

The	O
resident	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Swellingrabel	O

was	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
absent	O
twenty	O
miles	O
up	O
the	O
country	O
upon	O
the	O
Companys	O
business	O
,	O
but	O
had	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
certainly	O
return	O
on	O
the	O
1st	O
of	O
April	O
,	O
a	O
day	O
which	O
I	O
now	O
expected	O
with	O
great	O
impatience	O
,	O
especially	O
as	O
an	O
old	O
drunken	O
Serjeant	O
was	O
the	O
most	O
respectable	O
person	O
at	O
the	O
fort	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
of	O
the	O
3ist	O
,	O
a	O
packet	O
of	O
letters	O
for	O
him	O
arrived	O
here	O
from	O
Macassar	PNM
,	O
which	O
I	O
considered	O
as	O
a	O
good	O
omen	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
pledge	O
of	O
his	O
return	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
appointed	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
conceived	O
very	O
different	O
sentiments	O
when	O
I	O
learnt	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
sent	O
to	O
him	O
.	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
suspect	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
privy	O
to	O
any	O
such	O
design	O
as	O
had	O
been	O
intimated	O
to	O
me	O
by	O
the	O
letter	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
help	O
doubting	O
,	O
whether	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
kept	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
be	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
when	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
executed	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
state	O
of	O
anxiety	O
and	O
suspense	O
I	O
sent	O
a	O
message	O
to	O
the	O
fort	O
,	O
desiring	O
that	O
an	O
express	O
might	O
be	O
dispatched	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
to	O
acquaint	O
him	O
that	O
I	O
wished	O
to	O
see	O
him	O
immediately	O
upon	O
business	O
of	O
great	O
importance	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
admit	O
of	O
no	O
delay	O
.	O

Whether	O
my	O
message	O
was	O
forwarded	O
to	O
him	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
tell	O
;	O
but	O
having	O
waited	O
till	O
the	O
4th	O
of	O
April	O
,	O
without	O
having	O
seen	O
him	O
or	O
received	O
any	O
answer	O
,	O
I	O
wrote	O
him	O
a	O
letter	O
,	O
requesting	O
to	O
speak	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
pressing	O
terms	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
he	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

A	O
few	O
minutes	O
convinced	O
me	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
wholly	O
a	O
stranger	O
to	O
any	O
such	O
design	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
made	O
to	O
apprehend	O
;	O
and	O
be	O
was	O
clearly	O
of	O
opinion	O
that	O
no	O
such	O
design	O
had	O
been	O
formed	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
that	O
one	O
Tomilaly	O
,	O
a	O
counsellor	O
or	O
minister	O
of	O
the	O
King	O
of	O
Bony	PNM
,	O
had	O
lately	O
paid	O
him	O
a	O
visit	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
not	O
well	O
accounted	O
for	O
his	O
being	O
in	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
at	O
my	O
request	O
,	O
he	O
very	O
readily	O
undertook	O
to	O
make	O
farther	O
enquiries	O
concerning	O
him	O
and	O
his	O
people	O
.	O

The	O
Resident	O
and	O
his	O
attendants	O
took	O
notice	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
put	O
into	O
a	O
state	O
of	O
defence	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
every	O
thing	O
was	O
ready	O
for	O
immediate	O
action	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
told	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
shore	O
had	O
acquainted	O
him	O
,	O
before	O
he	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
with	O
our	O
vigilance	O
and	O
activity	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
particular	O
,	O
with	O
our	O
having	O
exercised	O
the	O
ships	O
company	O
at	O
small	O
arms	O
every	O
day	O
.	O

I	O
informed	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
,	O
at	O
all	O
events	O
,	O
continue	O
upon	O
our	O
guard	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
seemed	O
to	O
approve	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
parted	O
with	O
mutual	O
protestations	O
of	O
friendship	O
and	O
good	O
faith	O
.	O

After	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
,	O
he	O
sent	O
me	O
word	O
that	O
having	O
made	O
a	O
very	O
strict	O
enquiry	O
,	O
whether	O
any	O
other	O
persons	O
belonging	O
to	O
the	O
King	O
of	O
Bony	PNM
had	O
been	O
at	O
Bonthain	PNM
,	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
credibly	O
informed	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Princes	O
of	O
that	O
kingdom	O
had	O
been	O
there	O
in	O
disguise	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
eight	O
hundred	O
men	O
who	O
were	O
said	O
in	O
my	O
intelligence	O
to	O
be	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
find	O
no	O
traces	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
except	O
they	O
too	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
troops	O
of	O
the	O
King	O
of	O
Brentford	PNM
,	O
were	O
an	O
army	O
in	O
disguise	O
,	O
I	O
knew	O
that	O
no	O
such	O
people	O
could	O
be	O
in	O
that	O
country	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
16th	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
the	O
Resident	O
sent	O
me	O
word	O
,	O
that	O
M.	O
Le	O
Cerf	O
was	O
returned	O
from	O
Macassar	PNM
with	O
another	O
officer	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
and	O
dine	O
with	O
me	O
.	O

When	O
dinner	O
was	O
over	O
,	O
I	O
asked	O
Le	O
Cerf	O
,	O
among	O
other	O
conversation	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
taking	O
our	O
wine	O
,	O
what	O
was	O
become	O
of	O
his	O
expedition	O
to	O
Bally	PNM
,	O
to	O
which	O
he	O
answered	O
drily	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
laid	O
aside	O
,	O
without	O
saying	O
any	O
thing	O
more	O
upon	O
the	O
subject	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
23d	O
,	O
he	O
returned	O
to	O
Macassar	PNM
by	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
officer	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
also	O
an	O
ensign	O
,	O
remained	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
command	O
of	O
the	O
soldiers	O
that	O
were	O
still	O
left	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
.	O

The	O
season	O
now	O
approached	O
in	O
which	O
navigation	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
would	O
be	O
again	O
practicable	O
,	O
which	O
gave	O
us	O
all	O
great	O
pleasure	O
;	O
especially	O
as	O
putrid	O
diseases	O
had	O
begun	O
to	O
make	O
their	O
appearance	O
among	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
putrid	O
fever	O
had	O
carried	O
off	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
7th	O
of	O
May	O
,	O
the	O
Resident	O
gave	O
me	O
a	O
long	O
letter	O
from	O
the	O
Governor	O
of	O
Macassar	PNM
,	O
which	O
was	O
written	O
in	O
Dutch	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
which	O
he	O
gave	O
me	O
the	O
best	O
interpretation	O
he	O
was	O
able	O
.	O

The	O
general	O
purport	O
of	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
heard	O
a	O
letter	O
had	O
been	O
sent	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
charging	O
him	O
,	O
in	O
conjunction	O
with	O
the	O
king	O
of	O
Bony	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
design	O
to	O
cut	O
us	O
off	O
:	O
that	O
the	O
letter	O
was	O
altogether	O
false	O
,	O
exculpating	O
himself	O
with	O
the	O
most	O
solemn	O
protestations	O
,	O
and	O
requiring	O
the	O
letter	O
to	O
be	O
delivered	O
up	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
writer	O
might	O
be	O
brought	O
to	O
such	O
punishment	O
as	O
he	O
deserved	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
scarcely	O
necessary	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
deliver	O
up	O
the	O
letter	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
writer	O
would	O
certainly	O
have	O
been	O
punished	O
with	O
equal	O
severity	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
true	O
or	O
false	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
returned	O
the	O
Governor	O
a	O
polite	O
answer	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
I	O
justified	O
the	O
measures	O
I	O
had	O
taken	O
,	O
without	O
imputing	O
any	O
evil	O
design	O
to	O
him	O
or	O
his	O
allies	O
;	O
and	O
indeed	O
there	O
is	O
the	O
greatest	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
sufficient	O
ground	O
for	O
the	O
charge	O
contained	O
in	O
the	O
letter	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
equally	O
probable	O
that	O
the	O
writer	O
believed	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
false	O
.	O

At	O
day-break	O
on	O
Sunday	O
the	O
22d	O
of	O
May	O
,	O
we	O
sailed	O
from	O
this	O
place	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
town	O
of	O
Macassar	PNM
,	O
and	O
the	O
adjacent	O
country	O
,	O
I	O
shall	O
say	O

we	O

On	O
Thursday	O
the	O
2d	O
of	O
June	O
,	O
we	O
hauled	O
in	O
and	O
made	O
the	O
land	O
of	O
Java	PNM
,	O
which	O
proved	O
to	O
be	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
which	O

the	O

point	O
of	O
the	O

Batavia	PNM

When	O
we	O
first	O
got	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
gradually	O
decreased	O
our	O
soundings	O
from	O

eight	O

twenty	O
fathom	O

As	O
we	O

along	O
the	O
shore	O
for	O
Batavia	PNM

we	O
decreased	O
them	O
gradually	O

still	O
farther	O

to	O
thirteen	O
fathom	O
,	O
the	O
depth	O
in	O
which	O
,	O
night	O
coming	O
on	O

we	O
anchored	O
near	O
the	O
two	O
small	O
islands	O
called	O
Leyden	PNM

Alkmar	O
,	O
in	O

of	O
Batavia	PNM
;	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
of	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
we	O
anchored	O
in	O
the	O
Road	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
so	O
good	O
that	O
it	O
may	O
well	O
be	O
considered	O
as	O
an	O

We	O
had	O
now	O
great	O
reason	O
to	O
congratulate	O
ourselves	O
upon	O
our	O
situation	O
,	O
for	O
during	O
the	O
whole	O
of	O
our	O
passage	O
from	O
Celebes	O
,	O
the	O
ship	O
admitted	O
so	O
much	O
water	O
by	O
her	O
leaks	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
all	O
we	O
could	O
do	O
to	O
keep	O
her	O
from	O
sinking	O
,	O
with	O
two	O
pumps	O
constantly	O
going	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
here	O
eleven	O
large	O
Dutch	O
ships	O
,	O
besides	O
several	O
that	O
were	O
less	O
,	O
one	O
Spanish	O
ship	O

a	O
Portuguese	O
snow	O
,	O
and	O
several	O
Chinese	O
junks	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
we	O
saluted	O
the	O
town	O
with	O
eleven	O
guns	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
same	O
number	O
was	O
returned	O

As	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
birth-day	O
of	O
his	O
Britannick	O
Majesty	O
,	O
our	O
Sovereign	O
,	O
we	O
afterwards	O
fired	O
one	O
and	O
twenty	O
guns	O
more	O
on	O
that	O
occasion	O

We	O
found	O
the	O
variation	O
here	O
to	O
be	O
less	O
than	O
half	O
a	O
degree	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
I	O
waited	O
upon	O
the	O
Governor	O
,	O
and	O
acquainted	O
him	O
with	O
the	O
condition	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
desiring	O
liberty	O
to	O
repair	O
her	O
defects	O
,	O
to	O
which	O
he	O
replied	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
must	O
petition	O
the	O
Council	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
6th	O
therefore	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
Council-day	O
,	O
I	O
addressed	O
a	O
letter	O
to	O
the	O
Governor	O
and	O
Council	O
,	O
setting	O
forth	O
more	O
particularly	O
the	O
condition	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
and	O
after	O
requesting	O
leave	O
to	O
repair	O
her	O
,	O
I	O
added	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
hoped	O
they	O
would	O
allow	O
me	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
such	O
wharfs	O
and	O
shore-houses	O
as	O
should	O
be	O
necessary	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
of	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
the	O
shebander	O
,	O
with	O
Mr.	O
Garrison	O
,	O
a	O
merchant	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
as	O
interpreter	O
,	O
and	O
another	O
person	O
,	O
came	O
to	O
me	O
.	O

After	O
the	O
first	O
compliments	O
,	O
the	O
shebander	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
sent	O
by	O
the	O
Governor	O
and	O
Council	O
for	O
a	O
letter	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
heard	O
I	O
had	O
received	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
Bonthain	PNM
,	O
acquainting	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
a	O
design	O
had	O
been	O
formed	O
to	O
cut	O
off	O
my	O
ship	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
author	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
injured	O
both	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
nation	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
person	O
of	O
the	O
Governor	O
of	O
that	O
,	O
place	O
,	O
might	O
be	O
punished	O
.	O

I	O
readily	O
acknowledged	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
received	O
such	O
information	O
,	O
but	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
never	O
told	O
any	O
body	O
it	O
was	O
by	O
letter	O
.	O

The	O
shebander	O
then	O
asked	O
me	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
take	O
an	O
oath	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
received	O
no	O
such	O
letter	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
directed	O
to	O
demand	O
;	O
to	O
which	O
I	O
answered	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
surprised	O
at	O
the	O
question	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
Council	O
had	O
any	O
such	O
uncommon	O
requisition	O
to	O
make	O
of	O
me	O
,	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
in	O
writing	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
give	O
such	O
reply	O
,	O
as	O
,	O
upon	O
mature	O
consideration	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
think	O
proper	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
desired	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
answer	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
instructed	O
to	O
give	O
to	O
my	O
letter	O
,	O
concerning	O
the	O
refitting	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
,	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
Council	O
had	O
taken	O
offence	O
at	O
my	O
having	O
used	O
the	O
word	O
hope	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
written	O
in	O
the	O
stile	O
of	O
request	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
invariably	O
adopted	O
by	O
all	O
merchants	O
upon	O
the	O
like	O
occasion	O
:	O
I	O
replied	O
,	O
that	O
no	O
offence	O
was	O
intended	O
on	O
my	O
part	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
used	O
the	O
first	O
words	O
which	O
occurred	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
as	O
proper	O
to	O
express	O
my	O
meaning	O
.	O

Thus	O
we	O
parted	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
heard	O
nothing	O
more	O
of	O
them	O
till	O
the	O
afternoon	O
of	O
the	O
9th	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
shebander	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
same	O
two	O
gentlemen	O
,	O
came	O
to	O
me	O
a	O
second	O
time	O
.	O

The	O
shebander	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
then	O
commissioned	O
from	O
the	O
council	O
,	O
to	O
require	O
a	O
writing	O
under	O
my	O
hand	O
,	O
signifying	O
that	O
I	O
believed	O
the	O
report	O
of	O
an	O
intention	O
formed	O
at	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Celebes	O
to	O
cut	O
off	O
my	O
ship	O
,	O
was	O
false	O
and	O
malicious	O
,	O
saying	O
that	O
he	O
hoped	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
better	O
opinion	O
of	O
the	O
Dutch	O
nation	O
than	O
to	O
suppose	O
them	O
capable	O
of	O
suffering	O
so	O
execrable	O
a	O
fact	O
to	O
be	O
perpetrated	O
under	O
their	O
Government	O
.	O

Mr.	O
Garrison	O
then	O
read	O
me	O
a	O
certificate	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
by	O
order	O
of	O
the	O
council	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
drawn	O
up	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
sign	O
:	O
as	O
,	O
whatever	O
was	O
my	O
opinion	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
it	O
advisable	O
to	O
sign	O
such	O
a	O
certificate	O
,	O
especially	O
as	O
it	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
a	O
condition	O
of	O
complying	O
with	O
my	O
request	O
by	O
the	O
delay	O
of	O
an	O
answer	O
during	O
this	O
solicitiation	O
,	O
I	O
desired	O
the	O
shebander	O
to	O
shew	O
me	O
his	O
authority	O
for	O
the	O
requisition	O
he	O
had	O
made	O
:	O
he	O
replied	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
testimony	O
of	O
authority	O
but	O
the	O
notoriety	O
of	O
his	O
being	O
a	O
public	O
officer	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
the	O
gentlemen	O
that	O
were	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
confirming	O
his	O
own	O
declaration	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
acted	O
in	O
this	O
particular	O
by	O
the	O
express	O
order	O
of	O
Council	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
repeated	O
my	O
request	O
,	O
that	O
whatever	O
the	O
Council	O
required	O
of	O
me	O
might	O
.	O

be	O
given	O
me	O
in	O
writing	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
sense	O
of	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
fixed	O
and	O
certain	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
time	O
to	O
consider	O
of	O
my	O
reply	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
gave	O
me	O
to	O
understand	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
do	O
this	O
without	O
an	O
order	O
from	O
the	O
Council	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
then	O
absolutely	O
refused	O
to	O
sign	O
the	O
paper	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
desiring	O
an	O
answer	O
to	O
my	O
letter	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
not	O
being	O
prepared	O
to	O
give	O
,	O
we	O
parted	O
,	O
not	O
in	O
very	O
good	O
humour	O
with	O
each	O
other	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
waited	O
in	O
a	O
fruitless	O
expectation	O
till	O
the	O
15th	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
same	O
three	O
gentlemen	O
came	O
to	O
me	O
the	O
third	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
sent	O
to	O
tell	O
me	O
that	O
the	O
Council	O
had	O
protested	O
against	O
my	O
behaviour	O
at	O
Macassar	PNM
,	O
and	O
my	O
having	O
refused	O
to	O
sign	O
the	O
certificate	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
required	O
of	O
me	O
,	O
as	O
an	O
insult	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
an	O
act	O
of	O
injustice	O
to	O
their	O
nation	O
.	O

I	O
replied	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
conscious	O
of	O
having	O
in	O
any	O
instance	O
acted	O
contrary	O
to	O
the	O
treaties	O
subsisting	O
between	O
the	O
two	O
kingdoms	O
,	O
unworthy	O
of	O
my	O
character	O
as	O
an	O
officer	O
,	O
honoured	O
with	O
a	O
commission	O
of	O
his	O
Britannic	O
Majesty	O
,	O
or	O
unsuitable	O
to	O
the	O
trust	O
reposed	O
in	O
me	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
used	O
by	O
the	O
Governor	O
of	O
Macassar	PNM
as	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
a	O
friend	O
and	O
ally	O
;	O
desiring	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
any	O
thing	O
to	O
allege	O
against	O
me	O
,	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
reduced	O
to	O

and	O
laid	O
before	O
the	O
King	O
my	O
Master	O
,	O
to	O
whom	O
alone	O
I	O
thought	O
myself	O
amenable	O

With	O
this	O
answer	O
they	O
again	O
departed	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
having	O
not	O
yet	O
received	O
any	O
answer	O
to	O
my	O
letter	O

I	O
wrote	O
a	O
second	O
,	O
directed	O
like	O
the	O
first	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
I	O
represented	O
that	O
the	O
ships	O

were	O
every	O
day	O
increasing	O
,	O
and	O
urged	O
,	O
in	O
more	O

,	O
my	O
request	O
that	O
she	O

be	O
repaired	O

that	O
the	O

On	O
the	O
18th	O
,	O
the	O
shebander	O
came	O
again	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
acquainted	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
the	O

had	O
given	O

for	O
the	O

of	O

When	O

this	O

I	O
knew	O
she	O

an	O

and	O
I	O
was	O
afraid	O
that	O
if	O
her	O

opened	O
it	O
might	O
be	O

still	O
worse	O

so	O

as	O
that	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
Falmouth	O

she	O
might	O
be	O
condemned	O
;	O
I	O
therefore	O
desired	O
that	O
a	O

that	O
what	O
should	O
be	O
done	O
to	O
the	O

was	O
not	O
according	O
to	O

my	O

if	O

I	O
was	O

the	O

of	O

The	O

were	O
at	O

repaired	O

much	O
to	O
my	O

I	O
thought	O
she	O

The	O

and	O
my	O

represented	O
that	O
if	O
I	O
went	O
to	O

before	O

I	O
should	O
meet	O

of	PNM
Good	PNM
Hope	PNM
as	O
would	O

repent	O
it	O

but	O
being	O
very	O
ill	O
myself	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
people	O
being	O
sickly	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
better	O
to	O
run	O
the	O
risk	O
of	O
a	O
few	O
hard	O
gales	O
off	O
the	O
Cape	PNM

than	O
remain	O
longer	O
in	O
this	O

place	O
,	O
especially	O
as	O
the	O
west	O
monsoon	O
was	O

On	O
Wednesday	O
the	O
15th	O
of	O

,	O
therefore	O
,	O
we	O
set	O

as	O
I	O

was	O
able	O
to	O
procure	O
a	O

in	O
our	O

On	O

and	O
the	O

At	O
this	O

we	O
breathed	O
a	O
pure	O

had	O
wholesome	O

and	O
went	O
freely	O
about	O
the	O

so	O
that	O
I	O
began	O
to	O

myself	O

in	O
the	O

I	O
set	O

before	O

the	O

On	O
the	O
20th	O
,	O
after	O
a	O
fine	O
and	O
pleasant	O
passage	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Saint	PNM

;	O
and	O
set	O
sail	O
again	O
on	O

morning	O
of	O
the	O
24th	O

At	O
midnight	O
on	O
the	O
30th	O

we	O
made	O
the	O
north	O

of	O
the	O
Island	PNM
of	PNM
Ascension	PNM
,	O
and	O
brought	O

till	O
day-light	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
ran	O
in	O
close	O
to	O
it	O

I	O
sent	O
a	O

out	O
to	O
discover	O
the	O
anchoring-place	O
which	O
is	O
called	O
Cross-hill	PNM

while	O
we	O
kept	O

along	O
the	O
north	O

north	O

of	O
the	O

till	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
north	O

of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
anchored	O
in	O
the	O
bay	O
we	O
sought	O
.	O

The	O
way	O
to	O
find	O
this	O
place	O
at	O
once	O
,	O
is	O
to	O
bring	O
the	O
largest	O
and	O
most	O
conspicuous	O
hill	O
upon	O
the	O
island	O
to	O
bear	O
S.E.	O
;	O
when	O
the	O
ship	O
is	O
in	O
this	O
position	O
,	O
the	O
Bay	O
will	O
be	O
open	O

right	O
in	O
the	O

the	O

which	O
is	O

Upon	O
this	O

S.S.E.	O
1/2	O
E.	O
or	O
S.E.	O
by	O
E.	O
and	O
runs	O
in	O

keeping	O
it	O
so	O
till	O
she	O
is	O
in	O
ten	O

,	O
she	O
will	O
be	O
in	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
Bay	PNM

In	O
our	O
run	O
along	O
the	O
north	O
east	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
I	O
observed	O
several	O
other	O
small	O
sandy	O
bays	O
,	O
in	O
some	O
of	O
which	O
my	O
boat	O
found	O
good	O
anchorage	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
plenty	O
of	O
turtle	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
are	O
not	O
so	O
convenient	O
as	O
this	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
had	O
plenty	O
of	O
turtle	O
too	O
.	O

The	O
beach	O
here	O
is	O
a	O
fine	O
white	O
sand	O
;	O
the	O
landing-place	O
is	O
at	O
some	O
rocks	O
,	O
which	O
lie	O
about	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
Bay	O
,	O
and	O
may	O
be	O
known	O
by	O
a	O
ladder	O
of	O
ropes	O
which	O
hangs	O
from	O
the	O
top	O
to	O
mount	O
them	O
by	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
I	O
landed	O
a	O
few	O
men	O
to	O
turn	O
the	O
turtle	O
that	O
should	O
come	O
on	O
shore	O
during	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
thus	O
secured	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
eighteen	O

from	O
four	O
hundred	O
to	O
six	O
hundred	O
weight	O
each	O

and	O
these	O
were	O
as	O
many	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
well	O
stow	O
on	O
the	O
deck	O
.	O

As	O
there	O
are	O
no	O
inhabitants	O
upon	O
this	O
island	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
custom	O
for	O
the	O
ships	O
that	O
touch	O
at	O
it	O
to	O
leave	O
a	O
letter	O
in	O
a	O
bottle	O
,	O
with	O
their	O
names	O
and	O
destination	O
,	O
the	O
date	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
few	O
other	O
particulars	O

We	O
complied	O
with	O
this	O
custom	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
of	O
Monday	O
the	O
1st	O
of	O
February	O
,	O
we	O
weighed	O
anchor	O
and	O
set	O
sail	O

On	O
Friday	O
the	O
19th	O
,	O
we	O
discovered	O
a	O

a	O
considerable	O
distance	O

in	O
the	O
south	O

which	O
hoisted	O
French	O
colours	O
;	O
she	O
continued	O
in	O
sight	O
all	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
we	O
perceived	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
greatly	O
outsailed	O
us	O
during	O
the	O
night	O
;	O
she	O
made	O
a	O
tack	O
however	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
get	O
farther	O
to	O
windward	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
usual	O
for	O
ships	O
to	O
turn	O
to	O
windward	O
in	O
these	O
parts	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
evident	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
tacked	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
speak	O
with	O
us	O
.	O

By	O
noon	O
she	O
was	O
near	O
enough	O
to	O
hail	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
to	O
my	O
great	O
surprise	O
,	O
made	O
use	O
both	O
of	O
my	O
name	O
and	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
enquiring	O
after	O
my	O
health	O
,	O
and	O
telling	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
after	O
the	O
return	O
of	O
the	O
Dolphin	O
to	O
Europe	PNM
,	O
it	O
was	O
believed	O
we	O
had	O
suffered	O
shipwreck	O
in	O
the	O
Streight	PNM
of	PNM
Magellan	PNM
,	O
and	O
that	O
two	O
ships	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
sent	O
out	O
in	O
quest	O
of	O
us	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
turn	O
,	O
who	O
it	O
was	O
that	O
was	O
so	O
well	O
acquainted	O
with	O
me	O
and	O
my	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
the	O
opinions	O
,	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
formed	O
of	O
us	O
in	O
Europe	PNM
after	O
the	O
return	O
of	O
our	O
companion	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
this	O
knowlege	O
had	O
been	O
acquired	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
answered	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
which	O
hailed	O
us	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
service	O
of	O
the	O
French	O
East	O
India	PNM
Company	O
,	O
commanded	O
by	O
M.	O
Bougainville	O
;	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
returning	O
to	O
England	PNM
from	O
the	O
Isle	PNM
of	PNM
France	PNM
;	O
that	O
what	O
was	O
thought	O
of	O
the	O
Swallow	O
in	O
England	PNM
,	O
had	O
been	O
learnt	O
from	O
the	O
French	O
Gazette	O
at	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
of	PNM
Good	PNM
Hope	PNM
;	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
known	O
to	O
be	O
that	O
vessel	O
by	O
the	O
letter	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
bottle	O
at	O
the	O
Island	PNM
of	PNM
Ascension	PNM
a	O
few	O
days	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
left	O
that	O
place	O
.	O

An	O
offer	O
was	O
then	O
made	O
of	O
supplying	O
me	O
with	O
refreshments	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
wanted	O
any	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
asked	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
any	O
letters	O
to	O
send	O
to	O
France	PNM
.	O

I	O
returned	O
thanks	O
for	O
the	O
offer	O
of	O
refreshments	O
which	O
however	O
was	O
a	O
mere	O
verbal	O
civility	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
known	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
lately	O
sailed	O
from	O
the	O
places	O
where	O
M.	O
Bougainville	O
himself	O
had	O
been	O
supplied	O
but	O
I	O
said	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
received	O
letters	O
for	O
France	PNM
from	O
some	O
Gentlemen	O
of	O
that	O
country	O
at	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
,	PNM
and	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
send	O
his	O
boat	O
on	O
board	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
delivered	O
to	O
his	O
messenger	O
.	O

Thus	O
was	O
an	O
occasion	O
furnished	O
for	O
what	O
I	O
have	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
was	O
the	O
principal	O
object	O
of	O
M.	O
Bougainville	O
in	O
speaking	O
with	O
us	O
:	O
a	O
boat	O
was	O
immediately	O
sent	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
her	O
a	O
young	O
officer	O
drest	O
in	O
a	O
waistcoat	O
and	O
trowsers	O
;	O
whether	O
he	O
was	O
thus	O
dressed	O
by	O
design	O
I	O
shall	O
not	O
determine	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
soon	O
perceived	O
that	O
his	O
rank	O
was	O
much	O
superior	O
to	O
his	O
appearance	O
.	O

He	O
came	O
down	O
to	O
me	O
in	O
my	O
cabbin	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
the	O
usual	O
compliments	O
had	O
passed	O
,	O
I	O
asked	O
him	O
how	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
go	O
home	O
so	O
soon	O
in	O
the	O
season	O
;	O
to	O
which	O
he	O
replied	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
had	O
been	O
some	O
disagreement	O
between	O
the	O
Governor	O
and	O
inhabitants	O
of	O
the	O
Isle	PNM
of	PNM
France	PNM
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
sent	O
home	O
in	O
haste	O
with	O
dispatches	O
:	O
this	O
story	O
was	O
the	O
more	O
plausible	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
heard	O
of	O
the	O
dispute	O
between	O
the	O
Governor	O
and	O
inhabitants	O
of	O
the	O
Isle	PNM
of	PNM
France	PNM
,	O
from	O
a	O
French	O
Gentleman	O
,	O
who	O
came	O
from	O
thence	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
of	PNM
Good	PNM
Hope	PNM
;	O
yet	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
perfectly	O
satisfied	O
:	O
for	O
,	O
supposing	O
M.	O
Bougainville	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
sent	O
in	O
haste	O
to	O
Europe	PNM
with	O
dispatches	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
account	O
for	O
his	O
losing	O
the	O
time	O
which	O
it	O
cost	O
him	O
to	O
speak	O
with	O
me	O
;	O
I	O
therefore	O
observed	O
to	O
this	O
Gentleman	O
,	O
that	O
although	O
he	O
had	O
accounted	O
for	O
his	O
coming	O
before	O
the	O
usual	O
time	O
from	O
the	O
Isle	PNM
of	PNM
France	PNM
,	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
accounted	O
for	O
his	O
coming	O
at	O
an	O
unusual	O
time	O
from	O
India	PNM
,	O
which	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
the	O
case	O
.	O

To	O
this	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
he	O
readily	O
replied	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
made	O
only	O
a	O
short	O
trading	O
voyage	O
on	O
the	O
western	O
coast	O
of	O
Sumatra	PNM
.	O

I	O
then	O
enquired	O
,	O
what	O
commodities	O
he	O
had	O
brought	O
from	O
thence	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
answered	O
,	O
cocoa-nut	O
oil	O
,	O
and	O
rattans	O
:	O
but	O
,	O
said	O
I	O
,	O
these	O
are	O
commodities	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
usual	O
to	O
bring	O
into	O
Europe	PNM
;	O
it	O
is	O
true	O
,	O
said	O
he	O
,	O
but	O
these	O
commodities	O
we	O
left	O
at	O
the	O
Isle	PNM
of	PNM
France	PNM
,	O
the	O
oil	O
for	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
rattans	O
for	O
ships	O
which	O
were	O
to	O
touch	O
there	O
in	O
their	O
way	O
to	O
China	PNM
,	O
and	O
in	O
exchange	O
we	O
took	O
in	O
another	O
freight	O
for	O
Europe	PNM
;	O
this	O
freight	O
I	O
think	O
he	O
said	O
was	O
pepper	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
whole	O
tale	O
being	O
at	O
least	O
possible	O
,	O
I	O
asked	O
him	O
no	O
more	O
questions	O
.	O

He	O
then	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
heard	O
at	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
,	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
with	O
Commodore	O
Byron	O
at	O
Falklands	PNM
Islands	PNM
;	O
and	O
,	O
said	O
he	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
French	O
ship	O
that	O
met	O
you	O
in	O
the	O
Streight	PNM
of	PNM
Magellan	PNM
,	O
which	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
true	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
mentioned	O
several	O
incidents	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
otherwise	O
highly	O
improbable	O
he	O
should	O
know	O
,	O
particularly	O
the	O
store-ships	O
running	O
aground	O
,	O
and	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
difficulties	O
that	O
occurred	O
in	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
Streight	O
which	O
we	O
passed	O
together	O
:	O
by	O
this	O
conversation	O
he	O
contrived	O
to	O
introduce	O
several	O
enquiries	O
,	O
concerning	O
the	O
western	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
Streight	O
,	O
the	O
time	O
it	O
cost	O
me	O
to	O
get	O
through	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
difficulties	O
of	O
the	O
navigation	O
;	O
but	O
perceiving	O
that	O
I	O
declined	O
giving	O
any	O
account	O
of	O
these	O
particulars	O
,	O
he	O
changed	O
his	O
subject	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
heard	O
that	O
we	O
lost	O
an	O
officer	O
and	O
some	O
men	O
in	O
an	O
engagement	O
with	O
the	O
Indians	O
;	O
and	O
taking	O
notice	O
that	O
my	O
ship	O
was	O
small	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
bad	O
sailer	O
,	O
he	O
insinuated	O
that	O
we	O
must	O
have	O
suffered	O
great	O
hardship	O
in	O
so	O
long	O
a	O
voyage	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
said	O
he	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
thought	O
to	O
be	O
safer	O
and	O
pleasanter	O
sailing	O
in	O
the	O
South	PNM
Sea	PNM
than	O
any	O
where	O
else	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
perceived	O
that	O
he	O
waited	O
for	O
a	O
reply	O
,	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
great	O
ocean	O
,	O
called	O
the	O
South	PNM
Sea	PNM
,	O
extended	O
almost	O
from	O
one	O
pole	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
,	O
although	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
which	O
lay	O
between	O
the	O
Tropics	O
might	O
justly	O
be	O
called	O
the	O
Pacific	PNM
,	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
trade-winds	O
that	O
blow	O
there	O
all	O
the	O
year	O
;	O
yet	O
without	O
the	O
Tropics	O
,	O
on	O
either	O
side	O
,	O
the	O
winds	O
were	O
variable	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
seas	O
turbulent	O
.	O

In	O
all	O
this	O
he	O
readily	O
acquiesced	O
,	O
and	O
finding	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
draw	O
from	O
me	O
any	O
thing	O
to	O
satisfy	O
his	O
curiosity	O
,	O
by	O
starting	O
leading	O
subjects	O
of	O
conversation	O
,	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
propose	O
his	O
questions	O
in	O
direct	O
terms	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
to	O
know	O
on	O
which	O
side	O
the	O
equator	O
I	O
had	O
crossed	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
.	O

As	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
proper	O
to	O
answer	O
this	O
question	O
,	O
and	O
wished	O
to	O
prevent	O
others	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
kind	O
,	O
I	O
rose	O
up	O
somewhat	O
abruptly	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
believe	O
with	O
some	O
marks	O
of	O
displeasure	O
:	O
at	O
this	O
he	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
disconcerted	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
believe	O
was	O
about	O
to	O
make	O
an	O
apology	O
for	O
his	O
curiosity	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
prevented	O
him	O
,	O
by	O
desiring	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
make	O
my	O
compliments	O
to	O
his	O
Captain	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
return	O
for	O
his	O
obliging	O
civilities	O
present	O
him	O
with	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
arrows	O
that	O
had	O
wounded	O
my	O
men	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
immediately	O
went	O
into	O
my	O
bedroom	O
to	O
fetch	O
:	O
he	O
followed	O
me	O
,	O
looking	O
about	O
him	O
with	O
great	O
curiosity	O
as	O
indeed	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
from	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
his	O
first	O
coming	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
received	O
the	O
arrow	O
,	O
he	O
took	O
his	O
leave	O
.	O

After	O
he	O
was	O
gone	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
made	O
sail	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
upon	O
the	O
deck	O
,	O
where	O
my	O
Lieutenant	O
asked	O
me	O
,	O
if	O
my	O
visitor	O
had	O
entertained	O
me	O
with	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
his	O
voyage	O
.	O

This	O
led	O
me	O
to	O
tell	O
him	O
the	O
general	O
purport	O
of	O
our	O
conversation	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
he	O
assured	O
me	O
that	O
the	O
tale	O
I	O
had	O
heard	O
was	O
a	O
fiction	O
for	O
,	O
says	O
he	O
,	O
the	O
boats	O
crew	O
could	O
not	O
keep	O
their	O
secret	O
so	O
well	O
as	O
their	O
officer	O
,	O
but	O
after	O
a	O
little	O
conversation	O
told	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
born	O
at	O
Quebec	PNM
,	O
and	O
spoke	O
French	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
round	O
the	O
globe	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
we	O
.	O

This	O
naturally	O
excited	O
a	O
general	O
curiosity	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
a	O
very	O
little	O
difficulty	O
we	O
learnt	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
sailed	O
from	O
Europe	PNM
in	O
company	O
with	O
another	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
wanting	O
some	O
repair	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
left	O
at	O
the	O
isle	O
of	O
France	PNM
;	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
attempted	O
to	O
pass	O
the	O
Streight	PNM
of	PNM
Magellan	PNM
the	O
first	O
summer	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
being	O
able	O
,	O
had	O
gone	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
wintered	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
De	PNM
la	PNM
Plata	PNM
;	O
that	O
the	O
summer	O
afterwards	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
more	O
successful	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
passed	O
the	O
Streight	O
,	O
spent	O
two	O
months	O
at	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Juan	PNM
Fernandes	PNM
.	O

My	O
Lieutenant	O
told	O
me	O
also	O
,	O
that	O
a	O
boy	O
in	O
the	O
French	O
boat	O
said	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
upon	O
that	O
island	O
two	O
years	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
while	O
he	O
was	O
there	O
,	O
an	O
English	O
frigate	O
put	O
into	O
the	O
road	O
,	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
anchor	O
,	O
mentioning	O
the	O
time	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
he	O
could	O
recollect	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
it	O
appeared	O
that	O
the	O
frigate	O
he	O
had	O
seen	O
was	O
the	O
Swallow	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
boys	O
being	O
asked	O
how	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
long	O
upon	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Juan	PNM
Fernandes	PNM
,	O
he	O
said	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
taken	O
upon	O
the	O
Spanish	O
coast	O
in	O

he	O
could	O
in	O
no	O
case	O
dispense	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
requested	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
Gentlemen	O
whom	O
I	O
had	O
on	O
board	O
might	O
reside	O
on	O
shore	O
during	O
our	O
stay	O
,	O
*	O
and	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
might	O
go	O
up	O
the	O
country	O
to	O
gather	O
plants	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
he	O
absolutely	O
refused	O
.	O

I	O
judged	O
from	O
his	O
extreme	O
caution	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
severity	O
of	O
these	O
restrictions	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
suspected	O
we	O
were	O
come	O
to	O
trade	O
;	O
I	O
therefore	O
took	O
some	O
pains	O
to	O
convince	O
him	O
of	O
the	O
contrary	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
bound	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
order	O
of	O
his	O
Britannic	O
Majesty	O
,	O
to	O
observe	O
a	O
transit	O
of	O
the	O
planet	O
Venus	O
over	O
the	O
Sun	O
,	O
an	O
astronomical	O
phaenomenon	O
of	O
great	O
importance	O
to	O
navigation	O
.	O

Of	O
the	O
transit	O
of	O
Venus	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
form	O
no	O
other	O
conception	O
,	O
than	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
passing	O
of	O
the	O
North	O
Star	O
through	O
the	O
South	PNM
Pole	PNM
;	O
for	O
these	O
are	O
the	O
very	O
words	O
of	O
his	O
interpreter	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
a	O
Swede	O
,	O
and	O
spoke	O
English	O
very	O
well	O
.	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
it	O
necessary	O
to	O
ask	O
permission	O
for	O
the	O
Gentlemen	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
shore	O
during	O
the	O
day	O
,	O
or	O
that	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
on	O
shore	O
myself	O
,	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
at	O
liberty	O
,	O
taking	O
for	O
granted	O
that	O
nothing	O
was	O
intended	O
to	O
the	O
contrary	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
this	O
I	O
was	O
unfortunately	O
mistaken	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
took	O
leave	O
of	O
his	O
Excellency	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
an	O
officer	O
who	O
had	O
orders	O
to	O
attend	O
me	O
wherever	O
I	O
went	O
:	O
of	O
this	O
I	O
desired	O
an	O
explanation	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
told	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
meant	O
as	O
a	O
compliment	O
;	O
I	O
earnestly	O
desired	O
to	O
be	O
excused	O
from	O
accepting	O
such	O
an	O
honour	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
good	O
Viceroy	O
would	O
by	O
no	O

suffer	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
dispensed	O
with	O

With	O
this	O

,	O
therefore	O
,	O
I	O
returned	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
about	O
twelve	O
o'clock	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
impatiently	O
expected	O
by	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
and	O
Dr.	O
Solander	O
,	O
who	O
made	O
no	O

that	O
a	O
fair	O
account	O
of	O
us	O

given	O
by	O
the	O

who	O
had	O
been	O
on	O

removed	O

my	O

go	O
on	O

dispose	O
of	O
themselves	O

Their	O
disappointment	O
at	O
receiving	O
my	O
report	O
may	O
easily	O
be	O
conceived	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
still	O
increased	O
by	O
an	O
account	O
,	O
*	O
that	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
resolved	O
,	O
not	O
only	O
to	O
prevent	O
their	O
residing	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
going	O
up	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
but	O
even	O
their	O
leaving	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
orders	O
having	O
been	O
given	O
,	O
that	O
no	O
person	O
except	O
the	O

and	O
such	O
common	O
sailors	O
as	O
were	O
required	O
to	O
be	O
upon	O
duty	O
,	O
should	O
be	O
permitted	O
to	O
land	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
probably	O
a	O
particular	O
view	O
to	O
the	O
passengers	O
in	O
this	O
prohibition	O

as	O
they	O
were	O

abroad	O

observations	O

were	O
uncommonly	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O

Dr.	O
Solander	O
dressed	O
themselves	O

in	O
order	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
visit	O
to	O
the	O

they	O
were	O
stopped	O
by	O
the	O
guard-boat	O
which	O
had	O
come	O
off	O
with	O
our	O
pinnace	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
kept	O
hovering	O
round	O
the	O
ship	O
all	O
the	O
while	O
she	O
lay	O
here	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
purpose	O
;	O
the	O
officer	O
on	O

saying	O

that	O

had	O
particular	O
orders	O

could	O
not	O

any	O

to	O
pass	O

After	O
much	O
expostulation	O
to	O
no	O

with	O
whatever	O
reluctance	O

mortification	O

to	O
return	O
on	O
board	O

went	O
on	O

found	O
the	O

inflexible	O

In	O
this	O

I	O
determined	O
,	O
rather	O
than	O
be	O
made	O
a	O
prisoner	O
in	O

to	O

under	O

a	O
compliment	O
,	O
attended	O
me	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
ashore	O

insisted	O
also	O
upon	O
going	O
with	O
me	O
to	O

from	O
the	O

but	O
still	O
imagining	O

that	O
the	O
scrupulous	O
vigilance	O
of	O
the	O

must	O
proceed	O
from	O
some	O
mistaken	O
notion	O
about	O
us	O

which	O
might	O
more	O
easily	O
be	O
removed	O
by	O
writing	O
than	O
in	O

I	O
drew	O
up	O
a	O

Mr.	O

drew	O
up	O
another	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
sent	O
on	O

These	O
memorials	O
were	O
both	O
answered	O

but	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
to	O
our	O
satisfaction	O
;	O
we	O

replied	O
:	O
in	O
consequence	O
of	O
which	O

several	O

papers	O
were	O
interchanged	O
between	O

still	O
without	O

as	O
I	O
thought	O
some	O
degree	O
of	O
force	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
Viceroy	O

to	O
enforce	O

necessary	O
to	O
justify	O
my	O
acquiescence	O
in	O
them	O
to	O

I	O
gave	O

not	O

found	O

to	O

reported	O

refused	O

the	O

the	O

proceeded	O

seized	O
all	O

sent	O
them	O
under	O

uneasiness	O

out	O

about	O
three	O

the	O

accused	O
my	O

of	O

confident	O

was	O
without	O

in	O

Mr.	O
Banks	O
's	O
servants	O
had	O
indeed	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
on	O
the	O
22d	O
at	O
day-break	O
,	O
and	O
stay	O
till	O
it	O
was	O
dark	O
in	O

they	O
brought	O
on	O

having	O
been	O
sent	O
for	O
no	O

And	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
greatest	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
not	O
a	O
single	O
article	O
was	O
smuggled	O
by	O
any	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
who	O
were	O
admitted	O
on	O

many	O
artful	O

were	O
used	O
to	O
tempt	O
them	O
even	O
by	O
the	O
very	O
officers	O
that	O
were	O
under	O
his	O
Excellency	O
's	O
roof	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
the	O
charge	O
still	O
more	O
injurious	O
and	O
provoking	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
indeed	O
some	O
reason	O
to	O
suspect	O
that	O
one	O
poor	O
fellow	O
bought	O
a	O
single	O
bottle	O
of	O
rum	O
with	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
clothes	O
upon	O
his	O
back	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
my	O
answer	O
I	O
requested	O
of	O
his	O
Excellency	O

that	O

if	O
such	O
an	O
attempt	O

Mr.	O

,	O
with	O
much	O

at	O

got	O
the	O

to	O

sent	O
two	O

with	O
the	O

those	O

In	O
about	O
half	O

they	O
had	O
the	O
mortification	O
to	O
see	O
these	O
two	O
men	O
return	O
alone	O
;	O
they	O
said	O

that	O

that	O

This	O
was	O
matter	O
of	O
equal	O
surprise	O

concern	O
,	O
particularly	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
while	O
he	O
was	O
wondering	O
how	O
it	O
could	O
happen	O

missed	O
a	O

the	O
company	O

whole	O

in	O
the	O
knapsack	O

one	O

It	O
was	O
conjectured	O
,	O
that	O
with	O
this	O
Richmond	O
had	O
been	O
rouzed	O
by	O
the	O
two	O
persons	O
who	O
had	O

with	O
him	O

and	O
that	O
,	O
having	O
perhaps	O
drank	O
too	O
freely	O
of	O
it	O
themselves	O

they	O
had	O
all	O

Another	O
fall	O

now	O
came	O
on	O

continued	O
incessantly	O

that	O
all	O
hope	O

those	O
at	O

at	O

Mr.	O
Banks	O
,	O
with	O
four	O

immediately	O
went	O
out	O

found	O

Mr.	O

sent	O
him	O
immediately	O
to	O
the	O
fire	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
by	O
his	O
direction	O

proceeded	O
in	O

he	O
soon	O

found	O

Richmond	O
was	O
upon	O

not	O

was	O
lying	O
upon	O

were	O
now	O
called	O

an	O

this	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
the	O

night	O

the	O

after	O

contented	O
himself	O

that	O

for	O

he	O
would	O
not	O

it	O
happened	O
that	O
one	O

into	O
a	O

of	O
the	O

said	O

the	O

a	O
beach	O

it	O
has	O
the	O

appearance	O
also	O
in	O
three	O

so	O
that	O

the	O

counted	O
four	O

to	O

so	O
that	O
in	O

we	O
were	O
but	O
little	O
nearer	O

the	O

about	O
seven	O
a	O

up	O

before	O
eleven	O
several	O

these	O

as	O
we	O

were	O

the	O

in	O
one	O

up	O

at	O

which	O
we	O
did	O
not	O

at	O

we	O

that	O

they	O
expressed	O
the	O

We	O
then	O
purchased	O
their	O

consisting	O
of	O

a	O

they	O
would	O
not	O

for	O
any	O

a	O

and	O
therefore	O
we	O

them	O
a	O

we	O

we	O

then	O
proceeded	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
watering-place	O
it	O
was	O
intimated	O
to	O
us	O
by	O
signs	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
occupy	O
that	O
ground	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
happened	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
fit	O
for	O
our	O
purpose	O

During	O
our	O
walk	O
they	O
had	O
shaken	O
off	O
their	O
first	O
timid	O
sense	O
of	O
our	O
superiority	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
become	O
familiar	O
:	O
they	O
went	O
with	O
us	O
from	O
the	O
watering-place	O
and	O
took	O
a	O
circuit	O
through	O
the	O
woods	O
:	O
as	O
we	O
went	O
along	O
,	O
we	O
distributed	O
beads	O
and	O
other	O
small	O
presents	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
the	O
satisfaction	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
much	O
gratified	O
.	O

Our	O
circuit	O
was	O
not	O
less	O
than	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
miles	O
,	O
through	O
groves	O
of	O
trees	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
loaded	O
with	O
cocoa-nuts	O
and	O
bread-fruit	O
,	O
and	O
afforded	O
the	O
most	O
grateful	O
shade	O
.	O

Under	O
these	O
trees	O
were	O
the	O
habitations	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
being	O
only	O
a	O
roof	O
without	O

,	O
and	O
the	O
whole	O
scene	O
realized	O

poetical	O

We	O
remarked	O
however	O
,	O
not	O
without	O
some	O
regret	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
all	O
our	O
walk	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
only	O
two	O
hogs	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
a	O
single	O
fowl	O
.	O

Those	O
of	O
our	O
company	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
here	O
with	O
the	O
Dolphin	O
told	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
none	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
whom	O
we	O
had	O
yet	O
seen	O
were	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
class	O
;	O
they	O
suspected	O
that	O
the	O
chiefs	O
had	O
removed	O
,	O
and	O
upon	O
carrying	O
us	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
what	O
they	O
called	O
the	O
Queen	O
's	O
palace	O
had	O
stood	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
no	O
traces	O
of	O
it	O
were	O
left	O

We	O
determined	O
therefore	O
to	O
return	O
in	O

endeavour	O

to	O
find	O

After	O
rowing	O
about	O

they	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
go	O

gave	O
us	O
to	O
understand	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
place	O

We	O
accordingly	O
landed	O

among	O

hundreds	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O

who	O
conducted	O
us	O
into	O
a	O

than	O
any	O
we	O

When	O
we	O

saw	O
a	O

him	O

were	O

he	O
ordered	O
a	O
cock	O

to	O

brought	O
out	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
presented	O
to	O
Mr.	O

we	O
accepted	O
the	O
present	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
each	O
of	O
us	O
received	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
cloth	O

perfumed	O
after	O

Dr.	O

the	O

went	O
out	O

in	O
about	O
half	O

the	O

it	O

a	O

To	O
these	O

I	O
addressed	O
myself	O
by	O

endeavoured	O
to	O

understand	O

that	O
we	O
wanted	O
the	O

we	O
had	O

out	O
to	O
sleep	O
upon	O
for	O

that	O

Whether	O
I	O
was	O
understood	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
certainly	O
determine	O

the	O

behaved	O
with	O
a	O
deference	O

respect	O
that	O
at	O
once	O
pleased	O
and	O
surprised	O
us	O
:	O
they	O
sat	O
down	O
peaceably	O
without	O
the	O

looked	O
on	O

without	O
giving	O

any	O

we	O

done	O

was	O
upwards	O

they	O
had	O
been	O
driven	O
farther	O
up	O
the	O
country	O

the	O
rather	O
,	O
as	O
Owhaw	PNM
was	O
very	O

not	O
to	O
go	O
into	O

which	O
,	O
however	O

partly	O
for	O
these	O
reasons	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
determined	O
to	O
do	O

therefore	O
appointed	O
the	O
thirteen	O
marines	O

a	O
petty	O
officer	O
to	O

set	O
out	O

natives	O
joined	O

we	O
were	O
crossing	O
a	O

river	O
that	O
lay	O
in	O

he	O
had	O

at	O
them	O

and	O
happened	O
to	O
kill	O
three	O
at	O
one	O

this	O
struck	O
them	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
terror	O

so	O
that	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
fell	O
suddenly	O
to	O
the	O
ground	O

as	O
if	O
they	O
also	O
had	O
been	O
shot	O
at	O
the	O

discharge	O

it	O
was	O
not	O
long	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
before	O
they	O
recovered	O
from	O
their	O
fright	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
continued	O
our	O
rout	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
gone	O
far	O
before	O
we	O
were	O
alarmed	O
by	O
the	O
report	O
of	O
two	O
pieces	O

which	O
were	O
fired	O
by	O
the	O

had	O
then	O
straggled	O
a	O
little	O
distance	O
from	O

Owhaw	O
immediately	O
called	O
us	O
together	O

by	O
waving	O
his	O

hastily	O
broke	O

came	O
to	O
us	O
with	O
it	O
in	O

had	O
too	O
much	O
reason	O
to	O

we	O
had	O

so	O
scrupulous	O
of	O
invading	O
their	O
property	O

Mr.	O

a	O

the	O

this	O

Mr.	O

for	O
about	O
two	O

over	O
them	O

These	O
hills	O

which	O
were	O
barren	O

continued	O
for	O
about	O
three	O
miles	O

then	O
terminated	O
in	O
a	O
large	O

that	O

her	O

known	O

an	O

was	O
made	O
to	O

to	O

she	O
readily	O
accepted	O

and	O
came	O
on	O

with	O
two	O
men	O

several	O
women	O
,	O
who	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
all	O
of	O
her	O
family	O
;	O
I	O
received	O
her	O
with	O
such	O
marks	O
of	O
distinction	O
as	O
I	O
thought	O
would	O
gratify	O
her	O
most	O

was	O
not	O

of	O
my	O

this	O

we	O
landed	O

a	O
hog	O

several	O

met	O

the	O

that	O

became	O

her	O

that	O
to	O

him	O
it	O

it	O
had	O
never	O

taken	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
packing-case	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
eighteen	O

and	O
the	O
whole	O
was	O
of	O

a	O

none	O

We	O
at	O
first	O
suspected	O
that	O
it	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
stolen	O
by	O
some	O
of	O
our	O

who	O
seeing	O
a	O

with	O

A	O

offered	O
to	O
any	O

who	O
could	O
find	O
it	O

therefore	O

determined	O
to	O

he	O
should	O

the	O

would	O

or	O
,	O
if	O
in	O

it	O
by	O
the	O
ascendancy	O

He	O
set	O
out	O

accompanied	O
by	O
a	O
midshipman	O

Mr.	O
Green	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
crossing	O

was	O
met	O
by	O
Tubourai	O

three	O

of	O

upon	O

By	O
this	O
Mr.	O

knew	O
that	O
the	O
Indians	O
were	O
the	O
thieves	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
although	O

were	O
not	O
disposed	O

No	O

Mr.	O

made	O
Tubourai	O

understand	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
must	O
instantly	O
go	O
with	O
him	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
whither	O
the	O
quadrant	O
had	O
been	O
carried	O
;	O
he	O
consented	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
set	O
out	O
together	O
to	O
the	O

the	O
Chief	O
inquiring	O
at	O
every	O
house	O
which	O
they	O
passed	O
after	O
the	O
thief	O
by	O
name	O
:	O
the	O

readily	O
told	O
him	O

he	O
was	O
gone	O

and	O
how	O
long	O
it	O
was	O
since	O

there	O
:	O
the	O
hope	O
which	O
this	O
gave	O
them	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
overtake	O
him	O
,	O
supported	O
them	O
under	O
their	O
fatigue	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
pressed	O
forward	O
,	O
sometimes	O
walking	O
,	O
sometimes	O
running	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
weather	O
was	O
intolerably	O
hot	O
;	O
when	O
they	O
had	O
climbed	O
a	O
hill	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
about	O
four	O
miles	O
,	O
their	O
conductor	O
shewed	O
them	O
a	O
point	O
full	O
three	O

gave	O
them	O
to	O

that	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
to	O
expect	O
the	O
instrument	O
till	O
they	O
had	O
got	O
thither	O
.	O

Here	O
they	O
paused	O
;	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
arms	O
,	O
except	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
pistols	O
,	O
which	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
always	O
carried	O
in	O
his	O
pocket	O
;	O
*	O
they	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
a	O
place	O
that	O
was	O
at	O
least	O
seven	O
miles	O
distant	O
from	O
the	O
fort	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
Indians	O
might	O
be	O
less	O
submissive	O
than	O
at	O
home	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
take	O
from	O
them	O
what	O
they	O
had	O
ventured	O
their	O
lives	O
to	O
get	O
;	O
and	O
what	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
our	O
conjectures	O
,	O
they	O
appeared	O
desirous	O
to	O
keep	O
:	O
these	O
were	O
discouraging	O
circumstances	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
situation	O
would	O
become	O
more	O
critical	O
at	O
every	O
step	O
.	O

They	O
determined	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
not	O
to	O
relinquish	O
their	O
enterprize	O
,	O
nor	O
to	O
pursue	O
it	O
without	O
taking	O
the	O
best	O
measures	O
for	O
their	O
security	O
that	O
were	O
in	O
their	O
power	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
therefore	O
determined	O
,	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Green	O
should	O
go	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
Midshipman	O
should	O
return	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
desire	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
send	O
a	O
party	O
of	O
men	O
after	O
them	O
,	O
acquainting	O
me	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
they	O
should	O
return	O
till	O
it	O
was	O
dark	O
.	O

Upon	O
receiving	O
this	O
message	O
I	O
set	O
out	O
,	O
with	O
such	O
a	O
party	O
as	O
I	O
thought	O
sufficient	O
for	O
the	O
occasion	O
;	O
leaving	O
orders	O
,	O
both	O
at	O
the	O
ship	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
fort	O
,	O
that	O
no	O
canoe	O
should	O
be	O
suffered	O
to	O
go	O
out	O

that	O

no	O

violence	O
,	O
which	O
to	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
our	O

was	O
true	O

perhaps	O
the	O

had	O
behaved	O
with	O

Mr.	O

immediately	O
took	O
it	O
from	O
him	O

not	O
a	O

him	O

As	O
it	O
was	O
of	O
infinite	O
importance	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
Indians	O
totally	O
ignorant	O

the	O

had	O
taken	O
every	O
opportunity	O

never	O
offend	O
him	O
so	O
highly	O
as	O
by	O
even	O
touching	O
his	O
piece	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
now	O
proper	O
to	O
enforce	O
this	O
prohibition	O

and	O
he	O
therefore	O
added	O
threats	O
to	O
his	O
reproof	O
:	O
the	O
Indian	O
bore	O
all	O
patiently	O
;	O

Mr.	O

crossed	O

I	O
therefore	O
set	O
out	O
early	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
with	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
and	O
Dr.	O
Solander	O
,	O
and	O
three	O
others	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
pinnace	O

He	O
was	O
now	O
removed	O
from	O
Tettahah	PNM
,	O
where	O
Mr.	O
Hicks	O
had	O
seen	O
him	O
,	O
to	O
a	O
place	O
called	O
ATAHOUROU	PNM
,	O
about	O
six	O
miles	O
farther	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
go	O
above	O
half	O
way	O
thither	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
almost	O
evening	O
before	O
we	O
arrived	O
:	O
we	O
found	O
him	O
in	O
his	O
usual	O
state	O
,	O
sitting	O
under	O
a	O
tree	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
crowd	O
about	O
him	O
.	O

We	O
made	O
our	O
presents	O
in	O
due	O
form	O
,	O
consisting	O
of	O
a	O
yellow	O
stuff	O
petticoat	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
other	O
trifling	O
articles	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
graciously	O
received	O
;	O
a	O
hog	O
was	O
immediately	O
ordered	O
to	O
be	O
killed	O
and	O
dressed	O
for	O
supper	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
promise	O
of	O
more	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
:	O
however	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
less	O
desirous	O
of	O
feasting	O
upon	O
our	O
journey	O
than	O
of	O
carrying	O
back	O
with	O
us	O
provisions	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
welcome	O
at	O
the	O
fort	O
,	O
we	O
procured	O
a	O
reprieve	O
for	O
the	O
hog	O
,	O
and	O
supped	O
upon	O
the	O
fruits	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
.	O

As	O
night	O
now	O
came	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
place	O
was	O
crowded	O
with	O
many	O
more	O
than	O
the	O
houses	O
and	O
canoes	O
would	O
contain	O
;	O
there	O
being	O
Oberea	O
with	O
her	O
attendants	O
,	O
and	O
many	O
other	O
travellers	O
whom	O
we	O
knew	O
,	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
look	O
out	O
for	O
lodgings	O
.	O

Our	O
party	O
consisted	O
of	O
six	O
:	O
*	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
thought	O
himself	O
fortunate	O
in	O
being	O
offered	O
a	O
place	O
by	O
Oberea	O
in	O
her	O
canoe	O
,	O
and	O
wishing	O
his	O
friends	O
a	O
good	O
night	O
,	O
took	O
his	O
leave	O
.	O

He	O
went	O
to	O
rest	O
early	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
custom	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
taking	O
off	O
his	O
clothes	O
,	O
as	O
was	O
his	O
constant	O
practice	O
,	O
the	O
nights	O
being	O
hot	O
,	O
Oberea	PNM
kindly	O
insisted	O
upon	O
taking	O
them	O
into	O
her	O
own	O
custody	O
,	O
for	O
otherwise	O
she	O
said	O
they	O
would	O
certainly	O
be	O
stolen	O
.	O

Mr.	O
Banks	O
having	O
such	O
a	O
safeguard	O
,	O
resigned	O
himself	O
to	O
sleep	O
with	O
all	O
imaginable	O
tranquillity	O
:	O
but	O
awaking	O
about	O
eleven	O
o'clock	O
,	O
and	O
wanting	O
to	O
get	O
up	O
,	O
he	O
searched	O
for	O
his	O
clothes	O
where	O
he	O
had	O
seen	O
them	O
deposited	O
by	O
Oberea	O
when	O
he	O
lay	O
down	O
to	O
sleep	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
perceived	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
missing	O
.	O

He	O
immediately	O
awakened	O
Oberea	O
,	O
who	O
starting	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
hearing	O
his	O
complaint	O
,	O
ordered	O
lights	O
,	O
and	O
prepared	O
in	O
great	O
haste	O
to	O
recover	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
lost	O
:	O
Tootahah	O
himself	O
slept	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
canoe	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
soon	O
alarmed	O
,	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
them	O
and	O
set	O
out	O
with	O
Oberea	O
in	O
search	O
of	O
the	O
thief	O
:	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
was	O
not	O
in	O
a	O
condition	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
of	O
his	O
apparel	O
scarce	O
any	O
thing	O
was	O
left	O
him	O
but	O
his	O
breeches	O
;	O
his	O
coat	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
waistcoat	O
,	O
with	O
his	O
pistols	O
,	O
powder-horn	O
,	O
and	O
many	O
other	O
things	O
that	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
pockets	O
,	O
were	O
gone	O
.	O

In	O
about	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
his	O
two	O
noble	O
friends	O
returned	O
,	O
but	O
without	O
having	O
obtained	O
any	O
intelligence	O
of	O
his	O
clothes	O
or	O
of	O
the	O
thief	O
.	O

At	O
first	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
alarmed	O
,	O
his	O
musquet	O
had	O
not	O
indeed	O
been	O
taken	O
away	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
had	O
neglected	O
to	O
load	O
it	O
;	O
where	O
I	O
and	O
Dr.	O
Solander	O
had	O
disposed	O
of	O
ourselves	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
,	O
whatever	O
might	O
happen	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
recourse	O
to	O
us	O
for	O
assistance	O
.	O

He	O
thought	O
it	O
best	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
to	O
express	O
neither	O
fear	O
nor	O
suspicion	O
of	O
those	O
about	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
giving	O
his	O
musquet	O
to	O
Tupia	PNM
,	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
waked	O
in	O
the	O
confusion	O
and	O
stood	O
by	O
him	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
charge	O
not	O
to	O
suffer	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
stolen	O
,	O
he	O
betook	O
himself	O
again	O
to	O
rest	O
,	O
declaring	O
himself	O
perfectly	O
satisfied	O
with	O
the	O
pains	O
that	O
Tootahah	O
and	O
Oberea	PNM
had	O
taken	O
to	O
recover	O
his	O
things	O
,	O
*	O
though	O
they	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
successful	O

As	O
it	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
supposed	O
that	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
situation	O
his	O
sleep	O
was	O
very	O
sound	O
,	O
he	O
soon	O
after	O
heard	O
music	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
lights	O
at	O
a	O
little	O
distance	O
on	O
shore	O
:	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
concert	O
or	O
assembly	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
call	O
a	O
HEIVA	O
,	O
a	O
common	O
name	O
for	O
every	O
public	O
exhibition	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
it	O
would	O
necessarily	O
bring	O
many	O
people	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
chance	O
of	O
my	O
being	O
among	O
them	O
with	O
his	O
other	O
friends	O
,	O
he	O
rose	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
his	O
way	O
towards	O
it	O
:	O
he	O
was	O
soon	O
led	O
by	O
the	O
lights	O
and	O
the	O
sound	O
to	O
the	O
hut	O
where	O
I	O
lay	O
,	O
with	O
three	O
other	O
Gentlemen	O
of	O
our	O
party	O
;	O
and	O
easily	O
distinguishing	O
us	O
from	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
he	O
made	O
up	O
to	O
us	O
more	O
than	O
half	O
naked	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
us	O
his	O
melancholy	O
story	O
.	O

We	O
gave	O
him	O
such	O
comfort	O
as	O
the	O
unfortunate	O
generally	O
give	O
to	O
each	O
other	O
,	O
by	O
telling	O
him	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
fellow-sufferers	O
;	O
I	O
showed	O
him	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
myself	O
without	O
stockings	O
,	O
they	O
having	O
been	O
stolen	O
from	O
under	O
my	O
head	O

though	O
I	O
was	O
sure	O
I	O
had	O
never	O
been	O
asleep	O
,	O
and	O
each	O
of	O
my	O
associates	O
convinced	O
him	O
,	O
by	O
his	O
appearance	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
lost	O
a	O
jacket	O

We	O
determined	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
to	O
hear	O
out	O
the	O
concert	O
,	O
however	O
deficient	O
we	O
might	O
appear	O
in	O
our	O
dress	O

consisted	O
of	O
three	O
drums	O

this	O
entertainment	O

which	O
lasted	O
about	O

was	O
over	O

retired	O
again	O
to	O

agreed	O

that	O
nothing	O

We	O
rose	O
at	O
day-break	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
custom	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
;	O
the	O
first	O
man	O
that	O
Mr.	O

saw	O
was	O
Tupia	O
,	O
faithfully	O
attending	O
with	O
his	O
musquet	O
;	O
and	O
soon	O
after	O
,	O
Oberea	O
brought	O
him	O
some	O
of	O
her	O
country	O
clothes	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
succedaneum	O
for	O
his	O
own	O

so	O
that	O
when	O
he	O
came	O

made	O
a	O
most	O
motley	O
appearance	O

half	O
Indian	O
and	O
half	O
English	O

Our	O
party	O
soon	O
got	O
together	O

Dr.	O

whose	O
quarters	O
we	O
did	O

in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
Tootahah	O
made	O
his	O
appearance	O
,	O
*	O
and	O
we	O
pressed	O
him	O
to	O
recover	O
our	O
clothes	O
;	O
but	O
neither	O
he	O
nor	O
Oberea	O
could	O
be	O
persuaded	O
to	O
take	O
any	O
measure	O
for	O
that	O
purpose	O

so	O
that	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
suspect	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
parties	O
in	O
the	O
theft	O

About	O
eight	O
o'clock	O

we	O
were	O
joined	O
by	O
Dr.	O

given	O
up	O
all	O

of	O
recovering	O
our	O
clothes	O
,	O
which	O
indeed	O
were	O
never	O
afterwards	O

spent	O
all	O
the	O
morning	O
in	O
soliciting	O
the	O
hogs	O

we	O
had	O
been	O
promised	O
;	O

in	O
this	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
better	O
success	O
:	O
we	O
therefore	O
,	O
in	O
no	O
very	O
good	O
humour	O
,	O
set	O
out	O
for	O
the	O
boat	O
about	O
twelve	O
o'clock	O

with	O
only	O
that	O
which	O

As	O
we	O
were	O
returning	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
entertained	O
with	O
a	O
sight	O
that	O
in	O
some	O
measure	O
compensated	O
for	O
our	O
fatigue	O
and	O
disappointment	O

In	O
our	O
way	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
few	O
places	O
where	O
access	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
is	O
not	O
guarded	O
by	O
a	O
reef	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
consequently	O
,	O
a	O
high	O
surf	O
breaks	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
a	O
more	O
dreadful	O
one	O
indeed	O
I	O
had	O
seldom	O
seen	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
any	O
European	O
boat	O
to	O
have	O
lived	O
in	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
the	O
best	O
swimmer	O
in	O
Europe	PNM
had	O
,	O
by	O
any	O
accident	O
,	O
been	O
exposed	O
to	O
its	O
fury	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
confident	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
preserve	O
himself	O
from	O
drowning	O
,	O
especially	O
as	O
the	O
shore	O
was	O
covered	O
with	O
pebbles	O
and	O
large	O
stones	O
;	O
yet	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
midst	O
of	O
these	O
breakers	O
,	O
were	O
ten	O
or	O
twelve	O
Indians	O
swimming	O
for	O
their	O
amusement	O
:	O
whenever	O
a	O
surf	O
broke	O
near	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
dived	O
under	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
to	O
all	O
appearance	O
with	O
infinite	O
facility	O
,	O
rose	O
again	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O

This	O
diversion	O
was	O
greatly	O
improved	O
by	O
the	O
stern	O
of	O
an	O
old	O
canoe	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
happened	O
to	O
find	O
upon	O
the	O
spot	O
;	O
they	O
took	O
this	O
before	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
swam	O
out	O
with	O
it	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
outermost	O
breach	O

two	O

them	O

into	O
it	O
,	O
*	O
and	O
turning	O
the	O
square	O
end	O
to	O
the	O
breaking	O
wave	O
,	O
were	O
driven	O
in	O
towards	O
the	O
shore	O
with	O
incredible	O
rapidity	O
,	O
sometimes	O
almost	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O
;	O
but	O
generally	O
the	O
wave	O
broke	O
over	O
them	O
before	O
they	O
got	O
half	O
way	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
case	O
they	O
dived	O

and	O
rose	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
with	O
the	O
canoe	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O
:	O
they	O

swam	O
out	O

it	O
again	O

were	O
again	O
driven	O
back	O

just	O
as	O
our	O

hill	O
in	O

the	O
pleasure	O

what	O
I	O
thought	O
a	O
happy	O

It	O
happened	O
that	O
above	O
twenty	O
of	O
their	O
sailing	O
canoes	O
were	O
just	O
come	O
in	O
with	O
a	O
supply	O
of	O
fish	O

upon	O

I	O

seized	O
,	O
and	O
bringing	O
them	O
into	O
the	O
river	O
behind	O
the	O
fort	O

gave	O

from	O

the	O

no	O

were	O

A	O
list	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
was	O
made	O
out	O
,	O
consisting	O
principally	O
of	O
the	O
rake	O

the	O
musquet	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
taken	O
from	O
the	O

was	O
shot	O
;	O

the	O

About	O
noon	O
,	O
the	O
rake	O
was	O
restored	O

and	O
great	O
solicitation	O
was	O
made	O
for	O
the	O
release	O
of	O
the	O

;	O
but	O
I	O
still	O
insisted	O
upon	O

The	O
next	O

came	O
,	O
and	O
nothing	O
farther	O
was	O
restored	O
,	O
at	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
much	O
surprised	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
people	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
utmost	O
distress	O
for	O
the	O
fish	O
,	O
which	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
would	O
be	O
spoilt	O
;	O
I	O
was	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
reduced	O
to	O
a	O
disagreeable	O
situation	O
,	O
either	O
of	O
releasing	O
the	O
canoes	O
,	O
contrary	O
to	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
solemnly	O
and	O
publickly	O
declared	O
,	O
or	O
to	O
detain	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
great	O
injury	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
were	O
innocent	O
,	O
without	O
answering	O
any	O
good	O
purpose	O
to	O
ourselves	O
:	O
as	O
a	O
temporary	O
expedient	O
,	O
I	O
permitted	O
them	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
fish	O
;	O
but	O
still	O
detained	O
the	O
canoes	O
.	O

This	O
very	O
licence	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
was	O
productive	O
of	O
new	O
confusion	O
and	O
injury	O
;	O
for	O

it	O
not	O
being	O
easy	O
at	O

to	O
distinguish	O
to	O
what	O
particular	O
persons	O

about	O

all	O
our	O
caution	O
,	O
very	O
near	O
embroiling	O

I	O
sent	O
the	O

on	O

not	O
immediately	O
finding	O
stones	O
convenient	O
for	O

purpose	O

began	O
to	O
pull	O
down	O
some	O

they	O
deposited	O

down	O

not	O

Mr.	O

immediately	O
repaired	O
to	O

an	O
amicable	O
end	O

put	O
to	O

sending	O
the	O

to	O

enough	O
were	O
to	O

gathered	O
without	O
a	O
possibility	O
of	O

offence	O

It	O
is	O
very	O
remarkable	O

that	O
these	O
Indians	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O

more	O

These	O
circumstances	O
having	O
strongly	O
excited	O
our	O
curiosity	O
,	O
we	O
enquired	O
who	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
informed	O
,	O
that	O
Oamo	O
was	O
the	O
husband	O
of	O
Oberea	PNM
,	O
though	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
separated	O
by	O
mutual	O
consent	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
young	O
woman	O
and	O
the	O
boy	O
were	O
their	O
children	O
.	O

We	O
learnt	O
also	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
boy	O
,	O
whose	O
name	O
was	O
TERRIDIRI	O
,	O
was	O
heir	O
apparent	O
to	O
the	O
sovereignty	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
his	O
sister	O
was	O
intended	O
for	O
his	O
wife	O
,	O
the	O
marriage	O
being	O
deferred	O
only	O
till	O
he	O
should	O
arrive	O
at	O
a	O
proper	O
age	O
.	O

The	O
sovereign	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
was	O
a	O
son	O
of	O
WHAPPAI	O
,	O
whose	O
name	O
was	O
OUTOU	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
,	O
as	O
before	O
has	O
been	O
observed	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
minor	O
.	O

Whappai	O
,	O
Oamo	O
,	O
and	O
Tootahah	O
,	O
were	O
brothers	O
:	O
Whappai	O
was	O
the	O
eldest	O
,	O
and	O
Oamo	O
the	O
second	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
Whappai	O
having	O
no	O
child	O

Outou	O
,	O
Terridiri	O
,	O
the	O
son	O
of	O
his	O
next	O
brother	O
Oamo	O
,	O
was	O
heir	O
to	O
the	O
sovereignty	O
.	O

It	O
will	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
seem	O
strange	O
that	O
a	O
boy	O
should	O
be	O
sovereign	O
during	O
the	O
life	O
of	O
his	O
father	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
custom	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
a	O
child	O
succeeds	O
to	O
a	O
father	O

title	O
and	O
authority	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
born	O

elected	O

and	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

about	O
eight	O

we	O

this	O
was	O

with	O

a	O

about	O
five	O

whose	O

from	O

we	O
had	O
reason	O

When	O
Mathiabo	O
perceived	O
what	O
was	O
doing	O
,	O
he	O
also	O
pretended	O
to	O
want	O
a	O
cloak	O
;	O

,	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
behaved	O
very	O
well	O

done	O

some	O
service	O

a	O
cloak	O
was	O
ordered	O
for	O
him	O

We	O
lay	O
down	O

and	O
observed	O
that	O
Mathiabo	O
was	O
not	O
with	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
supposed	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
gone	O
to	O
bathe	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
Indians	O
always	O
do	O
before	O

We	O
had	O
not	O

long	O

when	O
an	O
Indian	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
a	O
stranger	O
to	O
us	O

came	O

told	O
Mr.	O

that	O
the	O
cloak	O
and	O
Mathiabo	PNM
had	O
disappeared	O
together	O

This	O
man	O
had	O
so	O
far	O
gained	O
our	O
confidence	O

that	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
at	O

As	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
pursue	O
the	O
thief	O
with	O
any	O

of	O
success	O
,	O
without	O
the	O
assistance	O
of	O
the	O

Mr.	O

started	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
telling	O
our	O
case	O

required	O
them	O
to	O
recover	O
the	O

the	O

think	O

the	O

he	O
made	O
his	O

When	O
we	O

we	O
found	O
the	O

known	O

no	O

were	O

more	O

trouble	O

for	O
about	O
five	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
our	O
sentry	O
alarmed	O
us	O
,	O
with	O
an	O
account	O
that	O
the	O
boat	O
was	O
missing	O
:	O
he	O
had	O
seen	O
her	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
about	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O

,	O
at	O
her	O
grappling	O

which	O
was	O
not	O
above	O
fifty	O

from	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O

upon	O
hearing	O
the	O
sound	O
of	O

he	O
had	O
looked	O
out	O
again	O

and	O
could	O
see	O
nothing	O

At	O
this	O
account	O
we	O
started	O
up	O
greatly	O
alarmed	O

ran	O
to	O
the	O
water	O

the	O
morning	O

there	O
was	O
no	O

broken	O

her	O

we	O
had	O
great	O
reason	O
to	O
fear	O
that	O
the	O
Indians	O
had	O
attacked	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
finding	O
the	O
people	O
asleep	O

their	O
enterprize	O

For	O
about	O

about	O
four	O

of	O
which	O
they	O
accepted	O

after	O
a	O

they	O
walked	O
forward	O
for	O
a	O

;	O
in	O
bad	O

it	O
is	O
not	O
easy	O
to	O

they	O

about	O
six	O

following	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
the	O

Soon	O

found	O
the	O
river	O
banked	O
by	O
steep	O
rocks	O

from	O
which	O
a	O
cascade	O
,	O
falling	O
with	O

formed	O
a	O
pool	O

so	O
steep	O

that	O
the	O
Indians	O
said	O

They	O
seemed	O

indeed	O

not	O
much	O
to	O

with	O
the	O

found	O
plenty	O

The	O
way	O
up	O

was	O
in	O

nearly	O

in	O
some	O

one	O
hundred	O

they	O
were	O
also	O
rendered	O

issued	O
from	O

yet	O
up	O

a	O

for	O
the	O

take	O

their	O

to	O
preserve	O
an	O

the	O

to	O

enquiry	O

after	O
them	O
of	O

told	O
us	O

that	O

had	O

it	O
was	O
impossible	O

the	O
search	O

after	O
some	O
deliberation	O

two	O
of	O

undertook	O
to	O

think	O
proper	O
to	O
send	O
after	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
place	O

their	O
retreat	O

As	O
they	O
were	O
known	O
to	O
be	O
without	O
arms	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
two	O
would	O
be	O
sufficient	O
,	O
and	O
accordingly	O
dispatched	O
a	O
petty	O
officer	O

the	O
corporal	O
of	O
the	O

with	O

As	O
the	O
recovery	O
of	O
these	O
men	O
was	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
great	O
importance	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
time	O
to	O
lose	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
the	O
Indians	O
spoke	O
doubtfully	O
of	O
their	O
return	O
,	O
telling	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
each	O
of	O
them	O
taken	O
a	O
wife	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
become	O
inhabitants	O
of	O
the	O
country	O

it	O
was	O
intimated	O
to	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
Chiefs	O
who	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
fort	O
with	O
their	O
women	O

among	O
whom	O
were	O
Tubourai	O
Tamaide	O

Tomio	O
,	O
and	O
Oberea	PNM

that	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
permitted	O
to	O
leave	O
it	O
till	O
our	O
deserters	O
were	O
brought	O
back	O
.	O

This	O
precaution	O
I	O
thought	O
the	O
more	O
necessary	O
,	O
as	O
,	O
by	O
concealing	O
them	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
,	O
they	O
might	O
compel	O
me	O
to	O
go	O
without	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
pleasure	O
to	O
observe	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
received	O
the	O
intimation	O
with	O
very	O
little	O
signs	O
either	O
of	O
fear	O
or	O
discontent	O
;	O
assuring	O
me	O
that	O
my	O
people	O
should	O
be	O
secured	O
and	O
sent	O
back	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
possible	O

While	O
this	O
was	O
doing	O
at	O
the	O
fort	O

I	O
sent	O
Mr.	O
Hicks	O
in	O
the	O
pinnace	O
to	O
fetch	O
Tootahah	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
*	O
which	O
he	O
did	O
,	O
without	O
alarming	O
either	O
him	O
or	O
his	O
people	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
Indian	O
guides	O
proved	O
faithful	O
and	O
in	O

I	O
had	O
reason	O

expect	O
the	O
return	O

the	O
deserters	O

disappointed	O

,	O
on	O
the	O

became	O

he	O

of	O
armed	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
having	O
learnt	O
that	O
Tootahah	O

themselves	O
in	O
a	O

purpose	O

who	O
having	O
taken	O
them	O
at	O

disadvantage	O
,	O
forced	O
their	O

out	O

declared	O

that	O
they	O
would	O
detain	O
them	O
till	O
their	O
Chief	O
should	O
be	O
set	O
at	O

He	O
said	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
Indians	O
were	O
not	O
unanimous	O
in	O
this	O
measure	O
;	O
that	O
some	O
were	O
for	O
setting	O
them	O
at	O
liberty	O

and	O
others	O
for	O
detaining	O
them	O
:	O
that	O
an	O
eager	O
dispute	O
ensued	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
from	O
words	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
blows	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
party	O
for	O
detaining	O
them	O
at	O
length	O
prevailed	O
:	O
that	O
soon	O
after	O
,	O
Webb	O
and	O
Gibson	O
were	O
brought	O
in	O
by	O
a	O
party	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
as	O
prisoners	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
also	O
might	O
be	O
secured	O
as	O
hostages	O
for	O
the	O
Chief	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
after	O
some	O
debate	O
resolved	O
to	O
send	O
Webb	O
to	O
inform	O
me	O
of	O
their	O
resolution	O

assure	O
me	O

it	O
appears	O
that	O
whatever	O
were	O
the	O
disadvantages	O
of	O
seizing	O
the	O

,	O
I	O
should	O
never	O

On	O
the	O
16th	O

we	O
had	O
a	O
gentle	O
breeze	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
about	O
eight	O

we	O
sounded	O

no	O

Some	O
canoes	O
very	O
soon	O
came	O
off	O

the	O

seemed	O
afraid	O

kept	O
at	O

they	O
discovered	O

they	O

of	O
the	O

that	O
came	O
up	O
to	O
the	O

was	O
the	O

Upon	O

repeated	O

came	O
on	O

At	O
first	O
they	O
were	O
struck	O
with	O
astonishment	O
,	O
and	O
wondered	O
at	O
every	O
thing	O
that	O
was	O
shewn	O
them	O
;	O
yet	O
they	O
made	O
no	O
enquiries	O

seeming	O
to	O
be	O
satisfied	O
with	O
what	O
was	O
offered	O
to	O
their	O
notice	O

they	O
made	O
no	O

with	O
which	O
it	O
was	O

After	O
some	O

In	O
the	O

of	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
I	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
*	O
accompanied	O
by	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
and	O
Dr.	O
Solander	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
pinnace	O
and	O
yawl	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
party	O
of	O
men	O
.	O

We	O
landed	O
abreast	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
here	O
about	O
forty	O
yards	O
broad	O
;	O
but	O
seeing	O
some	O
natives	O
on	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
whom	O
I	O
wished	O
to	O
speak	O
with	O
,	O
and	O
finding	O
the	O
river	O
not	O
fordable	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
yawl	O
in	O
to	O
carry	O
us	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
the	O
pinnace	O
at	O
the	O
entrance	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
near	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
the	O
people	O
were	O
assembled	O
,	O
they	O
all	O
ran	O
away	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
we	O
landed	O
,	O
and	O
leaving	O
four	O
boys	O
to	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
the	O
yawl	O
,	O
we	O
walked	O
up	O
to	O
some	O
huts	O
which	O
were	O
about	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
hundred	O
yards	O
from	O
the	O
water-side	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
got	O
some	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
four	O
men	O
,	O
armed	O
with	O
long	O
lances	O
,	O
rushed	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
and	O
running	O
up	O
to	O
attack	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
would	O
certainly	O
have	O
cut	O
her	O
off	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
pinnace	O
had	O
not	O
discovered	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
called	O
to	O
the	O
boys	O
to	O
drop	O
down	O
the	O
stream	O
:	O
the	O
boys	O
instantly	O
obeyed	O
;	O
but	O
being	O
closely	O
pursued	O
by	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
the	O
Cockswain	O
of	O
the	O
pinnace	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
the	O
charge	O
of	O
the	O
boats	O
,	O
fired	O
a	O
musquet	O
over	O
their	O
heads	O
;	O
at	O
this	O
they	O
stopped	O
and	O
looked	O
round	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
renewed	O
the	O
pursuit	O
,	O
brandishing	O
their	O
lances	O
in	O
a	O
threatening	O
manner	O
:	O
the	O
Cockswain	O
then	O
fired	O
a	O
second	O
musquet	O
over	O
their	O
heads	O
,	O
but	O
of	O
this	O
they	O
took	O
no	O
notice	O
;	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
lifting	O
up	O
his	O
spear	O
to	O
dart	O
it	O
at	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
another	O
piece	O
was	O
fired	O
,	O
which	O
shot	O
him	O
dead	O
.	O

When	O
he	O
fell	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
three	O
stood	O
motionless	O
for	O
some	O
minutes	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
petrified	O
with	O
astonishment	O
;	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
recovered	O
,	O
they	O
went	O
back	O
,	O
dragging	O
after	O
them	O
the	O
dead	O
body	O
,	O
which	O
however	O
they	O
soon	O
left	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
might	O
not	O
incumber	O
their	O
flight	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
report	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
musquet	O
we	O
drew	O
together	O
,	O
having	O
straggled	O
to	O
a	O
little	O
distance	O
from	O
each	O
other	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
our	O
way	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
;	O
and	O
crossing	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
we	O
soon	O
saw	O
the	O
Indian	O
lying	O
dead	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
.	O

Upon	O
examining	O
the	O
body	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
shot	O
through	O
the	O
heart	O
:	O
*	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
the	O
middle	O

stature	O
;	O
his	O
complexion	O
was	O
brown	O

but	O
not	O
very	O
dark	O
;	O
and	O
one	O
side	O
of	O
his	O
face	O
was	O
tattowed	O
in	O
spiral	O
lines	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
regular	O
figure	O

he	O
was	O

In	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
several	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
seen	O
the	O
night	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
walking	O
with	O
a	O
quick	O
pace	O
towards	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
had	O
landed	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
unarmed	O
;	O
but	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
with	O
long	O
pikes	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
was	O
desirous	O
to	O
establish	O
an	O
intercourse	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
three	O
boats	O
to	O
be	O
manned	O
with	O
seamen	O
and	O
marines	O
,	O
and	O
proceeded	O
towards	O
the	O
shore	O

accompanied	O
by	O
Mr.	O

Solander	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
Gentlemen	O
,	O
and	O
Tupia	O
;	O
about	O
fifty	O
of	O
them	O
seemed	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
our	O
landing	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
opposite	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
thought	O
a	O
sign	O
of	O
fear	O
,	O
and	O
seated	O
themselves	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
:	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
myself	O

with	O
only	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
,	O
Dr.	O
Solander	O
,	O
and	O
Tupia	O
,	O
landed	O
from	O
the	O
little	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
advanced	O
towards	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
proceeded	O
many	O
paces	O
before	O
they	O
all	O
started	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
every	O
man	O
produced	O
either	O
a	O
long	O
pike	O
,	O
or	O
a	O
small	O
weapon	O
of	O
green	O
Talc	O
,	O
extremely	O
well	O

about	O
a	O
foot	O

and	O
thick	O
enough	O
to	O
weigh	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
pounds	O
:	O
Tupia	O
called	O
to	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
language	O
of	O
Otaheite	PNM
;	O
but	O
they	O
answered	O
only	O
by	O
flourishing	O
their	O
weapons	O
,	O
and	O
making	O
signs	O
to	O
us	O
to	O
depart	O
;	O
a	O
musquet	O
was	O
then	O
fired	O
wide	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
ball	O
struck	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
the	O
river	O
being	O
still	O
between	O
us	O
:	O
they	O
saw	O
the	O
effect	O
,	O
and	O
desisted	O
from	O
their	O
threats	O
;	O
*	O
but	O
we	O
thought	O
it	O
prudent	O
to	O
retreat	O
till	O
the	O
marines	O
could	O
be	O
landed	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
soon	O
done	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
marched	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
jack	O
carried	O
before	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
a	O
little	O
bank	O
,	O
about	O
fifty	O
yards	O
from	O
the	O
water-side	O
;	O
here	O
they	O
were	O
drawn	O
up	O
,	O

I	O
again	O
advanced	O

with	O
Mr.	O

Tupia	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Green	O
,	O
and	O
Mr.	O

,	O
being	O
with	O
us	O
.	O

Tupia	O
was	O
again	O
directed	O
to	O
speak	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
with	O
great	O
pleasure	O
that	O
we	O
perceived	O
he	O
was	O
perfectly	O
understood	O
,	O
he	O
and	O
the	O
natives	O
speaking	O
only	O
different	O
dialects	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
language	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
we	O
wanted	O
provision	O
and	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
give	O
them	O
iron	O
in	O
exchange	O
,	O
the	O
properties	O
of	O
which	O
he	O
explained	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
able	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
willing	O
to	O
trade	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
come	O
over	O
to	O
them	O
for	O
that	O
purpose	O
:	O
to	O
this	O
we	O
consented	O
,	O
provided	O
they	O
would	O
lay	O
by	O
their	O
arms	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
be	O
persuaded	O
to	O
do	O
.	O

During	O
this	O
conversation	O
,	O
Tupia	O
warned	O
us	O
to	O
be	O
upon	O
our	O
guard	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
our	O
friends	O
:	O
we	O
then	O
pressed	O
them	O
in	O
our	O
turn	O
to	O
come	O
over	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
stripped	O
himself	O
,	O
and	O
swam	O
over	O
without	O
his	O
arms	O
:	O
he	O
was	O
almost	O
immediately	O
followed	O
by	O
two	O
more	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
after	O
by	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
twenty	O
or	O
thirty	O
;	O
but	O
these	O
brought	O
their	O
arms	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
made	O
them	O
all	O
presents	O
of	O
iron	O
and	O
beads	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
set	O
little	O
value	O
upon	O
either	O
,	O
particularly	O
the	O
iron	O
,	O
not	O
having	O
the	O
least	O
idea	O
of	O
its	O
use	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
got	O
nothing	O
in	O
return	O
but	O
a	O
few	O
feathers	O
:	O
they	O
offered	O
indeed	O
to	O
exchange	O
their	O
arms	O
for	O
ours	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
refused	O
,	O
made	O
many	O
attempts	O
to	O
snatch	O
them	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
hands	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
came	O
over	O
,	O
Tupia	O
repeated	O
his	O
declaration	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
our	O
friends	O
,	O
and	O
again	O
warned	O
us	O
to	O
be	O
upon	O
our	O
guard	O
;	O
their	O
attempts	O
to	O
snatch	O
our	O
weapons	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
did	O
not	O
succeed	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
gave	O
them	O
to	O
understand	O
by	O
Tupia	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
obliged	O
to	O
kill	O
them	O
if	O
they	O
offered	O
any	O
farther	O
violence	O

In	O

however	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Green	O
happening	O
to	O
turn	O
about	O

one	O
of	O
them	O
snatched	O
away	O
his	O
hanger	O

and	O
retiring	O
to	O
a	O
little	O
distance	O
,	O
waved	O
it	O
round	O
his	O
head	O

with	O
a	O
shout	O
of	O
exultation	O

the	O
rest	O
now	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
extremely	O
insolent	O

coming	O
to	O
join	O
them	O
from	O
the	O

the	O

To	O
my	O
great	O
regret	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
no	O
place	O
where	O
I	O
could	O
land	O
,	O
*	O
a	O
dangerous	O
surf	O
every	O
where	O
beating	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
saw	O
two	O
canoes	O
coming	O
in	O
from	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
one	O
under	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
worked	O
with	O
paddles	O
.	O

I	O
thought	O
this	O
a	O
favourable	O
opportunity	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
into	O
my	O
possession	O
without	O
mischief	O
,	O
as	O
those	O
in	O
the	O
canoe	O
were	O
probably	O
fishermen	O
and	O
without	O
arms	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
three	O
boats	O
full	O
of	O
men	O
.	O

I	O
therefore	O
disposed	O
the	O
boats	O
so	O
as	O
most	O
effectually	O
to	O
intercept	O
them	O
in	O
their	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
the	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
canoe	O
that	O
was	O
paddled	O
perceived	O
us	O
so	O
soon	O
,	O
that	O
by	O
making	O
to	O
the	O
nearest	O
land	O
with	O
their	O
utmost	O
strength	O
,	O
they	O
escaped	O
us	O
;	O
the	O
other	O
sailed	O
on	O
till	O
she	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
midst	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
without	O
discerning	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
moment	O
she	O
discovered	O
us	O
,	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
board	O
struck	O
their	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
to	O
their	O
paddles	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
plied	O
so	O
briskly	O
that	O
she	O
out-ran	O
the	O
boat	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
however	O
within	O
hearing	O
,	O
and	O
Tupia	O
called	O
out	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
come	O
along	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
promised	O
for	O
us	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
come	O
to	O
no	O
hurt	O
:	O
they	O
chose	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
rather	O
to	O
trust	O
to	O
their	O
paddles	O
than	O
our	O
promises	O
,	O
and	O
continued	O
to	O
make	O
from	O
us	O
with	O
all	O
their	O
power	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
ordered	O
a	O
musquet	O
to	O
be	O
fired	O
over	O
their	O
heads	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
least	O
exceptionable	O
expedient	O
to	O
accomplish	O
my	O
design	O
,	O
hoping	O
it	O
would	O
either	O
make	O
them	O
surrender	O
or	O
leap	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
.	O

Upon	O
the	O
discharge	O
of	O
the	O
piece	O
,	O
they	O
ceased	O
paddling	O
;	O
and	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
being	O
seven	O
in	O
number	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
strip	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
imagined	O
to	O
jump	O
overboard	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
happened	O
otherwise	O
.	O

They	O
immediately	O
formed	O
a	O
resolution	O
not	O
to	O
fly	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
fight	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
the	O
boat	O
came	O
up	O
,	O
they	O
began	O
the	O
attack	O
with	O
their	O
paddles	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
stones	O
and	O
other	O
offensive	O
weapons	O
that	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
so	O
vigorously	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
fire	O
upon	O
them	O
in	O
our	O
own	O
defence	O
:	O
four	O
were	O
unhappily	O
killed	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
three	O
who	O
were	O
boys	O
,	O
the	O
eldest	O
about	O
nineteen	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
youngest	O
about	O
eleven	O
,	O
instantly	O
leaped	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
;	O
the	O
eldest	O
swam	O
with	O
great	O
vigour	O
,	O
*	O
and	O
resisted	O
the	O
attempts	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
to	O
take	O
him	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
by	O
every	O
effort	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
make	O
:	O
he	O
was	O
however	O
at	O
last	O
overpowered	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
were	O
taken	O
up	O
with	O
less	O
difficulty	O
.	O

I	O
am	O
conscious	O
that	O
the	O
feeling	O
of	O
every	O
reader	O
of	O
humanity	O
will	O
censure	O
me	O
for	O
having	O
fired	O
upon	O
these	O
unhappy	O
people	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
impossible	O
that	O
,	O
upon	O
a	O
calm	O
review	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
approve	O
it	O
myself	O

They	O
certainly	O
did	O
not	O
deserve	O
death	O
for	O
not	O
chusing	O

confide	O
in	O
my	O

or	O
not	O

even	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
apprehended	O
no	O
danger	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
my	O
service	O
required	O
me	O
to	O
obtain	O
a	O
knowlege	O
of	O
their	O
country	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
could	O
no	O

by	O
forcing	O
my	O
way	O
into	O

in	O
a	O

or	O
gaining	O
admission	O
through	O
the	O
confidence	O

good-will	O
of	O
the	O

I	O
had	O
already	O
tried	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
presents	O
without	O
effect	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
now	O
prompted	O

by	O
my	O
desire	O
to	O
avoid	O
further	O
hostilities	O
,	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
of	O

on	O

to	O

told	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
a	O
large	O
body	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
was	O
in	O
sight	O
,	O
and	O
advancing	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
rate	O
.	O

Upon	O
receiving	O
this	O
intelligence	O
,	O
*	O
we	O
drew	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
our	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
boats	O
;	O
we	O
had	O
scarcely	O
begun	O
to	O
put	O
this	O
into	O
execution	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
three	O
Indian	O
boys	O
started	O
suddenly	O
from	O
some	O
bushes	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
concealed	O
themselves	O
,	O
and	O
again	O
claimed	O
our	O
protection	O
:	O
we	O
readily	O
received	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
repairing	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O
as	O
the	O
clearest	O
place	O
,	O
we	O
walked	O
briskly	O
towards	O
the	O
boats	O
.	O

The	O
Indians	O
were	O
in	O
two	O
bodies	O
;	O
one	O
ran	O
along	O
the	O
bank	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
quitted	O
by	O
the	O
marines	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
fetched	O
a	O
compass	O
by	O
the	O
swamp	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
see	O
them	O
:	O
when	O
they	O
perceived	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
formed	O
into	O
one	O
body	O
,	O
they	O
slackened	O
their	O
pace	O
;	O
but	O
still	O
followed	O
us	O
in	O
a	O
gentle	O
walk	O
:	O
that	O
they	O
slackened	O
their	O
pace	O
,	O
was	O
for	O
us	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
a	O
fortunate	O
circumstance	O
;	O
for	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
expected	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
boats	O
that	O
were	O
to	O
carry	O
us	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
wooders	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
pinnace	O
at	O
least	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
her	O
station	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
sent	O
to	O
pick	O
up	O
a	O
bird	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
shot	O
by	O
the	O
officer	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
little	O
boat	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
make	O
three	O
trips	O
before	O
we	O
could	O
all	O
get	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
party	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
drawn	O
up	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
,	O
the	O
Indians	O
came	O
down	O
,	O
not	O
in	O
a	O
body	O
as	O
we	O
expected	O
,	O
but	O
by	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
,	O
all	O
armed	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
their	O
number	O
increased	O
to	O
about	O
two	O
hundred	O
:	O
as	O
we	O
now	O
despaired	O
of	O
making	O
peace	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
seeing	O
that	O
the	O
dread	O
of	O
our	O
small	O
arms	O
did	O
not	O
keep	O
them	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
too	O
far	O
off	O
to	O
reach	O
the	O
place	O
with	O
a	O
shot	O
,	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
re-imbark	O
,	O
lest	O
our	O
stay	O
should	O
imbroil	O
us	O
in	O
another	O
quarrel	O
,	O
and	O
cost	O
more	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
their	O
lives	O
.	O

We	O
therefore	O
advanced	O
towards	O
the	O
pinnace	O
which	O
was	O
now	O
returning	O
,	O
when	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
boys	O
suddenly	O
cried	O
out	O
,	O
that	O
his	O
uncle	O
was	O
among	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
had	O
marched	O
down	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
us	O
to	O
stay	O
and	O
talk	O
with	O
them	O
:	O
we	O
complied	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
parley	O
immediately	O
commenced	O
between	O
them	O
and	O
Tupia	O
;	O
*	O
during	O
which	O
the	O
boys	O
held	O
up	O
every	O

we	O
had	O
given	O
them	O
as	O
tokens	O
of	O
our	O
kindness	O
and	O
liberality	O
;	O
but	O
neither	O
would	O
either	O
of	O
the	O
boys	O
swim	O
over	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
or	O
any	O
of	O
them	O

The	O
body	O
of	O
the	O
man	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
killed	O
the	O
day	O
before	O

still	O
lay	O
exposed	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
;	O
the	O
boys	O
seeing	O
it	O
lie	O
very	O
near	O
us	O
,	O
went	O
up	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
covered	O
it	O
with	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
clothes	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
given	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
soon	O
after	O
a	O
single	O
man	O
,	O
unarmed	O

who	O
proved	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
uncle	O
of	O
Maragovete	O
,	O
the	O
youngest	O
of	O
the	O
boys	O
,	O
swam	O
over	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
bringing	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
a	O
green	O
branch	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
supposed	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
here	O
as	O
at	O
Otaheite	PNM
,	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
emblem	O
of	O

We	O
received	O
his	O
branch	O
by	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
Tupia	PNM
,	O
to	O
whom	O
he	O
gave	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
him	O
many	O
presents	O
;	O
we	O
also	O
invited	O
him	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
declined	O
it	O
;	O
we	O
therefore	O
left	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
expected	O
that	O
his	O
nephew	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
two	O
other	O
young	O
Indians	O
would	O
have	O
staid	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
surprize	O
,	O
they	O
chose	O
rather	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
us	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
retired	O
,	O
he	O
went	O
and	O
gathered	O
another	O
green	O
branch	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
this	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
,	O
he	O
approached	O
the	O
dead	O
body	O
which	O
the	O

had	O
covered	O
with	O
part	O

his	O

walking	O
sideways	O
,	O
with	O
many	O
ceremonies	O

and	O
then	O
throwing	O
it	O
towards	O
him	O
.	O

When	O
this	O
was	O
done	O
,	O
he	O
returned	O
to	O
his	O
companions	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
sat	O
down	O
upon	O
the	O
sand	O
to	O
observe	O
the	O
issue	O
of	O
his	O
negotiation	O

they	O

gathered	O
round	O
him	O

continued	O
in	O
a	O

without	O

by	O

in	O
a	O

seemed	O
to	O
set	O

About	O
two	O
in	O
the	O

we	O
saw	O
a	O
pretty	O
high	O
island	O
bearing	O
west	O

at	O
five	O

saw	O
more	O
islands	O

to	O

hauled	O

them	O

could	O
not	O
weather	O
them	O

bore	O
up	O

put	O

this	O
was	O
the	O

The	O

I	O
went	O
with	O
two	O
boats	O
,	O
accompanied	O
by	O
Mr.	O

to	O
examine	O
a	O

river	O
that	O
empties	O
itself	O
into	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O

*	O
We	O
rowed	O
about	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
miles	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
have	O
gone	O
much	O
farther	O
if	O
the	O
weather	O
had	O
been	O
favourable	O

It	O
was	O
here	O
wider	O

at	O
the	O

divided	O
into	O

From	O
these	O
trees	O
exudes	O
a	O

substance	O
which	O
very	O

we	O

it	O
first	O
in	O
small	O

upon	O
the	O
sea	O

and	O
now	O
saw	O
it	O
sticking	O
to	O
the	O

by	O
which	O
we	O
knew	O
whence	O
it	O
came	O

We	O
landed	O
on	O
the	O
east	O

of	O
the	O
river	O

where	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
tree	O
upon	O
which	O
several	O

had	O
built	O
their	O

the	O

on	O

entered	O
with	O
the	O

within	O

found	O

had	O
proceeded	O
more	O

one	O

we	O
found	O
an	O

which	O
was	O
built	O
upon	O
a	O
a	O
small	O
bank	O
of	O
dry	O

intirely	O
surrounded	O
by	O
a	O
deep	O
mud	O

which	O
possibly	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
might	O
consider	O
as	O
a	O
defence	O

These	O

,	O
as	O
soon	O

accepted	O
the	O

made	O
them	O
a	O

received	O
us	O

us	O

were	O
fourteen	O

the	O

which	O
we	O
had	O
no	O

we	O
landed	O
on	O
the	O
west	O

take	O
a	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
lofty	O
trees	O
which	O
every	O

adorned	O

They	O
were	O
of	O

walked	O

into	O
the	O
wood	O
,	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
which	O
was	O
nineteen	O
feet	O
eight	O

in	O
the	O
girt	O

at	O
the	O
height	O

six	O

above	O
the	O
ground	O
:	O
having	O
a	O
quadrant	O
with	O
me	O

I	O
measured	O
its	O
height	O
from	O
the	O
root	O
to	O
the	O
first	O
branch	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
eighty-nine	O
feet	O
:	O
it	O
was	O
as	O
strait	O
as	O
an	O
arrow	O
,	O
and	O
tapered	O
but	O
very	O
little	O
in	O
proportion	O
to	O
its	O
height	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
judged	O
there	O
were	O
three	O
hundred	O

fifty-six	O
feet	O
of	O
solid	O
timber	O
in	O
it	O

As	O
we	O
advanced	O

we	O
saw	O
many	O

that	O
were	O
still	O
larger	O
;	O
we	O
cut	O
down	O
a	O
young	O
one	O

the	O
wood	O
proved	O
heavy	O
and	O
solid	O
,	O
not	O
fit	O
for	O

,	O
but	O
such	O
as	O
would	O
make	O
the	O

Our	O
carpenter	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
said	O
that	O
the	O
timber	O
resembled	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
pitch-pine	O
,	O
*	O
which	O
is	O
lightened	O
by	O
tapping	O
;	O
and	O
possibly	O
some	O
such	O
method	O
might	O
be	O
found	O
to	O
lighten	O
these	O

and	O
they	O
would	O
then	O
be	O
such	O
masts	O
as	O
no	O

was	O
swampy	O

we	O
could	O
not	O
range	O

a	O

was	O
about	O
three	O
quarters	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O

we	O
observed	O
that	O
the	O
canoes	O
which	O

about	O
the	O

did	O
not	O
follow	O
us	O

her	O

which	O
we	O
thought	O
a	O
good	O

we	O
had	O
no	O

landed	O
than	O
they	O
crouded	O
to	O
different	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
and	O
came	O
on	O
shore	O

We	O
were	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
cove	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
were	O
surrounded	O
by	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
hundred	O
people	O
,	O
*	O
some	O
rushing	O
from	O
behind	O
the	O

the	O
cove	O

and	O
others	O
appearing	O
on	O
the	O
tops	O
of	O
the	O
hills	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
armed	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
came	O
on	O
in	O
so	O
confused	O
and	O
straggling	O
a	O
manner	O
that	O
we	O
scarcely	O
suspected	O
they	O
meant	O
us	O
any	O
harm	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
determined	O
that	O
hostilities	O
should	O
not	O
begin	O
on	O
our	O
part	O
.	O

We	O
marched	O
towards	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
drew	O
a	O
line	O
upon	O
the	O
sand	O
between	O
them	O
and	O
us	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
gave	O
them	O
to	O
understand	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
to	O
pass	O
:	O
at	O
first	O
they	O
continued	O
quiet	O
,	O
but	O
their	O
weapons	O
were	O
held	O
ready	O
to	O
strike	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
rather	O
irresolute	O
than	O
peaceable	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
remained	O
in	O
this	O
state	O
of	O
suspense	O
,	O
another	O
party	O
of	O
Indians	O
came	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
now	O
growing	O
more	O
bold	O
as	O
their	O
number	O
increased	O
,	O
they	O
began	O
the	O
dance	O
and	O
song	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
their	O
preludes	O
to	O
a	O
battle	O
:	O
still	O

they	O
delayed	O
the	O
attack	O

but	O
a	O
party	O
ran	O
to	O
each	O
of	O
our	O
boats	O
,	O
and	O
attempted	O
to	O
draw	O
them	O
on	O

this	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
signal	O

for	O
the	O
people	O
about	O
us	O
at	O
the	O

began	O
to	O

our	O

us	O
to	O
remain	O
longer	O

I	O
therefore	O
discharged	O
my	O

was	O
loaded	O

at	O

Chiefs	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O

twenty	O

Dr.	O

whose	O

at	O
this	O

stopped	O

the	O

ran	O
away	O
with	O
the	O

they	O
did	O
not	O
however	O
disperse	O
,	O
but	O
got	O
together	O
upon	O
a	O
rising	O

and	O
seemed	O
only	O
to	O
want	O
some	O
leader	O
of	O

to	O
renew	O
their	O

As	O
they	O
were	O
now	O
beyond	O

we	O
fired	O
with	O

as	O
none	O
of	O

took	O
place	O
they	O
still	O
continued	O
in	O
a	O
body	O

and	O
in	O
this	O

the	O

from	O

a	O

of	O

were	O
seen	O
than	O

be	O
discovered	O
in	O
our	O

brought	O
her	O

to	O

and	O
intirely	O
dispersed	O
them	O
,	O
by	O
firing	O
a	O
few	O
shot	O
over	O
their	O
heads	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
skirmish	O
only	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
were	O
hurt	O
with	O
the	O
small	O
shot	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
a	O
single	O
life	O
was	O
lost	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
the	O
case	O
if	O

had	O
not	O

the	O

who	O
,	O
either	O
from	O
fear	O
or	O
the	O
love	O
of	O
mischief	O
,	O
shewed	O
as	O
much	O
impatience	O
to	O

When	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
quiet	O
possession	O
of	O
our	O
cove	O
,	O
we	O
laid	O
down	O
our	O

began	O
to	O
gather	O
celery	O
,	O
which	O
grew	O
here	O
in	O
great	O
plenty	O
:	O
after	O
a	O
little	O
time	O
we	O
recollected	O
to	O
have	O
seen	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
hide	O
themselves	O
in	O
a	O
cave	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
rocks	O
,	O
we	O
therefore	O
went	O
towards	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
when	O
an	O
old	O
Indian	O
,	O
who	O
proved	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
Chief	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
presented	O
with	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
broad	O
cloth	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
came	O
out	O
with	O
his	O
wife	O
and	O
his	O
brother	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
supplicating	O
posture	O
put	O
themselves	O
under	O
our	O
protection	O
.	O

We	O
spoke	O
kindly	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
then	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
another	O
brother	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
wounded	O
by	O
the	O
small	O
shot	O
,	O
and	O
enquired	O
with	O
much	O
solicitude	O
and	O
concern	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
die	O
.	O

We	O
assured	O
him	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
put	O
into	O
his	O
hand	O
both	O
a	O
musket	O
ball	O
and	O
some	O
small	O
shot	O
,	O
telling	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
those	O
only	O
who	O
were	O
wounded	O
with	O
the	O
ball	O
would	O
die	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
others	O
would	O
recover	O
;	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
assuring	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
attacked	O
again	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
certainly	O
defend	O
ourselves	O
with	O
the	O
ball	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
wound	O
them	O
mortally	O
.	O

Having	O
now	O
taken	O
courage	O
,	O
they	O
came	O
and	O
sat	O
down	O
by	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
tokens	O
of	O
our	O
perfect	O
amity	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
them	O

happened	O
to	O

about	O
us	O

rowed	O
to	O
another	O

a	O

of	O

of	O

advanced	O

taking	O

to	O
shew	O
us	O

when	O

when	O
he	O

drew	O
it	O
up	O
by	O
a	O

motion	O

so	O
that	O
the	O

out	O

this	O
simple	O
method	O
he	O

indeed	O
they	O

In	O

went	O

out	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
*	O
with	O
Mr.	O

entered	O

passed	O

For	O
this	O
purpose	O
,	O
having	O
landed	O
at	O
a	O
convenient	O
place	O

we	O
climbed	O
a	O
hill	O
of	O
very	O
considerable	O
height	O

from	O

we	O
had	O
a	O
full	O

with	O
the	O
land	O
on	O
the	O
opposite	O
shore	O

which	O
we	O
judged	O
to	O
be	O
about	O
four	O

as	O
it	O
was	O
hazey	O

we	O
could	O
not	O
see	O
far	O

I	O
resolved	O

to	O
search	O
the	O
passage	O
with	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
should	O
put	O
to	O

Upon	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
this	O
hill	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
parcel	O
of	O
loose	O
stones	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
we	O
erected	O
a	O
pyramid	O

left	O
in	O
it	O
some	O
musket	O

about	O
us	O

that	O
were	O
likely	O
to	O
stand	O
the	O
test	O
of	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
being	O
of	O
Indian	O
workmanship	O
,	O
would	O
convince	O
any	O

should	O
come	O

it	O
down	O

had	O
been	O
there	O

When	O
this	O
was	O
done	O
,	O
we	O
descended	O
the	O
hill	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
comfortable	O
meal	O
of	O
the	O
shaggs	O
and	O
fish	O
which	O
our	O
guns	O
and	O

had	O
procured	O

were	O
dressed	O
by	O

in	O
a	O
place	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
appointed	O

in	O
this	O

we	O
found	O
another	O

received	O
us	O

as	O
usual	O

with	O
strong	O

their	O

sat	O
down	O

seemed	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O

to	O
our	O
great	O

when	O

they	O
ran	O
away	O

to	O

ashore	O

procure	O
an	O
interview	O

but	O
in	O
this	O
we	O
were	O
again	O
disappointed	O

for	O
we	O
found	O
so	O
great	O
a	O
surf	O
beating	O
upon	O
every	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
that	O
landing	O
with	O
our	O
little	O
boat	O
was	O
altogether	O
impracticable	O
:	O
we	O
were	O
therefore	O
obliged	O
to	O
be	O
content	O
with	O
gazing	O
at	O
such	O
objects	O
as	O
presented	O
themselves	O
from	O
the	O

:	O
the	O
canoes	O

upon	O
a	O

seemed	O

much	O
to	O
resemble	O
those	O

We	O
observed	O

some	O
of	O
them	O

:	O
after	O
many	O
a	O
wishful	O

we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
return	O

with	O
our	O
curiosity	O
rather	O
excited	O
than	O
satisfied	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
five	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
got	O
on	O

the	O

About	O
this	O

it	O
fell	O
calm	O

and	O
our	O
situation	O
was	O
by	O
no	O

we	O
were	O
now	O
not	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
mile	O

a	O
half	O
from	O
the	O

within	O
some	O

which	O
lay	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
,	O
but	O
happily	O
a	O
light	O
breeze	O
came	O
off	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
us	O
out	O
of	O
danger	O
:	O
with	O
this	O
breeze	O
we	O
stood	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
,	O
*	O
and	O
at	O
day-break	O
we	O
discovered	O
a	O
bay	O
,	O
which	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
well	O
sheltered	O
from	O
all	O
winds	O
,	O
and	O
into	O
which	O
therefore	O
I	O
determined	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

The	O
pinnace	O
being	O
repaired	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
her	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
Master	O
,	O
to	O
sound	O
the	O
entrance	O

while	O
I	O
kept	O
turning	O
up	O

right	O
out	O

At	O

the	O

bore	O
N.	O
N.	O

about	O
a	O
mile	O
,	O
and	O
seeing	O
a	O
smoke	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
we	O
directed	O
our	O
glasses	O
to	O
the	O
spot	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
discovered	O
ten	O
people	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
upon	O
our	O
nearer	O
approach	O
,	O
left	O
their	O
fire	O

and	O
retired	O
to	O
a	O
little	O
eminence	O
,	O
whence	O
they	O
could	O
conveniently	O
observe	O
our	O
motions	O

Soon	O
after	O
two	O
canoes	O
,	O
each	O
having	O
two	O
men	O
on	O
board	O

came	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
just	O
under	O
the	O
eminence	O

*	O
and	O
the	O
men	O
joined	O
the	O
rest	O
on	O

The	O
pinnace	O

which	O
had	O
been	O
sent	O
ahead	O
to	O
sound	O

now	O
approached	O
the	O

upon	O
which	O
all	O
the	O
Indians	O
retired	O
farther	O
up	O
the	O
hill	O

one	O

who	O
hid	O
himself	O
among	O

As	O
the	O

proceeded	O
along	O

most	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
took	O
the	O

kept	O
abreast	O

her	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
;	O
when	O
she	O
came	O
back	O

us	O

that	O
in	O
a	O
cove	O

harbour	O

some	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
come	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O

and	O
invited	O
him	O
to	O
land	O
by	O
many	O
signs	O
and	O
words	O
of	O
which	O
he	O
knew	O
not	O
the	O

that	O
all	O

a	O
wooden	O

who	O
had	O
not	O
followed	O
the	O

the	O

over	O

they	O
had	O
so	O
little	O
regarded	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
coming	O
into	O
the	O
bay	O

they	O
would	O
as	O
little	O
regard	O
our	O
coming	O
on	O
shore	O
:	O
in	O
this	O

however	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
disappointed	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
approached	O
the	O
rocks	O
,	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
came	O
down	O
upon	O
them	O
to	O
dispute	O
our	O
landing	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
rest	O
ran	O
away	O

Each	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
champions	O
was	O
armed	O
with	O
a	O
lance	O
about	O
ten	O
feet	O
long	O
,	O
*	O
and	O
a	O
short	O
stick	O
which	O
he	O
seemed	O
to	O
handle	O
as	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
machine	O
to	O
assist	O
him	O
in	O
managing	O
or	O
throwing	O
the	O
lance	O
:	O
they	O
called	O
to	O
us	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
loud	O
tone	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
harsh	O
dissonant	O
language	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
neither	O
we	O
nor	O
Tupia	O
understood	O
a	O
single	O
word	O
:	O
they	O
brandished	O
their	O
weapons	O
,	O
and	O
seemed	O
resolved	O
to	O
defend	O
their	O
coast	O
to	O
the	O
uttermost	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
were	O
but	O
two	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
forty	O
.	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
but	O
admire	O
their	O
courage	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
very	O
unwilling	O
that	O
hostilities	O
should	O
commence	O
with	O
such	O
inequality	O
of	O
force	O
between	O
us	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
boat	O
to	O
lie	O
upon	O
her	O
oars	O
:	O
we	O
then	O
parlied	O
by	O
signs	O
for	O
about	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
bespeak	O
their	O
good-will	O
,	O
I	O
threw	O
them	O
nails	O
,	O
beads	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
trifles	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
took	O
up	O
and	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
well	O
pleased	O
with	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
I	O
wanted	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
by	O
all	O
the	O
means	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
devise	O
,	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
convince	O
them	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
do	O
them	O
no	O
harm	O
:	O
they	O
now	O
waved	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
willing	O
to	O
interpret	O
it	O
as	O
an	O
invitation	O
;	O
but	O
upon	O
our	O
putting	O
the	O
boat	O
in	O
,	O
they	O
came	O
again	O
to	O
oppose	O
us	O
.	O

One	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
youth	O
about	O
nineteen	O
or	O
twenty	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
middle	O
age	O
:	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
now	O
no	O
other	O
resource	O
I	O
fired	O
a	O
musquet	O
between	O
them	O
.	O

Upon	O
the	O
report	O
,	O
the	O
youngest	O
dropped	O
a	O
bundle	O
of	O
lances	O
upon	O
the	O
rock	O
,	O
but	O
recollecting	O
himself	O
in	O
an	O
instant	O
he	O
snatched	O
them	O
up	O
again	O
with	O
great	O
haste	O
:	O
a	O
stone	O
was	O
then	O
thrown	O
at	O
us	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
I	O
ordered	O
a	O
musquet	O
to	O
be	O
fired	O
with	O
small	O
shot	O
,	O
which	O
struck	O
the	O
eldest	O
upon	O
the	O
legs	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
immediately	O
ran	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
houses	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
distant	O
about	O
an	O
hundred	O
yards	O
:	O
I	O
now	O
hoped	O
that	O
our	O
contest	O
was	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
immediately	O
landed	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
had	O
scarcely	O
left	O
the	O
boat	O
when	O
he	O
returned	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
then	O
perceived	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
left	O
the	O
rock	O
only	O
to	O
fetch	O
a	O
shield	O
or	O
target	O
for	O
his	O
defence	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
came	O
up	O
,	O
he	O
threw	O
a	O
lance	O
at	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
comrade	O
another	O
;	O
they	O
fell	O
where	O
we	O
stood	O
thickest	O
,	O
*	O
but	O
happily	O
hurt	O
nobody	O
.	O

A	O
third	O
musquet	O
with	O
small	O
shot	O
was	O
then	O
fired	O
at	O
them	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
threw	O
another	O
lance	O
,	O
and	O
both	O
immediately	O
ran	O
away	O
:	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
pursued	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
probably	O
have	O
taken	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
suggesting	O
that	O
the	O
lances	O
might	O
be	O
poisoned	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
not	O
prudent	O
to	O
venture	O
into	O
the	O
woods	O
.	O

We	O
repaired	O
immediately	O
to	O
the	O
huts	O
,	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
children	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
hidden	O
themselves	O
behind	O
a	O
shield	O
and	O
some	O
bark	O
;	O
we	O
peeped	O
at	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
left	O
them	O
in	O
their	O
retreat	O
,	O
without	O
their	O
knowing	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
discovered	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
threw	O
into	O
the	O
house	O
when	O
we	O
went	O
away	O
some	O
beads	O
,	O
ribbons	O
,	O
pieces	O
of	O
cloth	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
presents	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
hoped	O
would	O
procure	O
us	O
the	O
good-will	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
when	O
they	O
should	O
return	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
lances	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
lying	O
about	O
,	O
we	O
took	O
away	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
about	O
fifty	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
from	O
six	O
to	O
fifteen	O
feet	O
long	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
four	O
prongs	O
in	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
a	O
fish-gig	O
,	O
each	O
of	O
which	O
was	O
pointed	O
with	O
fish-bone	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
sharp	O
:	O
we	O
observed	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
smeared	O
with	O
a	O
viscous	O
substance	O
of	O
a	O
green	O
colour	O
,	O
which	O
favoured	O
the	O
opinion	O
of	O
their	O
being	O
poisoned	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
afterwards	O
discovered	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
mistake	O
:	O
they	O
appeared	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
sea-weed	O
that	O
we	O
found	O
sticking	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
to	O

been	O
used	O
in	O
striking	O
fish	O

Upon	O
examining	O
the	O
canoes	O
that	O
lay	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
worst	O
we	O
had	O
ever	O
seen	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
between	O
twelve	O
and	O
fourteen	O
feet	O
long	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
of	O
the	O
bark	O
of	O
a	O
tree	O
in	O
one	O
piece	O

which	O
was	O
drawn	O
together	O

tied	O
up	O
at	O

were	O
placed	O
across	O
them	O
from	O

We	O
then	O
searched	O
for	O
fresh	O
water	O

found	O
none	O

except	O
in	O
a	O

dug	O
in	O

This	O

we	O
resolved	O
to	O
make	O
an	O
excursion	O
into	O
the	O
country	O

Mr.	O

,	O
Dr.	O
Solander	O
,	O
myself	O
,	O
and	O
seven	O
others	O
,	O
properly	O
accoutred	O
for	O
the	O
expedition	O
,	O
set	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
repaired	O
first	O
to	O
the	O
huts	O
,	O
near	O
the	O
watering-place	O
,	O
whither	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
continued	O
every	O
day	O
to	O
resort	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
the	O
little	O
presents	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
left	O
there	O
before	O
had	O
not	O
yet	O
been	O
taken	O
away	O
,	O
we	O
left	O
others	O
of	O
somewhat	O
more	O
value	O
,	O
consisting	O
of	O
cloth	O
,	O
looking-glasses	O
,	O
combs	O
,	O
and	O
beads	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
went	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
the	O
soil	O
to	O
be	O
either	O
swamp	O
or	O
light	O
sand	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
finely	O
diversified	O
by	O
wood	O
and	O
lawn	O
.	O

The	O
trees	O
are	O
tall	O
,	O
strait	O
,	O
and	O
without	O
underwood	O
,	O
standing	O
at	O
such	O
a	O
distance	O
from	O
each	O
other	O
that	O
the	O
whole	O
country	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
where	O
the	O
swamps	O
do	O
not	O
render	O
it	O
incapable	O
of	O
cultivation	O
,	O
might	O
be	O
cultivated	O
without	O
cutting	O
down	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
:	O
between	O
the	O
trees	O
the	O
ground	O
is	O
covered	O
with	O
grass	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
there	O
is	O
great	O
abundance	O
,	O
growing	O
in	O
tufts	O
about	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
can	O
well	O
be	O
grasped	O
in	O
the	O
hand	O
,	O
which	O
stand	O
very	O
close	O
to	O
each	O
other	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
many	O
houses	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
and	O
places	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
slept	O
upon	O
the	O
grass	O
without	O
any	O
shelter	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
saw	O
only	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
who	O
the	O
moment	O
he	O
discovered	O
us	O
ran	O
away	O
.	O

At	O
all	O
these	O
places	O
we	O
left	O
presents	O
,	O
hoping	O
that	O
at	O
length	O
they	O
might	O
produce	O
confidence	O
and	O
good-will	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
transient	O
and	O
imperfect	O
view	O
of	O
a	O
quadruped	O
about	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
a	O
rabbit	O
:	O
*	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
's	O
greyhound	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
got	O
sight	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
probably	O
have	O
caught	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
moment	O
he	O
set	O
off	O
he	O
lamed	O
himself	O
,	O
against	O
a	O
stump	O
which	O
lay	O
concealed	O
in	O
the	O
long	O
grass	O
.	O

We	O
afterwards	O
saw	O
the	O
dung	O
of	O
an	O
animal	O
which	O
fed	O
upon	O
grass	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
we	O
judged	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
less	O
than	O
a	O
deer	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
footsteps	O
of	O
another	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
clawed	O
like	O
a	O
dog	O
,	O
and	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
about	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
a	O
wolf	O
:	O
we	O
also	O
tracked	O
a	O
small	O
animal	O
,	O
whose	O
foot	O
resembled	O
that	O
of	O
a	O
polcat	O
or	O
weasel	O
.	O

The	O
trees	O
over	O
our	O
head	O
abounded	O
with	O
birds	O
of	O
various	O
kinds	O
,	O
among	O
which	O
were	O
many	O
of	O
exquisite	O
beauty	O
,	O
particularly	O
loriquets	O
and	O
cockatoos	O
,	O
which	O
flew	O
in	O
flocks	O
of	O
several	O
scores	O
together	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
some	O
wood	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
felled	O
by	O
the	O
natives	O
with	O
a	O
blunt	O
instrument	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
barked	O
.	O

The	O
trees	O
were	O
not	O
of	O
many	O
species	O
;	O
among	O
others	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
large	O
one	O
which	O
yielded	O
a	O
gum	O
not	O
unlike	O
the	O
Sanguis	O
draconis	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
steps	O
had	O
been	O
cut	O
at	O
about	O
three	O
feet	O
distance	O
from	O
each	O
other	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
convenience	O
of	O
climbing	O
them	O
.	O

From	O
this	O
excursion	O
we	O
returned	O
between	O
three	O
and	O
four	O
o'clock	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
dined	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
ashore	O
again	O
at	O
the	O
waterring-place	O
,	O
where	O
a	O
party	O
of	O
men	O
were	O
filling	O
casks	O

Mr.	O
Gore	O
,	O
the	O
Second	O
Lieutenant	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
sent	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
with	O
a	O
boat	O
to	O
dredge	O
for	O
oysters	O
at	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
;	O
when	O
he	O
had	O
performed	O
this	O
service	O
,	O
he	O
went	O
ashore	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
taken	O
a	O
midshipman	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
sent	O
the	O
boat	O
away	O
,	O
set	O
out	O
to	O
join	O
the	O
waterers	O
by	O
land	O
.	O

In	O
his	O
way	O
he	O
fell	O
in	O
with	O
a	O
body	O
of	O
two	O
and	O
twenty	O
Indians	O
,	O
who	O
followed	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
often	O
not	O
more	O
than	O
twenty	O
yards	O
distant	O
;	O
when	O
Mr.	O
Gore	O
perceived	O
them	O
so	O
near	O
,	O
he	O
stopped	O
,	O
and	O
faced	O
about	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
they	O
stopped	O
also	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
he	O
went	O
on	O
again	O
,	O
continued	O
their	O
pursuit	O
:	O
*	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
however	O
attack	O
him	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
armed	O
with	O
lances	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
and	O
the	O
midshipman	O
got	O
in	O
safety	O
to	O
the	O
watering-place	O
.	O

The	O
Indians	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
slackened	O
their	O
pursuit	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
in	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
main	O
body	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
,	O
halted	O
at	O
about	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
stood	O
still	O
.	O

Mr.	O
Monkhouse	O
and	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
of	O
the	O
waterers	O
took	O
it	O
in	O
their	O
head	O
to	O
march	O
up	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
seeing	O
the	O
Indians	O
keep	O
their	O
ground	O
till	O
they	O
came	O
pretty	O
near	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
seized	O
with	O
a	O
sudden	O
fear	O
very	O
common	O
to	O
the	O
rash	O
and	O
fool-hardy	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
hasty	O
retreat	O
:	O
this	O
step	O
,	O
which	O
insured	O
the	O
danger	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
taken	O
to	O
avoid	O
,	O
encouraged	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
and	O
four	O
of	O
them	O
running	O
forward	O
discharged	O
their	O
lances	O
at	O
the	O
fugitives	O
,	O
with	O
such	O
force	O
that	O
,	O
flying	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
forty	O
yards	O
,	O
they	O
went	O
beyond	O
them	O
.	O

As	O
the	O
Indians	O
did	O
not	O
pursue	O
,	O
our	O
people	O
,	O
recovering	O
their	O
spirits	O
,	O
stopped	O
to	O
collect	O
the	O
lances	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
they	O
lay	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
in	O
their	O
turn	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
retire	O
.	O

Just	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
I	O
came	O
up	O
,	O
with	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
,	O
Dr.	O
Solander	O
,	O
and	O
Tupia	O
;	O
and	O
being	O
desirous	O
to	O
convince	O
the	O
Indians	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
neither	O
afraid	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
nor	O
intended	O
them	O
any	O
mischief	O
,	O
we	O
advanced	O
towards	O
them	O
,	O
making	O
signs	O
of	O
expostulation	O
and	O
entreaty	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
persuaded	O
to	O
wait	O
till	O
we	O
could	O
come	O
up	O
.	O

Mr.	O
Gore	O
told	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
seen	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
up	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
invited	O
him	O
by	O
signs	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
shore	O

which	O
he	O
,	O
certainly	O
with	O

The	O
morning	O
of	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
was	O
so	O
rainy	O
,	O

that	O
we	O
were	O
all	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O

however	O
,	O
it	O
cleared	O

we	O
made	O
another	O
excursion	O
along	O

southward	O
:	O
we	O
went	O
ashore	O
,	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
and	O
Dr.	O
Solander	O
gathered	O
many	O
plants	O
;	O
but	O
besides	O
these	O
we	O
saw	O
nothing	O
worthy	O
of	O
notice	O
.	O

At	O
our	O
first	O
entering	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
*	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
three	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
who	O
instantly	O
ran	O
away	O
:	O
more	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
seen	O
by	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
all	O
disappeared	O
,	O
with	O
great	O
precipitation	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
found	O
that	O

By	O
the	O
boldness	O
of	O
these	O

at	O

them	O
at	O

it	O
appears	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
sufficiently	O
intimidated	O
by	O
our	O
fire-arms	O

not	O
that	O
we	O
had	O

coming	O

natives	O

In	O
our	O
way	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
eleven	O
or	O
twelve	O
small	O
canoes	O
,	O
with	O
each	O
a	O
man	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
probably	O
the	O
same	O
that	O
were	O
afterwards	O
abreast	O
of	O

shore	O

who	O
all	O
made	O
into	O
shoal	O
water	O
upon	O
our	O
approach	O

We	O
met	O
other	O
Indians	O
on	O
shore	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
we	O
landed	O
,	O
who	O
instantly	O
took	O
to	O
their	O
canoes	O
,	O
and	O
paddled	O
away	O
.	O

We	O
went	O
up	O
the	O
country	O
to	O
some	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
it	O
nearly	O
the	O
same	O
with	O
that	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
described	O
already	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
soil	O
was	O
much	O
richer	O
;	O
for	O
instead	O
of	O
sand	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
deep	O
black	O
mould	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
thought	O
very	O
fit	O
for	O
the	O
production	O
of	O
grain	O
of	O
any	O
kind	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
woods	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
tree	O
which	O
bore	O
fruit	O
that	O
in	O
colour	O
and	O
shape	O
resembled	O
a	O
cherry	O
;	O
the	O
juice	O
had	O
an	O
agreeable	O
tartness	O
,	O
though	O
but	O
little	O
flavour	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
also	O
interspersed	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
finest	O
meadows	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
:	O
some	O
places	O
however	O
were	O
rocky	O
,	O
but	O
these	O
were	O
comparatively	O
few	O
:	O
the	O
stone	O
is	O
sandy	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
be	O
used	O
with	O
advantage	O
for	O
building	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
returned	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
some	O
smoke	O
upon	O
another	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
thither	O
in	O
hopes	O
of	O
meeting	O
with	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
but	O
at	O
our	O
approach	O
,	O
these	O
also	O
ran	O
away	O

We	O
found	O
six	O
small	O
canoes	O
,	O
and	O
six	O
fires	O
very	O
near	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
muscles	O
roasting	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
few	O
oysters	O
lying	O
near	O
:	O
by	O
this	O
we	O
judged	O
that	O
there	O
had	O
been	O
one	O
man	O
in	O
each	O
canoe	O
,	O
who	O
having	O
picked	O
up	O
some	O
shell-fish	O
were	O
come	O
ashore	O
to	O
eat	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
each	O
had	O
made	O
his	O
separate	O
fire	O
for	O
that	O
purpose	O
;	O
we	O
tasted	O
of	O
their	O
cheer	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
them	O
in	O
return	O
some	O
strings	O
of	O
beads	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
things	O
which	O
we	O
thought	O
would	O
please	O
them	O
.	O

*	O
At	O
the	O
foot	O
of	O
a	O
tree	O
in	O
this	O
place	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
small	O
well	O
of	O
fresh	O
water	O
,	O
supplied	O
by	O
a	O
spring	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
day	O
being	O
now	O
far	O
spent	O

we	O
returned	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
made	O
a	O
little	O
excursion	O
with	O
his	O
gun	O

and	O
found	O
such	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
quails	O
,	O
resembling	O
those	O
in	O
England	PNM
,	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
shot	O
as	O
many	O
as	O
he	O
pleased	O

his	O
object	O
was	O

,	O
as	O
the	O

I	O
sent	O

as	O
they	O
were	O
coming	O
out	O

observed	O
six	O

standing	O
together	O
,	O
at	O
the	O

of	O
about	O
fifty	O
yards	O

One	O
of	O

pronounced	O

which	O
was	O
supposed	O
to	O

a	O
signal	O

*	O
for	O
a	O
lance	O
was	O
immediately	O

at	O
him	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
wood	O
,	O
which	O
very	O
narrowly	O
missed	O
him	O

When	O
the	O
Indians	O
saw	O
that	O

had	O
not	O
taken	O

they	O
ran	O
away	O
with	O

the	O

the	O

nineteen	O

Mr.	O

the	O

us	O

We	O

met	O
with	O
several	O
places	O
where	O

ashore	O
;	O
but	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
disappointment	O
we	O
could	O
find	O
no	O
fresh	O
water	O

We	O
proceeded	O
however	O
up	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
found	O
gum	O
trees	O
like	O
those	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
before	O

and	O
observed	O
that	O

was	O

Upon	O

But	O
upon	O
another	O

we	O
found	O
a	O
small	O

all	O

they	O

We	O
found	O
also	O
an	O
incredible	O

of	O

so	O
that	O
for	O
the	O
space	O
of	O
three	O

the	O

was	O

We	O
found	O
here	O
also	O
a	O
small	O
fish	O
of	O
a	O

it	O
was	O
about	O

had	O
two	O

it	O
in	O

it	O
might	O

it	O
did	O
not	O

by	O
the	O
want	O

;	O
for	O
upon	O

pursued	O

At	O
sun-rise	O
I	O
went	O
ashore	O
,	O
and	O
climbing	O
a	O
considerable	O
hill	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
a	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
coast	O
and	O
the	O
islands	O
that	O
lie	O
off	O
it	O

with	O
their	O
bearings	O
,	O
having	O
an	O
azimuth	O
compass	O
with	O
me	O
for	O
that	O
purpose	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
observed	O
that	O
the	O
needle	O
differed	O
very	O
considerably	O
in	O
its	O
position	O
,	O
even	O
to	O
thirty	O

in	O
some	O
places	O
more	O

in	O

less	O

and	O
once	O
I	O
found	O
it	O
differ	O
from	O
itself	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
two	O
points	O
in	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
fourteen	O
feet	O

I	O
took	O
up	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
loose	O
stones	O
that	O
lay	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
applied	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
needle	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
produced	O
no	O
effect	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
therefore	O
concluded	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
iron	O
ore	O
in	O
the	O
hills	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
remarked	O

I	O
proceeded	O
with	O
Dr.	O

up	O
the	O
inlet	O

I	O
set	O
out	O
with	O
the	O
first	O
of	O
the	O
flood	O
,	O
and	O
long	O
before	O
high-water	O
I	O
had	O
advanced	O
above	O
eight	O

Its	O
breadth	O
thus	O
far	O
was	O
from	O
two	O

five	O

upon	O
a	O
S.	O

by	O

but	O
here	O
it	O
opened	O
every	O

formed	O
a	O
large	O
lake	O
,	O
which	O
to	O
the	O
N.	O
W.	O
communicated	O
with	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
not	O
only	O
saw	O
the	O
sea	O
in	O
this	O
direction	O
,	O
but	O
found	O
the	O
tide	O
of	O
flood	O
coming	O
strongly	O
in	O
from	O
that	O
point	O
:	O
I	O
also	O
observed	O
an	O
arm	O
of	O
this	O
lake	O
extending	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
improbable	O
that	O
it	O
may	O
communicate	O
with	O
the	O
sea	O
in	O
the	O

On	O
the	O
south	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
lake	O
is	O
a	O
ridge	O
of	O
high	O
hills	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
desirous	O
to	O
climb	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
being	O
high-water	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
day	O
far	O
spent	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
afraid	O
of	O
being	O
bewildered	O
among	O
the	O
shoals	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
especially	O
as	O
the	O
weather	O
was	O
dark	O
and	O
rainy	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
I	O
made	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
my	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O

In	O
this	O
excursion	O
I	O
saw	O
only	O
two	O

they	O
were	O
at	O
a	O

;	O
they	O
followed	O
the	O
boat	O
along	O
the	O

a	O
good	O
way	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
tide	O
running	O
strongly	O
in	O
my	O
favour	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
prudently	O
wait	O
for	O
them	O

I	O
saw	O

several	O
fires	O
in	O
one	O

smoke	O
in	O

the	O

Mr.	O

found	O
their	O
course	O
obstructed	O
by	O
a	O
swamp	O

covered	O
with	O
mangroves	O

which	O
however	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
pass	O

the	O
mud	O
was	O
almost	O
knee	O
deep	O

yet	O
they	O
resolutely	O
went	O
on	O
;	O
but	O
before	O
they	O
got	O
half	O
way	O
,	O
they	O
repented	O
of	O
their	O
undertaking	O
:	O
the	O
bottom	O
was	O
covered	O
with	O
branches	O
of	O
trees	O
interwoven	O
with	O
each	O

,	O
sometimes	O
they	O
kept	O
their	O
footing	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
sometimes	O
their	O
feet	O
slipt	O
through	O

and	O
sometimes	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
entangled	O
among	O
them	O

that	O
they	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
free	O
themselves	O
by	O
groping	O
in	O
the	O

therefore	O
knew	O
that	O
we	O

very	O

and	O
we	O
had	O
too	O
much	O
reason	O
to	O
conclude	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
upon	O
a	O
rock	O
of	O
coral	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
more	O
fatal	O
than	O
any	O
other	O
,	O
because	O
the	O

it	O
are	O
sharp	O

every	O

at	O

upon	O

the	O

the	O

so	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
with	O
the	O

difficulty	O
that	O
we	O
kept	O
upon	O
our	O

to	O
complete	O
the	O
scene	O
of	O

that	O

to	O

it	O

On	O

we	O

that	O
would	O

by	O

would	O
be	O

for	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
the	O

rose	O

fell	O
perpendicularly	O
eight	O

at	O
the	O

as	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
coals	O
were	O
trimmed	O
from	O
over	O

we	O
could	O
hear	O
the	O

rush	O

abaft	O
the	O

about	O
three	O

to	O
clear	O

This	O
evening	O

Mr.	O

The	O
next	O

we	O
went	O
early	O
to	O
work	O
,	O
*	O
and	O
by	O
four	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
had	O
got	O
out	O
all	O
the	O
coals	O

cast	O

warped	O
the	O

a	O
little	O
higher	O
up	O
the	O
harbour	O
to	O
a	O
place	O
which	O
I	O
thought	O
most	O
convenient	O
for	O
laying	O
her	O
ashore	O
in	O

At	O
eight	O

it	O

I	O
hauled	O
her	O
bow	O

ashore	O

kept	O
her	O

because	O

At	O
two	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
of	O
the	O
22d	O
,	O
the	O
tide	O
left	O
her	O

and	O
gave	O
us	O
an	O
opportunity	O
to	O
examine	O
the	O
leak	O

we	O
found	O
to	O
be	O
at	O
her	O
floor	O

a	O
little	O
before	O
the	O
starboard	O
fore-chains	O

In	O
this	O
place	O
the	O
rocks	O
had	O
made	O
their	O
way	O
through	O
four	O
planks	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
into	O
the	O
timbers	O
;	O
three	O
more	O
planks	O
were	O
much	O
damaged	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
these	O
breaches	O
was	O
very	O
extraordinary	O
:	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
splinter	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
,	O
but	O
all	O
was	O
as	O
smooth	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
the	O
whole	O
had	O
been	O
cut	O
away	O
by	O
an	O
instrument	O
:	O
the	O
timbers	O
in	O
this	O
place	O
were	O
happily	O
very	O
close	O

and	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
not	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
absolutely	O

to	O
have	O
saved	O
the	O
ship	O

But	O
after	O
all	O
,	O
her	O
preservation	O
depended	O
upon	O
a	O
circumstance	O
still	O
more	O
remarkable	O
:	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
holes	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
big	O
enough	O
to	O
have	O
sunk	O
us	O

if	O
we	O
had	O
had	O
eight	O

able	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O

plugged	O
up	O

a	O

of	O
the	O
rock	O

which	O
,	O
after	O
having	O
made	O
the	O
wound	O

was	O
left	O
sticking	O
in	O
it	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
water	O
which	O
at	O
first	O
bad	O
gained	O
upon	O

between	O
the	O
stone	O
and	O
the	O
edges	O
of	O
the	O
hole	O
that	O
received	O
it	O

We	O
found	O
also	O
several	O
pieces	O
of	O
the	O
fothering	O

which	O
had	O
made	O
their	O
way	O

in	O
a	O

stopped	O

little	O
water	O
made	O
its	O

into	O

in	O

very	O

a	O

it	O
carried	O

I	O
should	O
have	O
taken	O
it	O
for	O
a	O

instead	O

running	O
,	O
it	O
had	O
not	O
leapt	O
like	O
a	O
hare	O
or	O
deer	O
:	O
its	O
legs	O
were	O
said	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
slender	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
print	O
of	O
its	O
foot	O
to	O
be	O
like	O
that	O
of	O
a	O
goat	O
;	O

where	O
I	O
saw	O
it	O
the	O

by	O

neither	O

up	O

by	O

over	O
the	O
long	O

About	O
noon	O
,	O
they	O
returned	O
to	O
the	O

and	O
again	O
proceeded	O
up	O
the	O
river	O

which	O
was	O

into	O
a	O
fresh	O

where	O

the	O
tide	O
rose	O
to	O

as	O

approached	O
,	O
it	O
became	O
low	O
water	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
then	O
so	O
shallow	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
and	O
drag	O
her	O
along	O

till	O
they	O
could	O
find	O

with	O
some	O

Such	O

while	O
they	O
were	O
getting	O
the	O
things	O
out	O
of	O

they	O
observed	O
a	O
smoke	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O

about	O
a	O
furlong	O
:	O
as	O
they	O

that	O
some	O

with	O

about	O
the	O
fire	O
,	O
three	O
of	O
the	O
party	O
went	O
immediately	O
towards	O
it	O

hoping	O
that	O
so	O
small	O

would	O
not	O
put	O
them	O
to	O
flight	O
:	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
it	O
deserted	O

and	O
therefore	O
they	O
conjectured	O
that	O
before	O

They	O
found	O
the	O
fire	O
still	O
burning	O

in	O
the	O
hollow	O
of	O
an	O
old	O
tree	O
that	O

broken	O
down	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
children	O
appeared	O
to	O

been	O
playing	O
:	O
they	O
observed	O
also	O
many	O
foot-steps	O
upon	O
the	O
sand	O
,	O
below	O
high	O
water	O
mark	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
certain	O
indications	O
that	O
the	O
Indians	O
had	O
been	O
recently	O
upon	O
the	O
spot	O
.	O

Several	O
houses	O
were	O
found	O
at	O
a	O
little	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
ovens	O
dug	O
in	O
the	O
ground	O

in	O
the	O

After	O
regretting	O
their	O
disappointment	O

they	O
repaired	O
to	O
their	O
quarters	O

which	O
was	O
a	O

sand	O
bank	O

under	O
the	O
shelter	O
of	O

Their	O

were	O

they	O
spread	O
upon	O
the	O

which	O
were	O
as	O

some	O
bunches	O
of	O
grass	O
for	O

:	O
with	O
these	O

they	O
hoped	O

a	O
better	O
night	O

the	O
last	O

to	O
their	O
great	O
comfort	O

not	O
a	O

Here	O
then	O
they	O
lay	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
such	O
is	O
the	O
force	O
of	O
habit	O

they	O
resigned	O
themselves	O
to	O
sleep	O

without	O
once	O
reflecting	O
upon	O
the	O
probability	O
and	O
danger	O
of	O
being	O
found	O
by	O
the	O
Indians	O
in	O
that	O
situation	O

If	O
this	O
appears	O
strange	O
,	O
*	O
let	O
us	O
for	O
a	O
moment	O
reflect	O
,	O
that	O
every	O
danger	O
,	O
and	O
every	O
calamity	O
,	O
after	O
a	O
time	O
becomes	O

If	O
it	O
were	O

that	O
a	O
man	O
should	O
first	O

being	O
gradually	O
acquainted	O
with	O
these	O
mournful	O
truths	O

by	O

,	O
we	O
scarce	O
know	O
when	O
,	O
they	O
lose	O
all	O
their	O
force	O

and	O
we	O
think	O
no	O
more	O
of	O
the	O
approach	O
of	O
old	O
age	O
and	O
death	O
,	O
than	O
these	O
wanderers	O
of	O
an	O

did	O
of	O
a	O

evil	O

the	O
approach	O
of	O
the	O
native	O

at	O
a	O
time	O
when	O
they	O
must	O
have	O
fallen	O
an	O
easy	O
prey	O
to	O
their	O
malice	O
or	O
their	O
fears	O
.	O

And	O
it	O
is	O
remarkable	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
greater	O
part	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
have	O
been	O
condemned	O
to	O
suffer	O
a	O
violent	O
death	O
,	O
have	O
slept	O
the	O
night	O
immediately	O
preceding	O
their	O
execution	O

though	O
there	O
is	O
perhaps	O
no	O
instance	O
of	O
a	O
person	O

of	O
a	O
capital	O
crime	O
having	O
slept	O
the	O
first	O
night	O

Thus	O
is	O
the	O
evil	O
of	O
life	O
in	O

The	O
next	O

we	O
had	O
another	O

This	O

was	O
distinguished	O
by	O
an	O
ornament	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
striking	O
appearance	O
:	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
bone	O

five	O

only	O
one	O

in	O

but	O
upon	O

we	O
found	O
that	O
among	O
all	O
these	O
people	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
nose	O
was	O
perforated	O
,	O
to	O
receive	O
an	O
ornament	O
of	O
the	O

kind	O
:	O
they	O
had	O
also	O
holes	O
in	O
their	O
ears	O
,	O
though	O
nothing	O
was	O
then	O
hanging	O

upon	O
the	O

,	O
made	O
of	O
plaited	O

,	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
of	O
Terra	PNM

Fuego	PNM
,	O
they	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
fond	O
of	O
ornament	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
are	O
absolutely	O
without	O
apparel	O
;	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
whom	O
I	O
had	O
given	O
part	O
of	O
an	O
old	O
shirt	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
throwing	O
it	O
over	O
any	O
part	O
of	O
his	O
body	O
,	O
tied	O
it	O
as	O
a	O
fillet	O
round	O
his	O
head	O

They	O
brought	O
with	O
them	O
a	O
fish	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
gave	O
us	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
supposed	O
,	O
in	O
return	O
for	O
the	O
fish	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
given	O
them	O
the	O

They	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
much	O

in	O
no	O

of	O
our	O
gentlemen	O

their	O

with	O
great	O
curiosity	O

were	O
alarmed	O

with	O
three	O

that	O

with	O

Soon	O

ventured	O
down	O
to	O
Tupia	PNM

tent	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
so	O
well	O
pleased	O
with	O
their	O
reception	O
,	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
went	O
with	O
the	O
canoe	O
to	O
fetch	O
two	O
others	O
whom	O
we	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
:	O
*	O
when	O
he	O
returned	O
,	O
he	O
introduced	O
the	O
strangers	O
by	O
name	O
,	O
a	O
ceremony	O
which	O
,	O
upon	O
such	O
occasions	O
,	O
was	O
never	O
omitted	O
.	O

As	O
they	O
had	O
received	O
the	O
fish	O
that	O
was	O
thrown	O
into	O
their	O
canoe	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
first	O
approached	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
with	O
so	O
much	O
pleasure	O
,	O
some	O
fish	O
was	O
offered	O
to	O
them	O
now	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
greatly	O
surprized	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
received	O
with	O
the	O
greatest	O
indifference	O
:	O
they	O
made	O
signs	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
to	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
dress	O
it	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
immediately	O
done	O
,	O
but	O
after	O
eating	O
a	O
little	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
they	O
threw	O
the	O
rest	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
's	O
dog	O
.	O

They	O
staid	O
with	O
us	O
all	O
the	O
forenoon	O
,	O
but	O
would	O
never	O
venture	O
above	O
twenty	O
yards	O
from	O
their	O
canoe	O
.	O

We	O
now	O
perceived	O
that	O
the	O
colour	O
of	O
their	O
skin	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
dark	O
as	O
it	O
appeared	O
,	O
what	O
we	O
had	O
taken	O
for	O
their	O
complexion	O
,	O
being	O
the	O
effects	O
of	O
dirt	O
and	O
smoke	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
,	O
we	O
imagined	O
,	O
they	O
contrived	O
to	O
sleep	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
the	O
heat	O
of	O
the	O
climate	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
only	O
means	O
in	O
their	O
power	O
to	O
keep	O
off	O
the	O
musquitos	O
.	O

Among	O
other	O
things	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
given	O
them	O
when	O
we	O
first	O
saw	O
them	O
,	O
were	O
some	O
medals	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
hung	O
round	O
their	O
necks	O
by	O
a	O
riband	O
;	O
and	O
these	O
ribands	O
were	O
so	O
changed	O
by	O
smoke	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
easily	O
distinguish	O
of	O
what	O
colour	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
:	O
this	O
incident	O
led	O
us	O
more	O
narrowly	O
to	O
examine	O
the	O
colour	O
of	O
their	O
skin	O
.	O

While	O
these	O
people	O
were	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
two	O
others	O
on	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
land	O
that	O
lay	O
on	O
the	O
opposite	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
about	O
two	O
hundred	O
yards	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
our	O
glasses	O
discovered	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
woman	O
and	O
a	O
boy	O
;	O
the	O
woman	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
being	O
stark	O
naked	O
.	O

We	O
observed	O
,	O
that	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
remarkably	O
clean-limbed	O
,	O
and	O
exceedingly	O
active	O
and	O
nimble	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
these	O
strangers	O
had	O
a	O
necklace	O
of	O
shells	O
,	O
very	O
prettily	O
made	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
bracelet	O
upon	O
his	O
arm	O
,	O
formed	O
of	O
several	O
strings	O
,	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
resemble	O
what	O
in	O
England	PNM
is	O
called	O
gymp	O
:	O
both	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
bark	O
tied	O
over	O
the	O
forehead	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
disfigured	O
by	O
the	O
bone	O
in	O
the	O
nose	O
.	O

*	O
We	O
thought	O
their	O
language	O
more	O
harsh	O
than	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
Islanders	O
in	O
the	O
South	PNM
Sea	PNM
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
continually	O
repeating	O
the	O
word	O
chercau	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
imagined	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
term	O
expressing	O
admiration	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
manner	O
in	O
which	O
it	O
was	O
uttered	O
:	O
they	O
also	O
cried	O
out	O

when	O
they	O
saw	O
any	O
thing	O
new	O

cher	O

Their	O
canoe	O
was	O
not	O
above	O
ten	O
feet	O
long	O

very	O
narrow	O

it	O
was	O
fitted	O

much	O

in	O

respect	O
very	O
much	O
inferior	O

when	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
shallow	O
water	O

they	O
set	O
it	O
on	O
with	O
poles	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
in	O
deep	O
,	O
they	O
worked	O
it	O
with	O
paddles	O
about	O
four	O
feet	O
long	O
:	O
it	O
contained	O
just	O
four	O
people	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
visited	O
us	O
to-day	O
went	O
away	O
at	O
two	O
turns	O

Their	O
lances	O
were	O
like	O
those	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
in	O
Botany	PNM

except	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
but	O
a	O
single	O
point	O

which	O
in	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
the	O
sting	O

barbed	O
with	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
sharp	O
bones	O
of	O
the	O

fish	O
:	O
it	O
was	O
indeed	O
a	O
most	O

weapon	O

and	O
the	O
instrument	O
which	O
they	O
used	O
in	O

seemed	O
to	O
be	O

with	O
more	O

in	O

we	O

of	O

at	O

threw	O
his	O
lance	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
about	O
eight	O
feet	O
long	O
:	O
it	O
flew	O
with	O
a	O
swiftness	O

steadiness	O
that	O
surprised	O
us	O

though	O
it	O
was	O
never	O
more	O
than	O
four	O
feet	O
from	O

it	O
entered	O
deeply	O
into	O
a	O
tree	O
at	O
fifty	O

After	O
this	O
they	O
ventured	O
on	O

I	O
left	O
them	O

to	O
all	O

entertained	O

went	O
again	O
with	O
Mr.	O

to	O
take	O
a	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
country	O

chiefly	O
to	O

round	O
us	O

the	O

us	O

an	O
idea	O
more	O
disadvantageous	O

the	O

After	O
having	O
walked	O
about	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
miles	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
,	O
we	O
ascended	O
a	O
very	O
high	O
hill	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
soon	O
convinced	O
that	O
the	O
danger	O
of	O
our	O
situation	O
was	O
at	O
least	O
equal	O
to	O
our	O
apprehensions	O
;	O
for	O
in	O
whatever	O
direction	O
we	O
turned	O
our	O
eyes	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
rocks	O
and	O
shoals	O
without	O
number	O
,	O
and	O
no	O
passage	O
out	O
to	O
sea	O

through	O
the	O

the	O

one	O
of	O
our	O
turtle	O

was	O

asked	O

by	O

to	O
give	O
them	O
one	O
;	O

being	O

expressed	O

both	O

great	O
disappointment	O

I	O
offered	O
one	O

stamped	O

dragged	O
them	O

side	O

out	O

some	O

from	O

just	O

enough	O

save	O
his	O
tent	O

hauling	O
it	O
down	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O

the	O
smith	O

forge	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
such	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
as	O
would	O
burn	O
,	O
was	O
consumed	O

While	O
this	O
was	O
doing	O
,	O
the	O
Indians	O
went	O
to	O
a	O
place	O
at	O
some	O
distance	O
,	O
where	O
several	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
were	O
washing	O

where	O
our	O
nets	O

was	O
the	O

a	O
great	O
quantity	O

laid	O
out	O

fire	O
to	O
the	O
grass	O

entirely	O
disregarding	O
both	O
threats	O

entreaties	O

We	O
were	O
therefore	O
obliged	O
to	O
discharge	O
a	O
musquet	O
,	O
loaded	O
with	O
small	O
shot	O
,	O
at	O
one	O

about	O
forty	O

this	O
putting	O
them	O
to	O

we	O
extinguished	O
the	O
fire	O
at	O
this	O

much	O

it	O
spread	O
into	O
the	O

As	O
the	O
Indians	O
were	O
still	O
in	O

I	O
fired	O
a	O

charged	O
with	O
ball	O

abreast	O

quickened	O
their	O
pace	O

we	O
soon	O
lost	O

We	O
thought	O
they	O
would	O
now	O
give	O
us	O
no	O

soon	O

he	O
went	O
back	O
to	O
his	O

and	O
the	O
whole	O
body	O
slowly	O
retreated	O

We	O
found	O
means	O
however	O
to	O
seize	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
darts	O
,	O
and	O
continued	O
to	O
follow	O
them	O
about	O

sat	O
down	O

spoke	O

answered	O

lances	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
taken	O
from	O

and	O
we	O
perceived	O
with	O
great	O
satisfaction	O
that	O
this	O
rendered	O
the	O
reconciliation	O
complete	O

We	O
found	O
in	O

that	O

dangerously	O
hurt	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
distance	O
at	O
which	O

reached	O
him	O

about	O

us	O

we	O
went	O
along	O

us	O

that	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
set	O
fire	O
to	O
the	O

we	O
distributed	O
among	O

some	O
musquet	O

endeavoured	O
to	O

them	O

came	O

down	O

could	O
not	O

prevailed	O
upon	O

come	O
on	O

we	O
therefore	O
left	O
them	O

in	O
about	O
two	O

they	O
went	O
away	O

Mr.	O

picked	O
up	O
several	O

which	O

We	O
found	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
visible	O
at	O
twelve	O
leagues	O

,	O
to	O
be	O

eight	O

and	O
in	O

there	O
are	O
some	O

which	O
is	O
covered	O
with	O
long	O
thin	O
grass	O
,	O
and	O
trees	O
of	O
the	O

kind	O
with	O
those	O
upon	O
the	O
main	O
:	O
this	O
part	O
also	O
abounded	O
with	O
lizards	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
large	O
size	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
took	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
also	O
fresh	O
water	O
in	O
two	O
places	O
;	O
one	O
was	O
a	O
running	O
stream	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
brackish	O
where	O
I	O
tasted	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
the	O
other	O
was	O
a	O
standing	O
pool	O
,	O
close	O
behind	O
the	O
sandy	O
beach	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
perfectly	O
sweet	O

good	O
.	O

Notwithstanding	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
this	O
island	O
from	O
the	O

,	O
we	O
saw	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
surprize	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
sometimes	O
visited	O
by	O
the	O
natives	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
found	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
frames	O
of	O
their	O
huts	O
,	O
and	O
vast	O
heaps	O
of	O
shells	O
,	O
the	O
fish	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
supposed	O
had	O
been	O
their	O
food	O
.	O

We	O
observed	O
that	O
all	O
these	O
huts	O
were	O
built	O
upon	O
eminences	O
,	O
and	O
entirely	O
exposed	O
to	O
the	O
S.	O
E.	O
contrary	O
to	O
those	O
which	O
we	O
had	O

upon	O

they	O
were	O
all	O

either	O
upon	O
the	O

of	O
a	O

,	O
or	O
under	O
some	O

which	O
afforded	O
them	O
shelter	O
from	O
the	O

these	O
huts	O
,	O
and	O

we	O
concluded	O
that	O
at	O
some	O

weather	O
here	O

it	O

so	O
that	O

even	O
now	O
the	O

at	O
this	O

a	O

which	O
was	O
enough	O
to	O
turn	O
the	O

in	O
our	O
favour	O

and	O
,	O
in	O
conjunction	O
with	O
the	O
assistance	O
which	O
was	O
afforded	O
us	O
by	O
the	O

,	O
to	O
give	O
the	O
ship	O
a	O
perceptible	O
motion	O
obliquely	O
from	O

Our	O
hopes	O
now	O
revived	O
;	O

in	O
less	O
than	O
ten	O
minutes	O
it	O
was	O
again	O
a	O
dead	O
calm	O
,	O
and	O
the	O

was	O
again	O
driven	O
towards	O
the	O

which	O
were	O
not	O

two	O

The	O

light	O

however	O
returned	O
before	O
we	O

all	O
the	O
ground	O

had	O
enabled	O
us	O
to	O
gain	O
,	O
and	O
lasted	O
about	O
ten	O
minutes	O
more	O
.	O

During	O
this	O
time	O
we	O
discovered	O
a	O
small	O
opening	O
in	O
the	O
reef	O
,	O
at	O
about	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
:	O
I	O
immediately	O
sent	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Mates	O
to	O
examine	O
it	O
,	O
who	O
reported	O
that	O
its	O
breadth	O
was	O
not	O
more	O
than	O
the	O
length	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
within	O
it	O
there	O
was	O
smooth	O
water	O
:	O
this	O
discovery	O
seemed	O
to	O
render	O
our	O
escape	O
possible	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
all	O
,	O
by	O
pushing	O
the	O
ship	O
through	O
the	O
opening	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
immediately	O
attempted	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
uncertain	O
indeed	O
whether	O
we	O
could	O
reach	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
if	O
we	O
should	O
succeed	O
thus	O
far	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
no	O
doubt	O
of	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
through	O
:	O
in	O
this	O
however	O
we	O
were	O
disappointed	O
,	O
for	O
having	O
reached	O
it	O
by	O
the	O
joint	O
assistance	O
of	O
our	O
boats	O
and	O
the	O
breeze	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
it	O
had	O
become	O
high	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
surprize	O
we	O
met	O
the	O
tide	O
of	O
ebb	O
rushing	O
out	O
of	O
it	O
like	O
a	O
mill-stream	O
.	O

We	O
gained	O
however	O
some	O
advantage	O
,	O
though	O
in	O
a	O
manner	O
directly	O
contrary	O
to	O
our	O
expectations	O
;	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
impossible	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
the	O
opening	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
stream	O
that	O
prevented	O
us	O
,	O
carried	O
us	O
out	O
about	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
:	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
narrow	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
keep	O
in	O
it	O
longer	O
;	O
yet	O
this	O
tide	O
of	O
ebb	O
so	O
much	O
assisted	O
the	O
boats	O
that	O
by	O
noon	O
we	O
had	O
got	O
an	O
offing	O
of	O
near	O
two	O

We	O
had	O

it	O

On	O
the	O
3d	O
of	O
September	O
,	O
at	O
day-break	O
,	O
*	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
land	O
extending	O
from	O
N.	O
by	O
E.	O
to	O
S.E.	O
at	O
about	O
four	O
leagues	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
then	O
kept	O
standing	O
in	O
for	O
it	O
with	O
a	O
fresh	O
gale	O
at	O
E.S.E.	O
and	O
E.	O
by	O
S.	O
till	O
nine	O
o'clock	O
,	O
when	O
being	O
within	O
about	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
miles	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
three	O
fathom	O
water	O
,	O
we	O
brought	O
to	O
.	O

The	O
pinnace	O
being	O
hoisted	O
out	O
,	O
I	O
set	O
off	O
from	O
the	O
ship	O
with	O
the	O
boat	O
's	O
crew	O
,	O
accompanied	O
by	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
,	O
who	O
also	O
took	O
his	O
servants	O
,	O
and	O
Dr.	O
Solander	O
,	O
being	O
in	O
all	O
twelve	O
persons	O
well	O
armed	O
;	O
we	O
rowed	O
directly	O
towards	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
*	O
but	O
the	O
water	O
was	O
so	O
shallow	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
reach	O
it	O
by	O
about	O
two	O
hundred	O
yards	O
:	O
we	O
waded	O
however	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
having	O
left	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
seamen	O
to	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
.	O

Hitherto	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
no	O
signs	O
of	O
inhabitants	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
got	O
ashore	O
we	O
discovered	O
the	O
prints	O
of	O
human	O
feet	O
,	O
which	O
could	O
not	O
long	O
have	O
been	O
impressed	O
upon	O
the	O
sand	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
below	O
high-water	O
mark	O
:	O
we	O
therefore	O
concluded	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
were	O
at	O
no	O
great	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
thick	O
wood	O
came	O
down	O
within	O
a	O
hundred	O
yards	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
we	O
thought	O
it	O
necessary	O
to	O
proceed	O
with	O
caution	O
,	O
lest	O
we	O
should	O
fall	O
into	O
an	O
ambuscade	O
and	O
our	O
retreat	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
be	O
cut	O
off	O
.	O

We	O
walked	O
along	O
the	O
skirts	O
of	O
the	O
wood	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
about	O
two	O
hundred	O
yards	O
from	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
landed	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
grove	O
of	O
cocoa-nut	O
trees	O
,	O
which	O
stood	O
upon	O
the	O
banks	O
of	O
a	O
little	O
brook	O
of	O
brackish	O
water	O
.	O

The	O
trees	O
were	O
of	O
a	O
small	O
growth	O
,	O
but	O
well	O
hung	O
with	O
fruit	O
;	O
and	O
near	O
them	O
was	O
a	O
shed	O
or	O
hut	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
covered	O
with	O
their	O
leaves	O
,	O
though	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
now	O
fallen	O
off	O
:	O
about	O
the	O
hut	O
lay	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
the	O
shells	O
of	O
the	O
fruit	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
which	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
just	O
fresh	O
from	O
the	O
tree	O
.	O

We	O
looked	O
at	O
the	O
fruit	O
very	O
wishfully	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
thinking	O
it	O
safe	O
to	O
climb	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
leave	O
it	O
without	O
tasting	O
a	O
single	O
nut	O
.	O

At	O
a	O
little	O
distance	O
from	O
this	O
place	O
we	O
found	O
plantains	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
breadfruit	O
tree	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
had	O
nothing	O
upon	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
now	O
advanced	O
about	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
three	O
Indians	O
rushed	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
wood	O
with	O
a	O
hideous	O
shout	O
,	O
at	O
about	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
a	O
hundred	O
yards	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
they	O
ran	O
towards	O
us	O
,	O
the	O
foremost	O
threw	O
something	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
hand	O
,	O
which	O
slew	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
burnt	O
exactly	O
like	O
gunpowder	O
,	O
but	O
made	O
no	O
report	O
:	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
instantly	O
threw	O
their	O
lances	O
at	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
no	O
time	O
was	O
now	O
to	O
be	O
lost	O
,	O
we	O
discharged	O
our	O
pieces	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
loaded	O
with	O
small	O
shot	O
.	O

*	O
It	O
is	O
probable	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
feel	O
the	O
shot	O
,	O
for	O
though	O
they	O
halted	O
a	O
moment	O
,	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
retreat	O
;	O
and	O
a	O
third	O
dart	O
was	O
thrown	O
at	O
us	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
thought	O
their	O
farther	O
approach	O
might	O
be	O
prevented	O
with	O
less	O
risk	O
of	O
life	O
,	O
than	O
it	O
would	O
cost	O
to	O
defend	O
ourselves	O
against	O
their	O
attack	O
if	O
they	O
should	O
come	O
nearer	O
,	O
we	O
loaded	O
our	O
pieces	O
with	O
ball	O
,	O
and	O
fired	O
a	O
second	O
time	O
:	O
by	O
this	O
discharge	O
it	O
is	O
probable	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
wounded	O
;	O
yet	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
satisfaction	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
they	O
all	O
ran	O
away	O
with	O
great	O
agility	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
disposed	O
forcibly	O
to	O
invade	O
this	O
country	O
,	O
either	O
to	O
gratify	O
our	O
appetites	O
or	O
our	O
curiosity	O
,	O
and	O
perceived	O
that	O
nothing	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
upon	O
friendly	O
terms	O
,	O
we	O
improved	O
this	O
interval	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
destruction	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
was	O
no	O
longer	O
necessary	O
to	O
our	O
own	O
defence	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
all	O
expedition	O
returned	O
towards	O
our	O
boat	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
were	O
advancing	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
we	O
perceived	O
that	O
the	O
two	O
men	O
on	O
board	O
made	O
signals	O
that	O
more	O
Indians	O
were	O
coming	O
down	O
;	O
and	O
before	O
we	O
got	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
we	O
saw	O
several	O
of	O
them	O
coming	O
round	O
a	O
point	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
about	O
five	O
hundred	O
yards	O
:	O
it	O
is	O
probable	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
the	O
three	O
who	O
first	O
attacked	O
us	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
saw	O
us	O
they	O
halted	O
,	O
and	O
seemed	O
to	O
wait	O
till	O
their	O
main	O
body	O
should	O
come	O
up	O
.	O

We	O
entered	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
waded	O
towards	O
the	O
boat	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
remained	O
at	O
their	O
station	O
,	O
without	O
giving	O
us	O
any	O
interruption	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
aboard	O
we	O
rowed	O
abreast	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
number	O
then	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
between	O
sixty	O
and	O
a	O
hundred	O
.	O

We	O
now	O
took	O
a	O
view	O
of	O
them	O
at	O
our	O
leisure	O
;	O
they	O
made	O
much	O
the	O
same	O
appearance	O
as	O
the	O
New	O
Hollanders	O
,	O
being	O
nearly	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
stature	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
their	O
hair	O
short	O
cropped	O
:	O
like	O
them	O
also	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
stark	O
naked	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
thought	O
the	O
colour	O
of	O
their	O
skin	O
was	O
not	O
quite	O
so	O
dark	O
;	O
this	O
however	O
might	O
perhaps	O
be	O
merely	O
the	O
effect	O
of	O
their	O
not	O
being	O
quite	O
so	O
dirty	O
.	O

All	O
this	O
while	O
they	O
were	O
shouting	O
defiance	O
,	O
and	O
letting	O
off	O
their	O
fires	O
by	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
.	O

*	O
What	O
these	O
fires	O
were	O
,	O
or	O
for	O
what	O
purpose	O
intended	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
imagine	O
:	O
those	O
who	O
discharged	O
them	O
had	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O
a	O
short	O
piece	O
of	O
stick	O
,	O
possibly	O
a	O
hollow	O
cane	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
swung	O
sideways	O
from	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
immediately	O
saw	O
fire	O
and	O
smoke	O
,	O
exactly	O
resembling	O
those	O
of	O
a	O
musquet	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
no	O
longer	O
duration	O
.	O

This	O
wonderful	O
phaenomenon	O
was	O
observed	O
from	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
deception	O
was	O
so	O
great	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
board	O
thought	O
they	O
had	O
fire-arms	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
so	O
near	O
as	O
that	O
we	O
must	O
have	O
heard	O
the	O
report	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
thought	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
firing	O
volleys	O
.	O

After	O
we	O
had	O
looked	O
at	O
them	O
attentively	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
without	O
taking	O
any	O
notice	O
of	O
their	O
flashing	O
and	O
vociferation	O
,	O
we	O
fired	O
some	O
musquets	O
over	O
their	O
heads	O
:	O
upon	O
hearing	O
the	O
balls	O
rattle	O
among	O
the	O
trees	O
,	O
they	O
walked	O
leisurely	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
returned	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

Upon	O
examining	O
the	O
weapons	O
they	O
had	O
thrown	O
at	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
light	O
darts	O
,	O
about	O
four	O
feet	O
long	O
,	O
very	O
ill	O
made	O

pointed	O
with	O
hard	O

in	O

there	O
were	O
many	O

were	O

great	O
force	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
sixty	O

they	O
went	O
beyond	O
us	O

but	O
in	O
what	O

we	O
could	O
not	O
exactly	O
see	O
:	O
possibly	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
shot	O
with	O
a	O

but	O
we	O
saw	O
no	O

among	O
them	O
when	O
we	O
surveyed	O
them	O
from	O
the	O
boat	O

and	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
general	O
of	O
opinion	O
that	O

Soon	O
after	O
our	O
return	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O

we	O
hoisted	O
in	O
the	O

made	O

But	O
I	O
am	O
sorry	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
strongly	O
urged	O
by	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
officers	O
to	O
send	O
a	O
party	O
of	O

ashore	O

cut	O
down	O
the	O
cocoa-nut	O

for	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
the	O

.	O

This	O
I	O
peremptorily	O
refused	O
,	O
as	O
equally	O
unjust	O
and	O
cruel	O
.	O

The	O
natives	O
had	O
attacked	O
us	O
merely	O
for	O
landing	O
upon	O
their	O
coast	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
attempted	O
to	O
take	O
nothing	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
therefore	O
morally	O
certain	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
made	O
a	O
vigorous	O
effort	O
to	O
defend	O
their	O
property	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
invaded	O

in	O
which	O
case	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
must	O
have	O
fallen	O
a	O
sacrifice	O
to	O
our	O
attempt	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
also	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
own	O
people	O

I	O
should	O
have	O
regretted	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
measure	O

if	O
I	O
had	O

in	O

certainly	O
it	O
would	O

two	O

three	O

The	O
isle	O

has	O
not	O
so	O
lofty	O

mountainous	O
an	O
appearance	O
as	O

the	O

part	O
was	O

with	O
a	O
kind	O

About	O
ten	O

at	O

we	O
observed	O
a	O

in	O

resembled	O

was	O

reached	O
about	O

its	O

was	O

and	O
at	O
first	O
I	O
thought	O

steered	O

by	O
ten	O
o'clock	O
were	O
close	O
in	O
with	O

and	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
very	O
agreeable	O
surprise	O

numerous	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
temptation	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
resisted	O
by	O
people	O
in	O
our	O
situation	O

were	O
in	O

it	O
was	O

appeared	O
to	O

that	O
had	O

The	O

was	O
hoisted	O
out	O

and	O
Mr.	O
Gore	O
,	O
the	O
Second	O
Lieutenant	O
,	O
sent	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
there	O
was	O
any	O
convenient	O
place	O
to	O
land	O

taking	O
with	O
him	O
some	O
trifles	O

as	O
presents	O
to	O

if	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
should	O
appear	O
.	O

While	O
he	O
was	O
gone	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
from	O
the	O
ship	O
two	O
men	O
on	O
horseback	O
,	O
who	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
riding	O
upon	O
the	O
hills	O
for	O
their	O
amusement	O
,	O
and	O
often	O
stopped	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
ship	O

By	O
this	O
we	O
knew	O
that	O
the	O
place	O
had	O
been	O
settled	O
by	O
Europeans	O
,	O
and	O
hoped	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
many	O
disagreeable	O
circumstances	O
which	O
always	O
attend	O
the	O
first	O
establishment	O
of	O
commerce	O
with	O
savages	O
,	O
would	O
be	O
avoided	O

In	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Gore	O
landed	O
in	O
a	O
small	O
sandy	O
cove	O
near	O
some	O
houses	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
met	O
by	O
eight	O
or	O
ten	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
in	O
their	O
dress	O
as	O
their	O
persons	O
,	O
very	O
much	O
resembled	O
the	O
Malays	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
without	O
arms	O
,	O
except	O
the	O
knives	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
their	O
custom	O
to	O
wear	O
in	O
their	O
girdles	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
a	O
jack	O
ass	O
with	O
him	O
:	O
they	O
courteously	O
invited	O
him	O
ashore	O
,	O
and	O
conversed	O
with	O
him	O
by	O
signs	O

*	O
but	O
very	O
little	O
of	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
either	O
party	O
could	O
be	O
understood	O
by	O
the	O
other	O

In	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
he	O
returned	O
with	O
this	O
report	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
mortification	O
,	O
added	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
anchorage	O
for	O
the	O
ship	O

I	O
sent	O
him	O
however	O
a	O
second	O
time	O
,	O
with	O
both	O
money	O

goods	O
,	O
that	O

purchase	O
some	O
refreshments	O

at	O

for	O
the	O
sick	O
;	O
and	O
Dr.	O
Solander	O
went	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
with	O
him	O

In	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
I	O
kept	O
standing	O
on	O

off	O
with	O
the	O
ship	O

at	O

of	O
the	O

Before	O
the	O
boat	O
could	O
land	O

we	O
saw	O
two	O

was	O
in	O

when	O

came	O
to	O
the	O

took	O
little	O
notice	O

sauntered	O

and	O
seemed	O
to	O
look	O
with	O
great	O
curiosity	O
at	O
the	O

We	O
saw	O

other	O
horsemen	O

a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
persons	O
on	O

gather	O
round	O
our	O
people	O

and	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
perceived	O
several	O
cocoa-nuts	O
carried	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O

from	O
which	O
we	O
concluded	O
that	O

ashore	O
about	O

the	O

The	O

told	O
us	O

that	O

seen	O
some	O
of	O

who	O
were	O

linen	O

and	O
had	O
chains	O
of	O
gold	O
round	O
their	O
necks	O

he	O
said	O

that	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
trade	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
owner	O
of	O
the	O
cocoa-nuts	O
was	O
absent	O

that	O
about	O
two	O

had	O

a	O
present	O

that	O
some	O

The	O
people	O
,	O
to	O
give	O
him	O
the	O
information	O
that	O
he	O
wanted	O
,	O
drew	O
a	O
map	O
upon	O
the	O
sand	O

in	O
which	O
they	O
made	O
a	O
rude	O
representation	O
of	O
a	O
harbour	O
to	O
leeward	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
town	O

it	O

they	O
also	O
gave	O
him	O
to	O
understand	O

that	O
sheep	O

Some	O

frequently	O
pronounced	O

said	O
something	O
of	O
Larntuca	PNM
,	O
upon	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Ende	PNM

from	O
this	O
circumstance	O

we	O
conjectured	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
Portuguese	O
somewhere	O
upon	O
the	O
island	O

and	O
a	O
Portuguese	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
in	O
our	O
boat	O

attempted	O
to	O
converse	O
with	O
the	O
Indians	O
in	O
that	O
language	O

soon	O
found	O
that	O

it	O

should	O
see	O
somewhat	O

which	O
he	O
expressed	O
by	O
crossing	O
his	O

the	O

that	O

at	O

with	O

the	O

a	O

that	O

when	O
they	O
came	O
ashore	O

walked	O
up	O
with	O
them	O
to	O

In	O
the	O

I	O
went	O
ashore	O
with	O
Mr.	O

several	O
of	O
the	O
officers	O

Gentlemen	O
,	O
to	O
return	O
the	O
King	O

visit	O
;	O
but	O
my	O
chief	O
business	O
was	O
to	O
procure	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
buffaloes	O
,	O
sheep	O

fowls	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
told	O
should	O
be	O
driven	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O

We	O
were	O
greatly	O

to	O
find	O
that	O
no	O
steps	O
had	O
been	O
taken	O
to	O
fulfil	O
this	O
promise	O

we	O
proceeded	O
to	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
assembly	O

which	O
with	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
more	O
had	O
been	O
erected	O
by	O
the	O
Dutch	O
East	O
India	PNM
company	O
,	O
and	O
are	O
distinguished	O
from	O
the	O
rest	O
by	O
two	O
pieces	O
of	O
wood	O
resembling	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
cow	O

one	O
of	O
which	O
is	O
set	O
up	O
at	O

of	O
the	O
ridge	O
that	O
terminates	O
the	O

these	O
were	O
certainly	O
what	O
the	O
Indian	O
intended	O
to	O
represent	O
by	O
crossing	O
his	O
fingers	O

though	O
our	O
Portuguese	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
Catholic	O
,	O
construed	O
the	O
sign	O
into	O
a	O
cross	O

*	O
which	O
had	O
persuaded	O
us	O
that	O
the	O
settlement	O
belonged	O
to	O
his	O
countrymen	O

In	O
this	O
place	O
we	O
met	O
Mr.	O
Lange	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
King	O
,	O
whose	O
name	O
was	O
A	O
Madocho	PNM
Lomi	PNM
Djara	PNM
,	O
attended	O
by	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
principal	O
people	O
.	O

We	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
goods	O
of	O
various	O
kinds	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
proposed	O
to	O
barter	O
for	O
such	O
refreshments	O
as	O
they	O
would	O
give	O
us	O
in	O
exchange	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
leave	O
to	O
bring	O
them	O
on	O
shore	O
;	O
which	O
being	O
granted	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
brought	O
ashore	O
accordingly	O

We	O
then	O
attempted	O
to	O
settle	O
the	O
price	O
of	O
the	O
buffaloes	O

sheep	O

left	O

telling	O
us	O
that	O
these	O

must	O
be	O
settled	O
with	O
the	O
natives	O
:	O
he	O
said	O

As	O
the	O
morning	O
was	O
now	O
far	O
advanced	O

we	O
were	O
very	O
unwilling	O

eat	O
salt	O

when	O
so	O
many	O

we	O
petitioned	O

answered	O

that	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
eat	O
victuals	O
dressed	O
by	O
his	O

About	O
five	O
o'clock	O

dinner	O
was	O
ready	O

it	O
was	O
served	O
in	O
six	O

thirty	O
dishes	O

rather	O
baskets	O

alternately	O
rice	O

three	O

filled	O
with	O

liquor	O

the	O

were	O

mats	O
laid	O
round	O

for	O
us	O
to	O

We	O
were	O
then	O
conducted	O
by	O
turns	O
to	O
a	O
hole	O
in	O
the	O
floor	O
,	O
near	O
which	O
stood	O
a	O
man	O
with	O
water	O
in	O
a	O
vessel	O
,	O
made	O
of	O
the	O
leaves	O
of	O
the	O
fan-palm	O

who	O
assisted	O
us	O
in	O
washing	O
our	O
hands	O
.	O

When	O
this	O
was	O
done	O
,	O
we	O
placed	O
ourselves	O
round	O
the	O
victuals	O
,	O
and	O
waited	O
for	O
the	O
king	O
.	O

As	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
come	O
,	O
we	O
enquired	O
for	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
told	O
that	O
the	O
custom	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
did	O
not	O
permit	O
the	O
person	O
who	O
gave	O
the	O
entertainment	O
to	O
sit	O
down	O
with	O
his	O
guests	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
suspected	O
the	O
victuals	O
to	O
be	O
poisoned	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
come	O
and	O
taste	O
it	O
.	O

We	O
immediately	O
declared	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
such	O
suspicion	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
that	O
none	O
of	O
the	O
rituals	O
of	O
hospitality	O
might	O
be	O
violated	O
on	O
our	O
account	O

The	O
prime	O
minister	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Lange	O
were	O
of	O
our	O
party	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
made	O
a	O
most	O
luxurious	O
meal	O
:	O
we	O
thought	O
the	O
pork	O
and	O
rice	O
excellent	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
broth	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
despised	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
spoons	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
made	O
of	O
leaves	O
,	O
were	O
so	O
small	O
that	O
few	O
of	O
us	O
had	O
patience	O
to	O
use	O
them	O

After	O
dinner	O
,	O
our	O
wine	O
passed	O
briskly	O
about	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
again	O
enquired	O
for	O
our	O
royal	O
host	O
,	O
thinking	O
that	O
though	O
the	O
custom	O
of	O
his	O
country	O
would	O
not	O
allow	O
him	O
to	O
eat	O
with	O
us	O

he	O
might	O
at	O

share	O
in	O
the	O
jollity	O
of	O
our	O
bottle	O

he	O
again	O
excused	O
himself	O

saying	O

that	O
the	O
master	O
of	O
a	O
feast	O
should	O
never	O
be	O
drunk	O
,	O
which	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
certain	O
way	O
to	O

by	O
not	O
tasting	O
the	O
liquor	O

We	O
did	O
not	O
however	O
drink	O
our	O
wine	O
where	O
we	O
had	O
eaten	O
our	O
victuals	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
dined	O
made	O
room	O
for	O
the	O
seamen	O
and	O
servants	O
,	O
who	O
immediately	O
took	O
our	O
places	O
:	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
dispatch	O
all	O
that	O
we	O

the	O
women	O
who	O
came	O
to	O
clear	O
away	O
the	O
bowls	O

obliged	O
them	O

them	O
what	O

As	O
wine	O
generally	O
warms	O
and	O
opens	O
the	O
heart	O
,	O
we	O
took	O
an	O
opportunity	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
thought	O
its	O
influence	O
began	O

to	O
revive	O
the	O

we	O

But	O
our	O
Saxon	O

with	O

phlegm	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
communicate	O
to	O
us	O

which	O
he	O
pretended	O

received	O
from	O
the	O
Governor	PNM

He	O
said	O

that	O

It	O
was	O
the	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
we	O
received	O
intelligence	O
from	O
our	O
trading-place	O
that	O
no	O
buffaloes	O
or	O
hogs	O
had	O
been	O
brought	O
down	O

only	O
a	O

had	O
been	O
taken	O
away	O
before	O
our	O
people	O

who	O
had	O
sent	O
for	O
money	O
,	O
could	O
procure	O
it	O

Some	O
fowls	O

had	O
been	O
bought	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
large	O
quantity	O
of	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
syrup	O
made	O
of	O
the	O

the	O

which	O

though	O
infinitely	O
superior	O
to	O
molasses	O

treacle	O
,	O
sold	O
at	O
a	O
very	O
low	O
price	O
.	O

We	O
complained	O
of	O
our	O
disappointment	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Lange	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
now	O
another	O
subterfuge	O
;	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
gone	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O
ourselves	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
purchased	O
what	O
we	O
pleased	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
natives	O
were	O
afraid	O
to	O
take	O
money	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
,	O
lest	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
counterfeit	O
.	O

We	O
could	O
not	O
but	O
feel	O
some	O
indignation	O
against	O
a	O
man	O
who	O
had	O
concealed	O
this	O
,	O
being	O
true	O
;	O
or	O
alleged	O
it	O
,	O
being	O
false	O
.	O

I	O
started	O
up	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
immediately	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
but	O
no	O
cattle	O
or	O
sheep	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O

were	O
any	O
at	O

While	O
I	O
was	O
gone	O
,	O
Lange	O
,	O
who	O
knew	O
well	O
enough	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
succeed	O
no	O
better	O
than	O
my	O
people	O
,	O
told	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
that	O
the	O
natives	O
were	O
displeased	O
at	O
our	O
not	O
having	O
offered	O
them	O
gold	O
for	O
their	O
stock	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
if	O
gold	O
was	O
not	O
offered	O
,	O
nothing	O
would	O
be	O
bought	O
.	O

Mr.	O
Banks	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
it	O
worth	O
his	O
while	O
to	O
reply	O
,	O
but	O
soon	O
after	O
rose	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
all	O
returned	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
very	O
much	O
dissatisfied	O
with	O
the	O
issue	O
of	O
our	O
negociations	O

During	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
the	O
day	O

the	O
King	O
had	O
promised	O
that	O
some	O
cattle	O
and	O
sheep	O
should	O
be	O
brought	O
down	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
given	O
a	O
reason	O
for	O
our	O
disappointment	O
somewhat	O
more	O
plausible	O
;	O
he	O
said	O
that	O
the	O
buffaloes	O
were	O
far	O
up	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
had	O

down	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
we	O
went	O
ashore	O
again	O
:	O
Dr.	O
Solander	O
went	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
town	O
to	O
speak	O
to	O
Lange	PNM
,	O
and	O
I	O
remained	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
could	O
be	O
done	O
in	O
the	O
purchase	O
of	O
provisions	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
here	O
an	O
old	O
Indian	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
appeared	O
to	O
have	O
some	O
authority	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
among	O
ourselves	O
called	O
the	O
Prime	O
Minister	O
;	O
to	O
engage	O
this	O
man	O
in	O
our	O
interest	O
I	O
presented	O
him	O
with	O
a	O
spying-glass	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
saw	O
nothing	O
at	O
market	O
except	O
one	O
small	O
buffalo	O
.	O

I	O
enquired	O
the	O
price	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
told	O
five	O
guineas	O
:	O
this	O
was	O
twice	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
worth	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
offered	O
three	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
could	O
perceive	O
the	O
man	O
who	O
treated	O
with	O
me	O
thought	O
a	O
good	O
price	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
said	O
that	O
he	O
must	O
acquaint	O
the	O
King	O
with	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
offered	O
before	O
he	O
could	O
take	O
it	O
.	O

A	O
messenger	O
was	O
immediately	O
dispatched	O
to	O
his	O
Majesty	O
,	O
who	O
soon	O
returned	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
buffalo	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
sold	O
for	O
any	O
thing	O
less	O
than	O
five	O
guineas	O
.	O

This	O
price	O
I	O
absolutely	O
refused	O
to	O
give	O
;	O
and	O
another	O
messenger	O
was	O
sent	O
away	O
with	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
my	O
refusal	O
:	O
this	O
messenger	O
was	O
longer	O
absent	O
than	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
and	O
while	O
I	O
was	O
waiting	O
for	O
his	O
return	O
I	O
saw	O
,	O
to	O
my	O
great	O
astonishment	O
,	O
Dr.	O
Solander	O
coming	O
from	O
the	O
town	O
,	O
*	O
followed	O
by	O
above	O
a	O
hundred	O
men	O
,	O
some	O
armed	O
with	O
musquets	O
and	O
some	O
with	O
lances	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
enquired	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
this	O
hostile	O
appearance	O
,	O
the	O
Doctor	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Lange	O
had	O
interpreted	O
to	O
him	O
a	O
message	O
from	O
the	O
King	O
,	O
purporting	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
would	O
not	O
trade	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
had	O
refused	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
more	O
than	O
half	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
what	O
they	O
had	O
to	O
sell	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
permitted	O
to	O
trade	O
upon	O
any	O
terms	O
longer	O
than	O
this	O
day	O
.	O

Besides	O
the	O
officers	O
who	O
commanded	O
the	O
party	O
,	O
there	O
came	O
with	O
it	O
a	O
man	O
who	O
was	O
born	O
at	O
Timor	PNM
,	O
of	O
Portuguese	O
parents	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
afterwards	O
discovered	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
colleague	O
to	O
the	O
Dutch	O
factor	O
;	O
by	O
this	O
man	O
what	O
they	O
pretended	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
King	O
's	O
order	O
was	O
delivered	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
purport	O
with	O
that	O
which	O
Dr.	O
Solander	O
had	O
received	O
from	O
Lange	PNM
.	O

We	O
were	O
all	O
clearly	O
of	O
opinion	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
mere	O
artifice	O
of	O
the	O
factors	O
to	O
extort	O
money	O
from	O
us	O
,	O
for	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
prepared	O
by	O
the	O
account	O
of	O
a	O
letter	O
from	O
Concordia	PNM
;	O
and	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
hesitating	O
what	O
step	O
to	O
take	O
,	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
the	O
sooner	O
accomplish	O
his	O
purpose	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
drive	O
away	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
had	O
brought	O
down	O
poultry	O
and	O
syrup	O
,	O
and	O
others	O
that	O
were	O
now	O
coming	O
in	O
with	O
buffaloes	O
and	O
sheep	O
.	O

At	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
I	O
glanced	O
my	O
eye	O
upon	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
whom	O
I	O
had	O
complimented	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
with	O
the	O
spying-glass	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
by	O
his	O
looks	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
heartily	O
approve	O
of	O
what	O
was	O
doing	O
;	O
I	O
therefore	O
took	O
him	O
by	O
the	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
presented	O
him	O
with	O
an	O
old	O
broad	O
sword	O
.	O

This	O
instantly	O
turned	O
the	O
scale	O
in	O
our	O
favour	O
;	O
he	O
received	O
the	O
sword	O
with	O
a	O
transport	O
of	O
joy	O
,	O
and	O
flourishing	O
it	O
over	O
the	O
busy	O
Portuguese	O
,	O
who	O
crouched	O
like	O
a	O
fox	O
to	O
a	O
lion	O
,	O
he	O
made	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
officer	O
who	O
commanded	O
the	O
party	O

sit	O
down	O
upon	O
the	O

whatever	O
were	O
the	O
crafty	O
pretences	O
of	O
these	O
iniquitous	O
factors	O
for	O
a	O
Dutch	O
company	O
,	O
were	O
eager	O
to	O
supply	O
us	O
with	O
whatever	O
we	O
wanted	O
,	O
*	O
and	O
seemed	O
also	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
desirous	O
of	O
goods	O
than	O
money	O
,	O
instantly	O
improved	O
the	O
advantage	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
procured	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
market	O
was	O
stocked	O
almost	O
in	O
an	O
instant	O

To	O
establish	O
a	O
trade	O
for	O
buffaloes	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
most	O
wanted	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
it	O
necessary	O
to	O
give	O
ten	O
guineas	O
for	O
two	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
which	O
weighed	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
hundred	O
and	O
sixty	O
pounds	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
bought	O
seven	O
more	O
much	O
cheaper	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
afterwards	O
have	O
purchased	O
as	O
many	O
as	O
I	O
pleased	O
almost	O
upon	O
my	O
own	O
terms	O

for	O

were	O
now	O
driven	O
down	O

the	O

the	O

I	O
bought	O
so	O
dear	O

certainly	O
a	O
share	O

it	O
was	O
in	O
hopes	O
to	O
obtain	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
price	O
of	O
others	O

that	O
he	O
had	O
pretended	O
we	O
must	O
pay	O
for	O
them	O
in	O

The	O
natives	O
however	O
sold	O
what	O
they	O
afterwards	O
brought	O
down	O

to	O
their	O
satisfaction	O

without	O
paying	O
part	O

the	O
price	O

an	O

by	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
Saow	PNM

he	O

The	O

is	O
called	O
Seba	PNM

are	O
at	O
a	O

nothing	O
can	O
be	O

for	O

that	O

be	O
some	O

in	O
the	O

that	O

I	O
added	O

,	O
to	O
convince	O
him	O

my	O
sincere	O
desire	O
to	O
avoid	O
disputes	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
man	O
was	O
a	O
Dane	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
delivered	O
up	O
as	O
a	O
courtesy	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
demanded	O
as	O
a	O
right	O
;	O

that	O
if	O
I	O
found	O
he	O

would	O
keep	O
him	O

Mr.	O

having	O
learnt	O
from	O
the	O

hired	O
at	O
Batavia	PNM
,	O
that	O
the	O
Indians	O

this	O

a	O
town	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O

at	O

set	O
out	O

accompanied	O
by	O
the	O

as	O
he	O
had	O
some	O
reason	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
his	O
visit	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
agreeable	O
to	O
the	O
inhabitants	O

he	O
told	O
the	O
people	O
whom	O
he	O
met	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
advancing	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O

that	O
he	O
was	O
in	O
search	O
of	O
plants	O
,	O
which	O
indeed	O
was	O
also	O
true	O
.	O

In	O
about	O
two	O
hours	O
they	O
arrived	O
at	O
a	O
place	O
where	O
there	O
were	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
houses	O

and	O
meeting	O
with	O
an	O
old	O
man	O
,	O
they	O
ventured	O
to	O
make	O
some	O
enquiries	O
concerning	O
the	O
town	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
far	O
distant	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
discouraged	O

enterprise	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
,	O
seeing	O
them	O
proceed	O
in	O
their	O
journey	O
,	O
joined	O

went	O
on	O

attempted	O
several	O

to	O

out	O

without	O

at	O

they	O
came	O
within	O

of	O
the	O

The	O

man	O
then	O
entered	O
cordially	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
entered	O
the	O
old	O
town	O

they	O
met	O
several	O

whom	O
they	O
had	O
seen	O
at	O
the	O

one	O

Mr.	O
Banks	O
replied	O

that	O
he	O
supposed	O
it	O
was	O
because	O

found	O
a	O
