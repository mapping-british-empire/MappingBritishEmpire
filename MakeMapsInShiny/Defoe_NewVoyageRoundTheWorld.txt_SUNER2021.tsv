NEW	O
VOYAGE	O
ROUND	O
THE	O
WORLD	O
.	O

It	O
has	O
for	O
some	O
ages	O
been	O
thought	O
so	O
wonderful	O
a	O
thing	O
to	O
sail	O
the	O
tour	O
or	O
circle	O
of	O
the	O
globe	O
,	O
that	O
when	O
a	O
man	O
has	O
done	O
this	O
mighty	O
feat	O
,	O
he	O
presently	O
thinks	O
it	O
deserves	O
to	O
be	O
recorded	O
like	O
Sir	O
Francis	O
Drake	O
's	O
.	O

So	O
soon	O
as	O
men	O
have	O
acted	O
the	O
sailor	O
,	O
they	O
come	O
ashore	O
and	O
write	O
books	O
of	O
their	O
voyage	O
,	O
not	O
only	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
great	O
noise	O
of	O
what	O
they	O
have	O
done	O
themselves	O
,	O
but	O
pretending	O
to	O
show	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
others	O
to	O
come	O
after	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
set	O
up	O
for	O
teachers	O
and	O
chart	O
makers	O
to	O
posterity	O
.	O

Though	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
have	O
had	O
this	O
misfortune	O
,	O
that	O
whatever	O
success	O
they	O
have	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
voyage	O
,	O
they	O
have	O
had	O
very	O
little	O
in	O
the	O
relation	O
;	O
except	O
it	O
be	O
to	O
tell	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
a	O
seaman	O
when	O
he	O
comes	O
to	O
the	O
press	O
,	O
is	O
pretty	O
much	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
element	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
sailor	O
may	O
make	O
but	O
a	O
very	O
indifferent	O
author	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
not	O
in	O
this	O
,	O
lessen	O
the	O
merit	O
of	O
those	O
gentlemen	O
who	O
have	O
made	O
such	O
a	O
long	O
voyage	O
as	O
that	O
round	O
the	O
globe	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
must	O
be	O
allowed	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
way	O
is	O
now	O
a	O
common	O
road	O
,	O
the	O
reason	O
of	O
it	O
thoroughly	O
known	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
occasion	O
of	O
it	O
more	O
frequent	O
than	O
in	O
former	O
times	O
,	O
so	O
the	O
world	O
has	O
done	O
wondering	O
at	O
it	O
;	O
we	O
no	O
more	O
look	O
upon	O
it	O
as	O
a	O
mighty	O
thing	O
,	O
a	O
strange	O
and	O
never	O
heard	O
of	O
undertaking	O
;	O
this	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
now	O
expected	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
the	O
thing	O
is	O
made	O
familiar	O
,	O
every	O
ordinary	O
sailor	O
is	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
,	O
if	O
his	O
merchants	O
are	O
but	O
qualified	O
to	O
furnish	O
him	O
for	O
so	O
long	O
a	O
voyage	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
that	O
can	O
carry	O
a	O
ship	O
to	O
Lisbon	PNM
,	O
may	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
ease	O
carry	O
it	O
round	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

Some	O
tell	O
us	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
enough	O
to	O
wonder	O
at	O
a	O
thing	O
nine	O
days	O
,	O
one	O
would	O
reasonably	O
then	O
conclude	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
enough	O
that	O
sailing	O
round	O
the	O
world	O
has	O
been	O
wondered	O
at	O
above	O
a	O
hundred	O
years	O
.	O

I	O
shall	O
therefore	O
let	O
the	O
reader	O
know	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
rarity	O
of	O
going	O
round	O
the	O
world	O
that	O
has	O
occasioned	O
this	O
publication	O
,	O
but	O
if	O
some	O
incidents	O
have	O
happened	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
voyage	O
,	O
as	O
either	O
have	O
not	O
happened	O
to	O
others	O
,	O
or	O
as	O
no	O
other	O
people	O
,	O
though	O
performing	O
the	O
same	O
voyage	O
have	O
taken	O
notice	O
of	O
,	O
then	O
this	O
account	O
may	O
be	O
worth	O
publishing	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
thing	O
,	O
viz.	O
The	O
Voyage	O
round	O
the	O
World	O
,	O
be	O
in	O
itself	O
of	O

It	O
is	O
to	O

observed	O

of	O
the	O
several	O

us	O
with	O
that	O
variety	O
which	O
a	O
circle	O
of	O
that	O
length	O
must	O
needs	O
offer	O
.	O

We	O
have	O
a	O
very	O
little	O
account	O
of	O
their	O
landings	O

all	O
the	O

of	O

not	O
at	O

Another	O
sort	O
of	O
these	O
writers	O
have	O
just	O
given	O
us	O
their	O
long	O
journals	O
,	O
tedious	O
accounts	O
of	O
their	O
log-work	O
,	O
how	O
many	O
leagues	O
they	O
sailed	O
every	O
day	O
;	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
the	O
winds	O

when	O
it	O
blew	O
hard	O

;	O
what	O

and	O
what	O
variation	O
of	O

Such	O
is	O
the	O
account	O
of	O
Sir	O
John	O
Narborough	O
's	O
Voyage	O
to	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
,	O
adorned	O
with	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
how	O
many	O
charts	O
of	O
the	O
famous	O
Strait	PNM
of	PNM
Magellan	PNM
,	O
a	O
place	O
only	O
now	O
famous	O
for	O
showing	O
the	O
ignorance	O
of	O
Sir	O
John	O
Narborough	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
wise	O
gentlemen	O
before	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
being	O
a	O
passage	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
need	O
to	O
have	O
troubled	O
themselves	O
with	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
nobody	O
will	O
ever	O

Such	O
also	O
are	O
the	O
Voyages	O
of	O

at	O
the	O

in	O
Queen	O

time	O
;	O
all	O
which	O
,	O
are	O
indeed	O
full	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
journals	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
incidents	O
of	O
sailing	O
,	O
but	O
have	O
little	O
or	O
nothing	O
of	O
story	O
in	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
such	O
readers	O
who	O
never	O
intend	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
such	O
readers	O
may	O
desire	O
to	O
hear	O
how	O
it	O
has	O
fared	O
with	O
those	O
that	O
have	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
affairs	O
stand	O
in	O
those	O
remote	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

For	O
these	O
reasons	O
,	O
when	O
first	O
I	O
set	O
out	O
upon	O
a	O
cruising	O
and	O
trading	O
voyage	O
to	O
the	O
East	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
anywhere	O
,	O
and	O
everywhere	O
that	O
the	O
advantage	O
of	O
trade	O
or	O
the	O
hopes	O
of	O
purchase	O
should	O
guide	O
us	O
,	O
I	O
also	O
resolved	O
to	O
take	O
such	O
exact	O
notice	O
of	O
everything	O
that	O
past	O
within	O
my	O
reach	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
able	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
lived	O
to	O
come	O
home	O
,	O
to	O
give	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
my	O
voyage	O
,	O
differing	O
from	O
all	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
ever	O
seen	O
before	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
observations	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
relating	O
them	O
.	O

And	O
as	O
this	O
is	O
perfectly	O
new	O
in	O
its	O
form	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
doubt	O
but	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
agreeable	O
in	O
the	O
particulars	O
,	O
seeing	O
either	O
no	O
voyage	O
ever	O
made	O
before	O
,	O
had	O
such	O
variety	O
of	O
incidents	O
happening	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
so	O
useful	O
and	O
so	O
diverting	O
,	O
or	O
no	O
person	O
that	O
sailed	O
on	O
those	O
voyages	O
,	O
has	O
thought	O
fit	O
to	O
publish	O
them	O
after	O
this	O
manner	O

been	O
fitted	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
of	O
Thames	O
so	O
lately	O
as	O
the	O
year	O
1713	O
,	O
and	O
on	O
a	O
design	O
perhaps	O
not	O
very	O
consistent	O
with	O
the	O
measures	O
taking	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
for	O
the	O
putting	O
an	O
end	O
to	O
the	O
war	O
,	O
I	O
must	O
be	O
allowed	O
to	O
own	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
first	O
obliged	O
to	O
act	O
not	O
in	O
my	O
own	O
name	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
put	O
in	O
a	O
French	O
commander	O
into	O
the	O
ship	O

for	O
the	O
reasons	O
which	O
follow	O

and	O
which	O
those	O

who	O
understand	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O

upon	O
closing	O
the	O
late	O
war	O
,	O
I	O
mean	O
the	O
trade	O
with	O
Spain	O
,	O
will	O
easily	O
allow	O
to	O
be	O
just	O

During	O
the	O
late	O
war	O
between	O
Great	PNM
Britain	PNM
and	O
her	O
confederates	O
on	O
one	O
side	O

France	PNM
and	O

on	O
the	O

all	O

the	O
French	O
had	O
a	O
free	O

into	O
the	O
South	PNM

;	O
a	O
trade	O

on	O

on	O
in	O
the	O

for	O
many	O
ages	O
past	O
;	O
insomuch	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
return	O
of	O
silver	O
that	O
came	O
back	O
to	O
France	PNM
by	O
those	O
ships	O

was	O
not	O
only	O
the	O
enriching	O
of	O
the	O
merchants	O
of	O
St.	PNM
Malo	PNM
,	PNM
Rochelle	PNM
,	O
and	O
other	O
ports	O
in	O
France	PNM
,	O
some	O
of	O
whom	O
we	O
saw	O
get	O
immense	O
estates	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
years	O
,	O
even	O
to	O
a	O
million	O
sterling	O
a	O
man	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
evident	O
,	O
the	O
King	O
of	O
France	PNM
himself	O
was	O
enabled	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
circulation	O
of	O
so	O
much	O
bullion	O
through	O
his	O
mints	O
,	O
to	O
carry	O
on	O
that	O
war	O
with	O
very	O
great	O
advantage	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
just	O
at	O
the	O
close	O
of	O
this	O
war	O
,	O
when	O
some	O
merchants	O
of	O
London	PNM
,	O
looking	O
with	O
envy	O
on	O
the	O
success	O
of	O
that	O
trade	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
the	O
French	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
the	O
peace	O
,	O
would	O
apparently	O
carry	O
it	O
on	O
,	O
for	O
some	O
years	O
at	O
least	O
,	O
to	O
infinite	O
advantage	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
consider	O
whether	O
it	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
possible	O
to	O
come	O
in	O
for	O
a	O
portion	O
of	O
it	O
with	O
France	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
allied	O
to	O
Spain	PNM
,	O
and	O
yet	O
go	O
abroad	O
in	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
a	O
private	O
cruiser	O

To	O
bring	O
this	O
to	O
pass	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
thought	O
proper	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
,	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
share	O

a	O
new	O
design	O
of	O
an	O
East	O

trade	O
in	O

just	O
then	O
intended	O

some	O

by	O
the	O

at	O

under	O

with	O

We	O
had	O
also	O
a	O
third	O
design	O
in	O
our	O

,	O
though	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
esteemed	O
an	O
accident	O
to	O
the	O

,	O
we	O
were	O
resolved	O
to	O
make	O
some	O
attempts	O
for	O
new	O
discoveries	O
,	O
as	O
opportunity	O
offered	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
two	O
persons	O
on	O

who	O
were	O
exceeding	O
well	O
qualified	O
for	O
our	O
direction	O
in	O
this	O
part	O
,	O
all	O
which	O
was	O
derived	O
from	O
the	O
following	O
occasion	O
.	O

The	O
person	O
who	O
was	O
principally	O
concerned	O
in	O
the	O
adventure	O
was	O
a	O
man	O
not	O
only	O
of	O
great	O
wealth	O
,	O
but	O
of	O
great	O
importance	O
;	O
he	O
was	O
particularly	O
addicted	O
to	O
what	O
we	O
call	O
new	O
discoveries	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
indeed	O
upon	O
his	O
genius	O
to	O
such	O
things	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
first	O
thought	O
of	O
the	O
voyage	O
was	O
founded	O
.	O

This	O
gentleman	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
already	O
sent	O
one	O
ship	O
fully	O
equipped	O
and	O
furnished	O
for	O
a	O
new	O
attempt	O
upon	O
the	O
North-West	O
or	O
North-East	O
passages	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
often	O
in	O
vain	O
tried	O
by	O
former	O
navigators	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
question	O
the	O
success	O
,	O
because	O
he	O
had	O
directed	O
them	O
by	O
new	O
measures	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
steer	O
a	O
course	O
that	O
was	O
never	O
attempted	O
yet	O
;	O
and	O
his	O
design	O
in	O
our	O
voyage	O
was	O
to	O
make	O
like	O
discoveries	O
towards	O
the	O
South	O
pole	O
;	O
where	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
us	O
very	O
good	O
reasons	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
doubt	O
but	O
we	O
might	O
discover	O
,	O
even	O
to	O
the	O
pole	O
itself	O
,	O
and	O
find	O
out	O
new	O
worlds	O
and	O
new	O
seas	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
never	O
been	O
heard	O
of	O
before	O
.	O

With	O
these	O
designs	O
,	O
this	O
gentleman	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
other	O
part	O
of	O
our	O
project	O
,	O
and	O
contributed	O
the	O
more	O
largely	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
the	O
more	O
freedom	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
whole	O

upon	O
that	O
account	O
;	O
in	O
particular	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
needful	O
preparations	O
for	O
such	O
discoveries	O
were	O
made	O
wholly	O
at	O
his	O
expense	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
take	O
notice	O
of	O
here	O
,	O
as	O
being	O
most	O
proper	O
in	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
our	O
story	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
reader	O
may	O
the	O
less	O
wonder	O
at	O
the	O
particular	O
way	O
we	O
took	O
to	O
perform	O
a	O
voyage	O
which	O
might	O
with	O
much	O
more	O
ease	O
have	O
been	O
done	O
by	O
the	O
usual	O
and	O
ordinary	O
way	O

We	O
sailed	O
from	O
the	O

the	O
2nd	O
of	O
January	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
without	O
any	O

made	O
the	O

of	O

,	O
in	O
Ireland	O
,	O
the	O
10th	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
stayed	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
extraordinary	O
store	O
of	O
provisions	O
,	O
three	O
times	O
as	O

usual	O
,	O
the	O
beef	O
being	O
also	O
well	O
pickled	O

might	O

a	O

,	O
resolving	O
also	O
to	O
spare	O
it	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
possible	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
very	O

on	O

consisting	O

British	PNM

the	O

in	O

,	O
as	O
we	O

at	O
nothing	O
of	O

till	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O

coast	O

we	O

upon	O

as	O
was	O
at	O

We	O
made	O
the	O

the	O
11th	O
of	O
February	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
coming	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
there	O
to	O
take	O
in	O
some	O

water	O

we	O
put	O
out	O

with	O
a	O

all	O
French	O

to	O

what	O

some	O

having	O
filled	O

we	O
set	O

again	O
the	O
13th	O

In	O
this	O
time	O
we	O
called	O
a	O
council	O
among	O
ourselves	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
way	O
we	O
should	O
go	O

I	O

that	O

that	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
against	O
me	O

as	O
well	O
French	O
as	O
English	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
the	O
two	O
agents	O
for	O
discoveries	O
submitted	O
to	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
stand	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
Canaries	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O
o	O
Brazil	PNM

thence	O
upon	O
the	O
eastern	O

of	O
South	PNM

to	O

,	O
and	O
then	O
into	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
;	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
anything	O
that	O
was	O
Spanish	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
make	O
prize	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
in	O
a	O
time	O
of	O
war	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Brazil	PNM
in	O
twenty-six	O
days	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
Canary	PNM
Islands	PNM
,	O
and	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
at	O
Cape	PNM
St.	PNM
Augustine	PNM
,	O
for	O
fresh	O
water	O
;	O
afterwards	O
we	O
put	O
into	O
the	O
bay	PNM
of	PNM
All	PNM
Saints	PNM
,	O
got	O
some	O
fresh	O
provisions	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
an	O
hundred	O
very	O
good	O
hogs	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
killed	O
and	O
pickled	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
the	O
rest	O
on	O
board	O
alive	O
,	O
having	O
taken	O
on	O
board	O
a	O
great	O
quantity	O
of	O
roots	O
and	O
maize	O
,	O
or	O
Indian	O
corn	O
,	O
for	O
their	O
food	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
thrived	O
on	O
very	O
well	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
last	O
of	O
March	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
stayed	O
there	O
fourteen	O
days	O
,	O
to	O
furnish	O
ourselves	O
with	O
all	O
things	O
we	O
wanted	O
,	O
we	O
got	O
intelligence	O
there	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
three	O
ships	O
at	O
Buenos	PNM
Ayres	PNM
,	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
Rio	PNM
de	PNM
la	PNM
Plata	PNM
,	O
which	O
were	O
preparing	O
to	O
go	O
for	O
Europe	PNM
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
expected	O
two	O
Spanish	O
men	O
of	O
war	O
to	O
be	O
their	O
convoy	O
,	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
men	O
of	O
war	O
which	O
were	O
in	O
Brazil	PNM
,	O
to	O
convoy	O
the	O
Brazil	PNM
fleet	O
.	O

Their	O
having	O
two	O
Spanish	O
men	O
of	O
war	O
with	O
them	O
for	O
their	O
convoy	O
,	O
took	O
away	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
from	O
the	O
joy	O
we	O
had	O
entertained	O
at	O
the	O
news	O
of	O
their	O
being	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
think	O
we	O
should	O
make	O
little	O
or	O
nothing	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
utmost	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
particularly	O
,	O
if	O
our	O
double	O
appearance	O
would	O
not	O
now	O
stand	O
us	O
in	O
some	O
stead	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
away	O
for	O
the	O
river	PNM
of	PNM
Plata	PNM
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
usual	O
,	O
spreading	O
French	O
colours	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
boldly	O
up	O
to	O
Buenos	PNM
Ayres	PNM
,	O
and	O
sent	O
in	O
our	O
boat	O
,	O
manned	O
with	O
Frenchmen	O
,	O
pretending	O
to	O
be	O
homeward	O
bound	O
from	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
,	O
and	O
in	O
want	O
of	O
provisions	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
received	O
us	O
with	O
civility	O
,	O
and	O
granted	O
us	O
such	O
provisions	O
as	O
we	O
wanted	O
;	O
and	O
here	O
we	O
found	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
such	O
thing	O
as	O
any	O
Spanish	O
man	O
of	O
war	O
there	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
said	O
they	O
expected	O
one	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
governor	O
there	O
for	O
the	O
King	O
of	O
Spain	PNM
asked	O
our	O
French	O
officer	O
if	O
we	O
would	O
take	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
ships	O
under	O
our	O
convoy	O
?	O

Monsieur	O
Merlotte	O
answered	O
him	O
warily	O
,	O
that	O
his	O
ship	O
was	O
deep	O
loaden	O
,	O
and	O
foul	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
undertake	O
anything	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
keep	O
him	O
company	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
do	O
them	O
what	O
service	O
he	O
could	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
also	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
a	O
rich	O
ship	O
,	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
design	O
to	O
go	O
directly	O
to	O
France	PNM
,	O
but	O
to	O
Martinico	PNM
,	O
where	O
they	O
expected	O
to	O
meet	O
with	O
some	O
French	O
men	O
of	O
war	O
to	O
convoy	O
them	O
home	O
.	O

This	O
answer	O
was	O
so	O
well	O
managed	O
;	O
though	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
one	O
word	O
of	O
truth	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
ships	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
were	O
not	O
ready	O
,	O
resolved	O
to	O
come	O
away	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
an	O
evil	O
hour	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
did	O
so	O
.	O

To	O
be	O
brief	O
,	O
we	O
took	O
the	O
innocent	O
Spaniard	O
into	O
our	O
convoy	O
,	O
and	O
sailed	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
not	O
far	O
at	O
sea	O
before	O
we	O
let	O
them	O
know	O
what	O
circumstances	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
following	O
method	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
league	O
a	O
head	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
when	O
our	O
captain	O
bringing	O
to	O
,	O
and	O
hauling	O
up	O
our	O
courses	O
,	O
made	O
a	O
signal	O
to	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
for	O
the	O
captain	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
very	O
readily	O
did	O
;	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
our	O
captain	O
let	O
him	O
know	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
our	O
prisoner	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
his	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
manning	O
their	O
boat	O
with	O
thirty	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
we	O
sent	O
them	O
on	O
board	O
their	O
ship	O
,	O
to	O
take	O
possession	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
but	O
ordered	O
them	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
behave	O
civilly	O
to	O
the	O
men	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
plunder	O
nothing	O
.	O

For	O
we	O
made	O
a	O
promise	O
to	O
the	O
Spanish	O
captain	O
,	O
that	O
his	O
ship	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
plundered	O
,	O
upon	O
condition	O
he	O
would	O
give	O
us	O
a	O
just	O
account	O
of	O
his	O
loading	O
,	O
and	O
deliver	O
peaceably	O
to	O
us	O
what	O
riches	O
he	O
had	O
on	O
board	O
;	O
then	O
we	O
also	O
agreed	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
restore	O
him	O
his	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
was	O
chiefly	O
loaden	O
with	O
hides	O
,	O
things	O
of	O
no	O
value	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
also	O
was	O
an	O
old	O
vessel	O
,	O
strong	O
,	O
but	O
often	O
doubled	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
a	O
very	O
heavy	O
sailer	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
fit	O
for	O
our	O
purpose	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
greatly	O
wanted	O
a	O
ship	O
to	O
take	O
along	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
having	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
both	O
too	O
many	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
too	O
full	O
of	O
goods	O
.	O

The	O
Spanish	O
captain	O
,	O
though	O
surprised	O
with	O
the	O
stratagem	O
that	O
had	O
brought	O
him	O
thus	O
into	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
his	O
enemies	O
,	O
and	O
greatly	O
enraged	O
in	O
his	O
mind	O
at	O
being	O
circumvented	O
,	O
and	O
trepanned	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
ship	O
,	O
yet	O
showed	O
a	O
great	O
presence	O
of	O
mind	O
under	O
his	O
misfortune	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
verily	O
believe	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
fought	O
us	O
very	O
bravely	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
let	O
him	O
know	O
fairly	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
so	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
appear	O
dejected	O
at	O
his	O
disaster	O
,	O
but	O
capitulated	O
with	O
us	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
taken	O
sword	O
in	O
hand	O
.	O

And	O
one	O
time	O
,	O
when	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
and	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
agree	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Spanish	O
captain	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
threatened	O
,	O
he	O
grew	O
warm	O
;	O
told	O
the	O
captain	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
be	O
ill	O
used	O
,	O
being	O
in	O
his	O
hands	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
afraid	O
to	O
suffer	O
whatever	O
his	O
ill	O
fortune	O
had	O
prepared	O
for	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
,	O
for	O
fear	O
of	O
ill	O
usage	O
,	O
yield	O
to	O
base	O
conditions	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
honour	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
he	O
was	O
so	O
too	O
,	O
he	O
demanded	O
to	O
be	O
put	O
on	O
board	O
his	O
own	O
ship	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
should	O
see	O
he	O
knew	O
how	O
to	O
behave	O
himself	O
.	O

Captain	O
Merlotte	O
smiled	O
at	O
that	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
afraid	O
to	O
put	O
him	O
on	O
board	O
his	O
own	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
fight	O
for	O
her	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
so	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
sure	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
escape	O
him	O
;	O
the	O
Spanish	O
captain	O
smiled	O
too	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
he	O
should	O
see	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
knew	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
heaven	O
from	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
the	O
sea	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
any	O
other	O
road	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
men	O
of	O
courage	O
were	O
never	O
at	O
a	O
loss	O
to	O
conquer	O
their	O
enemy	O
one	O
way	O
or	O
other	O
;	O
intimating	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
sink	O
by	O
his	O
side	O
rather	O
than	O
be	O
taken	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
take	O
care	O
to	O
be	O
but	O
a	O
very	O
indifferent	O
prize	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
was	O
conquered	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
better	O
terms	O
with	O
him	O
afterwards	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
having	O
taken	O
on	O
board	O
all	O
the	O
silver	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
about	O
two	O
hundred	O
thousand	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
,	O
and	O
whatever	O
else	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
that	O
was	O
valuable	O
,	O
among	O
the	O
rest	O
his	O
ammunition	O
,	O
and	O
six	O
brass	O
guns	O
,	O
we	O
performed	O
conditions	O

and	O
sent	O
him	O
into	O
the	O
Rio	PNM

again	O
with	O
his	O
ship	O

to	O
let	O
the	O
other	O
Spanish	O
captains	O
know	O
what	O
scouring	O
they	O
had	O
escaped	O

Though	O
we	O
got	O
a	O
good	O
booty	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
disappointed	O
of	O
a	O
ship	O

however	O

we	O
were	O
not	O
so	O

that	O

now	O

as	O
we	O
were	O
afterwards	O
:	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
depended	O
upon	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
South	O
Seas	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
no	O
doubt	O
of	O
meeting	O
with	O

for	O

Of	O
what	O

the	O

We	O
had	O
done	O
our	O

had	O
neither	O

any	O

being	O
crowded	O
together	O
so	O
close	O
all	O
in	O
one	O

so	O
we	O
made	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
our	O
way	O
south	O

We	O
met	O
with	O
some	O
stormy	O
weather	O
in	O
these	O
seas	O

and	O
particularly	O
a	O
north-west	O

us	O
for	O
eleven	O

a	O
great	O

soon	O
came	O
into	O

again	O

so	O
that	O

about	O
the	O

I	O
see	O
no	O

many	O

which	O
would	O

I	O
say	O

as	O

this	O
would	O

no	O

to	O
return	O

keeping	O
an	O

of	O
six	O

but	O
a	O
strong	O

took	O
us	O
at	O

that	O

we	O
may	O

and	O
made	O
very	O
good	O
work	O

yet	O
we	O
went	O
away	O

of	O
all	O
we	O
could	O
do	O

and	O

We	O
held	O
it	O
out	O

however	O

the	O
weather	O
being	O
clear	O

but	O
excessive	O

,	O
till	O
we	O
found	O
ourselves	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
64	O

We	O
called	O
our	O
council	O
several	O
times	O
,	O
to	O
consider	O
what	O
we	O
should	O
do	O
,	O
for	O

the	O

,	O
to	O
our	O
apprehensions	O

it	O
was	O

in	O

We	O
tried	O

the	O

abating	O

to	O
beat	O
up	O
again	O
to	O
the	O

we	O
did	O
so	O

it	O
was	O

running	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
east	O

once	O

I	O

near	O
six	O

At	O

this	O

before	O

for	O

the	O
wind	O
setting	O
in	O
at	O
south-west	O

blew	O
a	O
storm	O

and	O
drove	O
us	O
with	O
such	O
force	O
away	O

that	O
we	O
were	O
never	O

were	O

with	O
a	O

storm	O
of	O
wind	O

from	O
the	O

Our	O
pilot	O
,	O
or	O
master	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
called	O
him	O
,	O
finding	O
himself	O
often	O
obliged	O
to	O
go	O
away	O
before	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
kept	O
us	O
out	O
long	O
at	O

and	O
drove	O
us	O
far	O
to	O
the	O
north-east	O

that	O
he	O
advised	O
us	O
to	O
stand	O
away	O
for	O
the	O
Cape	PNM

Good	PNM

;	O
and	O
accordingly	O
we	O
did	O
so	O
,	O
and	O
arrived	O
there	O
the	O
last	O
day	O
of	O
July	O

We	O
were	O
now	O
disheartened	O
indeed	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
revive	O
my	O
proposal	O
of	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
,	O
as	O
I	O
at	O
first	O
proposed	O
;	O
and	O
to	O
answer	O
the	O
objection	O
which	O
they	O
then	O
made	O
against	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
being	O
against	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
trade	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
nothing	O
on	O
board	O
but	O
European	O
goods	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
not	O
fitted	O
for	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
,	O
where	O
money	O
only	O
was	O
suitable	O
to	O
the	O
market	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
make	O
;	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
to	O
answer	O
this	O
objection	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
I	O
would	O
engage	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
sell	O
our	O
whole	O
cargo	O
at	O
the	O
Philippine	PNM
Islands	PNM
as	O
well	O
as	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
America	PNM
;	O
for	O
that	O
those	O
islands	O
being	O
Spanish	O
,	O
our	O
disguise	O
of	O
being	O
French	O
would	O
serve	O
us	O
as	O
well	O
at	O
the	O
Philippines	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
would	O
in	O
New	PNM
Spain	PNM
;	O
and	O
with	O
this	O
particular	O
advantage	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
sell	O
here	O
for	O
four	O
times	O
the	O
value	O
we	O
should	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Chili	PNM
,	O
or	O
Peru	PNM
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
load	O
our	O
ship	O
again	O
there	O
,	O
or	O
in	O
other	O
places	O
in	O
the	O
Indies	O
,	O
with	O
such	O
goods	O
as	O
would	O
come	O
to	O
a	O
good	O
market	O
again	O
in	O
New	PNM
Spain	PNM
.	O

This	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
was	O
indeed	O
what	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
practised	O
,	O
nor	O
at	O
any	O
other	O
time	O
would	O
it	O
be	O
practicable	O
:	O
for	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
usual	O
for	O
any	O
ships	O
to	O
go	O
from	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
to	O
the	O
Philippines	O
,	O
so	O
neither	O
was	O
it	O
usual	O
for	O
any	O
European	O
ships	O
to	O
trade	O
with	O
freedom	O
in	O
the	O
South	O
Seas	O
,	O
till	O
,	O
since	O
the	O
late	O
war	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
French	O
had	O
the	O
privilege	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
but	O
be	O
amazed	O
that	O
the	O
French	O
had	O
never	O
gone	O
this	O
way	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
made	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
voyages	O
in	O
one	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
much	O
less	O
hazard	O
of	O
meeting	O
with	O
the	O
English	O
or	O
Dutch	O
cruisers	O
;	O
and	O
have	O
made	O
twice	O
the	O
profits	O
which	O
they	O
made	O
the	O
other	O
way	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
frequently	O
out	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
years	O
upon	O
one	O
return	O
;	O
whereas	O
here	O
they	O
might	O
make	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
three	O
returns	O
,	O
or	O
perhaps	O
four	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
voyage	O
and	O
in	O
much	O
less	O
time	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
now	O
a	O
little	O
surprised	O
,	O
for	O
in	O
all	O
our	O
first	O
debates	O
we	O
had	O
nothing	O
of	O
this	O
matter	O
brought	O
in	O
question	O
;	O
only	O
they	O
entertained	O
a	O
notion	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
going	O
upon	O
strange	O
projects	O
to	O
make	O
discoveries	O
,	O
search	O
for	O
the	O
South	O
pole	O

and	O
I	O

not	O
how	O
many	O

were	O
neither	O
in	O

The	O
person	O

who	O
was	O
our	O

the	O

the	O

who	O
had	O
all	O
opposed	O
me	O
before	O
,	O
came	O
cheerfully	O
into	O
my	O
proposal	O
;	O
only	O
the	O
supercargo	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
sensible	O
of	O
the	O
advantages	O
of	O
the	O
voyage	O
I	O
had	O
proposed	O
,	O
than	O
he	O
was	O
before	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
equally	O
intrusted	O
with	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
government	O
of	O
the	O
trading	O
part	O
,	O
he	O
begged	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
take	O
it	O
ill	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
desired	O
I	O
would	O
let	O
him	O
farther	O
into	O
that	O
particular	O
,	O
and	O
explain	O
myself	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
I	O
thought	O
proper	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
so	O
just	O
a	O
request	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
easy	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
above	O
all	O

was	O
made	O
with	O
so	O
much	O
good	O
manners	O

that	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
otherwise	O
determined	O
,	O
the	O
courteous	O

good-humoured	O
way	O
with	O
which	O
he	O
required	O
it	O

me	O
to	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
,	O
however	O

I	O
was	O
very	O
ready	O
to	O

it	O

as	O
he	O
was	O
intrusted	O
with	O
the	O
cargo	O
jointly	O
with	O
me	O

and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
justice	O
to	O
the	O
owners	O

that	O
whom	O
they	O
thought	O
fit	O
to	O
trust	O
I	O
should	O
trust	O
also	O
;	O
upon	O
this	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
my	O
scheme	O

which	O
was	O
as	O

:	O
First	O
,	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
that	O

as	O
the	O

received	O
all	O

,	O
by	O
the	O

they	O
were	O

goods	O
in	O

in	O
all	O
which	O

had	O
their	O
several	O
commissions	O

other	O
profits	O
upon	O
the	O

;	O
besides	O
the	O

that	O

after	O

they	O
were	O
brought	O
by	O

from	O
Acapulco	PNM
to	O
the	O
Philippine	PNM
Islands	PNM
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
prodigious	O

and	O
were	O

sold	O
in	O
the	O
Philippine	O

at	O
three	O

That	O

in	O

all	O
this	O
,	O
our	O

being	O
well	O

a	O

cheaper	O
than	O

should	O

abundantly	O
more	O

,	O
though	O

had	O
been	O

a	O

there	O
.	O

That	O
there	O
were	O
but	O
two	O
objections	O
to	O
this	O
advantage	O
,	O
and	O
these	O
were	O
,	O
our	O
liberty	O
of	O

,	O
and	O
whether	O
the	O

would	O
consume	O
the	O
quantity	O
of	O
goods	O
we	O
had	O
;	O
and	O
to	O
this	O
I	O
had	O
much	O
to	O
answer	O
.	O

First	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
well	O
known	O
at	O
the	O
Philippine	O
Isles	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
kings	O
of	O
France	PNM
and	O
Spain	PNM
were	O
united	O
firmly	O
together	O
;	O
that	O
the	O
king	O
of	O
Spain	PNM
had	O
allowed	O
the	O
king	O
of	O
France	O
's	O
subjects	O
a	O
free	O
trade	O
in	O
his	O
American	O
dominions	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
denied	O
there	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
denied	O
by	O
the	O
governor	O
,	O
yet	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
room	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
a	O
trade	O
with	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
and	O
especially	O
with	O
the	O
Chinese	O
and	O
Japan	PNM
merchants	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
always	O
there	O
,	O
which	O
trade	O
the	O
governor	O
could	O
not	O
prevent	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
fear	O
a	O
market	O
for	O
all	O
our	O
cargo	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
much	O
greater	O
than	O
it	O
was	O
.	O

That	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
returns	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
advantage	O
either	O
way	O
:	O
for	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
sure	O
to	O
receive	O
a	O
great	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
price	O
of	O
our	O
goods	O
in	O
Chinese	O
or	O
Japan	PNM
gold	O
and	O
silver	O
,	O
or	O
in	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
;	O
or	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
thought	O
fit	O
to	O
trade	O
another	O
way	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
take	O
on	O
board	O
such	O
a	O
quantity	O
of	O
China	PNM
damasks	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
wrought	O

chintz	O
,	O
China	PNM

ware	O
;	O
all	O
which	O
,	O
would	O
be	O
immediately	O
sold	O
in	O
America	O
;	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
carry	O
a	O
cargo	O
of	O
these	O
goods	O
to	O
New	PNM
Spain	PNM
,	O
infinitely	O
to	O
our	O
advantage	O
,	O
being	O
the	O
same	O
cargo	O
which	O
the	O
four	O
great	O
Acapulco	O
ships	O
carry	O
back	O
with	O
them	O
every	O
year	O
:	O
That	O
when	O
we	O
had	O
gone	O
to	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
with	O
this	O
cargo	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
knew	O
we	O
should	O
make	O
a	O
good	O
market	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
but	O
to	O
come	O
back	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
thought	O
fit	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
again	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
might	O
load	O
for	O
England	PNM
or	O
Flanders	O
such	O
goods	O
as	O
we	O
thought	O
proper	O
;	O
or	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
fit	O
to	O
take	O
so	O
great	O
a	O
run	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
go	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
,	O
and	O
round	O
by	O
Cape	PNM
Horn	PNM
into	O
the	O
Atlantic	PNM
Ocean	PNM
,	O
and	O
perfect	O
those	O
discoveries	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
made	O
part	O
of	O
in	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
our	O
voyage	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
so	O
clear	O
a	O
scheme	O
of	O
trade	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
seemed	O
surprised	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
fully	O
satisfied	O
in	O
every	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
captain	O
then	O
objected	O
against	O
the	O
length	O
of	O
the	O
voyage	O
to	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
from	O
the	O
Philippines	O
,	O
and	O
raised	O
several	O
scruples	O
about	O
the	O
latitude	O
which	O
we	O
should	O
keep	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
voyage	O
;	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
able	O

by	O

I	O
perceived	O
clearly	O

that	O
they	O

treated	O
me	O

that	O
I	O

everything	O

I	O
may	O

a	O

The	O
ill	O

which	O

not	O
for	O
some	O

broke	O
out	O
upon	O
the	O

the	O

the	O

out	O

not	O
with	O
any	O

why	O
this	O

the	O

that	O
everybody	O
rejected	O
at	O
the	O

and	O
now	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
are	O
driven	O
hither	O
by	O
contrary	O
winds	O

those	O
winds	O
must	O
be	O
a	O

find	O
our	O

to	O
the	O

if	O

we	O

,	O
in	O

that	O

if	O
these	O

he	O
was	O

they	O

up	O

;	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
great	O
danger	O
of	O

that	O
we	O

He	O
told	O

the	O

and	O
how	O
the	O
whole	O
weight	O
of	O
their	O
resentment	O
seemed	O
to	O
tend	O
to	O
quarrelling	O
at	O
my	O
command	O
,	O
as	O
believing	O
that	O
this	O
project	O

the	O

was	O
wholly	O

he	O

if	O

they	O
might	O
enter	O
into	O
some	O
fatal	O
measures	O
about	O

to	O

as	O
it	O

some	O
of	O

and	O
the	O
second	O

in	O

I	O
was	O
far	O
from	O
being	O
insensible	O
of	O
the	O
danger	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
of	O
the	O
danger	O
the	O
whole	O
voyage	O
,	O
ship	O
and	O
all	O
,	O
was	O
in	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
made	O
no	O
question	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
their	O
brutish	O
rage	O
led	O
them	O
to	O
one	O
villanous	O
action	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
soon	O
go	O
on	O
to	O
another	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
devil	O
would	O
take	O
hold	O
of	O
that	O
handle	O
to	O
represent	O
the	O
danger	O
of	O
their	O
being	O
punished	O
for	O
it	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
home	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
,	O
as	O
has	O
been	O
often	O
the	O
case	O
,	O
prompt	O
them	O
to	O
mutiny	O
against	O
all	O
command	O
,	O
and	O
run	O
away	O
with	O
the	O
ship	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
presence	O
of	O
mind	O
enough	O
to	O
enter	O
into	O
prompt	O
measures	O
for	O
our	O
general	O
safety	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
prevent	O
the	O
worse	O
,	O
in	O
case	O
of	O
any	O
attempt	O
upon	O
me	O
.	O

First	O
,	O
I	O
represented	O
the	O
case	O
to	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
gentlemen	O
and	O
asked	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
stand	O
by	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
resolutions	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
taken	O
for	O
the	O
voyage	O
;	O
then	O
I	O
called	O
into	O
our	O
assistance	O
the	O
chief	O
mate	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
a	O
kinsman	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
owners	O
,	O
a	O
bold	O
resolute	O
gentleman	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
purser	O
,	O
who	O
we	O
knew	O
was	O
faithful	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
as	O
also	O
the	O
surgeon	O
and	O
the	O
carpenter	O
.	O

I	O
engaged	O
them	O
all	O
to	O
give	O
me	O
first	O
their	O
opinions	O
whether	O
they	O
were	O
convinced	O
of	O
the	O
reasonableness	O
of	O
my	O
scheme	O
for	O
the	O
voyage	O
I	O
had	O
proposed	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
judge	O
for	O
themselves	O
,	O
laid	O
it	O
all	O
before	O
them	O
again	O
,	O
arguing	O
every	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
so	O
clearly	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
convinced	O
entirely	O
of	O
its	O
being	O
the	O
most	O
rational	O
prospect	O
of	O
the	O
voyage	O
for	O
us	O
,	O
of	O
any	O
we	O
could	O
go	O
about	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
recommended	O
it	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
expostulate	O
with	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
in	O
temper	O
,	O
and	O
keep	O
them	O
to	O
their	O
duty	O
;	O
but	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
to	O
stand	O
all	O
ready	O
,	O
and	O
upon	O
a	O
signal	O
which	O
I	O
gave	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
come	O
all	O
to	O
the	O
steerage	O
,	O
and	O
defend	O
the	O
great	O
cabin	O
door	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
other	O
hands	O
,	O
whom	O
they	O
could	O
be	O
sure	O
of	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
watchful	O
over	O
the	O
motions	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
what	O
they	O
drove	O
at	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
I	O
fortified	O
myself	O
with	O
the	O
French	O
captain	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
supercargo	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
captain	O
;	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
French	O
captain	O
's	O
men	O
were	O
true	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
true	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
to	O
a	O
man	O
.	O

We	O
then	O
brought	O
a	O
sufficient	O
store	O
of	O
ammunition	O
and	O
small	O
arms	O
into	O
the	O
great	O
cabin	O
,	O
and	O
secured	O
the	O
steerage	O
,	O
as	O
also	O
the	O
roundhouse	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
possibly	O
be	O
surprised	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
nothing	O
done	O
that	O
night	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
I	O
was	O
informed	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
gunner	O
and	O
second	O
mate	O
were	O
in	O
a	O
close	O
cabal	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
midshipmen	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
sworn	O
to	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
not	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
go	O
the	O
voyage	O
as	O
was	O
proposed	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
might	O
have	O
ended	O
in	O
their	O
running	O
away	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
should	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
sorry	O
for	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
their	O
oath	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
should	O
not	O
go	O
the	O
voyage	O
;	O
by	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
presently	O
to	O
understand	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
some	O
measures	O
to	O
take	O
to	O
prevent	O
my	O
design	O
of	O
the	O
voyage	O
to	O
the	O
Philippines	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
this	O
was	O
to	O
run	O
away	O
with	O
the	O
ship	O
to	O
Madagascar	PNM
,	O
which	O
was	O
not	O
far	O
off	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
this	O
apparent	O
encouragement	O
,	O
that	O
as	O
the	O
contrivance	O
was	O
yet	O
but	O
two	O
days	O
'	O
old	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
but	O
two	O
days	O
since	O
they	O
had	O
any	O
notice	O
of	O
our	O
intentions	O
to	O
go	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
some	O
days	O
caballing	O
and	O
forming	O
an	O
interest	O
among	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
up	O
a	O
party	O
strong	O
enough	O
to	O
make	O
any	O
attempt	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
trusty	O
set	O
of	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
would	O
be	O
as	O
diligent	O
the	O
other	O
way	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
contriving	O
every	O
method	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
men	O
over	O
to	O
their	O
opinion	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
at	O
least	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
some	O
time	O
before	O
they	O
could	O
make	O
their	O
party	O
up	O
.	O

The	O
affair	O
was	O
rightly	O
conjectured	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
three	O
men	O
who	O
had	O
made	O
themselves	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
the	O
mutineers	O
,	O
went	O
on	O
apace	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
men	O
increased	O
too	O
,	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
could	O
be	O
desired	O
for	O
the	O
time	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
Friday	O
after	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
about	O
five	O
days	O
from	O
the	O
first	O
discovery	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
midshipmen	O
came	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
to	O
speak	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
begged	O
it	O
might	O
not	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
be	O
known	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
with	O
me	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
if	O
he	O
desired	O
to	O
be	O
alone	O
;	O
he	O
said	O
no	O
,	O
I	O
might	O
appoint	O
whom	O
I	O
thought	O
convenient	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
trust	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
to	O
say	O
was	O
of	O
the	O
last	O
importance	O
to	O
all	O
our	O
lives	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
therefore	O
,	O
he	O
hoped	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
very	O
sure	O
of	O
those	O
in	O
whom	O
I	O
confided	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
name	O
the	O
chief	O
mate	O
,	O
the	O
French	O
captain	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
supercargo	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
,	O
I	O
bade	O
him	O
not	O
be	O
too	O
much	O
surprised	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
already	O
some	O
warning	O
of	O
the	O
scheme	O
which	O
I	O
believed	O
he	O
had	O
to	O
tell	O
me	O
of	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
preparing	O
all	O
things	O
to	O
disappoint	O
it	O
:	O
that	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
not	O
value	O
his	O
fidelity	O
the	O
less	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
speak	O
freely	O
his	O
mind	O
before	O
those	O
men	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
in	O
the	O
secret	O
already	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
might	O
be	O
sure	O
both	O
of	O
protection	O
and	O
reward	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
I	O
bade	O
him	O
go	O
out	O
upon	O
the	O
quarter-deck	O
,	O
and	O
walk	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
chief	O
mate	O
went	O
off	O
into	O
the	O
roundhouse	O
,	O
he	O
should	O
go	O
down	O
between	O
decks	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
was	O
going	O
into	O
his	O
cabin	O
to	O
sleep	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
heard	O
the	O
chief	O
mate	O
call	O
the	O
cabin	O
boy	O
,	O
a	O
black	O
of	O
mine	O
,	O
whose	O
name	O
was	O
Spartivento	O
,	O
he	O
should	O
take	O
that	O
for	O
a	O
signal	O
that	O
the	O
steerage	O
was	O
clear	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
might	O
come	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
should	O
be	O
let	O
into	O
the	O
great	O
cabin	O
;	O
all	O
which	O
was	O
so	O
managed	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
so	O
short	O
a	O
time	O

that	O
he	O
was	O
with	O
us	O
in	O
the	O

in	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
after	O
the	O
first	O
conference	O

and	O
none	O
of	O
the	O

perceived	O
it	O

Here	O
he	O
let	O
me	O
into	O
the	O
whole	O
secret	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
wicked	O
scheme	O
it	O
was	O
;	O
viz.	O

that	O

about	O
six-and-thirty	O
of	O

in	O
the	O

to	O
confine	O

either	O

so	O
carry	O
the	O

away	O
to	O
the	O
South	PNM

and	O
then	O
to	O
do	O
as	O
they	O

that	O
is	O
to	O

in	O

conclude	O
upon	O

I	O
had	O
all	O
that	O
day	O
-LRB-	O
Monday	O
-RRB-	O
to	O
order	O
my	O
preparations	O
,	O
and	O
upon	O
this	O
plain	O
intelligence	O
,	O
I	O
determined	O
to	O
lose	O
no	O
time	O

nor	O
was	O
it	O
long	O
before	O
I	O
resolved	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
their	O
design	O
was	O
desperate	O

so	O
I	O
had	O
nothing	O

desperate	O
remedies	O
to	O
provide	O

Having	O
therefore	O
settled	O
my	O
measures	O

I	O
called	O
for	O
the	O

bade	O
him	O

the	O
pinnace	O

for	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
to	O
go	O
on	O

I	O
appointed	O

the	O

the	O

the	O
French	O

There	O
were	O
no	O

there	O
were	O

the	O

as	O
we	O

that	O
the	O

asked	O

told	O

make	O
us	O
all	O

I	O
seemed	O
unwilling	O
at	O
first	O

telling	O
him	O
I	O
intended	O
to	O
go	O
on	O

and	O
pay	O
my	O

to	O
the	O

as	O
was	O
usual	O

to	O
ask	O
him	O
leave	O
to	O

some	O

and	O
that	O
the	O

would	O
take	O
it	O
very	O
ill	O
if	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
go	O

However	O
,	O
upon	O
his	O
alleging	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
not	O
stay	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
Dutch	O
captain	O
,	O
upon	O
his	O
going	O
on	O

would	O

he	O

give	O
us	O
a	O

the	O

by	O
which	O
we	O
should	O

I	O
consented	O

his	O

we	O
went	O
on	O

Captain	O
Merlotte	O
,	O
who	O
spoke	O
Dutch	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
hailed	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
asked	O
the	O
captain	O
's	O
name	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
asked	O
if	O
he	O
was	O
on	O
board	O
;	O
they	O
answered	O
,	O
Yes	O
;	O
then	O
he	O
bade	O
them	O
tell	O
him	O
the	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
English	O
ship	O
was	O
come	O
to	O
visit	O
him	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
,	O
immediately	O
their	O
chief	O
mate	O
bade	O
them	O
man	O
the	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
at	O
the	O
side	O
to	O
receive	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
before	O
we	O
could	O
get	O
up	O
,	O
the	O
Dutch	O
captain	O
came	O
upon	O
the	O
quarter-deck	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
great	O
civility	O
invited	O
us	O
into	O
his	O
cabin	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
there	O
,	O
the	O
chief	O

by	O
the	O

entertained	O
the	O

When	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
cabin	O
,	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
told	O
the	O
Dutch	O
captain	O
that	O
we	O
came	O
indeed	O
to	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
a	O
visit	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
our	O
business	O
was	O
of	O
the	O
greatest	O
importance	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
we	O
might	O
speak	O
to	O
him	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
hearing	O
of	O
none	O
but	O
such	O
as	O
he	O
could	O
trust	O
.	O

The	O
captain	O
told	O
us	O
with	O
the	O
greatest	O
open-heartedness	O
imaginable	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
we	O
were	O
strangers	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
looked	O
like	O
honest	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
would	O
grant	O
our	O
request	O
;	O
we	O
should	O
speak	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
hearing	O
of	O
none	O
but	O
those	O
we	O
could	O
trust	O
,	O
for	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
nobody	O
by	O
but	O
ourselves	O
.	O

We	O
made	O
him	O
fully	O
sensible	O
that	O
we	O
knew	O
how	O
obliging	O
that	O
compliment	O
was	O
,	O
but	O
begged	O
he	O
would	O
admit	O
any	O
whom	O
he	O
thought	O
worthy	O
to	O
be	O
trusted	O
with	O
a	O
secret	O
of	O
the	O
last	O
importance	O
.	O

He	O
then	O
carried	O
it	O
as	O
far	O
the	O
other	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
then	O
he	O
must	O
call	O
in	O
the	O
whole	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
man	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
but	O
he	O
could	O
trust	O
his	O
life	O
in	O
his	O
hands	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
upon	O
the	O
whole	O
,	O
he	O
sent	O
everybody	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
cabin	O
but	O
us	O
three	O
and	O
himself	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
desired	O
we	O
would	O
speak	O
our	O
minds	O
freely	O
.	O

Captain	O
Merlotte	O
,	O
who	O
spoke	O
Dutch	O
,	O
began	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
Dutch	O
captain	O
interrupted	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
asked	O
if	O
the	O
English	O
captain	O
,	O
meaning	O
me	O
,	O
spoke	O
Dutch	O
;	O
he	O
said	O
no	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
he	O
asked	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
if	O
he	O
spoke	O
English	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
said	O
yes	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
he	O
let	O
me	O
know	O
that	O
he	O
understood	O
English	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
I	O
would	O
speak	O
to	O
him	O
in	O
English	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
heartily	O
glad	O
of	O
this	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
immediately	O
with	O
the	O
story	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
time	O
little	O
enough	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
particularly	O
happy	O
in	O
having	O
it	O
in	O
his	O
power	O
to	O
say	O
he	O
could	O
put	O
his	O
life	O
in	O
the	O
hand	O
of	O
any	O
man	O
,	O
the	O
meanest	O
in	O
his	O
ship	O
;	O
that	O
my	O
men	O
were	O
unhappily	O
the	O
reverse	O
of	O
his	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
then	O
beginning	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
of	O
the	O
story	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
full	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
,	O
as	O
related	O
above	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
extremely	O
affected	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
asked	O
me	O
what	O
he	O
could	O
do	O
to	O
serve	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
assured	O
me	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
only	O
do	O
what	O
in	O
him	O
lay	O
,	O
but	O
would	O
engage	O
all	O
the	O
ships	O
in	O
the	O
road	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
like	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
governor	O
also	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

I	O
thanked	O
him	O
very	O
sincerely	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
what	O
at	O
present	O
was	O
the	O
circumstance	O
I	O
thought	O
lay	O
before	O
me	O
,	O
was	O
this	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
chief	O
conspirators	O
would	O
be	O
on	O
shore	O
on	O
the	O
morrow	O
,	O
with	O
one	O
,	O
or	O
perhaps	O
two	O
,	O
of	O
our	O
boats	O
,	O
to	O
fetch	O
water	O
and	O
get	O
some	O
fresh	O
provisions	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
very	O
glad	O
to	O
have	O
them	O
seized	O
upon	O
by	O
surprise	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
then	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O
could	O
master	O
the	O
rest	O
on	O
board	O
well	O
enough	O
.	O

Leave	O
that	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
says	O
he	O
,	O
I	O
will	O
give	O
the	O
governor	O
notice	O
this	O
evening	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
come	O
on	O
shore	O
they	O
shall	O
be	O
all	O
seized	O
;	O
But	O
,	O
says	O
he	O
,	O
if	O
you	O
think	O
they	O
may	O
incline	O
to	O
make	O
any	O
resistance	O
,	O
I	O
will	O
write	O
a	O
line	O
to	O
the	O
governor	O
,	O
and	O
give	O
it	O
you	O
now	O
;	O
then	O
,	O
when	O
your	O
men	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
order	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
principal	O
rogues	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
wait	O
on	O
the	O
governor	O
with	O
the	O
letter	O
from	O
you	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
he	O
receives	O
it	O
,	O
he	O
shall	O
secure	O
them	O
there	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
will	O
be	O
divided	O
,	O
and	O
taken	O
with	O
the	O
more	O
ease	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
,	O
added	O
he	O
,	O
while	O
this	O
is	O
doing	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
I	O
will	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
your	O
ship	O
,	O
with	O
my	O
long	O
boat	O
and	O
pinnace	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
many	O
men	O
as	O
you	O
please	O
,	O
to	O
repay	O
you	O
the	O
compliment	O
of	O
this	O
visit	O
,	O
and	O
assist	O
you	O
in	O
reducing	O
the	O
rest	O

This	O
was	O
so	O
kind	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
completely	O
what	O
I	O
desired	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
asked	O
nothing	O
more	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
accepted	O
his	O
visit	O
in	O
his	O
barge	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
thought	O
would	O
be	O
enough	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
afraid	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
more	O
came	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
might	O
be	O
alarmed	O
,	O
and	O
take	O
arms	O
before	O
I	O
was	O
ready	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
agreed	O
upon	O
that	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
desired	O
more	O
help	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
hang	O
out	O
a	O
signal	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
a	O
red	O
ancient	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
mizen	O
top	O
.	O

All	O
things	O
being	O
thus	O
consulted	O
,	O
I	O
returned	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
pretending	O
to	O
our	O
men	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
spent	O
so	O
much	O
time	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
Dutch	O
ship	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
;	O
and	O
indeed	O
some	O
of	O
my	O
men	O
were	O
so	O
drunk	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
scarce	O
sit	O
to	O
their	O
oars	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
coxswain	O
was	O
so	O
very	O
far	O
gone	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
took	O
occasion	O
to	O
ask	O
publicly	O
,	O
to	O
leave	O
him	O
on	O
board	O
till	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
giving	O
the	O
Dutch	O
captain	O
also	O
a	O
hint	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
conspiracy	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
glad	O
to	O
leave	O
him	O
on	O
that	O
account	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
about	O
nine	O
o'clock	O
,	O
the	O
second	O
mate	O
came	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
they	O
wanted	O
more	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
pleased	O
to	O
order	O
the	O
boat	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
go	O
if	O
I	O
thought	O
fit	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
if	O
he	O
could	O
get	O
any	O
fresh	O
provisions	O
,	O
the	O
purser	O
being	O
indisposed	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
yes	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
my	O
heart	O
;	O
that	O
the	O
Dutch	O
captain	O
last	O
night	O
had	O
given	O
me	O
a	O
letter	O
to	O
the	O
governor	O
,	O
to	O
desire	O
we	O
might	O
be	O
furnished	O
with	O
whatever	O
we	O
had	O
occasion	O
for	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
thoughts	O
of	O
calling	O
for	O
him	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
and	O
deliver	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
the	O
governor	O
might	O
make	O
him	O
some	O
present	O
in	O
compliment	O
to	O
the	O
English	O
nation	O

He	O
seemed	O
extremely	O

at	O
this	O

even	O

going	O
out	O

was	O
so	O

that	O
we	O
were	O

him	O
behind	O

This	O
was	O
just	O
what	O
he	O
wanted	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
he	O
chose	O
all	O
the	O
chief	O

such	O

he	O

secured	O
in	O

and	O
of	O
the	O

we	O
judged	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
plot	O

because	O
he	O
took	O
them	O
with	O
him	O
;	O

with	O

six-and-thirty	O

When	O

what	O
they	O

at	O
the	O

found	O
three	O
boats	O
of	O
Dutchmen	O
at	O
the	O
watering-place	O
,	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
the	O

procured	O
two	O

they	O
went	O
all	O

there	O
they	O
were	O
mighty	O

The	O
Dutch	O

a	O

his	O

so	O

that	O
nothing	O

finding	O
the	O

thus	O
in	O
a	O

he	O
takes	O
four	O
of	O

with	O

on	O

like	O
the	O

the	O

what	O
their	O

the	O

they	O
came	O
from	O
on	O

the	O

that	O
they	O
were	O

He	O

them	O

would	O
not	O
refuse	O
them	O
when	O
he	O
knew	O
who	O
they	O
were	O

but	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
but	O
good	O
manners	O
to	O
ask	O
leave	O
:	O
the	O
Englishman	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
yet	O
filled	O
any	O
water	O
or	O
bought	O
any	O
provisions	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
letter	O
to	O
the	O
governor	O
from	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
supposed	O

the	O

The	O
Dutchman	O
answered	O

that	O
was	O
hael	O

;	O
that	O
he	O
might	O

if	O
the	O

all	O
was	O

as	O
it	O

that	O

and	O
he	O

the	O

When	O

the	O

the	O

Upon	O
which	O

two	O

came	O
up	O
to	O
him	O

and	O
bid	O
him	O
deliver	O
his	O

which	O
he	O

with	O
some	O

;	O
for	O

At	O

When	O

When	O
I	O

I	O
moved	O

beckoning	O
to	O
the	O
mate	O
to	O

I	O
told	O
the	O

that	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
disposed	O
to	O

any	O
man	O
,	O
nor	O
had	O
I	O
done	O
what	O
I	O
now	O
did	O

by	O

that	O
I	O
expected	O

should	O

that	O

if	O
any	O

he	O
was	O

that	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
easy	O

I	O
should	O
give	O

which	O
had	O

Then	O
I	O
caused	O
my	O

to	O
be	O
read	O
to	O
them	O
all	O

by	O
which	O
it	O
appeared	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
really	O
chief	O

of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
right	O

as	O
I	O
thought	O

with	O

When	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
them	O
a	O
long	O

full	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
reasons	O
why	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O

not	O
to	O

to	O

away	O

what	O

there	O
was	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
men	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
wondered	O
much	O
that	O
such	O
measures	O
were	O
taken	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
as	O
I	O
heard	O
there	O
were	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
,	O
they	O
might	O
see	O

unprovided	O
of	O

to	O
reduce	O
every	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
to	O
their	O
duty	O
by	O
force	O

and	O
to	O
punish	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
guilty	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
deserved	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
I	O
rather	O
desired	O
to	O
win	O
them	O
with	O
kindness	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
resolved	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
any	O
reason	O
to	O
dislike	O
the	O
voyage	O
,	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
safely	O
set	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
suffered	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
second	O
mate	O
and	O
his	O
comrades	O
:	O
and	O
farther	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
what	O
circumstances	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
and	O
how	O
effectually	O
they	O
were	O
secured	O
.	O

This	O
astonished	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
surprised	O
them	O
exceedingly	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
inquired	O
more	O

into	O
the	O
circumstances	O
of	O
the	O
said	O
second	O
mate	O
and	O
his	O
fellows	O
:	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
they	O
were	O
safe	O
enough	O
,	O
and	O
should	O
remain	O
so	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
prove	O
they	O
had	O
all	O
a	O
villanous	O
design	O
to	O
run	O
away	O
with	O
the	O
ship	O

and	O
set	O
me	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
either	O
here	O
,	O
or	O
in	O
a	O
worse	O
place	O

I	O
thought	O
that	O
only	O
upon	O
account	O
of	O
my	O
own	O
safety	O
,	O
such	O
men	O
were	O
not	O

to	O
go	O
in	O

being	O
once	O
capable	O
to	O
entertain	O
such	O
horrid	O

or	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
guilty	O
of	O
such	O
a	O

that	O
,	O
if	O
any	O

At	O
this	O

some	O

upon	O

Upon	O

As	O
they	O
came	O
nearer	O
and	O
nearer	O
to	O
where	O
I	O

I	O
had	O
an	O

which	O
I	O
did	O
calmly	O

Why	O

Tom	O

I	O

what	O

Lord	O

Upon	O

What	O

one	O

What	O

What	O

us	O

He	O

we	O
are	O

He	O
immediately	O

I	O
was	O
glad	O

you	O
may	O

If	O

would	O
not	O
appear	O
in	O
this	O

down	O

that	O

away	O
they	O
dropt	O

at	O
the	O

down	O

By	O
this	O

our	O
two	O

the	O

I	O

then	O
turning	O
to	O
the	O
men	O
on	O
the	O
forecastle	O

I	O
told	O
them	O
they	O
should	O
go	O

the	O
boats	O
immediately	O

as	O

they	O

No	O

no	O

says	O
I	O

not	O
a	O

As	O

with	O
a	O

of	O

Jack	O
replies	O

he	O
had	O
no	O

the	O

he	O
did	O
not	O

Do	O

the	O

leave	O

he	O

him	O
down	O

out	O

there	O
was	O
not	O

seventeen	O

I	O

at	O

one	O
of	O

with	O

the	O

of	O
the	O
forecastle	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
next	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
said	O

in	O
a	O
very	O

manner	O

that	O
I	O
saw	O
how	O
many	O
had	O
slunk	O
away	O
and	O
made	O
their	O
peace	O
,	O
or	O
at	O

obtained	O
pardon	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
know	O
that	O
they	O
who	O
were	O
left	O
were	O
only	O
such	O
as	O
had	O
their	O
duty	O
there	O
,	O
being	O
placed	O
there	O
of	O
course	O
before	O
the	O
mutiny	O
began	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
hand	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
abhorred	O
it	O
with	O
all	O
their	O
hearts	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
hoped	O
I	O
would	O
consider	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
join	O
them	O
with	O
those	O
that	O
had	O
offended	O
,	O
merely	O
because	O
they	O
came	O
upon	O
the	O

and	O
mixed	O
there	O
with	O
the	O
men	O
who	O
had	O
the	O
watch	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
if	O
that	O
was	O
true	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
in	O
their	O
favour	O

but	O
I	O
expected	O
he	O
would	O
prove	O
it	O
to	O
my	O
satisfaction	O
before	O
I	O
accepted	O
that	O
for	O
an	O
excuse	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
it	O
might	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
be	O
hard	O
to	O
prove	O
it	O
,	O
seeing	O
the	O
boatswain	O
and	O
his	O
mate	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
second	O

,	O
were	O
gone	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O

crew	O
could	O
all	O
testify	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
whose	O
watch	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
upon	O
the	O
forecastle	O
by	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
their	O
duty	O
,	O
and	O
no	O

and	O
called	O
several	O

were	O
upon	O

with	O
them	O
to	O
witness	O
it	O
,	O
who	O

Upon	O
this	O

I	O
found	O
myself	O
under	O
a	O
necessity	O

in	O
justice	O
to	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
to	O
approve	O
it	O

but	O
my	O
own	O
management	O
was	O
a	O
bite	O
upon	O
myself	O
in	O
it	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
did	O
allow	O
the	O
midshipman	O
to	O
wink	O
at	O
their	O
slipping	O
away	O
,	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
made	O
no	O
question	O
but	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
some	O
left	O
to	O
make	O
examples	O
of	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
go	O
back	O
from	O
the	O
promise	O
of	O
mercy	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
allowed	O
the	O
midshipman	O
to	O
offer	O
in	O
my	O
name	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
tricked	O
myself	O
by	O
their	O
mistake	O
into	O
a	O
necessity	O
of	O
pardoning	O
them	O
all	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
very	O
far	O
from	O
my	O
design	O
;	O
but	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
remedy	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
happily	O
escaped	O
,	O
desired	O
the	O
midshipman	O

who	O
had	O
been	O
instrumental	O
to	O
their	O
deliverance	O
,	O
to	O
assure	O
me	O

that	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
sensible	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
deserved	O
very	O
ill	O
at	O
my	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
yet	O
I	O
had	O
treated	O
them	O
thus	O
kindly	O

they	O
would	O
not	O
only	O
reveal	O
to	O
me	O
all	O
the	O
particulars	O
of	O
the	O
conspiracy	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
names	O
of	O
those	O
principally	O
concerned	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
assure	O
me	O
they	O
would	O
never	O
more	O
dispute	O
any	O
of	O
my	O
measures	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
very	O
ready	O
to	O
do	O
their	O
duty	O
as	O
seamen	O
,	O
to	O
what	O
part	O
of	O
the	O

I	O
might	O

I	O
thought	O
fit	O
to	O
carry	O
them	O

whether	O
outward	O

homeward	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
gave	O
me	O
the	O
tender	O
of	O
their	O
duty	O
in	O
this	O
manner	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
sincerity	O
and	O
with	O
thankfulness	O
,	O
for	O
my	O
having	O
forgiven	O
them	O
that	O
conduct	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
worst	O
that	O
a	O
seamen	O
could	O
be	O
guilty	O
of	O
.	O

I	O
took	O
this	O
very	O
kindly	O

and	O
sent	O
them	O
word	O
I	O
did	O
so	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
see	O
they	O
had	O
taken	O
the	O
wiser	O
course	O
;	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
an	O
entire	O
confidence	O
in	O
their	O
fidelity	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
never	O
find	O
I	O
would	O
reproach	O
them	O
with	O
,	O
or	O
use	O
them	O
the	O
worse	O
for	O
,	O
what	O
had	O
past	O

I	O
must	O
confess	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
glad	O
of	O
this	O
submission	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
measures	O
I	O
had	O
taken	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
satisfied	O
I	O
should	O
conquer	O
them	O

and	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
safe	O
from	O
their	O
attempts	O
;	O
yet	O
,	O
carrying	O
it	O
on	O
by	O
resentment	O
,	O
and	O
doing	O
justice	O
upon	O
the	O
offenders	O
,	O
whatever	O
advantage	O
it	O
had	O
one	O
way	O
,	O
had	O
this	O
disadvantage	O
in	O
the	O
consequence	O
;	O
viz.	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
ruin	O
the	O
voyage	O
,	O
for	O
at	O

half	O
the	O

in	O
the	O
plot	O

Having	O
thus	O
conquered	O
them	O
by	O
good	O
usage	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
my	O
next	O
work	O
was	O
to	O
inquire	O
into	O
the	O
mistakes	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
the	O
foundation	O
of	O
all	O
this	O
:	O
so	O
,	O
before	O
I	O
parted	O
with	O
the	O
men	O
who	O
had	O
returned	O
to	O
their	O
duty	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
freely	O
forgiven	O
what	O
was	O
past	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
would	O
keep	O
my	O
word	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
never	O
reproach	O
them	O
with	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
necessary	O
their	O
judgments	O
should	O
be	O
convinced	O
how	O
much	O
they	O
were	O
imposed	O
upon	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
their	O
tempers	O
be	O
reduced	O
by	O
my	O
kindness	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

That	O
I	O
was	O
of	O
the	O
opinion	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
abused	O
in	O
the	O
account	O
given	O

of	O
what	O
I	O
had	O

of	O
the	O

to	O
give	O
for	O

it	O

and	O
I	O
would	O
desire	O
them	O
to	O
let	O
me	O
know	O
afterwards	O

whether	O
they	O
had	O

The	O

them	O
a	O

of	O
the	O

the	O

everything	O

As	O
I	O
was	O

see	O
how	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
abused	O

to	O
the	O

so	O
they	O
were	O
astonished	O
when	O
they	O
read	O
my	O

saw	O
what	O
mischiefs	O
they	O
had	O

,	O
after	O

they	O
desired	O
the	O

might	O
come	O
to	O
them	O
again	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
did	O
;	O
then	O
they	O
told	O
him	O

that	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
thus	O
grossly	O
abused	O

drawn	O

mischiefs	O

to	O

on	O
an	O

project	O
of	O
the	O
second	O

's	O
,	O
they	O
hoped	O
their	O
being	O
so	O

a	O
little	O
extenuate	O
their	O
fault	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
convinced	O
the	O
captain	O
had	O
proposed	O
nothing	O
but	O
what	O
was	O
very	O
rational	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
voyage	O
that	O
might	O
be	O
very	O
profitable	O
to	O
the	O
owners	O
and	O
to	O
every	O
individual	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
entirely	O
threw	O
themselves	O
upon	O
the	O
captain	O
's	O
mercy	O
,	O
and	O
humbly	O
begged	O
pardon	O
;	O
that	O

if	O
I	O

to	O

them	O

they	O
would	O

merit	O
such	O

by	O
their	O

;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
the	O

time	O
,	O
they	O
submitted	O
to	O
what	O
punishment	O
I	O
pleased	O
to	O
lay	O
upon	O
them	O
:	O
and	O
,	O
particularly	O
,	O
that	O

as	O
they	O

by	O
their	O
conspiracy	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
claims	O
they	O
had	O
upon	O
the	O

on	O

at	O
the	O
first	O
land	O
they	O
came	O
to	O

they	O
were	O
willing	O
to	O
sign	O
a	O
discharge	O
for	O
all	O
their	O
wages	O
due	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
now	O
near	O
eight	O
months	O
a	O
man	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
be	O
considered	O
for	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
voyage	O
as	O
they	O
deserved	O
:	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
all	O
take	O
a	O
solemn	O
oath	O
of	O
fidelity	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
do	O
their	O
duty	O

to	O
go	O
wherever	O

them	O

the	O

to	O

them	O

This	O
was	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
just	O
as	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
wanted	O
nothing	O
more	O
than	O
to	O
have	O
something	O
offered	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
might	O
give	O
them	O
back	O
again	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
ever	O
thought	O

and	O
have	O
found	O
it	O
by	O
experience	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
;	O
and	O
men	O
were	O
always	O
secured	O
in	O
their	O
duty	O
by	O
a	O
generous	O
kindness	O
,	O
better	O
than	O
by	O
absolute	O
dominion	O
and	O
severity	O
:	O
indeed	O
,	O
my	O
opinion	O
was	O
justified	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
measures	O
I	O
took	O
with	O
these	O
men	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
I	O
found	O
they	O
were	O
sufficiently	O
humbled	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
brought	O
them	O
low	O
enough	O
,	O
I	O
let	O
them	O
know	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
their	O
punishment	O
but	O
their	O
amendment	O
I	O
desired	O
;	O
that	O
I	O
scorned	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
prey	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
take	O
that	O
forfeiture	O
they	O
had	O
offered	O
,	O
by	O
putting	O
the	O
wages	O
due	O
to	O
them	O
for	O
their	O
labour	O
in	O
my	O
pocket	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
sent	O
them	O
word	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
glad	O
to	O
hear	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
sensible	O
how	O
much	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
imposed	O
upon	O
;	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
my	O
design	O
to	O
offer	O
anything	O
to	O
them	O
which	O
they	O
or	O
any	O
honest	O
men	O
ought	O
to	O
refuse	O
,	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
my	O
desire	O
to	O
make	O
any	O
advantages	O
of	O
their	O
follies	O
but	O
what	O
might	O
tend	O
to	O
bring	O
them	O
back	O
to	O
their	O
duty	O
;	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
prospect	O
that	O
was	O
inconsistent	O
with	O
their	O
safety	O
and	O
interest	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
scorned	O
to	O
make	O
an	O
advantage	O
of	O
their	O
submission	O
;	O
that	O
as	O
to	O
their	O
wages	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
had	O
forfeited	O
them	O
by	O
their	O
mutiny	O
,	O
yet	O
God	O
forbid	O
I	O
should	O
convert	O
them	O
to	O
my	O
own	O
profit	O
;	O
and	O
since	O
forgiving	O
their	O
offence	O
was	O
in	O
my	O
power	O
,	O
the	O
crime	O
being	O
in	O
one	O
particular	O
an	O
offence	O
against	O
me	O
,	O
they	O
should	O
never	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
say	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
gain	O
of	O
their	O
submission	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
Pope	O
,	O
should	O
sell	O
them	O
my	O
pardon	O
;	O
that	O
,	O
upon	O
their	O
solemnly	O

to	O
me	O
never	O
to	O

the	O

disturbance	O
of	O
any	O

in	O
the	O

the	O
future	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
do	O
their	O
duty	O
faithfully	O
and	O
cheerfully	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
forget	O
all	O
that	O
was	O
passed	O
;	O
only	O
this	O
I	O
expected	O
,	O
that	O
two	O
of	O
them	O

who	O
were	O
particularly	O
guilty	O
of	O
threatening	O
the	O
life	O
of	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
,	O
should	O
be	O
punished	O
as	O
they	O
deserved	O
.	O

They	O
could	O
not	O
deny	O
but	O
this	O
was	O
most	O
just	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
offer	O
to	O
intercede	O
for	O
those	O
two	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
when	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
moved	O
the	O
rest	O
to	O
petition	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
answered	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
do	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
received	O
favour	O
enough	O
for	O
themselves	O

and	O
they	O
could	O
not	O

anything	O
of	O
the	O

for	O
they	O

In	O

the	O

were	O

they	O

these	O

as	O
I	O

All	O
this	O
while	O
Captain	O

Captain	O

had	O
a	O
guard	O
of	O
eight	O
men	O
in	O
the	O

I	O
had	O
now	O
nothing	O
to	O

with	O
my	O
men	O
who	O
were	O
on	O
shore	O
;	O
and	O
of	O
these	O

six	O
were	O
no	O

not	O
embarked	O

with	O
a	O

to	O
engage	O

they	O
fell	O

into	O
the	O

what	O
to	O

with	O
these	O

was	O
a	O

The	O
first	O
thing	O
I	O
did	O
,	O
was	O
to	O
dismiss	O
my	O
visitor	O
,	O
the	O
Dutch	O
captain	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
reason	O
to	O
think	O
myself	O
exceedingly	O
obliged	O
to	O
:	O
and	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
I	O
handsomely	O
rewarded	O
his	O
men	O
,	O
to	O
whom	O
I	O
gave	O
four	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
a	O
man	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
waited	O
on	O
the	O
captain	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
seen	O
him	O
into	O
his	O
boat	O
,	O
I	O
fired	O
him	O
twenty-one	O
guns	O
at	O
his	O
going	O
off	O
;	O
for	O
which	O
he	O
fired	O
twenty-five	O
when	O
he	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
his	O
ship	O

The	O
same	O
afternoon	O
I	O
sent	O
my	O
pinnace	O
on	O
board	O
him	O
for	O
my	O
drunken	O
cockswain	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
the	O
pinnace	O
I	O
sent	O
the	O
captain	O
three	O
dozen	O
bottles	O
of	O
English	PNM
beer	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
quarter	O
cask	O
of	O
Canary	PNM

which	O
was	O
the	O
best	O

I	O
had	O
to	O
make	O
him	O
;	O

sent	O
every	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
other	O
seamen	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
eight	O
per	O
man	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
indeed	O

the	O
assistance	O
I	O

from	O
the	O

it	O
;	O

to	O
the	O
mate	O

who	O
acted	O
so	O
bravely	O
with	O
my	O
men	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
fifty	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
I	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
to	O
pay	O
my	O
respects	O
to	O
the	O
governor	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
had	O
all	O
the	O
prisoners	O
delivered	O
up	O
to	O
me	O

Six	O
men	O
I	O
caused	O
to	O
be	O
immediately	O
set	O
at	O

a	O

as	O
the	O

As	O
for	O
the	O
second	O

I	O
tried	O
him	O
formally	O
by	O
a	O
council	O
of	O

as	O
I	O
was	O
empowered	O
by	O

I	O
kept	O
him	O

expectation	O
of	O
the	O
halter	O
every	O
hour	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
to	O
some	O
,	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
as	O
grievous	O
as	O
the	O
hanging	O
itself	O
.	O

Thus	O
we	O
conquered	O
this	O
desperate	O
mutiny	O
,	O
all	O
principally	O
proceeding	O
from	O
suffering	O
the	O
private	O
disputes	O
among	O
ourselves	O
,	O
which	O
ought	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
the	O
arcana	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
voyage	O
,	O
and	O
kept	O
as	O
secret	O
as	O
death	O
itself	O
could	O
have	O
kept	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
mean	O
so	O
as	O
not	O
to	O
come	O
among	O
the	O
seamen	O
afore	O
the	O
mast	O

We	O
lay	O
here	O
twelve	O
days	O
,	O
during	O
which	O
time	O
we	O
took	O
in	O
fresh	O
water	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
casks	O
for	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
stow	O

On	O
the	O
13th	O
day	O
of	O
August	O
,	O
we	O
weighed	O
and	O
stood	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
east	O
,	O
designing	O
to	O
make	O
no	O
land	O

we	O
came	O
to	O
Java	PNM

and	O
the	O
Straits	O
of	O
Sunda	PNM
,	O
for	O
that	O
way	O
we	O
intended	O
to	O
sail	O

but	O
the	O
wind	O
sprung	O
up	O
at	O
E.	O
and	O
E.	O
S.	O
E.	O
,	O
and	O
blew	O
so	O
fresh	O

that	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
,	O
after	O
two	O
days	O
'	O
beating	O
against	O

to	O

While	O
we	O
were	O
here	O

there	O
came	O
in	O
two	O
Dutch	O
East	O
Indiamen	O
more	O

homeward-bound	O

to	O
whom	O
had	O
happened	O
a	O
very	O
odd	O
accident	O

They	O
had	O
been	O
attacked	O
by	O
a	O
large	O
ship	O
of	O
forty-four	O
guns	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
stout	O
sloop	O
of	O
eight	O
guns	O
;	O
the	O
Dutch	O
ships	O
resolving	O
to	O
assist	O
one	O

stood	O
up	O

the	O

-LRB-	O
for	O
such	O
it	O
seems	O
he	O
was	O

-RRB-	O
and	O
fought	O
him	O
very	O
warmly	O

The	O
engagement	O
lasted	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
hours	O
;	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
privateer	O
had	O
killed	O
them	O

;	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
heat	O
of	O
the	O
fight	O
,	O
the	O
sloop	O
received	O
a	O
shot	O
,	O
which	O
brought	O
her	O
mainmast	O
by	O
the	O
board	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
caused	O
the	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
frigate	O
to	O
sheer	O
off	O
,	O
fearing	O
his	O
sloop	O
would	O
be	O
taken	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
sloop	O
's	O
men	O
took	O
care	O
of	O
themselves	O
,	O
for	O
,	O
hauling	O
a	O
little	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
fight	O
,	O
they	O
got	O
into	O
their	O
own	O
boats	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
boat	O
which	O
the	O
frigate	O
sent	O
to	O
their	O
help	O
,	O
and	O
abandoned	O
the	O
sloop	O
;	O
which	O
the	O
Dutchmen	O
perceiving	O
,	O
they	O
manned	O
out	O
their	O
boats	O

and	O
sent	O

took	O
the	O
sloop	O
with	O
all	O
that	O
was	O
in	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
her	O
away	O
with	O
them	O

The	O
Dutchmen	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
road	O
at	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
with	O
this	O
prize	O
while	O
our	O
ship	O
was	O
there	O
the	O
second	O
time	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
saw	O
them	O
bringing	O
the	O
sloop	O
in	O
tow	O
,	O
having	O
no	O
mast	O
standing	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
pole-mast	O
set	O
up	O
for	O
the	O
present	O
,	O
and	O
her	O
mizen	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
also	O
disabled	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
little	O
use	O
to	O
her	O
.	O

I	O
no	O
sooner	O
saw	O
her	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
came	O
into	O
my	O
thoughts	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
she	O
was	O
anything	O
of	O
a	O
sea-boat	O
,	O
she	O
would	O
do	O
our	O
business	O
to	O
a	O
tittle	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
always	O
resolved	O
to	O
get	O
another	O
ship	O
,	O
but	O
had	O
been	O
disappointed	O
,	O
this	O
would	O
answer	O
our	O
end	O
exactly	O
;	O
accordingly	O
I	O
went	O
with	O
my	O
chief	O
mate	O
,	O
in	O
our	O
shallop	O
,	O
on	O
board	O
my	O
old	O
acquaintance	O
the	O
Dutch	O
captain	O
,	O
and	O
inquiring	O
there	O
,	O
was	O
informed	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
prize	O
taken	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
in	O
all	O
probability	O
the	O
captain	O
that	O
took	O
her	O
would	O
be	O
glad	O
to	O
part	O
with	O
her	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
captain	O
promised	O
me	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
that	O
brought	O
her	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
inquire	O
about	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
me	O
know	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
the	O
captain	O
sent	O
me	O
word	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
her	O
;	O
that	O
she	O
carried	O
eight	O
guns	O
,	O
had	O
good	O
store	O
of	O
provisions	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
with	O
ammunition	O
sufficient	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
her	O
and	O
all	O
that	O
was	O
in	O
her	O
for	O
twelve	O
hundred	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
my	O
chief	O
mate	O
back	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
messenger	O
and	O
the	O
money	O
,	O
giving	O
him	O
commission	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
take	O
possession	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
liked	O
her	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
Dutch	O
captain	O
,	O
my	O
friend	O
,	O
lent	O
him	O
twelve	O
men	O
to	O
bring	O
her	O
off	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
did	O
the	O
same	O
day	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
put	O
to	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
mast	O
for	O
her	O
,	O
having	O
not	O
anything	O
on	O
board	O
we	O
could	O
spare	O
that	O
was	O
fit	O
for	O
a	O
main-mast	O
;	O
but	O
resolving	O
at	O
last	O
to	O
mast	O
her	O
not	O
as	O
a	O
sloop	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
a	O
brigantine	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
shift	O
with	O
what	O
pieces	O
we	O
had	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
spare	O
foretop-mast	O
,	O
which	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Dutch	O
ships	O
helped	O
me	O
to	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
fitted	O
her	O
up	O
very	O
handsomely	O
,	O
made	O
her	O
carry	O
twelve	O
guns	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
sixty	O
men	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
things	O
we	O
found	O
on	O
board	O
her	O
,	O
were	O
casks	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
greatly	O
wanted	O
,	O
especially	O
for	O
barrelling	O
up	O
beef	O
and	O
other	O
provisions	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
very	O
difficult	O
;	O
but	O
our	O
cooper	O
eked	O
them	O
out	O
with	O
making	O
some	O
new	O
ones	O
out	O
of	O
her	O
old	O
ones	O
.	O

After	O
staying	O
here	O
sixteen	O
days	O
more	O
,	O
we	O
sailed	O
again	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
once	O
we	O
should	O
never	O
have	O
gone	O
away	O
at	O
all	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
is	O
certain	O
above	O
half	O
the	O
men	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
had	O
been	O
made	O
uneasy	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
remained	O
still	O
some	O
misunderstanding	O
of	O
my	O
design	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
supposition	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
frightful	O
things	O
the	O
second	O
mate	O
had	O
put	O
in	O
their	O
heads	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
by	O
his	O
means	O
,	O
the	O
boatswain	O
and	O
gunner	O
.	O

As	O
these	O
three	O
had	O
the	O
principal	O
management	O
of	O
the	O
conspiracy	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
pardoned	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
some	O
thoughts	O
of	O
making	O
an	O
example	O
of	O
these	O
;	O
I	O
took	O
care	O
to	O
let	O
them	O
know	O
it	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
manner	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
room	O
to	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
jest	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
intended	O
to	O
have	O
them	O
all	O
three	O
hanged	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
kept	O
them	O
above	O
three	O
weeks	O
in	O
suspense	O
about	O
it	O
:	O
however	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
intention	O
to	O
put	O
them	O
to	O
death	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
cruelty	O
,	O
something	O
worse	O
than	O
death	O
,	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
continually	O
in	O
expectation	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
place	O
too	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
but	O
little	O
more	O
than	O
room	O
to	O
breathe	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
seventeen	O
days	O
gone	O
from	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
relieve	O
them	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
remove	O
them	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
doing	O
me	O
any	O
capital	O
injury	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
should	O
have	O
any	O
such	O
design	O
still	O
in	O
their	O
heads	O
.	O

For	O
this	O
purpose	O
,	O
I	O
caused	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
removed	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
into	O
brigantine	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
I	O
permitted	O
them	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
liberty	O
than	O
they	O
had	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
great	O
ship	O
;	O
and	O
where	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
entered	O
into	O
another	O
conspiracy	O
,	O
as	O
wild	O
and	O
foolish	O
as	O
ever	O
I	O
heard	O
of	O
,	O
or	O
as	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
was	O
ever	O
heard	O
of	O
by	O
any	O
other	O
;	O
but	O
of	O
this	O
I	O
shall	O
say	O
more	O
in	O
its	O
place	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
now	O
to	O
sail	O
in	O
company	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
went	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
,	O
the	O
3rd	O
of	O
September	O
,	O
1714	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
the	O
brigantine	O
was	O
an	O
excellent	O
sea-boat	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
bear	O
the	O
weather	O
to	O
a	O
miracle	O
,	O
and	O
no	O
bad	O
sailer	O
;	O
she	O
kept	O
pace	O
with	O
us	O
on	O
all	O
occasions	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
storm	O
we	O
had	O
at	O
S.	O
S.	O
E.	O
,	O
some	O
days	O
after	O
,	O
she	O
shifted	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
we	O
did	O
in	O
the	O
great	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
us	O
all	O
well	O
pleased	O
with	O
her	O
.	O

This	O
storm	O
drove	O
us	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
once	O
thought	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
driven	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
again	PNM
;	O
which	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
happened	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
we	O
should	O
never	O
have	O
gone	O
on	O
with	O
the	O
voyage	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
men	O
began	O
to	O
murmur	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
say	O
we	O
were	O
bewitched	O
;	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
beaten	O
off	O
first	O
from	O
the	O
south	O
of	O
America	PNM
,	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
never	O
get	O
round	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
now	O
driven	O
back	O
from	O
the	O
south	O
of	O
Africa	PNM
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
it	O
looked	O
as	O
if	O
fate	O
had	O
determined	O
this	O
voyage	O
to	O
be	O
pursued	O
no	O
farther	O
.	O

The	O
wind	O
continued	O
,	O
and	O
blew	O
exceeding	O
hard	O
:	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
driven	O
so	O
far	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
made	O
the	O
south	O
point	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Madagascar	PNM
.	O

My	O
pilot	O
knew	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
Madagascar	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
clear	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
land	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
beaten	O
so	O
long	O
against	O
the	O
sea	O
to	O
no	O
purpose	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
in	O
want	O
of	O
many	O
things	O
,	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
put	O
in	O
;	O
and	O
accordingly	O
made	O
for	O
Port	PNM
St.	PNM
Augustine	PNM
,	O
on	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O

where	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
in	O
eleven	O
fathom	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
road	O
.	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
without	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
anxious	O
thoughts	O
upon	O
our	O
coming	O
into	O
this	O
island	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
knew	O
very	O
well	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
gang	O
of	O
desperate	O
rogues	O
here	O
,	O
especially	O
on	O
the	O
northern	O
coast	O

who	O
had	O
been	O
famous	O
for	O
their	O
piracies	O

and	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
either	O
strong	O
enough	O
as	O
pirates	O
to	O
take	O
us	O
,	O
or	O
rogues	O
enough	O
to	O
entice	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
of	O
my	O
men	O
to	O
run	O
away	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
resolved	O
neither	O
to	O

the	O
shore	O
to	O
be	O
surprised	O

on	O
shore	O
,	O
such	O
excepted	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
be	O
very	O
secure	O
of	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
was	O
soon	O
informed	O
by	O
a	O
Dutchman	O
,	O
who	O
came	O
off	O
to	O
me	O
with	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
in	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
canvass	O
boat	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
Europeans	O
there	O
but	O
himself	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
pirates	O
were	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
ship	O
with	O
them	O
of	O
any	O
force	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
glad	O
to	O
be	O
fetched	O
off	O
by	O
any	O
Christian	O
ship	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
above	O
two	O
hundred	O
in	O
number	O
,	O
their	O
chief	O
leaders	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
only	O
ships	O
of	O
force	O
they	O
had	O
,	O
being	O
out	O
a	O
cruising	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Arabia	PNM
,	O
and	O
the	O
Gulf	PNM
of	PNM
Persia	PNM
.	O

After	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
myself	O
with	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
whom	O
I	O
could	O
trust	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
true	O
as	O
the	O
Dutchman	O
had	O
related	O
.	O

The	O
Dutchman	O
gave	O
us	O
a	O
long	O
history	O
of	O
his	O
adventures	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
be	O
left	O
there	O
by	O
a	O
ship	O
he	O
came	O
in	O
from	O
Europe	PNM
,	O
which	O
,	O
he	O
running	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
for	O
sport	O
with	O
three	O
more	O
of	O
his	O
comrades	O
,	O
went	O
away	O
without	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
them	O
among	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
used	O
them	O
extremely	O
well	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
now	O
he	O
served	O
them	O
for	O
an	O
interpreter	O
and	O
a	O
broker	O
,	O
to	O
bargain	O
for	O
them	O
with	O
the	O
European	O
ships	O
for	O
provisions	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
he	O
engaged	O
to	O
bring	O
us	O
what	O
provisions	O
we	O
pleased	O
,	O
and	O
proposed	O
such	O
trinkets	O
in	O
return	O
as	O
he	O
knew	O
the	O
natives	O
desired	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
were	O
of	O
value	O
little	O
enough	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
desired	O
a	O
consideration	O
for	O
himself	O
in	O
money	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
of	O
no	O
use	O
to	O
him	O
there	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
hereafter	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
his	O
demand	O
was	O
but	O
twenty	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
,	O
we	O
thought	O
he	O
very	O
well	O
deserved	O
them	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
bought	O
a	O
great	O
quantity	O
of	O
beef	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
having	O
no	O
casks	O
to	O
spare	O
,	O
we	O
salted	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
cured	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
Dutchman	O
's	O
direction	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
proved	O
of	O
excellent	O
use	O
to	O
us	O
through	O
the	O
whole	O
voyage	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
kept	O
some	O
of	O
it	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
England	PNM
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
then	O
so	O
hard	O
,	O
that	O
a	O
good	O
hatchet	O
would	O
hardly	O
cut	O
it	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
lay	O
here	O
,	O
it	O
came	O
into	O
my	O
thoughts	O
,	O
that	O
now	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
time	O
to	O
execute	O
justice	O
upon	O
my	O
prisoners	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
called	O
up	O
the	O
officers	O
to	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
council	O
of	O
war	O
,	O
and	O
proposed	O
it	O
to	O
them	O
in	O
general	O
terms	O
,	O
not	O
letting	O
them	O
know	O
my	O
mind	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

They	O
all	O
agreed	O
it	O
was	O
necessary	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
second	O
mate	O
,	O
boatswain	O
,	O
and	O
gunner	O
,	O
had	O
so	O
much	O
intelligence	O
of	O
it	O
from	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
prepared	O
for	O
death	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
signed	O
a	O
dead-warrant	O
for	O
their	O
execution	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
hanged	O
at	O
the	O
yard-arm	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
midst	O
of	O
those	O
resolves	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
the	O
council	O
of	O
officers	O
,	O
my	O
design	O
was	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
where	O
a	O
gang	O
of	O
pirates	O
were	O
said	O
to	O
be	O
settled	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
persuaded	O
I	O
might	O
get	O
a	O
good	O
ship	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
many	O
men	O
as	O
we	O
desired	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
satisfied	O
the	O
greatest	O
part	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
so	O
wearied	O
of	O
their	O
present	O
situation	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
glad	O
of	O
an	O
opportunity	O
to	O
come	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
especially	O
such	O
as	O
had	O
,	O
either	O
by	O
force	O
,	O
or	O
rash	O
,	O
hasty	O
resolutions	O
,	O
been	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
surprised	O
into	O
that	O
sort	O
of	O
life	O
;	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
informed	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
far	O
from	O
being	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
formidable	O
posture	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
represented	O
to	O
us	O
in	O
Europe	PNM
,	O
or	O
anything	O
near	O
so	O
numerous	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
contrary	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
find	O
them	O
poor	O
,	O
divided	O
,	O
in	O
distress	O
,	O
and	O
willing	O
to	O
get	O
away	O
upon	O
any	O
terms	O
they	O
could	O
.	O

Some	O
of	O
the	O
officers	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
differed	O
from	O
me	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
received	O
such	O
ideas	O
of	O
the	O
figure	O
those	O
people	O
made	O
in	O
Madagascar	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
common	O
report	O
in	O
England	PNM
,	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
notion	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
of	O
a	O
little	O
commonwealth	O
of	O
robbers	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
immensely	O
rich	O
;	O
that	O
Captain	O
Avery	O
was	O
king	O
of	O
the	O
Island	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
eight	O
thousand	O
men	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
good	O
squadron	O
of	O
stout	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
resist	O
a	O
whole	O
fleet	O
of	O
men	O
of	O
war	O
;	O
having	O
a	O
harbour	O
so	O
well	O
fortified	O
at	O
the	O
entrance	O
into	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O

a	O
good	O
army	O
for	O
land-service	O

to	O
assist	O
in	O
the	O
enterprise	O

I	O
convinced	O
them	O
how	O
impossible	O
this	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
true	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
them	O
all	O
the	O

I	O
had	O
with	O
the	O
Dutchman	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
I	O
now	O
was	O

who	O
had	O
received	O
a	O
full	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
particulars	O
from	O
several	O
of	O

had	O
come	O
down	O
to	O
St.	PNM

in	O
little	O

in	O

to	O

to	O
get	O
passage	O
for	O
Europe	PNM
;	O
that	O

always	O
assisted	O

got	O
them	O
off	O
,	O
whenever	O
any	O
ship	O
touched	O
at	O
that	O
port	O

and	O
that	O
they	O
all	O
agreed	O
in	O
their	O

of	O
their	O
state	O

which	O
was	O
indeed	O
miserable	O
enough	O

that	O
they	O
wanted	O
not	O

In	O
a	O
word	O

I	O
soon	O
brought	O
them	O
to	O
enter	O

the	O

to	O
be	O
of	O

accordingly	O

I	O
ordered	O
to	O
get	O
ready	O

and	O
in	O
three	O
days	O

time	O
weighed	O
anchor	O

stood	O
away	O
for	O
the	O

taking	O

into	O

that	O

upon	O

and	O
,	O
if	O

they	O
would	O
desert	O

go	O
over	O
to	O
the	O

and	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
well	O
rid	O
of	O
them	O

without	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
bringing	O
them	O
to	O

for	O
I	O
was	O
very	O

I	O

fifteen	O

a	O
half	O
south	O

began	O
to	O

-LRB-	O
for	O
I	O
expected	O
by	O
his	O
words	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
made	O
that	O
choice	O
-RRB-	O
but	O
I	O
would	O
give	O
him	O
the	O
lives	O
of	O
his	O
two	O

;	O
and	O
would	O
give	O
them	O

and	O
anything	O

that	O
was	O

or	O
necessary	O

their	O
subsisting	O
on	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
then	O
,	O
that	O
had	O
it	O
been	O
any	O
other	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O

at	O
Madagascar	PNM
,	O
he	O
would	O
readily	O
have	O
chosen	O
to	O
have	O
gone	O
on	O
shore	O
;	O
nay	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
place	O
had	O
been	O
really	O
desolate	O
and	O
uninhabited	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
object	O
because	O
my	O
offer	O
was	O
not	O
very	O
generous	O
and	O
kind	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
always	O
with	O
regret	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
look	O
back	O
upon	O
the	O
mercy	O
he	O
should	O
have	O
received	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
ill	O
he	O
had	O
deserved	O
it	O
at	O
my	O

But	O
that	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
that	O
I	O
mentioned	O
setting	O
him	O
at	O
liberty	O

he	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
he	O

been	O
mutinous	O

,	O
for	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
acknowledged	O
he	O

yet	O
he	O
hoped	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
think	O
so	O
ill	O
of	O
him	O
as	O
to	O
believe	O
he	O
could	O
turn	O
pirate	O
;	O
and	O
begged	O
that	O
,	O
rather	O
than	O
entertain	O
such	O
hard	O
thoughts	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
execute	O
the	O
worst	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
sentence	O
,	O
and	O
send	O
him	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
a	O
penitent	O
and	O
an	O
honest	O
man	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
should	O
esteem	O
far	O
better	O
than	O
to	O
give	O
him	O
his	O
life	O
in	O
a	O
condition	O
in	O
which	O
he	O
could	O
preserve	O
it	O
upon	O
no	O
other	O
terms	O
than	O
those	O
of	O
being	O
the	O
worst	O
of	O
villains	O

He	O
added	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
there	O
was	O
anything	O
he	O
could	O
do	O
to	O
deserve	O
so	O
much	O
mercy	O
as	O
I	O
intended	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
begged	O
me	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
give	O
him	O
room	O
to	O
behave	O
himself	O
as	O
became	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
would	O
leave	O
it	O
wholly	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
use	O
him	O
as	O
he	O
should	O
deserve	O
,	O
even	O
to	O
the	O
recalling	O
the	O
pardon	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
granted	O
him	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
extremely	O
satisfied	O
with	O
what	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
and	O
more	O
particularly	O
with	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
his	O
speaking	O
it	O
;	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
I	O
was	O
glad	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
principle	O
of	O
so	O
much	O
honesty	O
at	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
a	O
part	O
so	O
unhappy	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
acted	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
very	O
far	O
from	O
prompting	O
him	O
to	O
turn	O
pirate	O
,	O
and	O
much	O
more	O
from	O
forcing	O
him	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
his	O
desire	O
,	O
put	O
an	O
opportunity	O
into	O
his	O
hands	O
to	O
show	O
himself	O
a	O
new	O
man	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
by	O
his	O
fidelity	O
,	O
to	O
wipe	O
out	O
all	O
that	O
was	O
past	O
.	O

And	O
then	O
,	O
without	O
any	O
more	O
ceremony	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
my	O
whole	O
design	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
,	O
to	O
send	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
four	O

five	O

men	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
on	O
shore	O
among	O
the	O
pirates	O
as	O
spies	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
condition	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
see	O
whether	O
there	O
were	O
any	O
apprehensions	O
of	O
violence	O
from	O
them	O
,	O
or	O
whether	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
mean	O
circumstances	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
lastly	O
,	O
whether	O
they	O
had	O
any	O
ship	O
or	O
vessel	O
which	O
might	O
be	O
bought	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
whether	O
men	O
might	O
be	O
had	O
to	O
increase	O
our	O
company	O
;	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
such	O
men	O
as	O
,	O
being	O
penitent	O
for	O
their	O
rogueries	O
and	O
tired	O
with	O
their	O
miseries	O
,	O
would	O
be	O
glad	O
of	O
the	O
opportunity	O
of	O
turning	O
honest	O
men	O
before	O
they	O
were	O
brought	O
to	O
it	O
by	O
distress	O
and	O
the	O
gallows	O
.	O

He	O
embraced	O
the	O
offer	O
with	O
the	O
greatest	O
readiness	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
me	O
all	O
the	O
assurances	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
desire	O
of	O
his	O
fidelity	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
asked	O
him	O
whether	O
he	O
thought	O
his	O
two	O
fellow-prisoners	O
might	O
be	O
trusted	O
upon	O
the	O
same	O
conditions	O
.	O

In	O
reply	O
,	O
he	O
asked	O
me	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
take	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
sincerity	O
,	O
if	O
,	O
after	O
a	O
trial	O
,	O
he	O
should	O
tell	O
me	O
his	O
mind	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
displeased	O
if	O
he	O
declined	O
speaking	O
his	O
thoughts	O
till	O
he	O
had	O
talked	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
at	O
liberty	O
to	O
give	O
his	O
farther	O
answer	O
after	O
he	O
had	O
proposed	O
it	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
insisted	O
upon	O
his	O
opinion	O
first	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
only	O
his	O
opinion	O
that	O
I	O
asked	O
now	O
;	O
whereas	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
reported	O
it	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
then	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
more	O
to	O
do	O
but	O
to	O
report	O
their	O
answer	O
.	O

He	O
then	O
asked	O
me	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
please	O
to	O
grant	O
him	O
one	O
thing	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
whatever	O
his	O
opinion	O
should	O
be	O
,	O
what	O
he	O
should	O
say	O
should	O
be	O
no	O
prejudice	O
to	O
them	O
in	O
their	O
present	O
condition	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
reasonable	O
caution	O
in	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
assure	O
him	O
that	O
,	O
whatever	O
he	O
said	O
should	O
not	O
do	O
them	O
any	O
prejudice	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
to	O
convince	O
him	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
him	O
my	O
word	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
put	O
them	O
to	O
death	O
on	O
any	O
account	O
whatsoever	O
,	O
merely	O
for	O
his	O
sake	O
.	O

He	O
bowed	O
,	O
and	O
thanked	O
me	O
very	O
heartily	O
for	O
that	O
grant	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
obliged	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
plainer	O
with	O
me	O
on	O
that	O
head	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
deceive	O
me	O
in	O
anything	O
whatever	O
,	O
so	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
in	O
this	O
,	O
especially	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
told	O
me	O
it	O
was	O
his	O
opinion	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
serve	O
me	O
faithfully	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
referred	O
me	O
to	O
the	O
experience	O
I	O
should	O
find	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
added	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
be	O
so	O
just	O
to	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
beginning	O
,	O
as	O
that	O
,	O
while	O
he	O
begged	O
to	O
be	O
merciful	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
yet	O
for	O
my	O
own	O
sake	O
he	O
would	O
also	O
beg	O
me	O
not	O
to	O
trust	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
took	O
the	O
hint	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
no	O
more	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
but	O
ordered	O
his	O
irons	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
off	O
,	O
with	O
direction	O
for	O
him	O
to	O
have	O
leave	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
his	O
former	O
cabin	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
have	O
his	O
chests	O
and	O
things	O
restored	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
at	O
full	O
liberty	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
in	O
any	O
office	O

or	O
appointed	O
to	O
any	O
particular	O
business	O

A	O
day	O
or	O
two	O
after	O
this	O
we	O
made	O
land	O
,	O
which	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
north-west	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O

in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
13	O

'	O
;	O
and	O
now	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
time	O
to	O
put	O
our	O
design	O
into	O
execution	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
knew	O
very	O
well	O
that	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
from	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
where	O
the	O
pirates	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
heard	O
of	O
:	O
so	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
boat	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
with	O
about	O
sixteen	O
men	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
discoveries	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
them	O
my	O
new-restored	O
man	O

I	O
gave	O
him	O
no	O
instruction	O
for	O
anything	O
extraordinary	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
our	O
work	O
now	O
being	O
only	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
.	O

The	O
boat	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
again	O
at	O
night	O
,	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
now	O
stood	O
in	O
within	O
two	O
leagues	O
of	O
the	O
shore	O
-RRB-	O
and	O
brought	O
us	O
an	O
account	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
English	O
or	O
Europeans	O
on	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
heard	O
of	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
farther	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
stood	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
all	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
being	O
fair	O
and	O
the	O
sea	O
smooth	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
our	O
reckoning	O
we	O
went	O
in	O
that	O
time	O
about	O
forty	O
leagues	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
evening	O
,	O
the	O
same	O
company	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
shown	O
by	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
where	O
the	O
pirates	O
inhabited	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
was	O
about	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
and	O
twenty	O
miles	O
farther	O
north	O
still	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
river	O
very	O
commodious	O
for	O
shipping	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
European-built	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
sloops	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
laid	O
up	O
,	O
except	O
two	O
sloops	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
they	O
cruised	O
sometimes	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
off	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
,	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
Arabian	PNM

The	O
mate	O
returned	O
with	O
this	O
intelligence	O
the	O
same	O
night	O
;	O
and	O
by	O
his	O
direction	O
we	O
stood	O
in	O
as	O
close	O
under	O
the	O
shore	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
conveniently	O
,	O
about	O
six	O
leagues	O
farther	O
north	O
;	O
here	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
road	O
under	O
a	O
little	O
cape	O
,	O
which	O
kept	O
us	O
perfectly	O
undiscovered	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
before	O
day	O
,	O
my	O
man	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
again	O
with	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
keeping	O
only	O
four	O
men	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
sent	O
the	O
boat	O
on	O
board	O
again	O
,	O
agreeing	O
on	O
a	O
signal	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
send	O
the	O
boat	O
for	O
him	O
again	O
when	O
he	O
should	O
return	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
pretty	O
high	O
ledge	O
of	O
hills	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
he	O
landed	O

the	O

under	O
the	O
lee	O
of	O
which	O
our	O
ship	O
rode	O
at	O
anchor	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
those	O
hills	O
,	O
he	O
plainly	O
discovered	O
the	O
creek	O

where	O
the	O
pirates	O

lay	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
they	O

on	O
the	O

Our	O

took	O
proper	O
observations	O
of	O
the	O
situation	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
they	O
were	O
in	O

They	O
boldly	O
went	O
down	O

came	O
to	O
the	O

the	O
pirates	O

camp	O
being	O
on	O

Here	O
they	O
fired	O
a	O

a	O

The	O

were	O
surprised	O
at	O
the	O

came	O
running	O

they	O
were	O

Upon	O

them	O
with	O
a	O

Our	O

pretended	O
to	O
be	O

at	O
finding	O
them	O
there	O

told	O
them	O
a	O

they	O

,	O
they	O

that	O

up	O

out	O

They	O
spent	O
good	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
first	O

in	O
looking	O
about	O
them	O

seeing	O
the	O

the	O
pirates	O
'	O
living	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
strength	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
perceived	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
indeed	O
in	O
but	O
a	O

condition	O
every	O
way	O
,	O
except	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
live	O
cattle	O

flesh	O
meat	O
sufficient	O

They	O
had	O
a	O
good	O
platform	O

indeed	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
covered	O
pallisadoe	O
round	O

their	O

but	O
as	O
for	O

to	O
the	O

they	O

a	O

which	O
was	O
all	O
they	O
had	O
to	O
fear	O
from	O
the	O
natives	O

They	O
had	O
no	O
bread	O
but	O
what	O
they	O
made	O
of	O
rice	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
store	O
they	O
had	O
of	O
that	O
was	O
very	O
small	O
:	O
they	O
told	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
two	O
ships	O
abroad	O

back	O
every	O

with	O
a	O

they	O
were	O
to	O

take	O
it	O

which	O
should	O

Our	O
men	O
pretended	O
to	O
like	O
their	O
way	O
of	O
living	O
mighty	O
well	O
and	O
talked	O
of	O
staying	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
let	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
they	O
passed	O
their	O
first	O
day	O
of	O
meeting	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
had	O
two	O
tents	O
or	O
huts	O
given	O
them	O
to	O
lodge	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
hammocks	O
hung	O
in	O
the	O
huts	O
very	O
agreeably	O
,	O
being	O
such	O
,	O
I	O
suppose	O

as	O
belonged	O
to	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
company	O
who	O
were	O
dead	O

or	O
were	O
out	O
upon	O
adventure	O
;	O
here	O
they	O
slept	O
very	O
securely	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
walked	O
about	O
,	O
as	O
strangers	O
might	O
be	O
suffered	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
to	O
look	O
about	O
them	O
.	O

But	O
my	O
new	O
manager	O
's	O
eye	O
was	O
chiefly	O
here	O
upon	O
two	O
things	O
:	O
first	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
any	O
shipping	O
for	O
our	O
purpose	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
secondly	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
he	O
could	O
pitch	O
upon	O
one	O
man	O
,	O
more	O
likely	O
than	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
to	O
enter	O
into	O
some	O
confidence	O
with	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
long	O
before	O
he	O
found	O
an	O
opportunity	O
for	O
both	O
.	O

The	O
manner	O
was	O
thus	O
:	O
He	O
was	O
walking	O
by	O
himself	O
,	O
having	O
ordered	O
his	O
other	O
men	O
to	O
straggle	O
away	O
,	O
two	O
and	O
two	O
,	O
this	O
way	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
not	O
minded	O
him	O
,	O
though	O
always	O
to	O
keep	O
him	O
in	O
sight	O
;	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
he	O
walked	O
by	O
himself	O
towards	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
creek	O
where	O
,	O
as	O
was	O
said	O
,	O
three	O
of	O
their	O
largest	O
ships	O
lay	O
by	O
the	O
walls	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
right	O
against	O
them	O
,	O
he	O
stood	O
still	O
,	O
looking	O
at	O
them	O
very	O
earnestly	O
.	O

While	O
he	O
was	O
here	O
,	O
he	O
observed	O
a	O
boat	O
put	O
off	O
from	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
with	O
four	O
oars	O
and	O
one	O
sitter	O
only	O
,	O
whom	O
they	O
set	O
on	O
shore	O
just	O
by	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
put	O
off	O
again	O
;	O
the	O
person	O
whom	O
they	O
set	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
was	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
one	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
with	O
our	O
men	O
the	O
evening	O
before	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
having	O
some	O
particular	O
office	O
on	O
board	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
ships	O
,	O
lay	O
on	O
board	O
every	O
night	O
with	O
about	O
ten	O
or	O
twelve	O
men	O
,	O
just	O
to	O
watch	O
and	O
guard	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
came	O
on	O
shore	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
as	O
is	O
usual	O
in	O
men-of-war	O
laid	O
up	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
saw	O
our	O
man	O
he	O
knew	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
spoke	O
very	O
familiarly	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
seeing	O
he	O
was	O
looking	O
so	O
earnestly	O
at	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
he	O
asked	O
him	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
go	O
on	O
board	O
;	O
our	O
man	O
faintly	O
declined	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
on	O
purpose	O
to	O
be	O
asked	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
upon	O
just	O
as	O
much	O
farther	O
pressing	O
as	O
was	O
sufficient	O
to	O
satisfy	O
him	O
that	O
the	O
gunner	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
that	O
was	O
his	O
office	O
-RRB-	O
was	O
in	O
earnest	O
,	O
he	O
yielded	O
;	O
so	O
the	O
gunner	O
called	O
back	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
went	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

Our	O
man	O
viewed	O
the	O
ship	O
very	O
particularly	O
,	O
and	O
pretended	O
to	O
like	O
everything	O
he	O
saw	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
after	O
some	O
conversation	O
,	O
asked	O
him	O
this	O
home	O
question	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
Why	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
go	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
seek	O
purchase	O
,	O
having	O
so	O
many	O
good	O
ships	O
at	O
their	O
command	O
?	O

He	O
shook	O
his	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
very	O
frankly	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
no	O
condition	O
to	O
undertake	O
anything	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
a	O
crew	O
of	O
unresolved	O
,	O
divided	O
rogues	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
never	O
two	O
days	O
of	O
a	O
mind	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
nobody	O
to	O
command	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
nobody	O
to	O
obey	O
;	O
that	O
several	O
things	O
had	O
been	O
offered	O
,	O
but	O
nothing	O
concluded	O
;	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
they	O
thought	O
of	O
nothing	O
but	O
of	O
shifting	O
every	O
one	O
for	O
himself	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
he	O
could	O
.	O

My	O
mate	O
replied	O
,	O
he	O
thought	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
quite	O
otherwise	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
made	O
him	O
tell	O
them	O
the	O
night	O
before	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
an	O
inclination	O
to	O
stay	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
heard	O
you	O
say	O
so	O
,	O
said	O
the	O
gunner	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
made	O
me	O
smile	O
;	O
I	O
thought	O
in	O
myself	O
that	O
you	O
would	O
be	O
of	O
another	O
mind	O
when	O
ye	O
knew	O
us	O
a	O
little	O
better	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
said	O
he	O
,	O
if	O
our	O
people	O
should	O
agree	O
to	O
lend	O
you	O
a	O
boat	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
your	O
ship	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
fall	O
together	O
by	O
the	O
ears	O
about	O
who	O
should	O
go	O
with	O
you	O
,	O
for	O
not	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
them	O
that	O
went	O
with	O
you	O
would	O
ever	O
come	O
back	O
again	O
hither	O
,	O
if	O
your	O
captain	O
would	O
take	O
them	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
terms	O
were	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
hanged	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
England	PNM
.	O

My	O
mate	O
knew	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
my	O
opinion	O
before	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
really	O
of	O
another	O
mind	O
himself	O
,	O
till	O
he	O
saw	O
things	O
and	O
till	O
he	O
talked	O
with	O
the	O
gunner	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
put	O
new	O
thoughts	O
in	O
his	O
head	O
;	O
so	O
he	O
entertained	O
the	O
gunner	O
with	O
a	O
scheme	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
as	O
he	O
related	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
really	O
a	O
mind	O
to	O
come	O
off	O
from	O
the	O
gang	O
,	O
he	O
believed	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
put	O
him	O
in	O
a	O
way	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
to	O
his	O
advantage	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
set	O
of	O
his	O
people	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
could	O
pick	O
out	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
that	O
might	O
be	O

upon	O

The	O
gunner	O
replied	O

I	O
can	O
pick	O
out	O
a	O
set	O

very	O
brave	O

of	O
them	O
such	O
as	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
forced	O
into	O
the	O
pirates	O
'	O
ships	O
,	O
were	O
dragged	O
into	O
that	O
wicked	O
life	O
they	O
had	O
lived	O
,	O
not	O
only	O
against	O
their	O
consciences	O
,	O
but	O
by	O
a	O
mere	O
necessity	O
to	O
save	O
their	O
lives	O

and	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
glad	O
at	O
any	O
price	O
to	O
go	O
off	O
.	O

The	O
mate	O
then	O
asked	O
him	O
,	O
Pray	O
,	O
gunner	O
,	O
how	O
many	O
such	O
men	O
can	O
you	O
answer	O
for	O
?	O

Why	O
,	O
says	O
he	O
,	O
after	O
a	O
short	O
pause	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
I	O
can	O
answer	O
for	O
above	O
a	O
hundred	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
my	O
mate	O
told	O
him	O
the	O
circumstances	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
,	O
the	O
voyage	O
we	O
were	O
upon	O
;	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
a	O
letter	O
of	O
mart	O
ship	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
force	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
over-manned	O
and	O
double-stored	O
,	O
in	O
hopes	O
of	O
getting	O
a	O
good	O
ship	O
upon	O
our	O
cruise	O
to	O
man	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
;	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
disappointed	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
only	O
got	O
the	O
sloop	O
or	O
brigantine	O
which	O
we	O
bought	O
at	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
;	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
could	O
persuade	O
the	O
men	O
to	O
sell	O
us	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
ships	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
pay	O
them	O
for	O
it	O
in	O
ready	O
money	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
entertain	O
a	O
hundred	O
of	O
their	O
men	O
into	O
the	O
bargain	O
.	O

The	O
gunner	O
told	O
him	O
he	O
would	O
propose	O
it	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
added	O
,	O
in	O
positive	O
terms	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
knew	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
readily	O
accepted	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
take	O
which	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
ships	O
I	O
pleased	O
.	O

The	O
mate	O
then	O
desired	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
lend	O
him	O
his	O
shallop	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
board	O
our	O
ship	O
,	O
to	O
acquaint	O
me	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
bring	O
back	O
sufficient	O
orders	O
to	O
treat	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
only	O
do	O
that	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
before	O
I	O
could	O
be	O
ready	O
to	O
go	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
propose	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
chief	O
men	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
his	O
eye	O
upon	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
have	O
their	O
consent	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
then	O
he	O
would	O
go	O
along	O
with	O
him	O
on	O
board	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
bargain	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
our	O
mate	O
could	O
expect	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
gunner	O
had	O
either	O
so	O
much	O
authority	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
men	O
were	O
so	O
forward	O
to	O
shift	O
their	O
station	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
gunner	O
came	O
again	O
to	O
our	O
mate	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
two	O
hours	O
,	O
with	O
an	O
order	O
,	O
signed	O
by	O
about	O
sixteen	O
of	O
their	O
officers	O
,	O
empowering	O
him	O
to	O
sell	O
us	O
the	O
ship	O
which	O
the	O
gunner	O
was	O
on	O
board	O
of	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
allot	O
so	O
many	O
guns	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
a	O
proportion	O
of	O
ammunition	O
to	O
her	O
,	O
as	O
was	O
sufficient	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
give	O
the	O
work	O
of	O
all	O
their	O
carpenters	O
for	O
so	O
many	O
days	O
as	O
were	O
necessary	O
to	O
repair	O
her	O
,	O
calk	O
,	O
and	O
grave	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
her	O
in	O
condition	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
sea	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
a	O
Spanish-built	O
ship	O
;	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
her	O
the	O
gunner	O
said	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
;	O
but	O
she	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
strong	O
,	O
tight	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
pretty	O
good	O
sailer	O
.	O

We	O
made	O
her	O
carry	O
two-and-thirty	O
guns	O
,	O
though	O
she	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
used	O
to	O
carry	O
above	O
twenty-four	O
.	O

The	O
gunner	O
being	O
thus	O
empowered	O
to	O
treat	O
with	O
my	O
mate	O
,	O
came	O
away	O
in	O
their	O
shallop	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
the	O
said	O
gunner	O
and	O
two	O
more	O
of	O
their	O
officers	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
eight	O
seamen	O
.	O

The	O
gunner	O
and	O
I	O
soon	O
made	O
a	O
bargain	O
for	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
bought	O
for	O
five	O
thousand	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
English	O
goods	O
such	O
as	O
they	O
wanted	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
almost	O
naked	O
of	O
clothes	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
for	O
other	O
things	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
scarce	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
stockings	O
or	O
shoes	O
among	O
them	O
.	O

When	O
our	O
bargain	O
was	O
made	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
mate	O
had	O
related	O
all	O
the	O
particulars	O
of	O
the	O
conference	O
he	O
had	O
had	O
with	O
the	O
gunner	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
talk	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
were	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
us	O
:	O
the	O
gunner	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
indeed	O
have	O
good	O
reason	O
to	O
suspect	O
a	O
gang	O
of	O
men	O
who	O
had	O
made	O
themselves	O
infamous	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
world	O
by	O
so	O
many	O
piracies	O
and	O
wicked	O
actions	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
put	O
so	O
much	O
confidence	O
in	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
assure	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
should	O
have	O
the	O
power	O
in	O
his	O
hands	O
to	O
pick	O
and	O
choose	O
his	O
men	O
,	O
so	O
he	O
would	O
answer	O
body	O
for	O
body	O
for	O
the	O
fidelity	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
men	O
he	O
should	O
choose	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
most	O
,	O
if	O
not	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
would	O
be	O
such	O
as	O
had	O
been	O
taken	O
by	O
force	O
out	O
of	O
other	O
ships	O
,	O
or	O
wheedled	O
away	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
drunk	O
:	O
and	O
he	O
added	O
,	O
there	O
never	O
was	O
a	O
ship	O
load	O
of	O
such	O
penitents	O
went	O
to	O
sea	O
together	O
as	O
he	O
would	O
bring	O
us	O
.	O

When	O
he	O
said	O
this	O
,	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
entreat	O
me	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
please	O
to	O
give	O
him	O
the	O
same	O
post	O
which	O
he	O
held	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
of	O
gunner	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
promised	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
he	O
desired	O
I	O
would	O
permit	O
him	O
to	O
speak	O
with	O
me	O
in	O
private	O
;	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
at	O
first	O
very	O
free	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
having	O
consented	O
to	O
let	O
the	O
mate	O
and	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
be	O
present	O
,	O
I	O
yielded	O
.	O

When	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
were	O
withdrawn	O
,	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
having	O
been	O
five	O
years	O
in	O
the	O
pirates	O
'	O
service	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
might	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
obliged	O
to	O
do	O
as	O
they	O
did	O
,	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
sure	O
he	O
had	O
some	O
small	O
share	O
in	O
the	O
purchase	O
;	O
and	O
however	O
he	O
had	O
come	O
into	O
it	O
against	O
his	O
will	O
,	O
yet	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
obliged	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
made	O
some	O
advantage	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
being	O
resolved	O
to	O
leave	O
them	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
good	O
while	O
ago	O
packed	O
up	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
got	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
his	O
escape	O
,	O
and	O
begged	O
I	O
would	O
let	O
him	O
deposit	O
it	O
with	O
me	O
as	O
a	O
security	O
for	O
his	O
fidelity	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
he	O
ordered	O
a	O
chest	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
shallop	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
into	O
my	O
great	O
cabin	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
besides	O
this	O
,	O
gave	O
me	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
pocket	O
,	O
a	O
bag	O
,	O
sealed	O
up	O
,	O
the	O
contents	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
shall	O
speak	O
of	O
hereafter	O
.	O

The	O
shallop	O
returned	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
sent	O
back	O
the	O
mate	O
with	O
my	O
long-boat	O
and	O
twenty-four	O
men	O
,	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
take	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
and	O
appointed	O
my	O
carpenter	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
see	O
to	O
the	O
repairs	O
that	O
were	O
necessary	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
to	O
her	O
:	O
and	O
some	O
days	O
after	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
with	O
the	O
supercargo	O
,	O
in	O
our	O
sloop	O
,	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
secure	O
the	O
possession	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
cover	O
the	O
retreat	O
of	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
who	O
might	O
have	O
a	O
mind	O
to	O
come	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
be	O
opposed	O
by	O
the	O
rest	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
done	O
at	O
the	O
request	O
of	O
the	O
gunner	O
who	O
foresaw	O
there	O
might	O
be	O
some	O
debate	O
about	O
it	O
.	O

They	O
spent	O
six	O
weeks	O
and	O
some	O
odd	O
days	O
in	O
fitting	O
out	O
this	O
ship	O
,	O
occasioned	O
by	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
a	O
convenient	O
place	O
to	O
lay	O
her	O
on	O
shore	O
in	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
make	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
labour	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
at	O
last	O
completely	O
fitted	O
up	O
.	O

When	O
she	O
was	O
equipped	O
,	O
they	O
laid	O
in	O
a	O
good	O
store	O
of	O
provisions	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
so	O
well	O
cured	O
as	O
to	O
last	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
things	O
we	O
got	O
a	O
recruit	O
of	O
here	O
was	O
casks	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
said	O
before	O
,	O
we	O
greatly	O
wanted	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
their	O
coopers	O
assisted	O
us	O
to	O
trim	O
,	O
season	O
,	O
and	O
fit	O
up	O
.	O

As	O
to	O
bread	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
help	O
from	O
them	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
none	O
but	O
what	O
they	O
made	O
of	O
rice	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
had	O
not	O
sufficient	O
store	O
of	O
that	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
had	O
more	O
to	O
do	O
yet	O
:	O
for	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
fitted	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
had	O
the	O
possession	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
surprised	O
one	O
morning	O
,	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
most	O
horrible	O
tumult	O
among	O
the	O
pirates	O
:	O
and	O
had	O
not	O
our	O
brigantine	O
been	O
at	O
hand	O
to	O
secure	O
the	O
possession	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
they	O
had	O
taken	O
the	O
ship	O
from	O
our	O
men	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
have	O
come	O
down	O
with	O
her	O
and	O
their	O
two	O
sloops	O
,	O
and	O
have	O
attacked	O
us	O
.	O

The	O
case	O
was	O
this	O
:	O
The	O
gunner	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
a	O
punctual	O
fellow	O
to	O
his	O
word	O
,	O
resolved	O
that	O
none	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
should	O
go	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
but	O
such	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
singled	O
out	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
such	O
as	O
were	O
generally	O
taken	O
out	O
of	O
merchant	O
ships	O
by	O
force	O
:	O
but	O
when	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
talk	O
to	O
the	O
men	O
of	O
who	O
should	O
go	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
should	O
stay	O
,	O
truly	O
they	O
would	O
all	O
go	O
,	O
to	O
a	O
man	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
them	O
would	O
stay	O
behind	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
they	O
fell	O
out	O
about	O
it	O
to	O
that	O
degree	O
that	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
blows	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
gunner	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
fly	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
with	O
about	O
twenty-two	O
men	O
that	O
stood	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
were	O
wounded	O
in	O
the	O
fray	O
,	O
whereof	O
two	O
died	O
.	O

The	O
gunner	O
being	O
thus	O
driven	O
to	O
his	O
shifts	O
,	O
made	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
to	O
his	O
boat	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
rogues	O
were	O
too	O
nimble	O
for	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
got	O
to	O
his	O
boat	O
before	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
prepared	O
to	O
man	O
her	O
and	O
two	O
more	O
,	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
board	O
and	O
secure	O
the	O
ship	O

That	O

if	O
they	O

that	O

considering	O
what	O

we	O
were	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
what	O

While	O
he	O
was	O
talking	O
thus	O
with	O
them	O
in	O
the	O

he	O
had	O

their	O

would	O

to	O

;	O
however	O
,	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
got	O
leave	O
to	O
get	O
in	O
at	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
ports	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
between	O
decks	O
among	O
our	O
men	O
;	O
here	O
they	O
made	O
terrible	O
complaints	O
of	O
their	O
condition	O
,	O
and	O
begged	O
hard	O
to	O
be	O
entertained	O
in	O
our	O
service	O
;	O
they	O
were	O
full	O
of	O
money	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
twenty	O
or	O
thirty	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
among	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
this	O
present	O
prevailed	O
on	O
two	O
men	O
to	O
speak	O
to	O
my	O
mate	O
,	O
who	O
appeared	O
as	O
captain	O
,	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
boat	O
's	O
crew	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

The	O
mate	O
very	O
gravely	O
told	O
the	O
two	O
ambassadors	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
added	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
seeing	O
they	O
were	O
come	O
with	O
a	O
flag	O
of	O
truce	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
stop	O
their	O
men	O
without	O
their	O
consent	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
men	O
being	O
so	O
earnest	O
,	O
he	O
thought	O
they	O
would	O
do	O
better	O
not	O
to	O
oppose	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
ambassadors	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
call	O
them	O
,	O
opposed	O
it	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
vehemently	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
desired	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
talk	O
with	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
granted	O
them	O
readily	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
came	O
into	O
their	O
boat	O
,	O
their	O
men	O
told	O
them	O
plainly	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
one	O
and	O
all	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
enter	O
themselves	O
with	O
their	O
countrymen	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
forced	O
already	O
to	O
turn	O
pirates	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
thought	O
they	O
might	O
very	O
justly	O
turn	O
honest	O
men	O
again	O
by	O
force	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
leave	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
peaceably	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
no	O
more	O
;	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
ambassadors	O
desired	O
it	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
set	O
them	O
on	O
shore	O
with	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
for	O
themselves	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
go	O
along	O
with	O
the	O
new	O
captain	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
ambassadors	O
saw	O
this	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
more	O
to	O
do	O
but	O
to	O
be	O
satisfied	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
were	O
set	O
on	O
shore	O
where	O
they	O
desired	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
men	O
stayed	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

During	O
this	O
transaction	O
,	O
my	O
mate	O
had	O
sent	O
a	O
full	O
account	O
to	O
me	O
of	O
all	O
that	O
had	O
passed	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
desired	O
me	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
and	O
give	O
farther	O
directions	O
in	O
all	O
that	O
was	O
to	O
follow	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
took	O
our	O
supercargo	O
and	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
along	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
more	O
of	O
our	O
officers	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
my	O
lot	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
just	O
when	O
the	O
aforesaid	O
ambassadors	O
were	O
talking	O
with	O
my	O
mate	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
heard	O
most	O
of	O
what	O
they	O
had	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
and	O
heard	O
the	O
answer	O
my	O
mate	O
gave	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
above	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
extremely	O
to	O
my	O
satisfaction	O
;	O
nor	O
did	O
I	O
interrupt	O
him	O
,	O
or	O
take	O
upon	O
me	O
any	O
authority	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
would	O
very	O
submissively	O
have	O
had	O
me	O
shown	O
myself	O
as	O
captain	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
bade	O
him	O
go	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
sat	O
down	O
,	O
as	O
not	O
concerned	O
in	O
the	O
affair	O
at	O
all	O
.	O

After	O
the	O
ambassadors	O
were	O
gone	O
,	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
I	O
did	O
,	O
was	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
presence	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
company	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
before	O
had	O
the	O
opinion	O
of	O
those	O
I	O
brought	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
to	O
tell	O
my	O
second	O
mate	O
how	O
well	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
satisfied	O
with	O
his	O
conduct	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
declare	O
him	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
in	O
;	O
only	O
demanding	O
his	O
solemn	O
oath	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
under	O
orders	O
of	O
the	O
great	O
ship	O
,	O
as	O
admiral	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
carry	O
on	O
no	O
separate	O
interests	O
from	O
us	O
;	O
which	O
he	O
thankfully	O
accepted	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
to	O
give	O
him	O
his	O
due	O
,	O
as	O
faithfully	O
performed	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
our	O
very	O
long	O
voyage	O
,	O
and	O
through	O
all	O
our	O
adventures	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
upon	O
my	O
seeming	O
intercession	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
gave	O
consent	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
's	O
crew	O
,	O
who	O
brought	O
the	O
ambassadors	O
,	O
to	O
remain	O
in	O
our	O
service	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
their	O
statesmen	O
on	O
shore	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
end	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
about	O
one	O
hundred	O
and	O
fifty	O
,	O
or	O
two	O
hundred	O
men	O
,	O
he	O
should	O
entertain	O
whom	O
he	O
thought	O
fit	O
.	O

Thus	O
having	O
settled	O
all	O
things	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
to	O
our	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
back	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
ship	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
many	O
hours	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
till	O
I	O
was	O
surprised	O
with	O
the	O
firing	O
of	O
three	O
muskets	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
we	O
wondered	O
what	O
could	O
be	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
knowing	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
an	O
unusual	O
thing	O
in	O
that	O
place	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
knew	O
the	O
natives	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
had	O
no	O
fire-arms	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
what	O
to	O
make	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
took	O
no	O
notice	O
,	O
other	O
than	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
to	O
wonder	O
at	O
it	O
.	O

About	O
half-an-hour	O
after	O
,	O
we	O
heard	O
three	O
muskets	O
more	O
,	O
and	O
still	O
,	O
not	O
knowing	O
anything	O
of	O
the	O
matter	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
them	O
no	O
return	O
to	O
the	O
signal	O
.	O

Some	O
time	O
after	O
three	O
muskets	O
were	O
fired	O
again	O
,	O
but	O
still	O
we	O
took	O
no	O
notice	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
knew	O
nothing	O
of	O
what	O
return	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
to	O
it	O
.	O

When	O
night	O
come	O
on	O
,	O
we	O
observed	O
two	O
great	O
fires	O
upon	O
two	O
several	O
hills	O
,	O
on	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
shore	O
opposite	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
that	O
,	O
three	O
rockets	O
were	O
fired	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
badly	O
constructed	O
;	O
I	O
suppose	O
their	O
gunner	O
was	O
ill	O
provided	O
for	O
such	O
things	O
:	O
but	O
all	O
signified	O
nothing	O
;	O
we	O
would	O
have	O
made	O
any	O
return	O
to	O
them	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
to	O
be	O
understood	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
knew	O
nothing	O
of	O
any	O
agreed	O
signal	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
send	O
a	O
boat	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
well	O
manned	O
,	O
to	O
learn	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
what	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
all	O
this	O
was	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
accordingly	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
our	O
long-boat	O
and	O
shallop	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
with	O
two-and-thirty	O
men	O
in	O
them	O
both	O
,	O
to	O
get	O
intelligence	O
;	O
ordering	O
them	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
to	O
speak	O
with	O
somebody	O
,	O
before	O
they	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
know	O
how	O
things	O
stood	O
;	O
that	O
then	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
party	O
of	O
the	O
pirates	O
,	O
they	O
should	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
come	O
near	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
parley	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
till	O
they	O
knew	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
their	O
behaviour	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
my	O
men	O
came	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
they	O
saw	O
plainly	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
body	O
of	O
above	O
a	O
hundred	O
of	O
the	O
pirates	O
;	O
but	O
seeing	O
them	O
so	O
strong	O
,	O
they	O
stood	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
not	O
come	O
nearer	O
,	O
nor	O
near	O
enough	O
to	O
parley	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
upon	O
this	O
,	O
the	O
men	O
on	O
shore	O
got	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
islanders	O
'	O
canvass	O
boats	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
boats	O
made	O
of	O
skins	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
but	O
sorry	O
ones	O
at	O
best	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
off	O
,	O
with	O
two	O
men	O
to	O
manage	O
the	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
sitter	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
paddles	O
for	O
oars	O
and	O
away	O
they	O
came	O
towards	O
us	O
,	O
carrying	O
a	O
flag	O
of	O
truce	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
an	O
old	O
white	O
rag	O
;	O
how	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
save	O
so	O
much	O
linen	O
among	O
them	O
all	O
,	O
was	O
very	O
hard	O
to	O
guess	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
could	O
do	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
receive	O
their	O
ambassador	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
flag	O
of	O
truce	O
gave	O
no	O
shadow	O
of	O
apprehension	O

especially	O
considering	O
the	O
figure	O
they	O
made	O

and	O
that	O
the	O

no	O

they	O

by	O
upon	O
their	O
oars	O
till	O
they	O
came	O
up	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
soon	O
understood	O
who	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
viz.	O
--	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
the	O
gunner	O

;	O
that	O
they	O
came	O
too	O
late	O
to	O
have	O
their	O
signal	O
perceived	O
from	O
the	O
other	O
ship	O

which	O
was	O
gone	O
out	O
of	O

of	O
the	O

were	O

they	O

with	O
great	O
difficulty	O
,	O
and	O
five	O
days	O
and	O
nights	O
'	O
marching	O
,	O
got	O
through	O
a	O
woody	O
and	O
almost	O
impassable	O
country	O
to	O
come	O
at	O
us	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
fetched	O
a	O
circuit	O
of	O
near	O
a	O
hundred	O
miles	O
to	O
avoid	O
being	O
attacked	O
by	O
their	O
comrades	O

and	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
pursued	O
by	O
them	O
with	O
their	O
whole	O
body	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
they	O
begged	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
on	O
board	O
;	O
they	O
added	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
overtaken	O
by	O
their	O
comrades	O
,	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
all	O
cut	O
in	O
pieces	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
broke	O
away	O
from	O
them	O
by	O
force	O
,	O
and	O
moreover	O
had	O
been	O
obliged	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
of	O
their	O
pursuit	O
,	O
to	O
face	O
about	O
and	O
fire	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
killed	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
wounded	O
others	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
sworn	O
they	O
would	O
give	O
them	O
no	O
quarter	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
come	O
fairly	O
up	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
told	O
them	O
they	O
must	O
be	O
contented	O
to	O
remain	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
do	O
nothing	O
till	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
acquainted	O
their	O
captain	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
particulars	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
came	O
back	O
immediately	O
to	O
me	O
for	O
orders	O
.	O

As	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
uneasy	O
at	O
the	O
thoughts	O
of	O
taking	O
them	O
on	O
board	O
;	O
I	O
knew	O
they	O
were	O
a	O
gang	O
of	O
pirates	O
at	O
best	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
they	O
might	O
do	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
sent	O
them	O
this	O
message	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
all	O
their	O
tale	O
might	O
be	O
very	O
good	O
for	O
aught	O
I	O
knew	O
,	O
yet	O
that	O
I	O
must	O
take	O
so	O
much	O
time	O
as	O
to	O
send	O
an	O
express	O
to	O
the	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
ship	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
informed	O
of	O
the	O
truth	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
brought	O
a	O
satisfactory	O
answer	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
send	O
for	O
them	O
all	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
very	O
uncomfortable	O
news	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
expected	O
to	O
be	O
surrounded	O
every	O
hour	O
by	O
their	O
comrades	O
,	O
from	O
whom	O
they	O
were	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
no	O
mercy	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
seeing	O
no	O
remedy	O
,	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
march	O
about	O
twenty	O
miles	O
farther	O
south	O
,	O
and	O
lie	O
by	O
in	O
a	O
place	O
near	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
agreed	O
to	O
send	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
concluding	O
that	O
their	O
comrades	O
not	O
finding	O
them	O
near	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
lay	O
,	O
would	O
not	O
imagine	O
they	O
could	O
be	O
gone	O
farther	O
that	O
way	O
.	O

As	O
they	O
guessed	O
,	O
so	O
it	O
proved	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
pirates	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
saw	O
tokens	O
enough	O
of	O
their	O
having	O
been	O
there	O
,	O
but	O
seeing	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
found	O
,	O
concluded	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
gone	O
on	O
board	O
our	O
ship	O
.	O

The	O
wind	O
proving	O
contrary	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
four	O
days	O
before	O
our	O
boat	O
came	O
back	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
poor	O
men	O
were	O
held	O
in	O
great	O
suspense	O
:	O
but	O
when	O
they	O
returned	O
,	O
they	O
brought	O
the	O
gunner	O
with	O
them	O
who	O
had	O
selected	O
those	O
men	O
from	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
for	O
our	O
new	O
ship	O
;	O
and	O
who	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
came	O
,	O
gave	O
me	O
a	O
long	O
account	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
care	O
he	O
had	O
taken	O
to	O
pick	O
them	O
out	O
for	O
our	O
service	O
,	O
delivering	O
me	O
also	O
a	O
letter	O
from	O
my	O
new	O
captain	O
to	O
the	O
same	O
purpose	O
:	O
upon	O
all	O
which	O
concurring	O
circumstances	O
,	O
we	O
concluded	O
to	O
take	O
them	O
on	O
board	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
sent	O
our	O
boats	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
at	O
twice	O
,	O
brought	O
them	O
all	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
stout	O
young	O
fellows	O
they	O
were	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
on	O
board	O
some	O
days	O
and	O
refreshed	O
themselves	O
,	O
I	O
concluded	O
to	O
send	O
all	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
new	O
ship	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
upon	O
advice	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
send	O
sixty	O
of	O
my	O
own	O
men	O
joined	O
to	O
forty	O
of	O
these	O
,	O
and	O
keep	O
thirty-four	O
of	O
them	O
on	O
board	O
my	O
ship	O
;	O
for	O
their	O
number	O
was	O
just	O
seventy-four	O
,	O
which	O
with	O
the	O
gunner	O
and	O
his	O
twenty-one	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sixteen	O
men	O
who	O
came	O
with	O
the	O
worthy	O
ambassadors	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
not	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
again	O
,	O
made	O
one	O
hundred	O
and	O
twelve	O
men	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
all	O
thought	O
,	O
were	O
enough	O
for	O
us	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
took	O
in	O
between	O
forty	O
and	O
fifty	O
more	O
afterwards	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
now	O
ready	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
caused	O
the	O
new	O
ship	O
and	O
the	O
brigantine	O
to	O
come	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
they	O
lay	O
,	O
and	O
join	O
us	O
;	O
which	O
they	O
did	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
unloaded	O
part	O
of	O
our	O
provisions	O
and	O
ammunition	O
;	O
of	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
observed	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
taken	O
in	O
double	O
quantity	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
furnished	O
the	O
new	O
ship	O
with	O
a	O
proportion	O
of	O
all	O
things	O
necessary	O
,	O
we	O
prepared	O
for	O
our	O
voyage	O
.	O

I	O
should	O
here	O
give	O
a	O
long	O
account	O
of	O
a	O
second	O
infernal	O
conspiracy	O
,	O
which	O
my	O
two	O
remaining	O
prisoners	O
had	O
formed	O
among	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
to	O
betray	O
the	O
new	O
ship	O
to	O
the	O
pirates	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
too	O
long	O
a	O
story	O
to	O
relate	O
here	O
;	O
nor	O
did	O
I	O
make	O
it	O
public	O
among	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O
:	O
but	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
only	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
laid	O
down	O
in	O
a	O
scheme	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
opportunity	O
to	O
put	O
it	O
in	O
practice	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
better	O
to	O
make	O
as	O
little	O
noise	O
about	O
it	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
ordered	O
my	O
new	O
captain	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
he	O
who	O
discovered	O
it	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
to	O
punish	O
them	O
in	O
their	O
own	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
without	O
taking	O
notice	O
of	O
their	O
new	O
villanies	O
,	O
to	O
set	O
them	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
leave	O
them	O
to	O
take	O
their	O
fate	O
with	O
a	O
set	O
of	O
rogues	O
whom	O
they	O
had	O
intended	O
to	O
join	O
with	O
,	O
and	O
whose	O
profession	O
was	O
likely	O
,	O
some	O
time	O
or	O
other	O
,	O
to	O
bring	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
gallows	O
.	O

And	O
thus	O
I	O
was	O
rid	O
of	O
two	O
incorrigible	O
mutineers	O
;	O
what	O
became	O
of	O
them	O
afterwards	O
I	O
never	O
heard	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
now	O
a	O
little	O
fleet	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
two	O
large	O
ships	O
and	O
a	O
brigantine	O
,	O
well	O
manned	O
,	O
and	O
furnished	O
with	O
all	O
sorts	O
of	O
necessaries	O
for	O
any	O
voyage	O
or	O
any	O
enterprise	O
that	O
was	O
fit	O
for	O
men	O
in	O
our	O
situation	O
to	O
undertake	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
particularly	O
,	O
here	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
full	O
design	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
voyage	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
again	O
openly	O
declared	O
to	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
them	O
asked	O
,	O
one	O
by	O
one	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
willing	O
and	O
resolved	O
to	O
undertake	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
all	O
very	O
cheerfully	O
answered	O
in	O
the	O
affirmative	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
had	O
an	O
opportunity	O
to	O
furnish	O
ourselves	O
with	O
a	O
plentiful	O
stock	O
of	O
excellent	O
beef	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
before	O
,	O
we	O
cured	O
with	O
little	O
or	O
no	O
salt	O
,	O
by	O
drying	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
,	O
we	O
laid	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
store	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
all	O
our	O
three	O
vessels	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
near	O
a	O
hundred	O
and	O
fifty	O
tons	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
of	O
excellent	O
use	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
served	O
us	O
through	O
the	O
whole	O
voyage	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
little	O
else	O
to	O
be	O
had	O
in	O
this	O
place	O
that	O
was	O
fit	O
to	O
be	O
carried	O
to	O
sea	O
;	O
except	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
there	O
was	O
plenty	O
of	O
milk	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
more	O
dexterous	O
than	O
others	O
,	O
made	O
several	O
large	O
cheeses	O
;	O
nor	O
were	O
they	O
very	O
far	O
short	O
of	O
English	PNM
cheese	O
,	O
only	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
but	O
indifferent	O
dairy	O
folks	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
made	O
some	O
butter	O
also	O
,	O
and	O
salted	O
it	O
to	O
keep	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
grew	O
rank	O
and	O
oily	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
of	O
little	O
use	O
to	O
us	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
15th	O
of	O
December	O
that	O
we	O
left	O
this	O
place	O
,	O
a	O
country	O
fruitful	O

full	O
of	O

we	O

if	O

at	O

we	O
effected	O

We	O
chased	O
her	O

and	O
brought	O
her	O
too	O
,	O
indeed	O

as	O
if	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
attack	O

no	O
mind	O
to	O
discover	O
ourselves	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
sail	O
through	O
the	O
very	O
centre	O
of	O
the	O
India	O
trade	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
was	O
perfectly	O
without	O
any	O
business	O
among	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
met	O
indeed	O
on	O
this	O
coast	O
with	O
some	O
pearl	O
fishers	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
Arabian	O
Gulf	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
large	O
quantity	O
of	O
pearl	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
have	O
traded	O
with	O
them	O
for	O
goods	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
understood	O
nothing	O
but	O
money	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
refused	O
to	O
part	O
with	O
it	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
the	O
fellows	O
gave	O
our	O
supercargo	O
some	O
scornful	O
language	O
,	O
which	O
though	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
well	O
understand	O
what	O
they	O
said	O
,	O
yet	O
he	O
pretended	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
as	O
a	O
great	O
affront	O
,	O
and	O
threatened	O
to	O
make	O
prize	O
of	O
their	O
barks	O
,	O
and	O
slaves	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
they	O
grew	O
very	O
humble	O
;	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
a	O
Malabar	O
Indian	O
,	O
who	O
spoke	O
a	O
little	O
English	O
,	O
spoke	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
willingly	O
trade	O
with	O
us	O
for	O
such	O
goods	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
;	O
whereupon	O
I	O
produced	O
three	O
bales	O
of	O
English	PNM
cloth	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
showed	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
of	O
good	O
merchandise	O
at	O
Gombaroon	PNM
in	O
the	O
Gulf	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
the	O
Persians	O
made	O
their	O
long	O
vests	O
of	O
such	O
cloths	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
for	O
this	O
cloth	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
money	O
,	O
we	O
bought	O
a	O
box	O
of	O
choice	O
pearls	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
chief	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
picked	O
out	O
from	O
the	O
rest	O
for	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
merchants	O
at	O
Goa	PNM
;	O
and	O
which	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
London	PNM
,	O
was	O
valued	O
at	O
two	O
thousand	O
two	O
hundred	O
pounds	O
sterling	O

We	O
were	O
near	O
two	O
months	O
on	O
our	O
voyage	O
from	O
Madagascar	PNM
to	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
India	PNM
,	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
to	O
Ceylon	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
put	O
in	O
on	O
the	O
south-west	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
provisions	O
we	O
could	O
get	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
take	O
in	O
a	O
large	O
supply	O
of	O
water	O
.	O

The	O
people	O
here	O
we	O
found	O
willing	O
to	O
supply	O
us	O
with	O
provisions	O
;	O
but	O
withal	O
so	O
sharp	O
,	O
imposing	O
upon	O
us	O
their	O
own	O
rates	O
for	O
everything	O
,	O
and	O
withal	O
,	O
so	O
false	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
often	O
provoked	O
to	O
treat	O
them	O
very	O
rudely	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
strict	O
orders	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
hurt	O
upon	O
any	O
occasion	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
till	O
we	O
had	O
filled	O
all	O
our	O
water-casks	O
and	O
taken	O
in	O
what	O
fresh	O
provisions	O
we	O
could	O
get	O
,	O
and	O
especially	O
rice	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
valued	O
very	O
much	O
.	O

But	O
they	O
provoked	O
us	O
at	O
last	O
beyond	O
all	O
patience	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
such	O
thieves	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
treacherous	O
rogues	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
bearing	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
two	O
accidents	O
fell	O
out	O
upon	O
this	O
occasion	O
which	O
fully	O
broke	O
the	O
peace	O
between	O
us	O
;	O
one	O
was	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
both	O
happened	O
the	O
same	O
day	O
.	O

The	O
case	O
on	O
board	O
was	O
this	O
.	O

There	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
us	O
a	O
small	O
boat	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
were	O
eleven	O
men	O
and	O
three	O
boys	O
,	O
to	O
sell	O
us	O
roots	O
,	O
yams	O
,	O
mangoes	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
other	O
articles	O
as	O
was	O
frequent	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
do	O
every	O
day	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
boat	O
having	O
more	O
goods	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
than	O
usual	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
longer	O
than	O
ordinary	O
in	O
making	O
their	O
market	O
.	O

While	O
they	O
were	O
thus	O
chaffering	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
having	O
wandered	O
about	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
pretending	O
to	O
admire	O
everything	O
he	O
saw	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
gotten	O
between	O
decks	O
,	O
was	O
taken	O
stealing	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
shoes	O
which	O
belonged	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
seamen	O
.	O

The	O
fellow	O
being	O
stopped	O
for	O
his	O
theft	O
,	O
appeared	O
angry	O
,	O
raised	O
a	O
hideous	O
screaming	O
noise	O
to	O
alarm	O
his	O
fellows	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
having	O
stolen	O
a	O
long	O
pair	O
of	O
scissors	O
,	O
pulled	O
them	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
stabbed	O
the	O
man	O
who	O
had	O
laid	O
hold	O
of	O
him	O
into	O
the	O
shoulder	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
repeat	O
his	O
blow	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
poor	O
fellow	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
wounded	O
,	O
having	O
struck	O
up	O
his	O
heels	O
and	O
fallen	O
upon	O
him	O
,	O
had	O
killed	O
him	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
called	O
to	O
take	O
him	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
bring	O
the	O
thief	O
up	O
to	O
me	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
order	O
,	O
they	O
laid	O
hold	O
of	O
the	O
barbarian	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
him	O
up	O
with	O
the	O
shoes	O
and	O
the	O
scissors	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
stolen	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
the	O
fact	O
was	O
plain	O
,	O
and	O
needed	O
no	O
witnesses	O
,	O
I	O
caused	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
brought	O
up	O
also	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
made	O
them	O
understand	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
.	O

They	O
made	O
pitiful	O
signs	O
of	O
fear	O
,	O
lest	O
they	O
should	O
all	O
be	O
punished	O
for	O
his	O
crime	O
,	O
and	O
particularly	O
when	O
they	O
saw	O
the	O
man	O
whom	O
he	O
had	O
wounded	O
brought	O
in	O
;	O
then	O
they	O
expected	O
nothing	O
but	O
death	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
made	O
a	O
sad	O
lamentation	O
and	O
howling	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
to	O
die	O
immediately	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
without	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
difficulty	O
that	O
I	O
found	O
ways	O
to	O
satisfy	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
nobody	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
punished	O
but	O
the	O
man	O
that	O
had	O
committed	O
the	O
fact	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
caused	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
brought	O
to	O
the	O
gears	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
halter	O
about	O
his	O
neck	O
,	O
and	O
be	O
soundly	O
whipped	O
;	O
and	O
indeed	O
,	O
our	O
people	O
did	O
scourge	O
him	O
severely	O
from	O
head	O
to	O
foot	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
run	O
myself	O
to	O
put	O
an	O
end	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
whipped	O
him	O
to	O
death	O
.	O

When	O
this	O
punishment	O
was	O
over	O
,	O
they	O
put	O
him	O
into	O
their	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
them	O
all	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

But	O
no	O
sooner	O
were	O
they	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
raised	O
a	O
terrible	O
outcry	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
villages	O
and	O
towns	O
near	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
a	O
few	O
,	O
the	O
country	O
being	O
very	O
populous	O
;	O
and	O
great	O
numbers	O
came	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
staring	O
at	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
making	O
confused	O
ugly	O
noises	O
,	O
and	O
abundance	O
of	O
arrows	O
they	O
shot	O
at	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
rode	O
too	O
far	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
do	O
us	O
any	O
hurt	O
.	O

While	O
this	O
was	O
doing	O
,	O
another	O
fray	O
happened	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
where	O
two	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
bargaining	O
with	O
an	O
islander	O
and	O
his	O
wife	O
for	O
some	O
fowls	O
,	O
they	O
took	O
their	O
money	O
and	O
gave	O
them	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
fowls	O
,	O
and	O
pretended	O
the	O
woman	O
should	O
go	O
and	O
fetch	O
the	O
rest	O
.	O

While	O
the	O
woman	O
was	O
gone	O
,	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
fellows	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
man	O
who	O
was	O
left	O
;	O
when	O
talking	O
a	O
while	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
seeing	O
our	O
men	O
were	O
but	O
two	O
,	O
they	O
began	O
to	O
take	O
hold	O
of	O
the	O
fowls	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
sold	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
take	O
them	O
away	O
again	O
;	O
when	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
stepped	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
fellow	O
who	O
had	O
taken	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
to	O
lay	O
hold	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
too	O
nimble	O
for	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
ran	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
off	O
the	O
fowls	O
and	O
the	O
money	O
too	O
.	O

The	O
seamen	O
were	O
so	O
enraged	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
served	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
took	O
up	O
their	O
pieces	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
both	O
fire-arms	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
fired	O
immediately	O
after	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
aimed	O
their	O
shot	O
so	O
well	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
the	O
fellow	O
flew	O
like	O
the	O
wind	O
,	O
he	O
shot	O
him	O
through	O
the	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
dropped	O
down	O
dead	O
upon	O
the	O
spot	O
.	O

The	O
rest	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
though	O
terribly	O
frightened	O
,	O
yet	O
,	O
seeing	O
our	O
men	O
were	O
but	O
two	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
noise	O
bringing	O
twenty	O
or	O
thirty	O
more	O
immediately	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
attacked	O
our	O
men	O
with	O
their	O
lances	O
,	O
and	O
bows	O
and	O
arrows	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
moment	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
pitched	O
battle	O
of	O
two	O
men	O
only	O
against	O
twenty	O
or	O
thirty	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
number	O
increasing	O
too	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
spent	O
their	O
shot	O
freely	O
among	O
them	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
it	O
lasted	O
,	O
and	O
killed	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
,	O
besides	O
wounding	O
ten	O
or	O
eleven	O
more	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
cooled	O
their	O
courage	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
give	O
over	O
the	O
battle	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
whose	O
ammunition	O
was	O
almost	O
spent	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
retreating	O
to	O
their	O
boat	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
near	O
a	O
mile	O
off	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
unhappily	O
gotten	O
from	O
their	O
boat	O
so	O
far	O
up	O
the	O
country	O
.	O

They	O
made	O
their	O
retreat	O
pretty	O
well	O
for	O
about	O
half	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
,	O
they	O
saw	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
pursued	O
only	O
,	O
but	O
surrounded	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
enemies	O
were	O
before	O
them	O
.	O

This	O
made	O
them	O
double	O
their	O
pace	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
seeing	O
no	O
remedy	O
,	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
break	O
through	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
before	O
them	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
about	O
eleven	O
or	O
twelve	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
came	O
within	O
pistol	O
shot	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
having	O
,	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
shot	O
,	O
put	O
almost	O
a	O
handful	O
of	O
gravel	O
and	O
small	O
stones	O
into	O
his	O
piece	O
,	O
fired	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
gravel	O
and	O
stones	O
scattering	O
,	O
wounded	O
almost	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
being	O
naked	O
from	O
the	O
waist	O
upwards	O
,	O
the	O
least	O
grain	O
of	O
sand	O
scratched	O
and	O
hurt	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
them	O
bleed	O
if	O
it	O
only	O
entered	O
the	O
skin	O

Being	O
thus	O
completely	O
scared	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
more	O
afraid	O
than	O
hurt	O
,	O
they	O
all	O
ran	O
away	O
,	O
except	O
two	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
really	O
wounded	O
with	O
the	O
shot	O
or	O
stones	O
,	O
and	O
lay	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
let	O
them	O
lie	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
their	O
way	O
to	O
their	O
boat	O
;	O
where	O
,	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
they	O
got	O
safe	O

but	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
at	O
their	O
heels	O

Our	O
men	O
did	O
not	O
stay	O
to	O
fire	O
from	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
but	O
put	O
off	O
with	O

We	O
had	O
enough	O
of	O
Ceylon	PNM
;	O
and	O
having	O
no	O

such	O

What	O
became	O
of	O
the	O
fellow	O
that	O
was	O
lashed	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O

torn	O

we	O

indifferent	O
surgeons	O

our	O

the	O

live	O

and	O
the	O
reason	O
they	O
gave	O
for	O
it	O
was	O

because	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
pickle	O
him	O

Truly	O

they	O
said	O

that	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
so	O
kind	O
to	O
him	O

to	O

him	O

throwing	O

on	O
the	O

enough	O

to	O
the	O

it	O

to	O

yet	O
it	O
is	O

the	O
way	O

We	O

to	O

we	O
stayed	O
but	O
five	O
days	O
;	O
in	O
which	O
time	O
we	O
supplied	O
ourselves	O
with	O
what	O
the	O

would	O
afford	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
pretending	O
to	O
be	O
bound	O
for	O
China	PNM
,	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
through	O

the	O

We	O
had	O
here	O
a	O
very	O
difficult	O
passage	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
took	O
two	O
pilots	O
on	O
board	O
at	O
Achen	O
,	O
who	O
pretended	O
to	O
know	O
the	O
straits	O
perfectly	O

;	O
twice	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
very	O
great	O
danger	O
of	O
being	O
lost	O
,	O
and	O
once	O
our	O
Madagascar	O
ship	O
was	O
so	O
entangled	O
among	O
rocks	O
and	O
currents	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
gave	O
her	O
up	O
for	O
lost	O
,	O
and	O
twice	O
she	O
struck	O
upon	O
the	O
rocks	O
,	O
but	O
she	O
did	O
but	O
touch	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
clear	O

We	O
went	O
several	O
times	O
on	O
shore	O
among	O
the	O
Malayans	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
of	O
Malacca	PNM
itself	O
,	O
as	O
on	O
the	O
side	O
of	O

They	O
are	O
as	O
fierce	O
,	O
cruel	O

treacherous	O
,	O
and	O
merciless	O
a	O
crew	O
of	O

I	O
have	O
met	O
with	O
on	O
the	O

and	O
we	O
had	O
some	O
skirmishes	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
of	O
any	O
consequence	O

We	O
made	O
no	O
stay	O
anywhere	O
in	O
this	O
strait	O
but	O
just	O
for	O
fresh	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
what	O

we	O
could	O

they	O
have	O
plenty	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
variety	O
:	O
but	O
nothing	O
to	O
be	O
had	O
but	O
for	O
ready	O
money	O
;	O
which	O
our	O
men	O
took	O
so	O
unkindly	O
,	O
and	O
especially	O
their	O
offering	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
times	O
to	O
cheat	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
once	O
to	O
murder	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
afterwards	O
they	O
made	O
no	O

to	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
a	O
hundred	O
or	O
more	O
at	O
a	O
time	O

and	O
plunder	O
and	O
burn	O
what	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
carry	O
off	O
;	O
till	O
at	O
last	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
such	O
a	O
terror	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
fled	O
from	O
us	O
wherever	O
we	O
came	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
5th	O
of	O
March	O
we	O
made	O
the	O
southernmost	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
Isthmus	O
of	O
Malacca	PNM
,	O
and	O
the	O
island	O
and	O
straits	O
of	O
Sincapora	PNM

famous	O
for	O
its	O
being	O
the	O
great	O
outlet	O
into	O
the	O

and	O
lying	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
1	O
°	O
15	O
'	O
north	O
latitude	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
good	O
weather	O
through	O
these	O
straits	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
very	O
much	O
to	O
our	O
comfort	O
;	O
the	O
different	O
currents	O
and	O
number	O
of	O
little	O
islands	O
making	O
it	O
otherwise	O
very	O
dangerous	O
,	O
especially	O
to	O
strangers	O
.	O

We	O
got	O
,	O
by	O
very	O
good	O
luck	O
,	O
a	O
Dutch	O
pilot	O
to	O
carry	O
us	O
through	O
this	O
strait	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
useful	O
,	O
skilful	O
fellow	O
,	O
but	O
withal	O
so	O
impertinent	O
and	O
inquisitive	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
to	O
say	O
to	O
him	O
nor	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
him	O
;	O
at	O
last	O
he	O
grew	O
saucy	O
and	O
insolent	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
our	O
chief	O
mate	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
but	O
we	O
might	O
be	O
pirates	O
,	O
or	O
at	O
least	O
enemies	O
to	O
his	O
countrymen	O
the	O
Dutch	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
we	O
would	O
not	O
tell	O
him	O
who	O
we	O
were	O
and	O
whither	O
we	O
were	O
bound	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
pilot	O
us	O
any	O
farther	O
.	O

This	O
I	O
thought	O
very	O
insolent	O
,	O
to	O
a	O
degree	O
beyond	O
what	O
was	O
sufferable	O
;	O
and	O
bade	O
the	O
boatswain	O
put	O
a	O
halter	O
about	O
the	O
fellow	O
's	O
neck	O
,	O
and	O
tell	O
him	O
that	O
,	O
the	O
moment	O
he	O
omitted	O
to	O
direct	O
the	O
steerage	O
as	O

The	O
boatswain	O
,	O
a	O
rugged	O
fellow	O
,	O
provided	O
himself	O
with	O
a	O
halter	O
,	O
and	O
coming	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
pilot	O
,	O
asked	O
him	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
he	O
wanted	O
to	O
be	O
satisfied	O
in	O
?	O

The	O
pilot	O
said	O
he	O
desired	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
true	O
account	O
whither	O
we	O
were	O
going	O
.	O

Why	O
,	O
says	O
the	O
boatswain	O
,	O
we	O
are	O
agoing	O
to	O
the	O
devil	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
shall	O
send	O
you	O
before	O
to	O
tell	O
him	O
we	O
are	O
coming	O
;	O
and	O
with	O
that	O
he	O
pulled	O
the	O
halter	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
pocket	O
and	O
put	O
it	O
over	O
his	O

taking	O
the	O

end	O
in	O
his	O

Come	O

says	O
the	O
boatswain	O

come	O
along	O

me	O
;	O
do	O
you	O

we	O
ca	O

go	O
through	O
the	O

Sincapora	PNM
without	O
your	O

I	O

you	O

By	O
this	O
time	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
supposed	O
the	O
Dutchman	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
mortal	O
fright	O
,	O
and	O
half	O
choked	O
too	O
with	O
being	O
dragged	O
by	O
the	O
throat	O
with	O
the	O
halter	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
full	O
heartily	O
he	O
begged	O
for	O
his	O
life	O
:	O
at	O
length	O
the	O
boatswain	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
pulled	O
him	O
along	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
,	O
stopped	O
and	O
the	O
Dutchman	O
fell	O
down	O
on	O
his	O
knees	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
boatswain	O
said	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
the	O
captain	O
's	O
orders	O
to	O
hang	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
hang	O
him	O
he	O
would	O
,	O
unless	O
the	O
captain	O
recalled	O
his	O
orders	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
stay	O
so	O
long	O
,	O
if	O
anybody	O
would	O
go	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
captain	O
and	O
tell	O
him	O
what	O
the	O
Dutchman	O
said	O
,	O
and	O
bring	O
back	O
an	O
answer	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
no	O
design	O
to	O
hang	O
the	O
poor	O
fellow	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
true	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
boatswain	O
knew	O
that	O
well	O
enough	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
resolved	O
to	O
humble	O
him	O
effectually	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
sent	O
back	O
two	O
men	O
to	O
the	O
boatswain	O
,	O
the	O
first	O
was	O
to	O
tell	O
the	O
boatswain	O
aloud	O
that	O
the	O
captain	O
was	O
resolved	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
fellow	O
hanged	O
,	O
for	O
having	O
been	O
so	O
impudent	O
to	O
threaten	O
to	O
run	O
the	O
ship	O
aground	O
;	O
but	O
then	O
the	O
second	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
to	O
stay	O
a	O
little	O
behind	O
,	O
was	O
to	O
call	O
out	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
came	O
since	O
the	O
first	O
from	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
prevailed	O
with	O
to	O
pardon	O
him	O
,	O
on	O
his	O
promises	O
of	O
better	O
behaviour	O

This	O
was	O
all	O
acted	O
to	O
admiration	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
messenger	O
called	O
aloud	O
to	O
the	O
boatswain	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
captain	O
said	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
the	O
Dutchman	O
hanged	O
for	O
a	O
warning	O
to	O
all	O
pilots	O

and	O
to	O
teach	O
them	O
not	O
to	O
insult	O
men	O
when	O
they	O
are	O
in	O
difficulties	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
midwives	O
do	O
whores	O
in	O
labour	O
,	O
and	O
will	O
not	O
deliver	O
them	O
till	O
they	O
confess	O
who	O
is	O
the	O
father	O
.	O

The	O
boatswain	O
had	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
halter	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
all	O
the	O
while	O
;	O
I	O
told	O
you	O
so	O
,	O
says	O
he	O
,	O
before	O
.	O

Come	O
,	O
come	O
along	O
Mynheer	O
,	O
I	O
shall	O
quickly	O
do	O
your	O
work	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
you	O
out	O
of	O
your	O
pain	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
he	O
dragged	O
the	O
poor	O
fellow	O
along	O
to	O
the	O
main-mast	O
.	O

By	O
this	O
time	O
the	O
second	O
messenger	O
came	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
delivered	O
his	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
errand	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
the	O
poor	O
Dutchman	O
was	O
put	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
fright	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
dram	O
to	O
restore	O
him	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
did	O
his	O
business	O
very	O
honestly	O
afterwards	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
liberty	O
again	O
,	O
being	O
in	O
the	O
open	O
sea	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
impatient	O
for	O
before	O
.	O

We	O
made	O
a	O
long	O
run	O
over	O
that	O
part	O
which	O
we	O
call	O
the	O
sea	O
of	O
Borneo	PNM
,	O
and	O
the	O
upper	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
Indian	O
Arches	O
,	O
called	O
so	O
from	O
its	O
being	O
full	O
of	O
islands	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
Archipelago	O
of	O
the	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
long	O
run	O

but	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
of	O
the	O
islands	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
more	O
sea-room	O

so	O
we	O
steered	O
east	O
half	O
a	O
point	O

one	O
way	O
or	O

,	O
for	O
the	O
Manillas	O

Philippine	PNM

which	O
was	O
the	O
true	O
design	O
of	O
our	O
voyage	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O

put	O
in	O
on	O
the	O

coast	O
of	O
Borneo	PNM
for	O
fresh	O

some	O

which	O
we	O

We	O

When	O
we	O

we	O

Captain	O

who	O

sent	O
his	O

on	O

the	O

to	O
the	O
governor	O

with	O
a	O

him	O

for	O
the	O
friendship	O
which	O
was	O
between	O
their	O
most	O
Christian	O

catholic	O
majesties	O
,	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
allowed	O
the	O
freedom	O
of	O

the	O

of	O
the	O
port	O

the	O

The	O
Spanish	O
governor	O
returned	O
a	O
very	O
civil	O
and	O
obliging	O
answer	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
permitted	O
us	O
to	O
buy	O
what	O
provisions	O
we	O
pleased	O
for	O
our	O
supply	O
,	O
or	O
anything	O
else	O
for	O
our	O
use	O
;	O
but	O
added	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
for	O
allowing	O
any	O
exchange	O
of	O
merchandises	O

there	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
not	O

We	O
made	O
it	O
appear	O
as	O
if	O
this	O
answer	O
was	O
satisfactory	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
sent	O
his	O
boat	O
on	O
shore	O
with	O
all	O
French	O
sailors	O
and	O
a	O
French	O
midshipman	O

with	O
a	O
handsome	O

the	O

French	O
drugget	O

and	O
five	O
yards	O
of	O
scarlet	O
woollen-cloth	O

This	O
was	O
too	O
considerable	O
a	O
present	O
for	O
a	O
Spaniard	O
to	O
refuse	O
;	O
and	O
yet	O
these	O
were	O
all	O
European	O
goods	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
seemed	O
not	O
to	O
allow	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
shore	O

The	O
governor	O
let	O
the	O
captain	O
know	O
that	O
he	O
accepted	O
his	O
present	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
men	O
who	O
brought	O
it	O
were	O
very	O
handsomely	O
entertained	O
by	O
the	O
governor	O
's	O
order	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
every	O
one	O
a	O
small	O
piece	O
of	O
gold	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
officer	O
who	O
went	O
at	O
their	O
head	O
had	O
five	O
pieces	O
of	O
gold	O
given	O
him	O
:	O
what	O
coin	O
it	O
was	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
Japan	O
coin	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
value	O
something	O
less	O
than	O
a	O
pistole	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
the	O
governor	O
sent	O
a	O
gentleman	O
with	O
a	O
large	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
it	O
a	O
present	O
to	O
our	O

,	O
consisting	O
of	O
two	O
cows	O

ten	O
sheep	O

for	O
they	O
were	O
between	O

a	O
number	O
of	O
fowls	O
of	O
several	O

and	O
twelve	O
great	O
boxes	O
of	O
sweetmeats	O
and	O
conserves	O
;	O
all	O
of	O
which	O
were	O
indeed	O
very	O
acceptable	O
;	O
and	O
invited	O
the	O
captain	O
and	O
any	O
of	O
his	O
attendants	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
offering	O
to	O
send	O
hostages	O
on	O
board	O
for	O
our	O
safe	O
return	O
;	O
and	O
concluding	O
with	O
his	O
word	O
of	O
honour	O
for	O
our	O
safety	O
,	O
and	O
free	O
going	O
back	O
to	O
our	O
ships	O

The	O
captain	O
received	O
the	O
present	O
with	O
very	O
great	O
respect	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
noble	O
present	O
;	O
for	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
a	O
boat	O
was	O
sent	O
to	O
both	O
the	O
other	O
ships	O
with	O
provisions	O
and	O
sweetmeats	O
,	O
in	O
proportion	O
to	O
the	O
size	O
of	O
the	O
vessels	O
.	O

Our	O
captain	O
caused	O
the	O
gentleman	O
who	O
came	O
with	O
this	O
present	O
,	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
fine	O
piece	O
of	O
crimson	O
English	O
cloth	O
given	O
him	O
,	O
sufficient	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
waistcoat	O
and	O
breeches	O
of	O
their	O
fashion	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
very	O
good	O

two	O

and	O
two	O

of	O

:	O
and	O
all	O
his	O
people	O
had	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
drugget	O

them	O
sufficient	O
to	O
make	O
the	O

suit	O
of	O

;	O
the	O
persons	O
who	O
went	O
to	O
the	O

ship	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
brigantine	O
,	O
had	O
presents	O
in	O
proportion	O
.	O

This	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
was	O
neither	O
more	O
nor	O
less	O
than	O
trading	O
and	O
bartering	O
,	O
though	O
,	O
from	O
supercilious	O
punctilio	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
in	O
a	O
manner	O
been	O
denied	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
the	O
captain	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
to	O
visit	O
the	O
governor	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
him	O
several	O
of	O
our	O
officers	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
Madagascar	O
ship	O
,	O
formerly	O
my	O
second	O
mate	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
brigantine	O
.	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
go	O
myself	O
for	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
nor	O
the	O
supercargo	O
,	O
because	O
,	O
whatever	O
might	O
happen	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
reserved	O
on	O
board	O
;	O
besides	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
care	O
to	O
appear	O
in	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
business	O
.	O

The	O
captain	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
like	O
a	O
captain	O
,	O
attended	O
with	O
his	O
two	O
trumpeters	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
ship	O
firing	O
eleven	O
guns	O
at	O
his	O
going	O
off	O
.	O

The	O
governor	O
received	O
him	O
like	O
himself	O
,	O
with	O
prodigious	O
state	O
and	O
formality	O
;	O
sending	O
five	O
gentlemen	O
and	O
a	O
guard	O
of	O
soldiers	O
to	O
receive	O
him	O
and	O
his	O
men	O
at	O
their	O
landing	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
conduct	O
them	O
to	O
his	O
palace	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
came	O
there	O
they	O
were	O
entertained	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
profusion	O
and	O
magnificence	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
Spanish	O
manner	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
all	O
had	O
the	O
honour	O
to	O
dine	O
with	O
his	O
excellence	O
;	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
officers	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
the	O
men	O
were	O
entertained	O
very	O
handsomely	O
in	O
another	O
house	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
very	O
good	O
cheer	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
observed	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
but	O
very	O
little	O
wine	O
,	O
except	O
such	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
sent	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
governor	O
apologised	O
for	O
,	O
by	O
saying	O
his	O
store	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
yearly	O
from	O
New	PNM
Spain	PNM
,	O
was	O
nearly	O
spent	O
.	O

This	O
deficiency	O
we	O
supplied	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
by	O
sending	O
him	O
a	O
quarter	O
cask	O
of	O
very	O
good	O
Canary	PNM
,	O
and	O
half	O
a	O
hogshead	O
of	O
Madeira	PNM
;	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
present	O
so	O
acceptable	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
after	O
this	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
do	O
just	O
as	O
we	O
pleased	O
with	O
him	O
and	O
all	O
his	O
men	O
.	O

While	O
they	O
were	O
thus	O
conversing	O
together	O
after	O
dinner	O
,	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
was	O
made	O
to	O
understand	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
the	O
governor	O
could	O
not	O
admit	O
an	O
open	O
avowed	O
trade	O
,	O
yet	O
that	O
the	O
merchants	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
forbid	O
coming	O
on	O
board	O
our	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
trading	O
with	O
us	O
in	O
such	O
manner	O
as	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
very	O
well	O
satisfied	O
with	O
;	O
after	O
which	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
at	O
no	O
hazard	O
of	O
getting	O
the	O
goods	O
we	O
should	O
sell	O
put	O
on	O
shore	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
an	O
experiment	O
of	O
this	O
made	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
,	O
as	O
follows	O
:	O
When	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
took	O
his	O
leave	O
of	O
the	O
governor	O
,	O
he	O
invited	O
his	O
excellence	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
our	O
ship	O
,	O
with	O
such	O
of	O
his	O
attendants	O
as	O
he	O
pleased	O
to	O
bring	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
like	O
manner	O
offered	O
hostages	O
for	O
his	O
return	O
.	O

The	O
governor	O
accepted	O
the	O
invitation	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
generosity	O
,	O
said	O
he	O
would	O
take	O
his	O
parole	O
of	O
honour	O
given	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
the	O
King	O
of	O
France	PNM
's	PNM
captain	PNM
,	O
and	O
would	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

The	O
governor	O
did	O
not	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
side	O
with	O
our	O
people	O
;	O
but	O
stood	O
in	O
the	O
window	O
of	O
the	O
palace	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
them	O
the	O
compliment	O
of	O
his	O
hat	O
and	O
leg	O
at	O
their	O
going	O
into	O
their	O
boats	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
signal	O
to	O
the	O
platform	O
,	O
to	O
fire	O
eleven	O
guns	O
at	O
their	O
boats	O
putting	O
off	O
.	O

These	O
were	O
unusual	O
and	O
unexpected	O
honours	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
but	O
for	O
this	O
stratagem	O
of	O
the	O
French	O
commission	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
declared	O
enemies	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
suggested	O
to	O
me	O
here	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
with	O
great	O
ease	O
surprise	O
the	O
whole	O
island	O
,	O
nay	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
islands	O
,	O
the	O
governor	O
putting	O
such	O
confidence	O
in	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
in	O
the	O
very	O
fort	O
unsuspected	O
.	O

But	O
though	O
this	O
was	O
true	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
play	O
them	O
a	O
trick	O
at	O
the	O
Rio	PNM
de	PNM
la	PNM
Plata	PNM
,	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
bear	O
the	O
thoughts	O
of	O
it	O
here	O
;	O
besides	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
quite	O
another	O
game	O
to	O
play	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
turn	O
out	O
more	O
advantageous	O
to	O
us	O
and	O
to	O
our	O
voyage	O
,	O
than	O
an	O
enterprise	O
of	O
so	O
much	O
treachery	O
could	O
be	O
to	O
England	PNM
,	O
which	O
also	O
we	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
support	O
from	O
thence	O
,	O
before	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
might	O
beat	O
us	O
out	O
again	O
from	O
Acapulco	PNM
,	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
might	O
pass	O
our	O
time	O
ill	O
enough	O
.	O

Upon	O
the	O
whole	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
keep	O
every	O
punctilio	O
with	O
the	O
governor	O
very	O
justly	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
our	O
account	O
in	O
it	O
presently	O
.	O

About	O
three	O
days	O
afterwards	O
we	O
had	O
notice	O
that	O
the	O
governor	O
would	O
pay	O
us	O
a	O
visit	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
prepared	O
to	O
entertain	O
his	O
excellence	O
with	O
as	O
much	O
state	O
as	O
possible	O
.	O

By	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
private	O
notice	O

bring	O
with	O
him	O

lay	O
out	O

Upon	O
this	O

our	O

several	O

up	O

opened	O

upon	O
the	O

When	O

by	O

When	O
his	O

As	O
the	O
governor	O
's	O
entertainment	O
to	O
us	O
was	O
more	O
meat	O

we	O
gave	O
him	O
more	O
liquor	O

as	O
we	O
had	O
several	O

After	O

they	O

the	O

to	O

they	O

to	O
be	O

they	O
bought	O

They	O
bought	O
as	O
many	O
goods	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
as	O
they	O

the	O
value	O

the	O

no	O

anything	O

to	O
the	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
three	O
Spanish	O
merchants	O
came	O
on	O

us	O
,	O
early	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
before	O
it	O
was	O
light	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
supercargo	O

They	O
brought	O
with	O
them	O
a	O
box	O
of	O
diamonds	O

some	O
pearl	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
quantity	O
of	O
gold	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
work	O
they	O
went	O
with	O
our	O
cargo	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
thought	O
once	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
bought	O
the	O
whole	O
ship	O
's	O
loading	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
contented	O
themselves	O
to	O
buy	O
about	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
two-and-twenty	O
thousand	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
,	O
which	O
did	O
not	O
cost	O
,	O
in	O
England	PNM
,	O
one-sixth	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
money	O

We	O
had	O
some	O
difficulty	O
about	O
the	O
diamonds	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
the	O
worth	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
our	O
supercargo	O
ventured	O
upon	O
them	O
at	O
ten	O
thousand	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
the	O
rest	O
in	O
gold	O

They	O
desired	O
to	O
stay	O
on	O
board	O
till	O
the	O
next	O
night	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
soon	O
after	O
it	O
was	O
dark	O
,	O
a	O
small	O
sloop	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
and	O
took	O
in	O
all	O
their	O
goods	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
told	O
,	O
carried	O
them	O
away	O
to	O
some	O
other	O
island	O

The	O
same	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
before	O
these	O
merchants	O
were	O
gone	O

came	O
a	O
large	O
shallop	O
on	O

with	O
a	O
square	O
sail	O

towing	O
after	O
her	O
a	O
great	O
heavy	O
boat	O

which	O
had	O
a	O

seemed	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
large	O
ship	O

long-boat	O
,	O
built	O
into	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O

but	O
ill	O
masted	O
,	O
and	O
sailed	O
heavily	O

In	O
these	O
two	O
boats	O
they	O
brought	O
seven	O

of	O

some	O

In	O
short	O

the	O
merchants	O
sold	O
so	O
cheap	O
and	O
bought	O
so	O
dear	O

that	O
our	O

declared	O
he	O
would	O

would	O

them	O

by	O

he	O
had	O

the	O

one	O

Our	O

for	O

two	O

three	O

the	O

with	O

a	O

seven	O

eight	O
Chinese	O

Japanners	O
;	O
strange	O
,	O
ugly	O
,	O
ill-looking	O
fellows	O
they	O
were	O

but	O
brought	O
a	O
Spaniard	O
to	O
be	O
their	O
interpreter	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
trade	O
also	O
,	O
bringing	O
with	O
them	O
seventy	O
great	O
chests	O
of	O
China	PNM

twelve	O

of	O
several	O

some	O

very	O

We	O
dealt	O
with	O
them	O
for	O
all	O
those	O
,	O
for	O
our	O
supercargo	O
left	O
nothing	O
,	O
he	O
took	O
everything	O
they	O
brought	O

Our	O
traders	O
were	O
more	O
difficult	O
to	O
please	O
than	O
we	O
:	O
for	O
as	O
for	O
baize	O
and	O

,	O
and	O
such	O
goods	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
not	O

with	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
our	O
fine	O
cloths	O
and	O
some	O
bales	O
of	O
linen	O
they	O
bought	O
very	O
freely	O
.	O

So	O
we	O
unloaded	O
their	O
vessel	O
and	O
put	O
our	O
goods	O
on	O
board	O

We	O
took	O
a	O
good	O
sum	O
of	O
money	O
of	O
them	O

;	O
but	O
whither	O
they	O
went	O
we	O

they	O

came	O

went	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
too	O

as	O
the	O

This	O
trade	O
held	O
a	O
good	O
while	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
our	O
customers	O
came	O
more	O
from	O
other	O
islands	O
than	O
from	O
the	O
island	O
where	O
the	O
governor	O
resided	O
;	O
the	O
reason	O
of	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
understood	O
afterwards	O
,	O
was	O
,	O
because	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
governor	O
had	O
not	O
openly	O
granted	O
a	O
freedom	O
of	O
commerce	O
,	O
but	O
privately	O
winked	O
at	O
it	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
willing	O
to	O
carry	O
it	O
on	O
openly	O
before	O
his	O
face	O
,	O
or	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
say	O
,	O
under	O
his	O
nose	O
;	O
whereas	O
,	O
in	O
other	O
islands	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
convey	O
their	O
goods	O
on	O
shore	O
with	O
very	O
little	O
hazard	O
,	O
agreeing	O
with	O
the	O
custom-house	O

for	O
a	O
small	O

These	O
boats	O
came	O
and	O
went	O
thus	O
several	O
times	O
,	O
till	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
disposed	O
almost	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
cargo	O
;	O
and	O
now	O
our	O
men	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
convinced	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
laid	O
out	O
our	O
voyage	O
very	O
right	O
,	O
for	O
never	O
was	O
cargo	O
better	O
sold	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
pursue	O
our	O
voyage	O
for	O
New	PNM
Spain	PNM
,	O
we	O
had	O
taken	O
in	O
a	O
cargo	O
very	O
proper	O
to	O
sell	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
to	O
double	O
the	O
advantage	O
we	O
had	O
already	O
made	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
,	O
all	O
our	O
hands	O
were	O
at	O
work	O
to	O
store	O
ourselves	O
anew	O
,	O
with	O
such	O
provisions	O
as	O
could	O
be	O
had	O
here	O
for	O
so	O
long	O
a	O
run	O
as	O
we	O
knew	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
have	O
next	O

,	O
over	O
the	O
vast	O
Pacific	PNM
Ocean	PNM
,	PNM
or	O
South	PNM
Sea	PNM
,	O
a	O
voyage	O
where	O
we	O
might	O
expect	O
to	O
see	O
no	O
land	O
for	O
four	O
months	O
,	O
except	O
we	O
touched	O
at	O
the	O
Ladrones	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
might	O
happen	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
greatest	O
anxiety	O
was	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
which	O
our	O
whole	O
ship	O
could	O
scarce	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
stow	O
sufficient	O
for	O
our	O
use	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
want	O
of	O
casks	O
was	O
still	O
as	O
bad	O
as	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
really	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
to	O
put	O
water	O
in	O
when	O
we	O
had	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniards	O
had	O
helped	O
us	O
to	O
some	O
casks	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
many	O
;	O
those	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
spare	O
were	O
but	O
small	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
make	O
use	O
of	O
about	O
two	O
hundred	O
large	O
earthen	O
jars	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
of	O
singular	O
use	O
to	O
us	O

We	O
got	O
a	O
large	O
quantity	O
of	O
good	O
rice	O
here	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
bought	O
of	O
a	O
Chinese	O
merchant	O

who	O
came	O
in	O
here	O
with	O
a	O
large	O

Just	O
as	O
we	O

We	O
sold	O

we	O
had	O

gave	O
him	O

had	O
them	O
at	O

was	O

to	O
let	O
us	O

Had	O
more	O
of	O
these	O
merchants	O
come	O
on	O
board	O

we	O
were	O
resolved	O
to	O
have	O
laid	O
out	O
all	O

The	O
last	O
merchant	O
who	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
us	O
was	O
a	O
Spaniard	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
he	O
spoke	O
very	O
good	O
French	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
English	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
England	PNM
some	O
years	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
understood	O
English	O
woollen	O

very	O
well	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
had	O
all	O
his	O
present	O
goods	O
from	O
Acapulco	PNM
,	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
then	O
excessively	O
dear	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
considerable	O
dealings	O
with	O
the	O
Chinese	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
with	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Coromandel	PNM
and	O
Bengal	PNM
,	O
and	O
kept	O
a	O
vessel	O
or	O
two	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Bengal	PNM
,	O
which	O
generally	O
went	O
twice	O
in	O
a	O
year	O

I	O
found	O
be	O
had	O
great	O
business	O
with	O
New	PNM
Spain	PNM
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
generally	O
had	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Acapulco	O
ships	O
chiefly	O
consigned	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
full	O
of	O
all	O
such	O
goods	O
as	O
those	O
ships	O
generally	O
carried	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
Manillas	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
had	O
we	O
traded	O
with	O
him	O
sooner	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
had	O
more	O
calicoes	O

than	O
we	O
now	O
had	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
exceedingly	O
well	O
stored	O
with	O
goods	O
of	O
all	O
sorts	O
,	O
suitable	O
for	O
a	O
market	O
in	O
Peru	PNM
,	O
whither	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O

We	O
continued	O
chaffering	O
after	O
this	O
manner	O
about	O
nine	O
weeks	O
,	O
during	O
which	O
time	O
we	O
careened	O
our	O
ships	O

cleaned	O
their	O
bottoms	O
,	O
rummaged	O
our	O
gold	O

repacked	O
some	O

;	O
endeavouring	O
,	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
possible	O
,	O
to	O
keep	O
all	O
our	O
men	O
as	O
fully	O

we	O
could	O
,	O
to	O
preserve	O
them	O

the	O

Some	O
time	O
before	O
we	O
were	O
ready	O
to	O
sail	O
,	O
I	O
called	O
all	O
the	O
warrant	O
officers	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
come	O
to	O
a	O
country	O
where	O
abundance	O
of	O
small	O
things	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
bought	O
,	O
and	O
going	O
to	O
a	O
country	O
where	O
we	O
might	O
possibly	O
have	O
an	O
opportunity	O
to	O
sell	O
them	O
again	O
to	O
advantage	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
advance	O
to	O
every	O
officer	O
a	O
hundred	O
dollars	O
,	O
upon	O
account	O
of	O
their	O
pay	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
lay	O
it	O
out	O

and	O
dispose	O
of	O
it	O
again	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
New	PNM

to	O
advantage	O

This	O
was	O
very	O
acceptable	O
to	O
them	O
,	O

they	O
acknowledged	O
it	O
;	O

here	O

besides	O
this	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
consent	O
of	O
all	O
our	O
superior	O

I	O
gave	O

five	O

to	O
all	O

;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
wanted	O
no	O

we	O
did	O
not	O
at	O

we	O
changed	O

the	O

went	O
through	O
the	O
passage	O
to	O
the	O

and	O
came	O
to	O

The	O
people	O
came	O
off	O

several	O

we	O
were	O
very	O
glad	O
of	O

and	O
which	O
we	O
bought	O
the	O
more	O
of	O
because	O
we	O
always	O
found	O
that	O
such	O
things	O
were	O
good	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O

from	O
the	O

and	O
even	O
to	O
cure	O
them	O
of	O
it	O
if	O
they	O

We	O
took	O
in	O
fresh	O
water	O
here	O

it	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
question	O
meeting	O

perhaps	O

such	O
as	O
the	O

not	O
expect	O
to	O

relating	O

and	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O
a	O

out	O

either	O
east	O

I	O

would	O
be	O

if	O
they	O
were	O
searched	O
after	O
this	O
way	O
;	O
and	O
which	O
,	O
for	O
aught	O
I	O
know	O
,	O
remain	O
undiscovered	O
for	O
want	O
only	O
of	O
an	O
attempt	O
being	O
made	O
by	O
those	O
seas	O
,	O
where	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
easy	O
to	O
find	O
whether	O
the	O
Tartarian	O
seas	O
are	O
navigable	O
or	O
not	O
;	O
and	O
whether	O
Nova	PNM

be	O
an	O
island	O

joined	O
to	O
the	O
main	O
;	O
whether	O
the	O

have	O
any	O

any	O

But	O
though	O
these	O
were	O
valuable	O
discoveries	O
,	O
yet	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
cast	O
up	O
the	O
account	O
in	O
a	O
more	O
serious	O
manner	O
,	O
they	O
appeared	O
to	O
have	O
no	O
relation	O
to	O
,	O
or	O
coherence	O
with	O
,	O
our	O
intended	O
voyage	O
,	O
or	O
with	O
the	O
design	O
of	O
our	O
employers	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
consider	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
,	O
for	O
though	O
it	O
is	O
true	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
encouraged	O
to	O
make	O
all	O
such	O
kinds	O
of	O
useful	O
discoveries	O
as	O
might	O
tend	O
to	O
the	O
advantage	O
of	O
trade	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
improvement	O
of	O
geographical	O
knowledge	O
and	O
experience	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
was	O
all	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
directed	O
as	O
to	O
be	O
subservient	O
to	O
the	O
profits	O
and	O
advantages	O
of	O
a	O
trading	O
and	O
cruising	O
voyage	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
true	O
that	O
these	O
northern	O
discoveries	O
might	O
be	O
infinitely	O
great	O
,	O
and	O
most	O
glorious	O
to	O
the	O
British	O
nation	O
,	O
by	O
opening	O
new	O
sources	O
of	O
wealth	O
and	O
commerce	O
in	O
general	O
:	O
yet	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
evident	O
that	O
they	O
tended	O
directly	O
to	O
destroy	O
the	O
voyage	O
,	O
either	O
as	O
to	O
trading	O
or	O
to	O
cruising	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
perhaps	O
end	O
in	O
our	O
own	O
destruction	O
also	O
.	O

For	O
example	O
,	O
first	O
of	O
all	O
,	O
if	O
adventuring	O
into	O
those	O
northern	O
seas	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
,	O
by	O
our	O
industry	O
,	O
make	O
out	O
the	O
discovery	O

and	O
find	O
a	O
passage	O

either	O
east	O

must	O
follow	O
the	O

that	O
it	O

whenever	O

we	O

this	O

if	O

we	O

had	O
a	O

the	O

we	O
solemnly	O

-RRB-	O
;	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
,	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
were	O
for	O
steering	O
the	O
usual	O
course	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
Philippines	O
to	O
New	PNM
Spain	PNM
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
keeping	O
in	O
the	O

of	O
11	O

,	O
and	O
so	O
making	O
directly	O
for	O
California	PNM
;	O
in	O
which	O
latitude	O
they	O
proposed	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
by	O
cruising	O
thereabout	O
,	O
meet	O
with	O
the	O
Manilla	PNM
ships	O

going	O
from	O

to	O

which	O
we	O
might	O

prizes	O

and	O
then	O
stand	O
directly	O
for	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Peru	PNM

But	O
I	O
opposed	O
this	O
,	O
principally	O
because	O
it	O
would	O
effectually	O
overthrow	O
all	O
my	O
meditated	O
discoveries	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
secondly	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
had	O
observed	O

that	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
of	O
the	O
line	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
no	O

in	O

from	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
Ladrones	O

to	O
the	O
land	O
of	O
California	PNM
;	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
find	O
we	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
subsist	O
during	O
so	O
long	O
a	O
run	O
,	O
especially	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
water	O
;	O
whereas	O
,	O
on	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
line	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
within	O
the	O
tropic	O
as	O
without	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
sure	O
to	O
meet	O
with	O
islands	O
innumerable	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
even	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
sure	O
of	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
main	O
consideration	O
to	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
we	O
soon	O
resolved	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
southern	O
course	O
;	O
yet	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O

we	O
stood	O
away	O

During	O
our	O

we	O
lived	O
wholly	O

laid	O
in	O
a	O

our	O

At	O

We	O

and	O
,	O
buying	O
a	O
great	O
quantity	O
of	O
very	O
good	O
limes	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
three	O

four	O
hogsheads	O

which	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
relief	O
to	O

in	O
the	O
hot	O

,	O
to	O
mix	O
with	O
their	O
water	O

as	O
for	O

we	O
had	O
some	O

neither	O

We	O

on	O
our	O
passage	O
from	O
the	O

of	PNM
Mindora	PNM
to	O
Guam	PNM

and	O
stayed	O
six	O
days	O
at	O
the	O
latter	O
,	O
furnishing	O
ourselves	O
with	O

appearing	O
all	O
this	O
while	O
with	O
French	O
colours	O

and	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
as	O
commander	O

However	O
we	O
made	O
no	O
great	O
ceremony	O
here	O
with	O
the	O
Spanish	O
governor	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
already	O
,	O
only	O
that	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
,	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
here	O
two	O
days	O
,	O
sent	O
a	O
letter	O
to	O
him	O
by	O
a	O
French	O
officer	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
showing	O
his	O
commission	O
from	O
the	O
king	O
of	O
France	PNM
,	O
the	O
governor	O
presently	O
gave	O
us	O
product	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
leave	O
to	O
buy	O
what	O
provisions	O
we	O
wanted	O
.	O

In	O
compliment	O
for	O
this	O
civility	O
,	O
we	O
sent	O
the	O
governor	O
a	O
small	O
present	O
of	O
fine	O
scarlet	O
camlet	O
and	O
two	O
pieces	O
of	O
baize	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
made	O
a	O
very	O
handsome	O
return	O
,	O
in	O
such	O
refreshments	O
as	O
he	O
thought	O
we	O
most	O
wanted	O

There	O
was	O
another	O
reason	O
for	O
our	O
keeping	O
in	O
this	O
latitude	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
Ladrones	O

that	O

the	O

between	O
the	O

the	O

,	O
is	O
so	O
full	O
of	O
islands	O

that	O
,	O
unless	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
provided	O
with	O
very	O
good	O
pilots	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
extremely	O
hazardous	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
add	O
to	O
this	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
beyond	O
these	O
islands	O
south	O
,	O
is	O
no	O
passage	O
;	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
call	O
Nova	PNM

,	O
lying	O
away	O
east	O
and	O
east-south-east	O

farther	O

so	O
that	O
it	O

Having	O
for	O
all	O
these	O
reasons	O
gone	O
to	O
the	O
Ladrones	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
sufficiently	O

in	O
our	O

for	O
going	O

to	O
the	O

the	O
10th	O
day	O
of	O
September	O
in	O
the	O

and	O
stood	O
away	O
east-south-east	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
wind	O
north-north-west	O
,	O
a	O
fresh	O
gale	O
;	O
after	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
about	O
five	O
days	O

by	O
our	O

into	O
some	O
fit	O
of	O
wonder	O
,	O
knowing	O
nothing	O
of	O
a	O
ship	O
of	O
any	O
bulk	O
could	O
be	O
met	O
with	O
in	O
those	O
seas	O
;	O
but	O
our	O
fit	O
of	O
wonder	O
was	O
soon	O
turned	O
to	O
a	O
fit	O
of	O
laughter	O
,	O
when	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
from	O
the	O
foretop	O
,	O
cried	O
out	O
,	O
Land	O
!	O

which	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
was	O
the	O
case	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
first	O
sailor	O
was	O
sufficiently	O
laughed	O
at	O
for	O
his	O
mistake	O
,	O
though	O
,	O
giving	O
him	O
his	O
due	O
,	O
it	O
looked	O
at	O
first	O
as	O
like	O
a	O
sail	O
as	O
ever	O
any	O
land	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
could	O
look	O
.	O

Towards	O
evening	O
we	O
made	O
the	O
land	O
very	O
plain	O
,	O
distance	O
about	O
seven	O
leagues	O
south-by-east	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
an	O
island	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
vast	O
tract	O
of	O
land	O
,	O
extended	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
Gilolo	PNM
,	O
and	O
the	O
Spice	O
Islands	O
,	O
or	O
that	O
which	O
we	O
call	O
Nova	PNM
Guinea	PNM
,	O
and	O
never	O
yet	O
fully	O
discovered	O

The	O
land	O
lying	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
west-north-west	O
to	O
the	O
south-east-by-south	O
,	O
still	O
southerly	O
.	O

I	O
,	O
that	O
was	O
for	O
making	O
all	O
possible	O
discovery	O
,	O
was	O
willing	O
,	O
besides	O
the	O
convenience	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
fresh	O
provisions	O
,	O
to	O
put	O
in	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
country	O
it	O
was	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
brigantine	O
to	O
stand	O
in	O
for	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

They	O
sounded	O
,	O
but	O
found	O
no	O
ground	O
within	O
half	O
a	O
league	O
of	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
hoisted	O
out	O
their	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
close	O
in	O
with	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
found	O
good	O
anchor-hold	O
in	O
about	O
thirty-six	O
fathom	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
large	O
creek	O
,	O
or	O
mouth	O
of	O
a	O
river	O
;	O
here	O
they	O
found	O
eleven	O
to	O
thirteen	O
fathom	O
soft	O
oozy	O
sand	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
water	O
half	O
fresh	O
at	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
creek	O
.	O

Upon	O
notice	O
of	O
this	O
,	O
we	O
stood	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
all	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
in	O
the	O
very	O
creek	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
sending	O
our	O
boats	O
up	O
the	O
creek	O
,	O
found	O
the	O
water	O
perfectly	O
fresh	O
and	O
very	O
good	O
upon	O
the	O
ebb	O
,	O
about	O
a	O
league	O
up	O
the	O
river	O
.	O

Among	O
all	O
the	O
islands	O
in	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
Philippines	O
eastward	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
there	O
are	O
an	O
infinite	O
number	O
,	O
we	O
never	O
came	O
near	O
any	O
but	O
we	O
found	O
ourselves	O
surrounded	O
with	O
canoes	O
and	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
boats	O
,	O
bringing	O
off	O
to	O
us	O
cocoa-nuts	O
,	O
plantains	O
,	O
roots	O
,	O
and	O
greens	O
,	O
to	O
traffic	O
for	O
such	O
things	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
get	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
in	O
such	O
numbers	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
tired	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
alarmed	O
,	O
and	O
obliged	O
to	O
fire	O
at	O
them	O
.	O

But	O
here	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
saw	O
great	O
numbers	O
of	O
people	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
saw	O
not	O
one	O
boat	O
or	O
bark	O
,	O
nor	O
anything	O
else	O
upon	O
the	O
water	O
.	O

We	O
stayed	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
taking	O
in	O
fresh	O
water	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O
restrain	O
our	O
men	O
from	O
going	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
sort	O
of	O
a	O
country	O
it	O
was	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
willing	O
they	O
should	O
do	O
so	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
two	O
of	O
our	O
boats	O
,	O
with	O
about	O
thirty	O
men	O
in	O
both	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
creek	O
or	O
harbour	O
where	O
our	O
ship	O
lay	O
.	O

They	O
found	O
the	O
country	O
looked	O
wild	O
and	O
savage	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
could	O
find	O
no	O
houses	O
,	O
or	O
speak	O
with	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
they	O
saw	O
their	O
footsteps	O
and	O
their	O
seats	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
sat	O
down	O
under	O
some	O
trees	O
;	O
and	O
after	O
wandering	O
about	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
they	O
saw	O
people	O
,	O
both	O
men	O
and	O
women	O
,	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
ran	O
away	O
from	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
at	O
first	O
sight	O
,	O
like	O
frightened	O
deer	O
;	O
nor	O
could	O
they	O
make	O
any	O
signal	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
understood	O
;	O
for	O
when	O
our	O
men	O
hallooed	O
and	O
called	O
after	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
ran	O
again	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
bewitched	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
gathered	O
a	O
great	O
variety	O
of	O
green	O
stuff	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
knew	O
not	O
of	O
what	O
kind	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
it	O
all	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
eat	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
some	O
we	O
boiled	O
and	O
made	O
broth	O
of	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
the	O
scurvy	O
,	O
found	O
it	O
did	O
them	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
good	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
herbs	O
were	O
of	O
a	O
spicy	O
kind	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
most	O
pleasant	O
agreeable	O
taste	O
:	O
but	O
none	O
of	O
us	O
could	O
tell	O
what	O
to	O
call	O
them	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
several	O
men	O
on	O
board	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
among	O
the	O
Spice	O
Islands	O
before	O
in	O
Dutch	O
ships	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
very	O
uneasy	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
get	O
nothing	O
here	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
grass	O
and	O
potherbs	O
,	O
as	O
our	O
men	O
called	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
men	O
importuned	O
me	O
to	O
let	O
them	O
have	O
two	O
boats	O
,	O
and	O
go	O
up	O
the	O
river	O
as	O
high	O
as	O
the	O
tide	O
would	O
carry	O
them	O
;	O
this	O
I	O
consented	O
to	O
,	O
being	O
as	O
willing	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
discovery	O
as	O
they	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
Madagascar	O
ship	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
been	O
formerly	O
my	O
second	O
mate	O
,	O
to	O
go	O
along	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

But	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
a	O
little	O
before	O
the	O
flood	O
was	O
made	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
called	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
cabin	O
to	O
see	O
an	O
army	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
coming	O
to	O
attack	O
us	O
.	O

I	O
turned	O
out	O
hastily	O
enough	O
,	O
as	O
may	O
be	O
easily	O
conjectured	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
an	O
army	O
appeared	O
as	O
no	O
ship	O
was	O
ever	O
attacked	O
with	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
spied	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
hundred	O
black	O
creatures	O
,	O
come	O
playing	O
and	O
tumbling	O
down	O
the	O
stream	O
towards	O
us	O
,	O
like	O
so	O
many	O
porpoises	O
in	O
the	O
water	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
not	O
satisfied	O
at	O
first	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
human	O
creatures	O
,	O
but	O
would	O
have	O
persuaded	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
sea-monsters	O
,	O
or	O
fishes	O
of	O
some	O
strange	O
kind	O
.	O

But	O
they	O
quickly	O
undeceived	O
us	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
came	O
swimming	O
about	O
our	O
ships	O
,	O
staring	O
and	O
wondering	O
and	O
calling	O
to	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
but	O
said	O
not	O
one	O
word	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
did	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
understand	O
them	O
.	O

Some	O
of	O
them	O
came	O
very	O
near	O
our	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
venture	O
.	O

We	O
tossed	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
a	O
rope	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
took	O
hold	O
of	O
it	O
boldly	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
offered	O
to	O
pull	O
,	O
he	O
let	O
go	O
,	O
and	O
laughed	O
at	O
us	O
;	O
another	O
of	O
them	O
did	O
the	O
like	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
he	O
let	O
go	O
,	O
turned	O
up	O
his	O
black	O
buttocks	O
,	O
as	O
in	O
sport	O
at	O
us	O
;	O
the	O
language	O
of	O
which	O
,	O
in	O
our	O
country	O
,	O
we	O
all	O
knew	O
,	O
but	O
whether	O
it	O
had	O
the	O
same	O
meaning	O
here	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
a	O
loss	O
to	O
know	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
this	O
dumb	O
manner	O
of	O
conversing	O
with	O
them	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
like	O
,	O
neither	O
was	O
it	O
to	O
any	O
purpose	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
resolved	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
to	O
know	O
something	O
more	O
of	O
them	O
than	O
we	O
could	O
get	O
thus	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
ordered	O
out	O
our	O
pinnace	O
with	O
six	O
oars	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
many	O
other	O
men	O
well	O
armed	O
,	O
to	O
row	O
among	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
to	O
take	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
and	O
bring	O
them	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

They	O
went	O
off	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
six-oar	O
pinnace	O
,	O
though	O
a	O
very	O
nimble	O
boat	O
,	O
could	O
not	O
row	O
so	O
fast	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
swim	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
if	O
pulling	O
with	O
all	O
their	O
might	O
,	O
they	O
came	O
near	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
immediately	O
,	O
like	O
dog	O
and	O
duck	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
dive	O
,	O
and	O
come	O
up	O
again	O
thirty	O
or	O
forty	O
yards	O
off	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
our	O
men	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
which	O
way	O
to	O
row	O
after	O
them	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
at	O
last	O
getting	O
among	O
the	O
thickest	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
got	O
hold	O
of	O
two	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
some	O
difficulty	O
dragged	O
them	O
in	O
;	O
but	O
think	O
of	O
our	O
surprise	O
,	O
to	O
find	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
men	O
,	O
but	O
both	O
young	O
women	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
brought	O
on	O
board	O
naked	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
they	O
should	O
have	O
two	O
pieces	O
of	O
linen	O
wrapped	O
round	O
their	O
waists	O
to	O
cover	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
seemed	O
well	O
pleased	O
with	O
.	O

We	O
gave	O
them	O
also	O
several	O
strings	O
of	O
beads	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
tied	O
them	O
about	O
their	O
necks	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
their	O
arms	O
like	O
bracelets	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
wonderfully	O
delighted	O
with	O
their	O
ornaments	O
.	O

Others	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
gave	O
each	O
of	O
them	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
scissors	O
,	O
with	O
needles	O
and	O
some	O
thread	O
,	O
and	O
threading	O
the	O
needles	O
,	O
showed	O
them	O
how	O
to	O
sew	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
we	O
also	O
gave	O
them	O
food	O
,	O
and	O
each	O
of	O
them	O
a	O
dram	O
of	O
arrack	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
know	O
of	O
them	O
where	O
they	O
lived	O
;	O
they	O
pointed	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
could	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
understand	O
them	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
dressed	O
them	O
up	O
thus	O
with	O
necklaces	O
,	O
and	O
bracelets	O
,	O
and	O
linen	O
,	O
we	O
brought	O
them	O
up	O
upon	O
the	O
deck	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
them	O
call	O
to	O
their	O
country	O
folk	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
them	O
see	O
how	O
well	O
they	O
were	O
used	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
girls	O
beckoned	O
them	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
venture	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
thought	O
the	O
discovery	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
make	O
,	O
would	O
be	O
something	O
the	O
easier	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
usage	O
of	O
these	O
two	O
young	O
women	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
guessed	O
,	O
above	O
twenty	O
or	O
two-and-twenty	O
years	O
of	O
age	O
;	O
we	O
resolved	O
that	O
the	O
boat	O
should	O
go	O
on	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
intended	O
,	O
up	O
the	O
river	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
two	O
women	O
pointed	O
that	O
way	O
,	O
we	O

carry	O
them	O
along	O
with	O
us	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
we	O
sent	O
two	O
shallops	O
,	O
or	O
large	O
boats	O
,	O
which	O
carried	O
together	O
sixty	O
men	O
,	O
all	O
well	O
armed	O
.	O

We	O
gave	O
them	O
store	O
of	O
beads	O
and	O
knives	O
and	O
scissors	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
baubles	O
with	O
them	O

with	O
hatchets	O
and	O
nails	O
,	O
and	O
hooks	O
,	O
looking-glasses	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
like	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
built	O
up	O
the	O
sides	O
and	O
sterns	O
of	O
the	O
boats	O
,	O
and	O
covered	O
them	O
with	O
boards	O
,	O
to	O
keep	O
off	O
arrows	O
and	O
darts	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
should	O
find	O
occasion	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
looked	O
like	O
London	PNM
barges	O

In	O
this	O
posture	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
tide	O
or	O
flood	O
was	O
made	O
up	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
went	O
away	O
,	O
carrying	O
a	O
drum	O
and	O
a	O
trumpet	O
in	O
each	O
boat	O
;	O
and	O
each	O
boat	O
had	O
also	O
two	O

or	O
small	O
cannon	O
,	O
fixed	O
on	O
the	O
gunnel	O
near	O
the	O
bow	O

Thus	O
furnished	O
,	O
they	O
went	O
off	O
about	O
eleven	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
forenoon	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
my	O
very	O
great	O
uneasiness	O
,	O
I	O
heard	O
no	O
more	O
of	O
them	O
for	O
four	O
days	O
.	O

The	O
whole	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O
were	O
indeed	O
surprised	O
at	O
their	O
stay	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
sloop	O
would	O
fain	O
have	O
had	O
me	O
let	O
him	O
have	O
sailed	O
up	O
the	O
river	O
with	O
the	O
sloop	O
,	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
channel	O
would	O
serve	O
;	O
which	O
really	O
we	O
found	O
was	O
deep	O
enough	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
unwilling	O
to	O
run	O
any	O
more	O
risks	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
persuade	O
myself	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
force	O
I	O
had	O
already	O
sent	O
was	O
sufficient	O
to	O
fight	O
five	O
thousand	O
naked	O
creatures	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
natives	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
unwilling	O
to	O
send	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
consented	O
at	O
last	O
to	O
have	O
our	O
long-boat	O
and	O
two	O
smaller	O
boats	O
manned	O
with	O
fifty-four	O
men	O
more	O
,	O
very	O
well	O
armed	O
,	O
and	O
covered	O
from	O
arrows	O
and	O

as	O
the	O
other	O
had	O
been	O
,	O
to	O
go	O
up	O
the	O

upon	O
their	O
solemn	O

with	O

to	O

the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
at	O
farthest	O
;	O
ordering	O
them	O
to	O
fire	O
guns	O
as	O
they	O
went	O
up	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
to	O
give	O
notice	O
to	O
their	O
fellows	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
be	O
heard	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
coming	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
fired	O
three	O
guns	O
they	O
should	O
immediately	O
return	O
.	O

They	O
went	O
away	O
with	O
the	O
tide	O
of	O
flood	O
,	O
a	O
little	O
before	O
noon	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
up	O
the	O
river	O
about	O
five	O
leagues	O
,	O
the	O
tide	O
running	O
but	O
slowly	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
strong	O
fresh	O
of	O
land-water	O
that	O
checked	O
the	O
current	O
coming	O
down	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
when	O
the	O
tide	O
was	O
spent	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
.	O

They	O
found	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
contrary	O
to	O
their	O
expectation	O
,	O
continued	O
both	O
deep	O
enough	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
wider	O
in	O
breadth	O
than	O
where	O
the	O
ships	O
were	O
at	O
anchor	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
had	O
another	O
mouth	O
or	O
outlet	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
some	O
leagues	O
farther	O

so	O
that	O
the	O

the	O
east	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
where	O
our	O
men	O
went	O
on	O

was	O

an	O
island	O

had	O
not	O
many	O

if	O

the	O

As	O

found	O
they	O
could	O
go	O
no	O
farther	O
for	O

of	O
the	O
tide	O
,	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O

to	O
an	O
anchor	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
just	O
as	O
they	O
were	O

to	O

what	O

they	O

what	O

a	O

at	O

It	O
must	O

that	O
all	O

they	O

any	O

that	O

some	O

After	O

then	O
pointing	O
with	O
the	O

to	O
what	O
the	O
Indians	O
carried	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
his	O

intimating	O
that	O
we	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
presently	O
understood	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
threw	O
himself	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
holding	O
a	O
bundle	O
of	O
plants	O

such	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
trussed	O
up	O
together	O

upon	O
his	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
swimming	O
with	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
came	O
so	O
near	O
the	O
boat	O

where	O
our	O

held	O
out	O
the	O
staff	O

as	O
to	O
reach	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
staff	O

take	O
off	O
the	O

for	O
it	O
was	O
not	O

upon	O
the	O
hook	O

went	O

When	O
he	O
was	O

on	O

all	O
his	O

came	O
about	O
him	O

what	O

;	O
he	O
hung	O
the	O
string	O

round	O
his	O

and	O
ran	O
dancing	O
about	O

in	O

as	O
if	O

What	O
our	O

got	O
was	O
a	O

of	O
less	O

than	O
a	O
good	O
bunch	O
of	O
carrots	O
in	O
England	PNM

but	O
yet	O
it	O
was	O

it	O
brought	O
the	O

to	O

with	O
us	O
;	O
for	O

they	O

By	O

which	O

that	O
which	O

was	O
a	O

sort	O
of	O
maize	O

some	O

that	O

that	O

as	O
I	O

with	O

Our	O

some	O
of	O
them	O
stark	O
naked	O

both	O

I	O
thought	O
they	O

in	O
their	O
countenances	O
from	O
all	O
the	O
wild	O

I	O
ever	O

that	O

a	O
token	O
of	O

and	O
our	O

us	O

that	O
they	O

In	O
a	O

was	O
on	O

which	O
our	O

met	O
before	O
the	O

down	O

But	O
all	O
the	O

from	O

in	O
seven	O

twenty	O

when	O
on	O
a	O

whether	O

We	O
went	O
on	O
two	O

three	O
days	O
more	O
,	O
our	O
course	O
south-east	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
made	O
land	O
again	O
;	O
but	O
found	O
it	O
only	O
to	O

two	O

lying	O
south	O
and	O
by	O
east	O

We	O
stood	O
on	O

them	O

two	O
of	O
our	O

went	O
on	O

The	O

that	O

,	O
varying	O
our	O

ran	O
with	O

we	O
lay	O
by	O

in	O

We	O
now	O
hoisted	O
our	O
boat	O
out	O

and	O
sent	O
it	O
on	O
shore	O
for	O
discoveries	O

to	O

for	O
a	O

Our	O
people	O
went	O
quite	O
in	O
with	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
found	O
several	O
men	O
and	O
women	O
crowded	O
together	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
us	O

When	O
our	O
men	O
came	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
land	O
they	O
hung	O
out	O
a	O
white	O
flag	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
wild	O
people	O
understood	O
nothing	O
of	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
stood	O
looking	O
and	O
amazed	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
have	O
great	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
they	O
never	O
had	O
seen	O
any	O
ship	O
or	O
bark	O
of	O
any	O
nation	O
before	O

We	O
found	O
on	O
our	O
landing	O

no	O
boats	O

or	O
anything	O
they	O
had	O
to	O
make	O

of	O
on	O
the	O
water	O
;	O
but	O
some	O
days	O
after	O
we	O
saw	O
several	O
small	O
canoes	O
,	O
with	O
three	O

four	O
men	O
in	O
each	O

Our	O

not	O

them	O
to	O
understand	O

or	O
to	O

what	O
was	O
said	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
they	O
did	O
,	O
was	O
to	O
make	O
signs	O
to	O
them	O
for	O
something	O
to	O
eat	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
three	O
of	O
them	O
seemed	O
to	O
go	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
coming	O
again	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
,	O
brought	O
with	O

several	O

some	O

some	O

and	O
laid	O
down	O
all	O
upon	O
the	O
coast	O

Our	O
men	O
took	O
courage	O
then	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
taking	O
up	O
what	O
they	O
brought	O
,	O
set	O
up	O
a	O
stick	O
,	O
and	O
upon	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
it	O
hung	O
five	O
bunches	O

strings	O
of	O
blue	O

white	O
beads	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
on	O

Never	O
was	O
such	O
joy	O
among	O
a	O
wild	O
people	O
discovered	O
,	O
as	O
these	O
natives	O
showed	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
took	O
the	O
beads	O
off	O
the	O
stick	O
;	O
they	O
danced	O
and	O
capered	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
thousand	O
antic	O
gestures	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
inviting	O
our	O
men	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
laid	O
their	O
hands	O
upon	O
their	O
breasts	O
across	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
looked	O
up	O
,	O
intimating	O
a	O
solemn	O
oath	O
not	O
to	O
hurt	O
us	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
made	O
signs	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
they	O
made	O
them	O
understand	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
come	O
again	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
also	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
bring	O
us	O
more	O
eatables	O
;	O
accordingly	O
,	O
we	O
sent	O
three	O
boats	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
carried	O
knives	O

any	O

not	O

glass	O

and	O
glass	O
ear-rings	O
in	O
abundance	O

The	O
Indians	O
were	O
very	O
ready	O
to	O
meet	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
us	O
fruits	O
and	O
herbs	O
as	O
before	O
;	O
but	O
three	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
who	O
stood	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
held	O
each	O
of	O
them	O
a	O
creature	O
exactly	O
like	O
a	O
goat	O
,	O
but	O
without	O
horns	O
or	O
beard	O
;	O
and	O
these	O
were	O
brought	O
to	O
traffick	O
with	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
brought	O
out	O
our	O
goods	O
,	O
and	O
offered	O
every	O
one	O
something	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
variety	O
was	O
surprising	O
to	O
them	O
who	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
such	O
things	O
before	O
.	O

But	O
that	O
which	O
was	O
most	O
valuable	O
of	O
all	O
our	O
things	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
hatchet	O
,	O
which	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
principal	O
men	O
took	O
up	O
and	O
looked	O
at	O
it	O
,	O
felt	O
the	O
edge	O
,	O
and	O
laid	O
it	O
down	O
;	O
then	O
took	O
it	O
up	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
wanted	O
to	O
know	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
it	O
:	O
upon	O
which	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
took	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
stepping	O
to	O
a	O
tree	O
that	O
stood	O
near	O
,	O
cut	O
off	O
a	O
small	O
bough	O
of	O
it	O
at	O
one	O
blow	O
.	O

The	O
man	O
was	O
surprised	O
,	O
and	O
ran	O
to	O
the	O
tree	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
he	O
could	O
do	O
the	O
same	O
,	O
and	O
finding	O
he	O
could	O
,	O
he	O
laid	O
it	O
down	O

ran	O
with	O
all	O
his	O
might	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
by-and-by	O
returning	O
,	O
came	O
with	O
two	O
men	O
more	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
to	O
show	O
them	O
this	O
wonderful	O
thing	O
,	O
a	O
hatchet	O
.	O

But	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
surprised	O
with	O
the	O
novelty	O
of	O
a	O
hatchet	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
were	O
as	O
much	O
surprised	O
to	O
see	O
hanging	O
round	O
the	O
ears	O
of	O
both	O
the	O
men	O
that	O
he	O
brought	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
large	O
flat	O
pieces	O
of	O
pure	O
gold	O
.	O

The	O
thread	O
which	O
they	O
hung	O
by	O
was	O
made	O
of	O
the	O
hair	O
of	O
the	O
goats	O
,	O
twisted	O
very	O
prettily	O
together	O
and	O
very	O
strong	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
offering	O
to	O
handle	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
gold	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
took	O
off	O
his	O
two	O
gold	O
bobs	O
,	O
and	O
offered	O
them	O
to	O
our	O
men	O
for	O
the	O
hatchet	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
seemed	O
to	O
make	O
much	O
difficulty	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
the	O
hatchet	O
was	O
of	O
much	O
greater	O
value	O
than	O
those	O
trifles	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
he	O
,	O
being	O
as	O
we	O
found	O
,	O
superior	O
,	O
made	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
who	O
came	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
pull	O
off	O
his	O
two	O
ear-jewels	O
also	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
our	O
unreasonable	O
people	O
took	O
them	O
all	O
four	O
,	O
being	O
of	O
pure	O
gold	O
,	O
and	O
weighing	O
together	O
some	O
grains	O
above	O
two	O
ounces	O
,	O
in	O
exchange	O
for	O
an	O
old	O
rusty	O
hatchet	O
.	O

However	O
unreasonable	O
the	O
price	O
was	O
,	O
the	O
purchaser	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
it	O
so	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
over-fond	O
was	O
he	O
of	O
the	O
hatchet	O
,	O
that	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
it	O
for	O
his	O
own	O
,	O
he	O
ran	O
to	O
the	O
tree	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
had	O
so	O
laid	O
about	O
him	O
with	O
the	O
hatchet	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
twig	O
left	O
on	O
it	O
that	O
was	O
within	O
his	O
reach	O
.	O

This	O
exchange	O
was	O
a	O
particular	O
hint	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
presently	O
directly	O
my	O
chief	O

Captain	O

to	O
go	O
on	O

the	O
next	O

and	O
acquaint	O
themselves	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
they	O

with	O
the	O

if	O

to	O

out	O

this	O
gold	O

to	O

Captain	O
Merlotte	O
and	O
my	O

bestowed	O
their	O
time	O
so	O
well	O

and	O
obliged	O
the	O
natives	O
so	O
much	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
toys	O
and	O
trifles	O
they	O
gave	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
presently	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
the	O
gold	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
called	O
Aarah	PNM
,	O
was	O
picked	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
rivers	O
that	O
came	O
down	O
from	O
a	O
mountain	O
which	O
they	O
pointed	O
to	O
,	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
off	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
prevailed	O
with	O
three	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
them	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
rivers	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
them	O
beads	O
and	O
such	O
things	O
to	O
encourage	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
no	O
hatchet	O
;	O
that	O
was	O
kept	O
up	O
at	O
a	O
high	O
rate	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
a	O
rarity	O
fit	O
only	O
for	O
a	O
king	O
,	O
or	O
some	O
great	O
man	O
who	O
wore	O
Aarah	O
on	O
his	O
ears	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
river	O
where	O
they	O
said	O
they	O
found	O
this	O
Aarah	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
our	O
men	O
observed	O
there	O
,	O
was	O
an	O
Indian	O
sitting	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
beating	O
something	O
upon	O
a	O
great	O
stone	O
,	O
with	O
another	O
stone	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
for	O
his	O
hammer	O
:	O
they	O
went	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
he	O
was	O
doing	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
he	O
had	O
got	O
a	O
lump	O
of	O
gold	O
from	O
the	O
sand	O
,	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
a	O
swan-shot	O
,	O
of	O
no	O
regular	O
shape	O
,	O
but	O
full	O
of	O
corners	O
,	O
neither	O
round	O
nor	O
square	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
man	O
was	O
beating	O
it	O
flat	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
he	O
could	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
a	O
hatchet	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
,	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
him	O
to	O
let	O
him	O
flatten	O
it	O
for	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
turning	O
the	O
back	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
hatchet	O
,	O
which	O
served	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O
a	O
hammer	O
,	O
he	O
beat	O
the	O
piece	O
of	O
gold	O
flat	O
in	O
an	O
instant	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
turning	O
it	O
upon	O
the	O
edge	O
,	O
beat	O
it	O
that	O
way	O
until	O
he	O
brought	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
round	O
also	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
so	O
surprising	O
to	O
the	O
man	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
beating	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
stood	O
looking	O
on	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
tokens	O
of	O
joy	O
and	O
amazement	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
desiring	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
hatchet	O
,	O
looked	O
this	O
way	O
and	O
that	O
way	O
,	O
upon	O
those	O
of	O
his	O

who	O
came	O
with	O
us	O

as	O
if	O

them	O

When	O
our	O
man	O
had	O
done	O

he	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
know	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
any	O
more	O
Aarah	O
;	O
the	O
man	O
said	O
nothing	O
,	O
but	O
went	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
brink	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
putting	O
his	O
hand	O
into	O
a	O
hole	O
,	O
he	O
brought	O
out	O
three	O
little	O
lumps	O
of	O
gold	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
smaller	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
about	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
a	O
large	O
pin	O
's	O
head	O
;	O
all	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
laid	O
up	O
there	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
hollow	O
of	O
a	O
stone	O
.	O

Our	O
man	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
much	O
,	O
to	O
take	O
all	O
that	O
for	O
the	O
hatchet	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
pulled	O
out	O
some	O
beads	O

and	O
pieces	O
of	O
glass	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
toys	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
short	O

bought	O
all	O
this	O
cargo	O
of	O
gold	O
,	O
which	O
in	O
the	O
whole	O
weighed	O
near	O
five	O
ounces	O
,	O
for	O
about	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
two	O

rather	O
where	O
it	O

I	O
employed	O
myself	O
to	O
be	O
fully	O
informed	O
where	O
this	O

was	O

whether	O
it	O
was	O
an	O

having	O
found	O
a	O
tolerable	O
good	O
road	O
for	O
our	O
ships	O
to	O
ride	O
in	O
,	O
I	O
caused	O
my	O
two	O
shallops	O
,	O
well	O
manned	O
,	O
to	O
run	O
along	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
both	O
east	O

,	O
to	O
find	O
which	O
way	O
it	O
lay	O

and	O
whether	O
they	O
could	O
find	O
any	O
end	O
of	O

as	O
also	O
to	O

what	O
rivers	O

what	O
people	O

and	O
what	O
provisions	O
they	O
could	O
meet	O
with	O
.	O

By	O
my	O
observation	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
27	O

south	O

While	O
my	O
shallops	O
were	O
gone	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
my	O
men	O
set	O
up	O
tents	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
for	O
the	O
convenience	O
of	O
their	O
traffick	O

as	O
for	O
their	O
resting	O
on	O
shore	O
all	O
night	O
;	O
keeping	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
a	O
good	O
guard	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
two	O
of	O
our	O
ship	O
's	O
dogs	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
who	O
never	O
failed	O
giving	O
them	O
notice	O
,	O
whenever	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
came	O
near	O
them	O
;	O
for	O
what	O
ailed	O
the	O
dogs	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
,	O
but	O
neither	O
of	O
them	O
could	O
bear	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
much	O
to	O
do	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
from	O
flying	O
at	O
them	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
rode	O
here	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
most	O
violent	O
storm	O
of	O
wind	O
with	O
rain	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
great	O
claps	O
of	O
thunder	O

that	O
we	O
had	O
yet	O
sustained	O
since	O
we	O
came	O
out	O
of	O
England	PNM
.	O

It	O
was	O
our	O
comfort	O
that	O
the	O
wind	O
came	O
off	O
shore	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
blew	O
at	O
south	O

and	O
shifting	O
between	O
the	O

with	O
such	O

so	O

and	O
withal	O
,	O
not	O
only	O
by	O
squalls	O
and	O
sudden	O

but	O
a	O
settled	O
terrible	O
tempest	O

that	O
had	O
it	O

from	O
off	O
sea	O

as	O
it	O
was	O
off	O

we	O

and	O
even	O
as	O
it	O

we	O
rode	O
in	O
great	O
danger	O

My	O
boatswain	O
called	O
out	O
twice	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
cut	O
my	O
masts	O
by	O
the	O
board	O
,	O
protesting	O
we	O
should	O
either	O
bring	O
our	O

home	O
,	O
or	O
founder	O
as	O
we	O
rode	O
;	O
and	O
indeed	O
the	O
sea	O
broke	O
over	O
us	O
many	O
times	O
in	O
a	O
terrible	O
manner	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
said	O
before	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
an	O
indifferent	O
good	O
road	O

and	O
so	O
we	O
had	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
one	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
land	O
was	O
low	O
;	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
east	O
we	O
lay	O
a	O
little	O
open	O

However	O
,	O
our	O
ground-tackle	O
was	O
good	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
ship	O
very	O
tight	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
told	O
the	O
boatswain	O
I	O
would	O
rather	O
slip	O
the	O
cable	O
and	O
go	O
off	O
to	O
sea	O
than	O
cut	O
the	O
masts	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
in	O
about	O
four	O
hours	O
'	O
time	O
more	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
wind	O
abate	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
blew	O
very	O
hard	O
for	O
three	O
days	O
after	O

I	O
was	O
in	O
great	O
pain	O
for	O
my	O
two	O
shallops	O
in	O
this	O
tempest	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
had	O
both	O
the	O
good	O
luck	O
to	O
lie	O
close	O
under	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
and	O
one	O
indeed	O
had	O
hauled	O
quite	O
upon	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
men	O
lay	O
on	O
shore	O
under	O
their	O
sail	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
got	O
no	O
damage	O
;	O
and	O
about	O
three	O
days	O
after	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
returned	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
me	O
word	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
made	O
very	O
little	O
discovery	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
situation	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
or	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
an	O
island	O
or	O
a	O
continent	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
had	O
conversed	O
with	O
the	O
natives	O
very	O
often	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
several	O
who	O
had	O
pieces	O
of	O
gold	O
hanging	O
,	O
some	O
in	O
their	O
hair	O
,	O
some	O
about	O
their	O
necks	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
made	O
a	O
shift	O
to	O
bring	O
as	O
many	O
with	O
them	O
as	O
weighed	O
,	O
all	O
put	O
together	O
,	O
seventeen	O
or	O
eighteen	O
ounces	O
,	O
for	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
bartered	O
toys	O
and	O
trifles	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
did	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
found	O
no	O
rivers	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
could	O
discover	O
any	O
gold	O
in	O
the	O
sands	O
,	O
as	O
We	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
believed	O
it	O
all	O
came	O
from	O
the	O
side	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
.	O

But	O
our	O
other	O
shallop	O
had	O
much	O
better	O
luck	O
;	O
she	O
went	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
east	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
time	O
she	O
had	O
gone	O
about	O
sixteen	O
leagues	O
she	O
found	O
the	O
shore	O
break	O
off	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
after	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
,	O
until	O
at	O
length	O
they	O
came	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
to	O
the	O
land	O
's	O
end	O
;	O
when	O
,	O
the	O
shore	O
running	O
due	O
south	O
,	O
they	O
followed	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
their	O
account	O
,	O
near	O
thirteen	O
leagues	O
more	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
interval	O
they	O
went	O
several	O
times	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
entered	O
three	O
rivers	O
,	O
indifferently	O
large	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
very	O
large	O
at	O
the	O
mouth	O
,	O
but	O
grew	O
narrow	O
again	O
in	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
leagues	O
;	O
but	O
a	O
deep	O
channel	O
,	O
with	O
two-and-twenty	O
to	O
eight-and-twenty	O
fathom	O
water	O
in	O
it	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
they	O
went	O
.	O

Here	O
they	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
and	O
trafficked	O
with	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
whom	O
they	O
found	O
rude	O
and	O
unpolished	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
very	O
mild	O
inoffensive	O
people	O
;	O
nor	O
did	O
they	O
find	O
them	O
anything	O
thievish	O
,	O
much	O
less	O
treacherous	O
,	O
as	O
in	O
some	O
countries	O
is	O
the	O
case	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
the	O
good	O
luck	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
supposed	O
,	O
the	O
king	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
resided	O
;	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
city	O
,	O
encompassed	O
all	O
round	O
,	O
the	O
river	O
making	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
double	O
horse-shoe	O
.	O

The	O
manner	O
of	O
their	O
living	O
is	O
too	O
long	O
to	O
describe	O
;	O
neither	O
could	O
our	O
men	O
give	O
any	O
account	O
of	O
their	O
government	O
,	O
or	O
of	O
the	O
customs	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
;	O
but	O
what	O
they	O
sought	O
for	O
was	O
gold	O
and	O
provisions	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
those	O
they	O
got	O
pretty	O
considerable	O
quantities	O
.	O

They	O
found	O
the	O
Indians	O
terribly	O
surprised	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
sight	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
after	O
some	O
time	O
they	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
let	O
them	O
know	O
they	O
desired	O
a	O
truce	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
understand	O
what	O
they	O
meant	O
by	O
it	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
a	O
truce	O
being	O
established	O
,	O
the	O
king	O
came	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
him	O
near	O
three	O
hundred	O
men	O
;	O
and	O
soon	O
after	O
the	O
queen	O
,	O
with	O
half	O
as	O
many	O
women	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
not	O
stark	O
naked	O
,	O
neither	O
men	O
nor	O
women	O
,	O
but	O
wearing	O
a	O
loose	O
piece	O
of	O
cloth	O
about	O
their	O
middles	O
;	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
made	O
of	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
imagine	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
neither	O
linen	O
or	O
woollen	O
,	O
cotton	O
or	O
silk	O
;	O
nor	O
was	O
it	O
woven	O
,	O
but	O
twisted	O
and	O
braided	O
by	O
hand	O
,	O
as	O
our	O
women	O
make	O
bone	O
lace	O
with	O
bobbins	O
.	O

It	O
seems	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
stalk	O
of	O
an	O
herb	O
,	O
which	O
this	O
was	O
made	O
with	O
;	O
and	O
was	O
so	O
strong	O
that	O
I	O
doubt	O
not	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
made	O
cables	O
for	O
our	O
ships	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
wanted	O
to	O
make	O
such	O
an	O
experiment	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
king	O
first	O
came	O
to	O
our	O
men	O
they	O
were	O
a	O
little	O
shy	O
of	O
his	O
company	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
so	O
many	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
began	O
to	O
retire	O
;	O
which	O
the	O
king	O
perceiving	O
,	O
he	O
caused	O
all	O
his	O
men	O
to	O
stop	O
,	O
and	O
keep	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
;	O
and	O
advanced	O
himself	O
with	O
about	O
ten	O
or	O
twelve	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
no	O
more	O
.	O

When	O
he	O
was	O
come	O
quite	O
up	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
to	O
show	O
their	O
breeding	O
,	O
pulled	O
off	O
their	O
hats	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
,	O
for	O
his	O
men	O
had	O
no	O
hats	O
on	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
officer	O
making	O
a	O
bow	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
understood	O
that	O
presently	O
,	O
and	O
bowed	O
again	O
;	O
at	O
which	O
all	O
his	O
men	O
fell	O
down	O
flat	O
upon	O
their	O
faces	O
,	O
as	O
flat	O
to	O
the	O
ground	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
shot	O
to	O
death	O
with	O
a	O
volley	O
of	O
our	O
shot	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
fall	O
so	O
quick	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
up	O
again	O
as	O
nimbly	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
down	O
flat	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
they	O
did	O
three	O
times	O
,	O
their	O
king	O
bowing	O
himself	O
to	O
our	O
men	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
.	O

This	O
ceremony	O
being	O
over	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
them	O
that	O
they	O
wanted	O
victuals	O
to	O
eat	O
,	O
and	O
something	O
to	O
drink	O
:	O
and	O
pulled	O
out	O
several	O
things	O
,	O
to	O
let	O
the	O
people	O
see	O
they	O
would	O
give	O
something	O
for	O
what	O
they	O
might	O
bring	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
king	O
understood	O
them	O
presently	O
,	O
and	O
turning	O
to	O
some	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
he	O
talked	O
awhile	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
observed	O
,	O
that	O
while	O
he	O
spoke	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
terrified	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
threatening	O
them	O
with	O
death	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
three	O
of	O
them	O
went	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
supposed	O
they	O
went	O
to	O
fetch	O
something	O
that	O
the	O
king	O
would	O
give	O
them	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
beforehand	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
presented	O
his	O
majesty	O
with	O
two	O
pair	O
of	O
bracelets	O
of	O
fine	O
glass	O
beads	O
of	O
several	O
colours	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
them	O
upon	O
his	O
arms	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
took	O
most	O
kindly	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
they	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
knife	O

with	O
a	O
good	O
plain	O
ivory	O
handle	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
other	O
odd	O
things	O

Upon	O
receiving	O
these	O

noble	O

he	O
sends	O
away	O
another	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
after	O
two	O
more	O

Our	O
men	O
observed	O
that	O
two	O
of	O
the	O

went	O
a	O
great	O

the	O
hill	O

but	O
the	O
other	O
man	O
that	O

went	O
to	O
his	O
queen	O

who	O

with	O

her	O

The	O
officer	O
who	O
commanded	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
finding	O
he	O
should	O
have	O
another	O
kind	O
of	O
compliment	O
to	O
pay	O
the	O
ladies	O
,	O
retired	O
a	O
little	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
being	O
an	O
ingenious	O
handy	O
sort	O
of	O
a	O
man	O
,	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
half-an-hour	O
,	O
he	O
and	O
another	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
made	O
a	O
nice	O
garland	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
a	O
coronet	O
,	O
of	O
sundry	O
strings	O
of	O
beads	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
glass	O
bobs	O
and	O
pendants	O
,	O
all	O
hanging	O
about	O
it	O
,	O
most	O
wonderful	O
gay	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
the	O
queen	O
was	O
come	O
,	O
he	O
went	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
king	O
,	O
and	O
showing	O
it	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
give	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
queen	O
.	O

The	O
king	O
took	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
so	O
pleased	O
with	O
the	O
present	O
,	O
that	O
truly	O
he	O
desired	O
our	O
officer	O
to	O
put	O
it	O
upon	O
his	O
own	O
head	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
did	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
had	O
got	O
it	O
so	O
placed	O
,	O
he	O
let	O
our	O
men	O
see	O
he	O
was	O
king	O
over	O
his	O
wife	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
over	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
wear	O
it	O
himself	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
then	O
pulled	O
out	O
a	O
little	O
pocket	O
looking-glass	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
holding	O
it	O
up	O
,	O
let	O
his	O
majesty	O
see	O
his	O
own	O
face	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
might	O
reasonably	O
suppose	O
he	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
before	O
,	O
especially	O
with	O
a	O
crown	O
on	O
his	O
head	O
too	O
.	O

Before	O
he	O
saw	O
his	O
own	O
face	O
in	O
the	O
glass	O
he	O
was	O
grave	O
and	O
majestic	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
it	O
something	O
like	O
a	O
king	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
so	O
delighted	O
with	O
the	O
novelty	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
quite	O
beside	O
himself	O
,	O
and	O
jumped	O
and	O
capered	O
and	O
danced	O
about	O
like	O
a	O
madman	O
.	O

All	O
this	O
while	O
our	O
men	O
saw	O
nothing	O
coming	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
all	O
was	O
given	O
on	O
their	O
side	O
;	O
whereupon	O
they	O
made	O
signs	O
again	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
wanted	O
provisions	O
.	O

The	O
king	O
then	O
made	O
signs	O
,	O
pointing	O
to	O
a	O
hill	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
off	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
it	O
would	O
come	O
from	O
thence	O
very	O
quickly	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
looked	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
his	O
people	O
were	O
coming	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
was	O
impatient	O
till	O
they	O
came	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
our	O
men	O
.	O

During	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
observed	O
that	O
the	O
queen	O
had	O
several	O
pieces	O
of	O
gold	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
thought	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
,	O
hanging	O
about	O
her	O
,	O
particularly	O
in	O
her	O
hair	O
,	O
and	O
large	O
flat	O
plates	O
of	O
gold	O
upon	O
the	O
hinder	O
part	O
of	O
her	O
head	O
,	O
something	O
in	O
the	O
place	O
of	O
a	O
roll	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
our	O
women	O
wear	O
;	O
that	O
her	O
hair	O
was	O
wound	O
about	O
it	O
in	O
rolls	O
,	O
braided	O
together	O
very	O
curiously	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
informed	O
our	O
officer	O
,	O
he	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
the	O
king	O
for	O
leave	O
to	O
give	O
the	O
queen	O
something	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
consented	O
to	O
.	O

So	O
he	O
went	O
to	O
her	O
majesty	O
,	O
making	O
a	O
bow	O
as	O
before	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
complaisance	O
surprised	O
her	O
,	O
for	O
,	O
upon	O
his	O
bowing	O
,	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
falls	O
the	O
queen	O
and	O
all	O
her	O
four	O
ladies	O
flat	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
up	O
again	O
in	O
a	O
moment	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
people	O
wondered	O
how	O
they	O
could	O
throw	O
themselves	O
so	O
flat	O
on	O
their	O
faces	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
hurt	O
themselves	O
;	O
nor	O
was	O
it	O
less	O
to	O
be	O
wondered	O
at	O
,	O
how	O
they	O
could	O
so	O
suddenly	O
jump	O
up	O
again	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
rise	O
up	O
gradually	O
as	O
we	O
must	O
do	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
our	O
hands	O
and	O
knees	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
extended	O
so	O
flat	O
on	O
our	O
faces	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
spring	O
,	O
whether	O
with	O
their	O
hands	O
or	O
their	O
whole	O
bodies	O
,	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
,	O
sprang	O
up	O
at	O
once	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
upon	O
their	O
feet	O
immediately	O
.	O

This	O
compliment	O
over	O
,	O
our	O
officer	O
stepped	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
queen	O
,	O
and	O
tied	O
about	O
her	O
neck	O
a	O
most	O
delicate	O
necklace	O
of	O
pearl	O
;	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
of	O
large	O
handsome	O
white	O
glass	O
beads	O
,	O
which	O
might	O
in	O
England	PNM
cost	O
about	O
fourpence	O
halfpenny	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
every	O
one	O
of	O
her	O
ladies	O
he	O
gave	O
another	O
of	O
smaller	O
beads	O
,	O
differing	O
in	O
colour	O
from	O
those	O
which	O
he	O
gave	O
the	O
queen	O
.	O

Then	O
he	O
presented	O
her	O
majesty	O
with	O
a	O
long	O
string	O
of	O
glass	O
beads	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
being	O
put	O
over	O
her	O
head	O
,	O
reached	O
down	O
to	O
her	O
waist	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
joined	O
in	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
tassel	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
little	O
knot	O
of	O
blue	O
riband	O
,	O
which	O
she	O
was	O
also	O
extremely	O
pleased	O
with	O
;	O
and	O
very	O
fine	O
she	O
was	O
.	O

The	O
queen	O
made	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
the	O
first	O
return	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
stepping	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
her	O
women	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
observed	O
that	O
her	O
attendant	O
took	O
something	O
out	O
of	O
her	O
hair	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
the	O
queen	O
let	O
her	O
tie	O
her	O
hair	O
up	O
again	O
;	O
after	O
which	O
her	O
majesty	O
brought	O
it	O
and	O
gave	O
it	O
to	O
our	O
officer	O
,	O
making	O
signs	O
to	O
know	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
acceptable	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
gold	O
that	O
weighed	O
about	O
two	O
ounces	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
;	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
beaten	O
as	O
flat	O
as	O
they	O
knew	O
how	O
to	O
beat	O
it	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
metal	O
was	O
of	O
much	O
more	O
beauty	O
to	O
our	O
men	O
than	O
the	O
shape	O
.	O

Our	O
officer	O
soon	O
let	O
the	O
queen	O
and	O
people	O
see	O
that	O
he	O
accepted	O
the	O
present	O
,	O
by	O
laying	O
it	O
to	O
his	O
mouth	O
and	O
to	O
his	O
breast	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
found	O
was	O
the	O
way	O
when	O
they	O
liked	O
anything	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
our	O
officer	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
while	O
he	O
made	O
a	O
little	O
coronet	O
for	O
the	O
queen	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
before	O
for	O
the	O
king	O
,	O
though	O
less	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
without	O
asking	O
leave	O
of	O
his	O
majesty	O
,	O
went	O
up	O
to	O
her	O
and	O
put	O
it	O
upon	O
her	O
head	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
gave	O
her	O
a	O
little	O
looking-glass	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
to	O
the	O
king	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
might	O
view	O
her	O
face	O
in	O
it	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
so	O
surprised	O
at	O
the	O
sight	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
knew	O
not	O
how	O
to	O
contain	O
herself	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
to	O
show	O
her	O
gratitude	O
,	O
she	O
pulled	O
out	O
another	O
plate	O
of	O
gold	O
out	O
of	O
her	O
own	O
hair	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
it	O
to	O
our	O
officer	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
not	O
content	O
with	O
that	O
,	O
she	O
sent	O
one	O
of	O
her	O
women	O
to	O
the	O
crowd	O
of	O
females	O
who	O
first	O
attended	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
whether	O
she	O
stripped	O
them	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
gold	O
they	O
had	O
,	O
or	O
only	O
a	O
part	O
,	O
she	O
brought	O
so	O
many	O
pieces	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
when	O
together	O
,	O
they	O
weighed	O
almost	O
two	O
pounds	O
.	O

When	O
she	O
was	O
thus	O
dressed	O
she	O
stepped	O
forward	O
very	O
nimbly	O
and	O
gracefully	O
towards	O
the	O
king	O
,	O
to	O
show	O
him	O
what	O
she	O
had	O
got	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
finding	O
he	O
was	O
dressed	O
as	O
fine	O
as	O
herself	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
work	O
enough	O
for	O
near	O
two	O
hours	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
and	O
admire	O
their	O
new	O
ornaments	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
reported	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
king	O
was	O
a	O
tall	O
,	O
well-shaped	O
man	O
,	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
majestic	O
deportment	O
,	O
only	O
that	O
when	O
he	O
laughed	O
he	O
showed	O
his	O
teeth	O
too	O
much	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
were	O
as	O
white	O
as	O
ivory	O
:	O
as	O
for	O
the	O
queen	O
,	O
saving	O
that	O
her	O
skin	O
was	O
of	O
a	O
tawny	O
colour	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
pretty	O
woman	O
;	O
very	O
tall	O
,	O
a	O
sweet	O
countenance	O
,	O
admirable	O
features	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
a	O
complete	O
handsome	O
lady	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
very	O
oddly	O
dressed	O
;	O
she	O
was	O
quite	O
naked	O
from	O
her	O
head	O
to	O
below	O
her	O
breasts	O
;	O
her	O
breasts	O
were	O
plump	O
and	O
round	O
,	O
not	O
flaggy	O
and	O
hanging	O
down	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
generally	O
is	O
with	O
the	O
Indian	O
women	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
whose	O
breasts	O
hang	O
as	O
low	O
as	O
their	O
bellies	O
,	O
but	O
projecting	O
as	O
beautifully	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
laced	O
up	O
with	O
stays	O
round	O
her	O
body	O
;	O
and	O
below	O
her	O
breast	O
she	O
had	O
a	O
broad	O
piece	O
of	O
a	O
skin	O
of	O
some	O
curious	O
creature	O
,	O
spotted	O
like	O
a	O
leopard	O
,	O
probably	O
of	O
some	O
fine	O
spotted	O
deer	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
wrapped	O
round	O
her	O
very	O
tight	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
body-girt	O
to	O
a	O
horse	O
;	O
and	O
under	O
this	O
she	O
had	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
petticoat	O
,	O
as	O
before	O
described	O
,	O
hanging	O
down	O
to	O
her	O
ankles	O
.	O

As	O
for	O
shoes	O
or	O
stockings	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
only	O
such	O
as	O
nature	O
had	O
furnished	O
.	O

Her	O
hair	O
was	O
black	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
supposed	O
,	O
very	O
long	O
,	O
being	O
wreathed	O
up	O
and	O
twisted	O
in	O
long	O
locks	O
about	O
the	O
plate	O
of	O
gold	O
she	O
wore	O
;	O
for	O
when	O
she	O
pulled	O
off	O
the	O
plate	O
above	O
mentioned	O
,	O
it	O
hung	O
down	O
her	O
back	O
and	O
upon	O
her	O
shoulders	O
very	O
gracefully	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
seems	O
she	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
so	O
,	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
she	O
found	O
it	O
so	O
fallen	O
down	O
,	O
she	O
caused	O
one	O
of	O
her	O
women	O
to	O
roll	O
it	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
tie	O
it	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
knot	O
which	O
hung	O
down	O
in	O
her	O
neck	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
look	O
so	O
well	O
as	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
loose	O
.	O

While	O
the	O
king	O
and	O
the	O
queen	O
were	O
conversing	O
together	O
about	O
their	O
fine	O
things	O
,	O
as	O
above	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
went	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
left	O
the	O
purchase	O
they	O
had	O
got	O
,	O
and	O
furnished	O
themselves	O
with	O
other	O
things	O
fit	O
to	O
traffick	O
with	O
as	O
they	O
saw	O
occasion	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
quite	O
come	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
king	O
again	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
perceived	O
that	O
the	O
men	O
the	O
king	O
had	O
sent	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
were	O
returned	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
brought	O
with	O
them	O
a	O
great	O
quantity	O
of	O
such	O
provisions	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
,	O
which	O
chiefly	O
consisted	O
of	O
roots	O
and	O
maize	O
,	O
or	O
Indian	O
corn	O
,	O
and	O
several	O
fruits	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
before	O
.	O

Some	O
of	O
them	O
resembled	O
the	O
large	O
European	O
figs	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
not	O
really	O
figs	O
;	O
with	O
some	O
great	O
jars	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
having	O
herbs	O
steeped	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
roots	O
,	O
that	O
made	O
it	O
look	O
as	O
white	O
as	O
milk	O
,	O
and	O
drank	O
like	O
milk	O
sweetened	O
with	O
sugar	O

more	O
delicious	O

and	O
refreshing	O

They	O
brought	O
also	O
a	O
great	O
quantity	O
of	O
oranges	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
neither	O
sweet	O
nor	O
sour	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
believed	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
ripe	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
dressed	O
after	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
showed	O
our	O

and	O
which	O
was	O
to	O
roast	O
them	O
before	O
the	O
fire	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
an	O
admirable	O
flavour	O

our	O

brought	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
away	O
to	O
us	O

and	O
when	O
we	O
roasted	O
them	O
they	O
exceeded	O
anything	O
of	O
the	O
kind	O
I	O
had	O
ever	O
tasted	O

After	O
our	O
men	O
had	O
received	O
what	O
was	O
brought	O
,	O
and	O
shown	O
that	O
the	O
whole	O
was	O
very	O
acceptable	O
,	O
the	O
king	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
be	O
gone	O
,	O
but	O
would	O
come	O
again	O
to	O
them	O
the	O
next	O

;	O
and	O
,	O
pointing	O
to	O
the	O
queen	O

head	O

where	O
the	O
plate	O
of	O
gold	O
had	O
been	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
given	O
to	O
our	O
men	O

intimated	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
bring	O
some	O
of	O
the	O

with	O
him	O
the	O
next	O

But	O
while	O
he	O
was	O
making	O
these	O
signs	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
other	O
messengers	O
came	O
back	O

gave	O
the	O
king	O
something	O
into	O
his	O
hand	O
wrapped	O
up	O
,	O
which	O
our	O

could	O
not	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
king	O
had	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
proud	O
to	O
show	O
our	O
men	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
make	O
himself	O
and	O
his	O
queen	O
as	O
fine	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
make	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
undid	O
the	O
parcel	O

and	O
decked	O
out	O
his	O
queen	O
with	O
a	O
short	O
thing	O
like	O
a	O

which	O
reached	O
from	O
her	O
neck	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
spotted	O
skin	O
which	O
she	O
wore	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
it	O
covered	O
her	O
shoulders	O

It	O
was	O
made	O
of	O
an	O
infinite	O
number	O
and	O
variety	O
of	O
feathers	O
,	O
oddly	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
very	O
curiously	O
put	O
together	O
;	O
and	O
was	O
spangled	O
all	O
over	O
with	O
little	O
drops	O
or	O
lumps	O
of	O
gold	O
;	O
some	O
no	O
bigger	O
than	O
a	O
pin	O
's	O
head	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
holes	O
made	O
through	O
them	O

and	O
were	O
strung	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
tied	O
on	O
to	O
the	O
feathers	O
;	O
some	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
a	O
large	O
pea	O

hanging	O

some	O
as	O
big	O

a	O
horse-bean	O

hanging	O

without	O
any	O

which	O

were	O
very	O
beautiful	O
in	O
the	O
whole	O

and	O
made	O
the	O
thing	O
look	O
rich	O
and	O
handsome	O
enough	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
thus	O
equipped	O
his	O
queen	O
,	O
he	O
put	O
another	O
upon	O
himself	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
larger	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
this	O
particular	O
in	O
its	O
shape	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
covered	O
his	O
arms	O
almost	O
to	O
his	O

and	O
was	O
so	O
made	O
that	O
it	O
came	O
round	O
under	O
the	O
arm	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
fastened	O
there	O
with	O
a	O
string	O

made	O
a	O

of	O

As	O
the	O
king	O

robe	O

or	O
whatever	O
it	O
may	O
be	O

longer	O

for	O
it	O
came	O
down	O
to	O
his	O

so	O
it	O
had	O
a	O
great	O

more	O
gold	O
about	O
it	O

and	O
larger	O

When	O
their	O
majesties	O
had	O
thus	O
put	O
on	O
their	O
robes	O
,	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
guessed	O
how	O
glorious	O
they	O
looked	O

especially	O
the	O
queen	O

who	O
being	O
a	O
most	O
charming	O

creature	O
,	O
as	O
said	O
before	O

was	O
much	O
more	O
so	O
when	O

thus	O
with	O

Our	O
men	O
looked	O
very	O
narrowly	O
to	O
observe	O
whether	O
there	O
were	O
any	O
diamonds	O
or	O
pearls	O
among	O
their	O

but	O
they	O
could	O
not	O

any	O

The	O
king	O
and	O
queen	O
now	O
withdrew	O
for	O
that	O
evening	O
,	O
but	O
their	O
people	O
did	O
not	O
leave	O
our	O
men	O
so	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
thronged	O
about	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
some	O
brought	O
them	O
jars	O
of	O
the	O
white	O
liquor	O
,	O
some	O
brought	O
them	O
roots	O
,	O
others	O
fruits	O
,	O
some	O
one	O
thing	O
,	O
some	O
another	O
;	O
and	O
our	O

gave	O
every	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
some	O
small	O
matter	O
or	O
other	O
in	O

to	O
what	O
they	O

At	O
last	O
,	O
there	O
came	O
four	O
particular	O
tall	O
lusty	O
men	O
,	O
with	O
bows	O
and	O
arrows	O
;	O
but	O
before	O
they	O
came	O
close	O
up	O
to	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
they	O
laid	O
down	O
their	O
bows	O
and	O
arrows	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
forward	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
tokens	O
of	O
friendship	O
they	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
make	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
two	O
youths	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
each	O
of	O
whom	O
led	O
a	O
tame	O
fawn	O
of	O
pretty	O
large	O
growth	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
the	O
men	O
came	O
up	O
,	O
they	O
gave	O
the	O
two	O
fawns	O
to	O
our	O
men	O
;	O
who	O
,	O
in	O
return	O
,	O
gave	O
each	O
of	O
them	O
a	O
knife	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
strings	O
of	O
beads	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
toys	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
observed	O
,	O
that	O
all	O
these	O
men	O
had	O
little	O
bits	O
of	O
gold	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
one	O
shape	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
another	O
,	O
hanging	O
at	O
their	O
ears	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
our	O
men	O
came	O
to	O
be	O
familiar	O
,	O
they	O
asked	O
them	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
found	O
that	O
stuff	O
?	O

and	O
they	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
the	O
sand	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
pointed	O
towards	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
where	O
our	O
ships	O
lay	O
,	O
which	O
signified	O
to	O
our	O
men	O
that	O
the	O
gold	O
was	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
lay	O
,	O
not	O
there	O
where	O
the	O
king	O
and	O
queen	O
resided	O
.	O

Nay	O
,	O
when	O
our	O
men	O
pointed	O
again	O
to	O
the	O
river	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
and	O
took	O
up	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
sand	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
look	O
for	O
gold	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
they	O
made	O
signs	O
of	O
laughing	O
at	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
nothing	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
there	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
it	O
lay	O
all	O
the	O
other	O
way	O
.	O

And	O
yet	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
tide	O
was	O
out	O
,	O
went	O
up	O
the	O
bank	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
miles	O
upon	O
the	O
sands	O
,	O
peeping	O
and	O
trying	O
the	O
sands	O
as	O
they	O
went	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
little	O
bits	O
of	O
pure	O
gold	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
bigger	O
than	O
pins	O
heads	O
;	O
but	O
no	O
doubt	O
farther	O
up	O
the	O
country	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
found	O
more	O
.	O

These	O
four	O
men	O
seeing	O
how	O
fond	O
our	O
people	O
were	O
of	O
the	O
gold	O
,	O
made	O
signs	O
they	O
could	O
fetch	O
gold	O
to	O
them	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
give	O
them	O
such	O
things	O
as	O
they	O
liked	O
;	O
and	O
ours	O
again	O
told	O
them	O
they	O
should	O
have	O
anything	O
they	O
pleased	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
earnest	O
,	O
gave	O
them	O
some	O
pieces	O
of	O
iron	O
and	O
bits	O
of	O
glass	O
of	O
small	O
value	O
,	O
both	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
much	O
delighted	O
with	O
.	O

Early	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
their	O
four	O
customers	O
came	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
several	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
servants	O
,	O
along	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
loaden	O
with	O
refreshments	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
white	O
water	O
,	O
mentioned	O
above	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
brought	O
in	O
earthen	O
pots	O
,	O
very	O
hard	O
,	O
made	O
so	O
by	O
the	O
heat	O
of	O
the	O
sun	O
.	O

They	O
brought	O
also	O
three	O
small	O
deer	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
coney	O
or	O
rabbit	O
,	O
but	O
larger	O
,	O
which	O
our	O
men	O
were	O
very	O
glad	O
of	O
.	O

But	O
that	O
which	O
was	O
above	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
they	O
brought	O
a	O
good	O
quantity	O
of	O
gold-dust	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
some	O
in	O
small	O
lumps	O
,	O
some	O
in	O
bigger	O
;	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
near	O
a	O
pound	O
weight	O
wrapped	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
coney-skin	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
all	O
so	O
very	O
small	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
like	O
dust	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
our	O
men	O
understood	O
afterwards	O
,	O
was	O
reckoned	O
little	O
worth	O
,	O
because	O
all	O
the	O
lumps	O
had	O
been	O
picked	O
out	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
were	O
very	O
willing	O
to	O
trade	O
for	O
this	O
commodity	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
they	O
brought	O
out	O
great	O
variety	O
of	O
things	O
to	O
truck	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
making	O
signs	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
pick	O
out	O
what	O
they	O
liked	O
;	O
but	O
still	O
keeping	O
a	O
reserve	O
for	O
the	O
king	O
and	O
queen	O
,	O
whom	O
they	O
expected	O
.	O

Above	O
all	O
they	O
had	O
made	O
a	O
reserve	O
for	O
the	O
king	O
of	O
some	O
extraordinary	O
hatchets	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
not	O
yet	O
suffered	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
hammer	O
or	O
two	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
drinking-glasses	O

and	O
the	O
like	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
particular	O
toys	O
for	O
the	O
queen	O
.	O

But	O
they	O
had	O
variety	O
enough	O
left	O
besides	O
for	O
the	O
four	O
men	O
:	O
who	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
bought	O
so	O
many	O
trinkets	O
and	O
trifles	O
,	O
that	O
our	O
men	O
not	O
only	O
got	O
all	O
the	O
gold	O
they	O
brought	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
very	O
pieces	O
of	O
gold	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
ears	O
;	O
in	O
return	O
for	O
which	O
our	O
men	O
gave	O
them	O
every	O
one	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
ear-rings	O
,	O
to	O
hang	O
about	O
their	O
ears	O

with	O
a	O
fine	O
drop	O
;	O
some	O
of	O
green	O
glass	O
,	O
some	O
red	O
,	O
some	O
blue	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
wonderfully	O
pleased	O
with	O
the	O
exchange	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
back	O
,	O
we	O
may	O
venture	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
much	O
richer	O
in	O
opinion	O
than	O
they	O
came	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
these	O
people	O
had	O
done	O
their	O
market	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
a	O
little	O
before	O
,	O
they	O
perceived	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
the	O
king	O
and	O
queen	O
coming	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
retinue	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
our	O
men	O
that	O
they	O
must	O
be	O
gone	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
the	O
king	O
know	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
there	O
.	O

I	O
must	O
confess	O
,	O
the	O
relation	O
of	O
all	O
this	O
made	O
me	O
very	O
much	O
repent	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
happened	O
to	O
have	O
put	O
in	O
there	O
with	O
the	O
ships	O

as	O
the	O
road	O

open	O

the	O
east	O

it	O
might	O

worse	O
another	O

when	O
the	O
storm	O
blew	O

However	O

I	O

the	O

had	O
over	O
all	O
his	O

a	O

robe	O
of	O
deer	O
skins	O

which	O

as	O
he	O

it	O

covered	O
him	O
from	O
head	O

;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
short	O

it	O
was	O
so	O
very	O
beautiful	O
that	O
he	O
really	O
looked	O
like	O
a	O
king	O
with	O
it	O

When	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
ceremony	O
of	O
their	O
meeting	O
was	O
over	O

the	O
king	O
,	O
turning	O
round	O

showed	O
them	O

that	O
he	O

;	O
and	O
indeed	O

so	O
he	O
had	O

for	O
he	O
had	O
at	O

fifty	O

him	O

with	O

and	O
maize	O

and	O
such	O
things	O
;	O
in	O

,	O
he	O
brought	O
them	O
above	O
twenty	O
thousand	O
oranges	O
;	O
a	O
great	O
parcel	O
of	O
that	O
fruit	O
like	O
a	O
fig	O

which	O
I	O
mentioned	O
above	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
fruits	O

After	O
which	O
another	O
party	O
followed	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
twenty	O
live	O
deer	O

and	O
as	O

;	O
the	O

as	O
our	O

As	O
they	O
came	O
up	O
,	O
the	O
king	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
our	O
men	O
to	O
take	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
officer	O
making	O
signs	O
to	O
thank	O
his	O
majesty	O
,	O
he	O
ordered	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
queen	O
's	O
attendants	O
to	O
give	O
him	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
feathered	O
robes	O
,	O
such	O
an	O
one	O
as	O
the	O
king	O
himself	O
had	O
on	O
;	O
and	O
made	O
mighty	O
fine	O
with	O
lumps	O
and	O
tassels	O
of	O
gold	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
other	O
.	O

And	O
a	O
tawny	O
lass	O
advancing	O
to	O
him	O
offered	O
to	O
put	O
it	O
over	O
his	O
head	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
took	O
it	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
and	O
put	O
it	O
on	O
himself	O
,	O
and	O
looked	O
as	O
like	O
a	O
jack	O
pudding	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
any	O
one	O
could	O
desire	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
made	O
no	O
figure	O
at	O
all	O
upon	O
him	O
,	O
compared	O
to	O
what	O
it	O
did	O
upon	O
the	O
Indians	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
had	O
received	O
all	O
this	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
but	O
make	O
a	O
suitable	O
return	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
our	O
officer	O
caused	O
his	O
reserve	O
to	O
be	O
brought	O
out	O
;	O
and	O
first	O
he	O
gave	O
his	O
majesty	O
a	O
dozen	O
of	O
very	O
handsome	O
drinking-glasses	O
of	O
several	O
sizes	O
;	O
with	O
half	O
a	O
dozen	O
of	O
glass	O
beakers	O
,	O
or	O
cups	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
queen	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
same	O
use	O
.	O

Then	O
he	O
gave	O
the	O
king	O
a	O
little	O
hanger	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
belt	O
to	O
wear	O
it	O
by	O
his	O
side	O
;	O
and	O
showed	O
him	O
how	O
to	O
buckle	O
it	O
on	O
and	O
take	O
it	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
to	O
draw	O
it	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
it	O
in	O
again	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
such	O
a	O
present	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
king	O
was	O
so	O
delighted	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
our	O
officer	O
said	O
he	O
believed	O
the	O
king	O
did	O
nothing	O
but	O
draw	O
it	O
and	O
put	O
it	O
up	O
again	O
,	O
put	O
it	O
on	O
and	O
pull	O
it	O
off	O
,	O
for	O
near	O
two	O
hours	O
together	O
.	O

Besides	O
this	O
he	O
gave	O
the	O
king	O
three	O
hatchets	O
,	O
and	O
showed	O
him	O
the	O
uses	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
also	O
two	O
large	O
hammers	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
very	O
strong	O
large	O
shears	O
,	O
particularly	O
showing	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
with	O
those	O
hammers	O
they	O
might	O
beat	O
out	O
the	O
gold	O
lumps	O
which	O
they	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
rivers	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
the	O
shears	O
might	O
cut	O
the	O
edges	O
round	O
,	O
or	O
into	O
what	O
shape	O
they	O
pleased	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
beaten	O
thin	O
.	O

To	O
the	O
queen	O
he	O
gave	O
six	O
little	O
knives	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
dozen	O
small	O
looking-glasses	O
for	O
her	O
ladies	O
;	O
six	O
pairs	O
of	O
scissors	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
small	O
box	O
full	O
of	O
large	O
needles	O
;	O
then	O
he	O
gave	O
her	O
some	O
coarse	O
brown	O
thread	O
,	O
and	O
showed	O
her	O
how	O
to	O
thread	O
the	O
needle	O
,	O
and	O
sew	O
anything	O
together	O
with	O
the	O
thread	O
;	O
all	O
which	O
she	O
admired	O
exceedingly	O
,	O
and	O
called	O
her	O
tawny	O
maids	O
of	O
honour	O
about	O
her	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
learn	O
also	O
.	O

And	O
whilst	O
they	O
were	O
standing	O
all	O
together	O
,	O
our	O
officer	O
,	O
to	O
divert	O
the	O
king	O
,	O
sewed	O
two	O
of	O
her	O
women	O
one	O
to	O
another	O
by	O
the	O
lap	O
of	O
their	O
waistcoats	O
,	O
or	O
what	O
else	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
called	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
a	O
little	O
surprised	O
at	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
thought	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
uneasy	O
,	O
he	O
took	O
the	O
scissors	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
one	O
snap	O
set	O
them	O
at	O
liberty	O
again	O
,	O
which	O
passed	O
for	O
such	O
an	O
extraordinary	O
piece	O
of	O
dexterity	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
king	O
would	O
needs	O
have	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
sewed	O
together	O
again	O
,	O
on	O
purpose	O
to	O
see	O
it	O
cut	O
again	O
.	O

And	O
then	O
the	O
king	O
desired	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
a	O
needle	O
and	O
thread	O
himself	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
scissors	O
;	O
then	O
he	O
would	O
sew	O
some	O
things	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
cut	O
them	O
asunder	O
again	O
several	O
times	O
,	O
and	O
laugh	O
most	O
heartily	O
at	O
the	O
ingenuity	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

Besides	O
the	O
above	O
things	O
,	O
they	O
gave	O
her	O
majesty	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
ear-rings	O
to	O
hang	O
on	O
her	O
ears	O
,	O
the	O
glass	O
in	O
them	O
looking	O
green	O

an	O

;	O
a	O
ring	O
of	O
silver	O
,	O
with	O
false	O
stones	O
in	O

the	O
middle	O
stone	O
red	O
like	O
a	O
ruby	O
,	O
which	O
she	O
went	O
presently	O
and	O
gave	O
to	O
the	O
king	O
;	O
but	O
our	O
officer	O
made	O
signs	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
one	O
that	O
was	O
bigger	O
for	O
the	O
king	O
,	O
and	O
accordingly	O
gave	O
the	O
king	O
one	O
much	O
larger	O
;	O
and	O
now	O
they	O
had	O
done	O
giving	O
presents	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
thought	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
king	O
made	O
a	O
sign	O
to	O
the	O
queen	O
,	O
which	O
she	O
understood	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
calling	O
one	O
of	O
her	O
women	O
,	O
she	O
brought	O
a	O
small	O
parcel	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
queen	O
gave	O
our	O
officer	O
into	O
his	O
hand	O
,	O
wherein	O
was	O
about	O
eleven	O
pounds	O
weight	O
of	O
gold-dust	O

but	O
,	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
no	O

Our	O

having	O
thus	O
finished	O
their	O
traffick	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
about	O
to	O
come	O
away	O
,	O
they	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
the	O
king	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
come	O
again	O
and	O
bring	O
him	O
more	O
fine	O
things	O
;	O
at	O
which	O
the	O
king	O
smiled	O
,	O
and	O
pointing	O
to	O
the	O
gold	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
telling	O
them	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
more	O
of	O
that	O
for	O
them	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
again	O

Our	O
men	O
had	O
now	O
their	O
expectations	O
fully	O
answered	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
had	O
ended	O
their	O
traffick	O

and	O
,	O
taking	O
leave	O
of	O
the	O
king	O
and	O
all	O
his	O
retinue	O

retired	O
to	O
their	O
shallop	O
,	O
the	O
king	O
and	O
queen	O
going	O
away	O
to	O
their	O
city	O
as	O
above	O

The	O
wind	O
blowing	O
northerly	O

they	O
were	O
seven	O
days	O
before	O
they	O
got	O
down	O
to	O
us	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
during	O
which	O
time	O
they	O
had	O
almost	O
famished	O
the	O
deer	O
they	O
had	O
left	O
,	O
five	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
kept	O
to	O
bring	O
us	O
alive	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
they	O
went	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
times	O
on	O
shore	O
to	O
get	O
food	O
for	O
them	O
by	O
the	O
way	O

We	O
were	O
all	O
glad	O
to	O
see	O
them	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
reason	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
well	O
satisfied	O
with	O
the	O
account	O
of	O
their	O
traffick	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
much	O
with	O
their	O
discovery	O

for	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
give	O
us	O
the	O

account	O
whether	O
the	O
land	O
was	O

in	O

no	O

the	O

;	O
where	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
quantity	O

it	O
is	O
at	O

that	O

a	O

I	O

such	O

the	O

that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O

I	O
reckon	O

that	O

including	O
the	O

our	O

brought	O

and	O
what	O
we	O

on	O

we	O
lay	O

about	O
twenty-four	O

of	O
gold	O
;	O
the	O
expense	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
value	O
at	O
above	O
ten	O

eleven	O

in	O

,	O
put	O

for	O

for	O
twenty	O

by	O

At	O

it	O
blew	O

Here	O

My	O

ashore	O
again	O

trafficked	O
with	O
the	O

for	O
more	O

but	O
I	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
still	O
in	O
quest	O
of	O
further	O
discoveries	O
,	O
thought	O
I	O
knew	O
enough	O
of	O
this	O

to	O
tempt	O
my	O
friend	O
the	O

was	O
that	O
of	O

,	O
to	O
another	O
voyage	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
enough	O
for	O
me	O

So	O
I	O
declined	O
going	O
on	O
shore	O
again	O
,	O
except	O
that	O
we	O
sent	O
our	O
boats	O
for	O
a	O

of	O
fresh	O
water	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
while	O
they	O
were	O
filling	O
it	O

shot	O
a	O

,	O
and	O
also	O
some	O
wild	O
ducks	O

Here	O
we	O
set	O
up	O
a	O
great	O
wooden	O

wrote	O
on	O

the	O

and	O
the	O
time	O
that	O
we	O

an	O

But	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
a	O
farther	O
discovery	O
of	O
this	O
country	O
than	O
we	O
intended	O
,	O
by	O
the	O

We	O
had	O
unmoored	O
early	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
eight	O
o'clock	O
were	O
under	O
sail	O
;	O
by	O
ten	O
we	O
had	O
doubled	O
the	O
point	O
I	O
mentioned	O
above	O

and	O
stood	O
away	O
south	O
keeping	O
the	O
shore	O
on	O

at	O
the	O
distance	O

about	O
two	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
the	O
officer	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
with	O
the	O
shallop	O
,	O
showed	O
us	O
the	O
opening	O
or	O

where	O

and	O
where	O
he	O

traffick	O
with	O
the	O
king	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
as	O
said	O
before	O
.	O

We	O
went	O
on	O
still	O
for	O
two	O
days	O
,	O
and	O
still	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
land	O
extending	O
itself	O
south	O
,	O
till	O
the	O
third	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
a	O
little	O
surprised	O
to	O
find	O
ourselves	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
embayed	O
,	O
being	O
in	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
a	O
deep	O
gulf	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
land	O
appearing	O
right	O
ahead	O
,	O
distance	O
about	O
three	O
leagues	O
;	O
the	O
coast	O
having	O
turned	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
east	O
and	O
by	O
south	O
,	O
very	O
high	O
land	O
and	O
mountainous	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
tops	O
of	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
hills	O
covered	O
with	O
snow	O
.	O

Our	O
second	O
mate	O
and	O
the	O
boatswain	O
,	O
upon	O
this	O
discovery	O
,	O
were	O
for	O
coming	O
about	O
,	O
and	O
sent	O
to	O
me	O
for	O
orders	O
to	O
make	O
signals	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
ship	O
and	O
our	O
brigantine	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
both	O
ahead	O
,	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
like	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
willing	O
to	O
acquaint	O
myself	O
as	O
fully	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
with	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
made	O
no	O
question	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
occasion	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
again	O
,	O
said	O
,	O
No	O
,	O
no	O
,	O
I	O
will	O
see	O
a	O
little	O
farther	O
first	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
ran	O
on	O
,	O
having	O
an	O
easy	O
gale	O
at	O
north-east	O
and	O
good	O
weather	O
,	O
till	O
I	O
came	O
within	O
about	O
a	O
league	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
of	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
found	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
very	O
bite	O
or	O
nook	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
inlet	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
which	O
either	O
must	O
be	O
a	O
passage	O
or	O
strait	O
between	O
the	O
land	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
on	O
shore	O
upon	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
in	O
that	O
case	O
,	O
must	O
be	O
a	O
great	O
island	O
,	O
or	O
that	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
some	O
extraordinary	O
great	O
river	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
discovery	O
too	O
great	O
to	O
be	O
omitted	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
brigantine	O
to	O
stand	O
in	O
with	O
an	O
easy	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
what	O
account	O
could	O
be	O
had	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
;	O
accordingly	O
they	O
stood	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
followed	O
about	O
a	O
league	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
lay	O
by	O
,	O
waiting	O
their	O
signals	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
particularly	O
ordered	O
them	O
to	O
keep	O
two	O
boats	O
ahead	O
to	O
sound	O
the	O
depth	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
did	O
so	O
;	O
and	O
how	O
it	O
happened	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
,	O
but	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
we	O
heard	O
the	O
sloop	O
fire	O
two	O
guns	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
one	O
gun	O
;	O
the	O
first	O
was	O
a	O
signal	O
to	O
us	O
to	O
bring	O
to	O
,	O
and	O
come	O
no	O
farther	O
:	O
the	O
next	O
was	O
a	O
signal	O
of	O
distress	O
.	O

We	O
immediately	O
tacked	O
to	O
stand	O
off	O
,	O
but	O
found	O
a	O
strong	O
current	O
setting	O
directly	O
into	O
the	O
bite	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
not	O
being	O
wind	O
enough	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
stem	O
the	O
current	O
,	O
we	O
let	O
go	O
our	O
anchors	O
in	O
twenty	O
fathoms	O
water	O
.	O

Immediately	O
we	O
manned	O
out	O
all	O
the	O
boats	O
we	O
had	O
,	O
great	O
and	O
small	O
,	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
assist	O
our	O
brigantine	O
,	O
not	O
knowing	O
what	O
distress	O
she	O
might	O
be	O
in	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
found	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
driven	O
up	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
like	O
to	O
have	O
done	O
,	O
too	O
far	O
into	O
the	O
channel	O
of	O
a	O
large	O
river	O
,	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
which	O
,	O
being	O
very	O
broad	O
,	O
had	O
several	O
shoals	O
in	O
it	O
:	O
and	O
though	O
she	O
had	O
dropped	O
her	O
anchor	O
just	O
upon	O
notice	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
boats	O
who	O
were	O
sounding	O
gave	O
her	O
,	O
yet	O
she	O
tailed	O
aground	O
upon	O
a	O
sand-bank	O
,	O
and	O
stuck	O
fast	O
;	O
our	O
men	O
made	O
no	O
doubt	O
but	O
she	O
would	O
be	O
lost	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
saving	O
the	O
provisions	O
and	O
ammunition	O
out	O
of	O
her	O
.	O

The	O
two	O
long	O
boats	O
accordingly	O
began	O
to	O
lighten	O
her	O
;	O
and	O
first	O
they	O
took	O
in	O
her	O
guns	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
out	O
all	O
her	O
casks	O
of	O
water	O
:	O
then	O
they	O
began	O
to	O
take	O
in	O
her	O
great	O
shot	O
and	O
the	O
heavy	O
goods	O
.	O

But	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
they	O
found	O
their	O
mistake	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
current	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
mentioned	O
,	O
was	O
nothing	O
but	O
a	O
strong	O
tide	O
of	O
flood	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
the	O
indraught	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
being	O
considerable	O
,	O
ran	O
up	O
with	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
force	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
something	O
less	O
than	O
an	O
hour	O
the	O
brigantine	O
floated	O
again	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
she	O
had	O
stuck	O
so	O
long	O
upon	O
the	O
sand	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
force	O
of	O
the	O
current	O
or	O
tide	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
great	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
received	O
considerable	O
damage	O
;	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
water	O
in	O
her	O
hold	O
.	O

I	O
immediately	O
ordered	O
out	O
boats	O
to	O
row	O
to	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
find	O
a	O
good	O
place	O
to	O
lay	O
her	O
on	O
shore	O
in	O
;	O
they	O
obeyed	O
the	O
order	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
a	O
very	O
convenient	O
harbour	O
in	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
a	O
small	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
emptied	O
itself	O
into	O
the	O
great	O
river	O
about	O
two	O
leagues	O
within	O
the	O
foreland	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
river	O
Medway	O
runs	O
into	O
the	O
Thames	O
,	O
within	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
south	O
,	O
side	O
,	O
only	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
far	O
up	O
.	O

Here	O
they	O
ran	O
in	O
the	O
sloop	O
immediately	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
we	O
came	O
thither	O
also	O
;	O
our	O
boats	O
having	O
sounded	O
the	O
whole	O
breadth	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
main	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
channel	O
,	O
half	O
a	O
league	O
broad	O
,	O
having	O
from	O
seventeen	O
to	O
four-and-twenty	O
fathoms	O
water	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
good	O
riding	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
absolutely	O
necessary	O
to	O
take	O
everything	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
brigantine	O
to	O
search	O
her	O
bottom	O
,	O
for	O
her	O
lying	O
on	O
shore	O
had	O
strained	O
her	O
seams	O
,	O
and	O
broke	O
one	O
of	O
her	O
floor	O
timbers	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
hands	O
enough	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
unloaded	O
her	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
little	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
making	O
a	O
little	O
dock	O
for	O
her	O
,	O
mended	O
all	O
the	O
damage	O
in	O
about	O
ten	O
days	O
'	O
time	O
.	O

But	O
seeing	O
her	O
in	O
so	O
good	O
a	O
condition	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
place	O
so	O
convenient	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
have	O
her	O
whole	O
bottom	O
new	O
calked	O
and	O
cleaned	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
made	O
her	O
as	O
tight	O
as	O
she	O
was	O
when	O
she	O
first	O
came	O
off	O
the	O
stocks	O
.	O

This	O
I	O
took	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
opportunity	O
to	O
careen	O
and	O
clean	O
our	O
other	O
ships	O
too	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
done	O
little	O
to	O
them	O
since	O
we	O
came	O
from	O
Madagascar	PNM
.	O

We	O
found	O
our	O
Madagascar	O
ship	O
much	O
worm-eaten	O
in	O
her	O
sheathing	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
helped	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
by	O
new	O
nailing	O
and	O
by	O
taking	O
out	O
some	O
pieces	O
of	O
her	O
sheathing	O

and	O
putting	O
new	O
ones	O
in	O

But	O
as	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
ship	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
sheathed	O
with	O
lead	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
received	O
no	O
damage	O
at	O
all	O
;	O
only	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
very	O
foul	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
remedied	O
by	O
scraping	O
and	O
cleaning	O
,	O
and	O
new	O
graving	O
her	O
quite	O
over	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
not	O
all	O
employed	O
in	O
this	O
work	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
we	O
had	O
leisure	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
our	O
time	O
for	O
the	O
main	O
work	O
of	O
new	O
discoveries	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
leave	O
it	O
no	O
more	O
to	O
under	O
officers	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
before	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
gave	O
the	O
command	O
of	O
the	O
shallop	O
that	O
traded	O
with	O
the	O
king	O
and	O
queen	O
,	O
as	O
above	O
,	O
to	O
a	O
midshipman	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
sorry	O
for	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
fellow	O
did	O
his	O
business	O
very	O
well	O
too	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
not	O
to	O
trust	O
any	O
one	O
now	O
but	O
myself	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
the	O
two	O
shallops	O
and	O
went	O
across	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
great	O
river	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
shore	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
country	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
there	O
.	O

For	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
much	O
the	O
same	O
with	O
that	O
part	O
where	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
before	O
;	O
with	O
this	O
difference	O
only	O
,	O
whereas	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
other	O
place	O
gold	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
had	O
in	O
plenty	O
,	O
but	O
here	O
was	O
none	O
we	O
could	O
find	O
;	O
nor	O
did	O
we	O
perceive	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
had	O
any	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
this	O
river	O
,	O
or	O
inlet	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
about	O
four	O
leagues	O
over	O
where	O
I	O
crossed	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
about	O
three	O
leagues	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
within	O
the	O
inlet	O
itself	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
weather	O
being	O
very	O
calm	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
flood-tide	O
running	O
sharp	O
,	O
we	O
let	O
our	O
boat	O
drive	O
up	O
,	O
in	O
our	O
crossing	O
,	O
about	O
two	O
leagues	O
more	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
channel	O
grew	O
narrow	O
so	O
fast	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
land	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
full	O
a	O
league	O
over	O
;	O
that	O
about	O
three	O
leagues	O
farther	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
a	O
mere	O
river	O
,	O
not	O
above	O
as	O
broad	O
as	O
the	O
Thames	O
at	O
Blackwall	PNM
.	O

We	O
found	O
it	O
a	O
steep	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
observing	O
a	O
little	O
creek	O
very	O
convenient	O
for	O
our	O
purpose	O
,	O
we	O
ran	O
in	O
our	O
boats	O
among	O
some	O
flags	O
or	O
rushes	O
,	O
and	O
laid	O
them	O
as	O
soft	O
and	O
as	O
safe	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
a	O
dock	O
;	O
we	O
went	O
all	O
on	O
shore	O
immediately	O
,	O
except	O
two	O
men	O
in	O
each	O
boat	O
left	O
to	O
guard	O
our	O
provisions	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
for	O
arms	O
,	O
every	O
man	O
a	O
musket	O
,	O
a	O
pistol	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
cutlass	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
each	O
boat	O
we	O
had	O
six	O
half	O
pikes	O
,	O
to	O
use	O
as	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
occasion	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
also	O
every	O
man	O
a	O
hatchet	O
,	O
hung	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
frog	O
at	O
his	O
belt	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
each	O
boat	O
a	O
broad	O
axe	O
and	O
a	O
saw	O

We	O
were	O
furnished	O
with	O
strings	O
of	O
beads	O
,	O
bits	O
of	O
glass	O
,	O
glass	O
rings	O

looking-glasses	O

in	O
great	O

.	O

We	O
were	O
no	O
sooner	O
on	O
shore	O
but	O
we	O
found	O
people	O
in	O
abundance	O
;	O
for	O
there	O
were	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
,	O
small	O
towns	O
within	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
of	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
suppose	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
the	O
more	O
people	O
about	O
us	O
,	O
because	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
understood	O
afterwards	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
seen	O
us	O
before	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
seen	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
by	O
putting	O
our	O
fingers	O
to	O
our	O
mouths	O
,	O
and	O
moving	O
our	O
chaps	O
as	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
eating	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
wanted	O
provisions	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
hung	O
up	O
a	O
white	O
flag	O
for	O
a	O
truce	O
.	O

They	O
presently	O
understood	O
the	O
first	O
signal	O
,	O
but	O
knew	O
nothing	O
of	O
the	O
last	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
to	O
provisions	O
,	O
just	O
as	O
had	O
been	O
the	O
case	O
before	O
,	O
they	O
brought	O
us	O
out	O
roots	O
and	O
fruits	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
they	O
ate	O
themselves	O
,	O
but	O
such	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
before	O
.	O

Some	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
were	O
very	O
sweet	O
and	O
good	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
we	O
boiled	O
them	O
they	O
tasted	O
much	O
like	O
an	O
English	O
parsnip	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
gave	O
them	O
strings	O
of	O
beads	O
,	O
pieces	O
of	O
glass	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
things	O
as	O
we	O
remarked	O
they	O
were	O
fond	O
of	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
observed	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
very	O
inoffensive	O
and	O
sincere	O
;	O
not	O
quarrelsome	O
,	O
nor	O
treacherous	O
,	O
nor	O
mischievous	O
in	O
the	O
least	O
.	O

And	O
we	O
took	O
care	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
to	O
let	O
them	O
know	O
the	O
use	O
or	O
manner	O
of	O
our	O
fire-arms	O
for	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
;	O
neither	O
was	O
there	O
one	O
piece	O
fired	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
we	O
were	O
among	O
the	O
other	O
people	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
had	O
so	O
much	O
gold	O
.	O

If	O
there	O
had	O
,	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
very	O
probable	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
fled	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
in	O
spite	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
good	O
usage	O
we	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
have	O
shown	O
them	O

The	O
people	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
were	O
not	O
so	O
rich	O
in	O
gold	O
as	O
those	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
before	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
found	O
them	O
much	O
better	O
stored	O
with	O
provisions	O
;	O
for	O
besides	O
deer	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
great	O
plenty	O
and	O
variety	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
some	O
of	O
a	O
sort	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
besides	O
an	O
infinite	O
number	O
of	O
those	O
rabbits	O
I	O
have	O
mentioned	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
our	O
hares	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
do	O
not	O
burrow	O
in	O
the	O
ground	O
as	O
our	O
rabbits	O
do	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
also	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
sheep	O
,	O
large	O
,	O
-LRB-	O
like	O
those	O
of	O
Peru	PNM
,	O
where	O
they	O
are	O
used	O
to	O
carry	O
burdens	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
good	O
.	O

They	O
have	O
no	O
wool	O
nor	O
horns	O
,	O
but	O
are	O
rather	O
hairy	O
like	O
a	O
goat	O
;	O
nor	O
should	O
I	O
call	O
them	O
sheep	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
their	O
flesh	O
eats	O
like	O
mutton	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
else	O
to	O
call	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
natives	O
called	O
them	O
huttash	O
;	O
but	O
what	O
breed	O
,	O
or	O
from	O
what	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
or	O
whether	O
peculiar	O
to	O
this	O
division	O
alone	O
,	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
their	O
flesh	O
was	O
very	O
agreeable	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
fat	O
and	O
good	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
the	O
Indians	O
were	O
mightily	O
pleased	O
with	O
the	O
price	O
we	O
paid	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
goods	O
we	O
paid	O
them	O
in	O

they	O
brought	O
us	O
more	O
of	O
these	O
huttashes	O
than	O
we	O
knew	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
I	O
can	O
calculate	O
the	O
rate	O
,	O
I	O
suppose	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
them	O
for	O
about	O
eight-pence	O
,	O
or	O
sometimes	O
not	O
above	O
sixpence	O
cost	O
each	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
would	O
give	O
us	O
one	O
very	O
thankfully	O
for	O
a	O
string	O
or	O
two	O
of	O
small	O
beads	O
,	O
and	O
think	O
themselves	O
mighty	O
well	O
paid	O

I	O
found	O
them	O
so	O
plentiful	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
easy	O
to	O
come	O
at	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
short	O
I	O
sent	O
fifty	O
of	O
them	O
alive	O
,	O
tied	O
neck	O
and	O
heels	O
,	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
shallops	O
back	O
to	O
our	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
ordered	O
them	O
to	O
send	O
their	O
long-boats	O
over	O
for	O
more	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
little	O
a	O
way	O
over	O
,	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
find	O
they	O
had	O
any	O
of	O
them	O
on	O
that	O
side	O
the	O
river	O

We	O
did	O
the	O
Indians	O
another	O
piece	O
of	O
service	O
,	O
for	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
gave	O
us	O
meat	O
,	O
we	O
taught	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
cooks	O

for	O
we	O
showed	O
them	O
how	O
to	O
roast	O
it	O
upon	O
a	O
stick	O
or	O
spit	O
before	O
the	O
fire	O
;	O
whereas	O
they	O
ate	O
all	O
their	O
meat	O
before	O

either	O
stewed	O
in	O
earthen	O
pots	O
over	O
the	O

with	O
herbs	O

such	O
as	O
we	O
did	O
not	O

or	O
thrown	O
on	O
burning	O
fuel	O
of	O
green	O
wood	O

which	O
always	O
made	O
it	O
taste	O
and	O
stink	O
of	O
the	O
smoke	O
most	O
intolerably	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
opportunity	O
now	O
to	O
converse	O
with	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
the	O
river	O

and	O
we	O
found	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
not	O
only	O
different	O
nations	O
,	O
but	O
of	O
different	O
speech	O
and	O
different	O

These	O
on	O
the	O
south	O
side	O

where	O
I	O
now	O
was	O
,	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
best	O
furnished	O
with	O
provisions	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
the	O
greatest	O
plenty	O
.	O

But	O
those	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
appeared	O
better	O
clothed	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
more	O
civilized	O
sort	O
of	O
people	O
;	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
,	O
seemed	O
to	O
have	O
in	O
their	O
countenances	O
something	O
more	O
agreeable	O

However	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
near	O
neighbours	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
river	O
only	O
parted	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
very	O
much	O

That	O
which	O
seemed	O
most	O
strange	O
to	O
me	O
was	O

that	O
we	O
found	O
they	O
had	O
little	O
knowledge	O
or	O
communication	O
one	O
with	O
another	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
indeed	O
some	O
boats	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
small	O

and	O
rather	O
served	O
to	O
just	O
waft	O
them	O
over	O

to	O
fish	O
in	O
them	O

than	O
for	O
any	O

for	O
we	O
found	O
none	O
that	O
could	O
carry	O
above	O

those	O
very	O
oddly	O
made	O

that	O
they	O
would	O
paddle	O

them	O

For	O

He	O

his	O

Doubtless	O
those	O

who	O
have	O
any	O

of	O

must	O
represent	O
him	O

something	O
that	O

paying	O
their	O

in	O

We	O
found	O
those	O

not	O
so	O
agreeably	O
as	O
those	O
we	O

above	O

and	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
clothing	O
of	O
these	O
were	O
generally	O
made	O
of	O
the	O
skins	O
of	O
beasts	O

but	O
very	O
artfully	O
put	O
together	O

so	O
that	O
though	O
they	O
had	O
neither	O
needle	O
nor	O
thread	O
,	O
yet	O
they	O
had	O
the	O

plant	O
as	O
I	O
mentioned	O
before	O

the	O
stalk	O
of	O
which	O
would	O
so	O
strongly	O
tie	O

a	O

that	O
they	O
peeled	O
it	O
off	O
thicker	O
or	O
finer	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
occasion	O

and	O
made	O
use	O
of	O

of	O

to	O
tie	O

and	O
make	O

as	O
if	O
it	O

woven	O
in	O
a	O

We	O
found	O
several	O
of	O
these	O
people	O
had	O
little	O
bits	O
of	O
gold	O
about	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
we	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
know	O
where	O
they	O
got	O
it	O

and	O
where	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
had	O
,	O
they	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O

pointing	O
to	O
the	O

on	O
the	O
north	O

so	O
that	O
we	O
had	O

it	O

fallen	O
upon	O
the	O
right	O
gold	O
coast	O
in	O
our	O
first	O
coming	O

They	O
pointed	O
indeed	O
likewise	O
to	O
some	O
very	O
high	O
mountains	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
saw	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
south-west	O

so	O
that	O
it	O
seems	O
as	O
if	O
there	O
was	O
gold	O
found	O
that	O
way	O
also	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
appeared	O
the	O
people	O
here	O
had	O
not	O
much	O
of	O
it	O
for	O
their	O
share	O
.	O

The	O
men	O
here	O
had	O
bows	O
and	O
arrows	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
used	O
them	O
so	O
dexterously	O
,	O
that	O
a	O
wild	O
goose	O
flying	O
over	O
our	O
heads	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
shot	O
it	O
quite	O
through	O
with	O
an	O

One	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
was	O
so	O
provoked	O
to	O
see	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
to	O
outdo	O
him	O
,	O
that	O

some	O

,	O
seeing	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
ducks	O
flying	O
fair	O
for	O
a	O
mark	O
,	O
he	O
presented	O
his	O
piece	O

and	O
shot	O
them	O
both	O
flying	O

I	O
was	O
very	O
angry	O
when	O
I	O
heard	O
the	O
gun	O
;	O
had	O
I	O
been	O
there	O
he	O
had	O
never	O
got	O
leave	O
to	O
fire	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
done	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
pleased	O
well	O
enough	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
effect	O
it	O
had	O
upon	O
these	O
poor	O
innocent	O
well-meaning	O
people	O
.	O

At	O
first	O
it	O
frightened	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
degree	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
may	O
truly	O
say	O
it	O
frightened	O
them	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
senses	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
that	O
were	O
near	O
it	O
started	O
so	O
violently	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
fell	O
down	O
and	O
lay	O
speechless	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
;	O
those	O
that	O
were	O
farther	O
off	O
ran	O
away	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
some	O
new	O
kind	O
of	O
lightning	O

thunder	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
earth	O
instead	O
of	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
clouds	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
they	O
saw	O
the	O
two	O
creatures	O
fall	O
down	O
dead	O
from	O
above	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
see	O
nothing	O
that	O
flew	O
upward	O
to	O
kill	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
perfectly	O
astonished	O
,	O
and	O
laid	O
their	O
two	O
hands	O
on	O
their	O
breasts	O
and	O
looked	O
up	O
to	O
heaven	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
saying	O
their	O
prayers	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
solemn	O
manner	O
imaginable	O

However	O
,	O
this	O
accident	O
gave	O
them	O
terrible	O
ideas	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
afraid	O
at	O
first	O
they	O
would	O
run	O
all	O
away	O
from	O
us	O
through	O
fear	O

I	O
therefore	O
used	O
them	O
after	O
it	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
kindness	O
and	O
tenderness	O
imaginable	O

gave	O
them	O
every	O

some	O

other	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
though	O
of	O
no	O
value	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
exceedingly	O
fond	O
of	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
asked	O
nothing	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
return	O
but	O
provisions	O

of	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
great	O
plenty	O

gave	O
us	O
enough	O
every	O

to	O
satisfy	O
us	O

As	O
for	O

they	O
had	O
none	O

which	O
we	O
had	O
in	O
the	O

part	O
of	O

they	O
had	O
a	O
root	O
which	O
they	O
steeped	O
in	O
water	O

and	O
made	O
it	O
taste	O
hot	O
,	O
as	O
if	O

which	O

our	O

neither	O

But	O
when	O
the	O
man	O
who	O
had	O
the	O
child	O
in	O
his	O
arms	O
had	O
been	O
told	O
by	O
signs	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
mother	O
,	O
he	O
beckoned	O
to	O
have	O
her	O
come	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
came	O
,	O
but	O
trembling	O
for	O
fear	O
.	O

Then	O
he	O
took	O
the	O
child	O
,	O
and	O
kissing	O
it	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
times	O
,	O
gave	O
it	O
her	O
into	O
her	O
arms	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
is	O
impossible	O
to	O
express	O
by	O
words	O
the	O
agony	O
the	O
poor	O
woman	O
was	O
in	O
;	O
she	O
took	O
the	O
child	O
,	O
and	O
holding	O
it	O
in	O
her	O
arms	O
fixed	O
her	O
eyes	O
upon	O
it	O
without	O
motion	O
,	O
or	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
without	O
life	O
,	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
while	O
;	O
then	O
she	O
took	O
it	O
and	O
embraced	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
passionate	O
manner	O
imaginable	O
;	O
when	O
this	O
was	O
over	O
,	O
she	O
fell	O
a-crying	O
so	O
vehemently	O
till	O
she	O
sobbed	O
;	O
and	O
all	O
this	O
while	O
spoke	O
not	O
one	O
word	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
crying	O
had	O
given	O
sufficient	O
vent	O
to	O
her	O
passion	O
,	O
then	O
she	O
fell	O
a-dancing	O
and	O
making	O
a	O
strange	O
odd	O
noise	O
,	O
that	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
described	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
she	O
left	O
the	O
child	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
our	O
men	O
were	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
man	O
that	O
brought	O
her	O
child	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
she	O
came	O
up	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
she	O
fell	O
flat	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
described	O
above	O
the	O
queen	O
and	O
her	O
women	O
did	O
,	O
and	O
up	O
again	O
immediately	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
she	O
did	O
three	O
times	O
,	O
which	O
it	O
seems	O
was	O
her	O
acknowledgment	O
to	O
him	O
for	O
bringing	O
it	O
back	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
for	O
her	O
gratitude	O
did	O
not	O
end	O
here	O
,	O
she	O
came	O
down	O
to	O
our	O
tent	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
with	O
her	O
two	O
sheep	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
back-burden	O
of	O
roots	O
of	O
the	O
kind	O
which	O
I	O
said	O
the	O
natives	O
steep	O
in	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
several	O
fruits	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
two	O
men	O
who	O
came	O
with	O
her	O
could	O
carry	O
,	O
and	O
these	O
she	O
gave	O
all	O
to	O
the	O
man	O
who	O
had	O
brought	O
back	O
her	O
child	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
were	O
so	O
moved	O
at	O
the	O
affectionate	O
carriage	O
of	O
this	O
poor	O
woman	O
to	O
her	O
infant	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
told	O
me	O
it	O
brought	O
tears	O
from	O
their	O
eyes	O
.	O

The	O
man	O
who	O
received	O
the	O
present	O
took	O
the	O
woman	O
and	O
dressed	O
her	O
up	O
almost	O
as	O
fine	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
the	O
child	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
went	O
home	O
like	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
queen	O
among	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
observed	O
while	O
we	O
stayed	O
here	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
most	O
incomparable	O
soil	O
;	O
that	O
the	O
earth	O
was	O
a	O
fat	O
loamy	O
mould	O
;	O
that	O
the	O
herbage	O
was	O
strong	O
;	O
that	O
the	O
grass	O
in	O
some	O
places	O
was	O
very	O
flourishing	O
and	O
good	O
,	O
being	O
as	O
high	O
as	O
our	O
mid-thigh	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
air	O
was	O
neither	O
very	O
hot	O
,	O
nor	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
believed	O
,	O
very	O
cold	O
.	O

We	O
made	O
an	O
experiment	O
of	O
the	O
fruitfulness	O
of	O
the	O
soil	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
took	O
some	O
white	O
peas	O
,	O
and	O
digging	O
the	O
ground	O
up	O
with	O
a	O
spade	O
,	O
we	O
sowed	O
some	O
,	O
and	O
before	O
we	O
went	O
away	O
we	O
saw	O
them	O
come	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ground	O
again	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
in	O
about	O
nine	O
days	O
.	O

We	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
let	O
them	O
grow	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
gathered	O
them	O
they	O
were	O
good	O
to	O
eat	O
;	O
we	O
also	O
sowed	O
some	O
English	O
wheat	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
them	O
know	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
what	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
them	O
both	O
was	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
make	O
no	O
doubt	O
but	O
they	O
have	O
been	O
better	O
acquainted	O
with	O
,	O
both	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
by	O
an	O
occasion	O
which	O
followed	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
were	O
so	O
fond	O
of	O
this	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
pleased	O
with	O
the	O
temper	O
of	O
the	O
people	O

the	O
fruitfulness	O
of	O
the	O
soil	O
,	O
and	O
agreeableness	O
of	O
the	O
climate	O
,	O
that	O
about	O
twenty	O
of	O
them	O
offered	O
me	O

if	O
I	O
would	O
give	O
them	O
my	O
word	O
to	O
come	O
again	O

or	O
send	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
relieve	O
and	O
supply	O
them	O
with	O
necessaries	O

they	O
would	O
go	O
on	O

begin	O
a	O

live	O
all	O
their	O

Nay	O
,	O
after	O
this	O

their	O
number	O

three-and-thirty	O

they	O

stay	O
at	O
all	O
hazards	O

not	O
doubting	O

as	O
they	O

me	O

they	O
should	O
come	O

England	PNM
again	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
sloop	O
full	O
of	O

I	O
was	O
not	O
very	O
willing	O
to	O
encourage	O
either	O
of	O
these	O
proposals	O
,	O
because	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
might	O
perhaps	O
find	O
a	O
place	O
as	O
fit	O
to	O
settle	O
a	O
colony	O
in	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
home	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
not	O
at	O
such	O
an	O
excessive	O
distance	O
from	O
England	PNM
,	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
scarce	O
possible	O
ever	O
to	O
relieve	O
them	O

This	O
satisfied	O
them	O
pretty	O
well	O

and	O
they	O
were	O

to	O
give	O
over	O
the	O
project	O
;	O
and	O
yet	O
,	O
at	O

,	O
which	O
was	O
more	O

than	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
five	O
of	O
our	O

and	O
a	O
boy	O
ran	O
away	O
from	O
us	O

went	O
on	O

what	O
sort	O
of	O
life	O
they	O
led	O

how	O
they	O

we	O

were	O
too	O
far	O
off	O
us	O

They	O
took	O
a	O
small	O

with	O
them	O

it	O

I	O

I	O
make	O
no	O

they	O

a	O

I	O
have	O
something	O

our	O

We	O
had	O

six-and-twenty	O

we	O
had	O

ten	O

about	O

then	O
we	O

to	O
the	O
sheathing	O

We	O
stored	O

got	O
nothing	O

We	O

the	O
six-and-twentieth	O

in	O

we	O

In	O
all	O
this	O

we	O

two	O

the	O

the	O

slackening	O

we	O

we	O
lay	O
by	O

morning	O

when	O
being	O
fair	O
with	O

The	O

rowed	O
in	O

found	O
a	O

was	O
good	O

very	O

We	O
went	O
in	O

and	O
after	O
we	O
were	O
moored	O
sent	O
our	O
boat	O
on	O

to	O
look	O
for	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
else	O
the	O

afforded	O

Our	O
men	O
found	O
water	O

and	O
a	O
good	O
sort	O
of	O
country	O

but	O
saw	O
no	O

and	O
,	O
upon	O
coasting	O
a	O
little	O
both	O
ways	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O

they	O
found	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
island	O

and	O
without	O

;	O
but	O
said	O
that	O
about	O
three	O

seemed	O
to	O

where	O
it	O
was	O
more	O
likely	O

should	O
make	O
some	O
discovery	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
we	O
filled	O
water	O
again	O

and	O
shot	O
some	O
ducks	O

and	O
the	O
day	O
after	O
weighed	O

stood	O
over	O

it	O

Here	O

using	O
the	O

caution	O

we	O
always	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
of	O
sounding	O
the	O
coast	O

we	O
found	O
a	O
bold	O

very	O
good	O
anchor	O

in	O
six-and-twenty	O
to	O
thirty	O
fathoms	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
on	O
shore	O

we	O
found	O
people	O

of	O
a	O
quite	O
different	O

those	O

met	O

surprised	O
at	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O

not	O

not	O
for	O

and	O
no	O
sooner	O
were	O
we	O
on	O
shore	O
but	O
they	O
saluted	O
us	O
with	O
their	O
bows	O

We	O
made	O
signals	O
of	O
truce	O
to	O
them	O

but	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
us	O

we	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
to	O
offer	O
them	O
more	O

the	O
muzzles	O

We	O
could	O
easily	O
perceive	O
that	O
the	O

terrified	O
them	O

they	O

next	O

,	O
and	O
anchored	O
under	O
the	O
shore	O
of	O
this	O
last	O
land	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
persuaded	O
was	O
really	O
the	O
main	O
.	O

We	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
here	O
peaceably	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
neither	O
saw	O
any	O
people	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
any	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
charming	O
pleasant	O
valley	O
,	O
of	O
about	O
ten	O
or	O
eleven	O
miles	O
long	O
,	O
and	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
miles	O
broad	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
it	O
was	O
surrounded	O
with	O
mountains	O
,	O
which	O
reached	O
the	O
full	O
length	O
,	O
running	O
parallel	O
with	O
the	O
valley	O
,	O
and	O
closing	O
it	O
in	O
to	O
the	O
sea	O
at	O
both	O
ends	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
natural	O
park	O
,	O
having	O
the	O
sea	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
mountains	O
in	O
a	O
semicircle	O
round	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
it	O

These	O
hills	O
were	O
so	O
high	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
ways	O
so	O
untrod	O
and	O
so	O
steep	O
,	O
that	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
curious	O
enough	O
to	O
have	O
climbed	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
could	O
find	O
no	O
way	O
that	O
was	O
practicable	O
to	O
get	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
attempts	O
gave	O
it	O
over	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
vale	O
we	O
found	O
abundance	O
of	O
deer	O
,	O
and	O
abundance	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
kind	O
of	O
sheep	O
which	O
I	O
mentioned	O
lately	O

We	O
killed	O
as	O
many	O
of	O
both	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
occasion	O
for	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
finding	O
nothing	O
here	O
worth	O
our	O
staying	O
any	O
longer	O
for	O
,	O
except	O
that	O
we	O
saw	O
something	O
like	O
wild	O
rice	O
growing	O
here	O
,	O
we	O
weighed	O
after	O
three	O
days	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
away	O
still	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
not	O
sailed	O
above	O
two	O
days	O
with	O
little	O
wind	O
and	O
an	O
easy	O
sail	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
perceived	O
this	O
also	O
was	O
an	O
island	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
a	O
large	O
one	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
by	O
our	O
account	O
,	O
we	O
sailed	O
near	O
a	O
hundred	O
and	O
fifty	O
miles	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
south	O
part	O
a	O
flat	O
pleasant	O
country	O
enough	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
said	O
they	O
saw	O
people	O
upon	O
it	O
on	O
the	O
south	O
side	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
went	O
not	O
on	O
shore	O
there	O
any	O
more	O
.	O

Steering	O
due	O
south	O
from	O
hence	O
in	O
quest	O
of	O
the	O
mainland	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
eleven	O
days	O
more	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
nothing	O
significant	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
upon	O
a	O
fair	O
observation	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
47	O
°	O
8	O
'	O
south	O
;	O
then	O
I	O
altered	O
my	O
course	O
a	O
little	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
,	O
finding	O
no	O
land	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
weather	O
very	O
cold	O
,	O
and	O
going	O
on	O
with	O
a	O
fresh	O
gale	O
at	O
south-south-west	O
for	O
four	O
days	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
land	O
again	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
now	O
to	O
the	O
east-north-east	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
gotten	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
may	O
say	O
,	O
beyond	O
it	O
.	O

We	O
fell	O
in	O
with	O
this	O
land	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
perceived	O
till	O
we	O
were	O
within	O
half	O
a	O
league	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
very	O
much	O
alarmed	O
us	O
,	O
the	O
land	O
being	O
low	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
found	O
our	O
error	O
,	O
we	O
brought	O
to	O
and	O
stood	O
off	O
and	O
on	O
till	O
morning	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
shore	O
lie	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
under	O
our	O
larboard	O
bow	O
,	O
within	O
a	O
mile	O
and	O
a	O
quarter	O
distance	O
,	O
the	O
land	O
low	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
sea	O
deep	O
and	O
soft	O
ground	O
.	O

We	O
came	O
to	O
anchor	O
immediately	O
,	O
and	O
sent	O
our	O
shallops	O
to	O
sound	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
men	O
found	O
very	O
good	O
riding	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
bay	O
,	O
under	O
the	O
shelter	O
of	O
two	O
points	O
of	O
land	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
which	O
made	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
hook	O
,	O
under	O
which	O
we	O
lay	O
secure	O
from	O
all	O
winds	O
that	O
could	O
blow	O
,	O
in	O
seventeen	O
fathoms	O
good	O
ground	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
good	O
observation	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
ourselves	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
50	O
°	O
21	O
'	O
.	O

Our	O
next	O
work	O
was	O
to	O
find	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
boats	O
going	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
found	O
plenty	O
of	O
good	O
water	O
and	O
some	O
cattle	O
,	O
but	O
told	O
us	O
they	O
could	O
give	O
no	O
account	O
what	O
the	O
cattle	O
were	O
,	O
or	O
what	O
they	O
were	O
like	O
.	O

In	O
searching	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
we	O
soon	O
found	O
this	O
was	O
an	O
island	O
also	O
,	O
about	O
eleven	O
leagues	O
in	O
length	O
,	O
from	O
north-west	O
to	O
south-east	O
,	O
what	O
breadth	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
also	O
saw	O
some	O
signs	O
of	O
inhabitants	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
six	O
men	O
appeared	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
but	O
would	O
take	O
notice	O
of	O
no	O
signals	O
,	O
and	O
fled	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
our	O
men	O
advanced	O
.	O

Our	O
people	O
went	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
were	O
they	O
lay	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
they	O
had	O
made	O
a	O
fire	O
of	O
some	O
dry	O
wood	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
laid	O
there	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
suppose	O
,	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
though	O
without	O
covering	O
.	O

They	O
found	O
two	O
pieces	O
of	O
old	O
ragged	O
skins	O
of	O
deer	O
,	O
which	O
looked	O
as	O
if	O
worn	O
out	O
by	O
some	O
that	O
had	O
used	O
them	O
for	O
clothing	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
piece	O
of	O
a	O
skin	O
of	O
some	O
other	O
creature	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
rolled	O
up	O
into	O
a	O
cap	O
for	O
the	O
head	O
;	O
also	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
arrows	O
of	O
about	O
four	O
feet	O
long	O
,	O
very	O
thick	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
of	O
a	O
hard	O
and	O
heavy	O
wood	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
must	O
have	O
very	O
large	O
and	O
strong	O
bows	O
to	O
shoot	O
such	O
arrows	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
must	O
be	O
men	O
of	O
an	O
uncommon	O
strength	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
wandered	O
about	O
the	O
country	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
days	O
,	O
with	O
less	O
caution	O
than	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
their	O
situation	O
required	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
among	O
a	O
people	O
of	O
an	O
innocent	O
,	O
inoffensive	O
temper	O
here	O
,	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
but	O
among	O
a	O
wild	O
,	O
untractable	O
nation	O
,	O
that	O
perhaps	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
creatures	O
in	O
their	O
own	O
likeness	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
no	O
thought	O
of	O
themselves	O
but	O
of	O
being	O
killed	O
and	O
destroyed	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
had	O
no	O
thought	O
of	O
those	O
they	O
had	O
seen	O
but	O
as	O
of	O
enemies	O
,	O
whom	O
they	O
must	O
either	O
destroy	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
able	O
,	O
or	O
escape	O
from	O
them	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
got	O
no	O
harm	O
,	O
neither	O
would	O
the	O
natives	O
ever	O
appear	O
to	O
accept	O
any	O
kindnesses	O
from	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
no	O
business	O
here	O
,	O
after	O
we	O
found	O
what	O
sort	O
of	O
people	O
they	O
were	O
who	O
inhabited	O
this	O
place	O
;	O
so	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
taken	O
in	O
fresh	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
caught	O
some	O
fish	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
good	O
store	O
in	O
the	O
bay	O
or	O
harbour	O
where	O
we	O
rode	O
,	O
we	O
prepared	O
to	O
be	O
gone	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
first	O
oysters	O
that	O
we	O
saw	O
anywhere	O
in	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
our	O
men	O
found	O
them	O
but	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
sail	O
,	O
they	O
made	O
great	O
entreaty	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
let	O
them	O
stay	O
one	O
day	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
quantity	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
they	O
being	O
very	O
refreshing	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
nourishing	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
men	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
was	O
more	O
easily	O
prevailed	O
with	O
to	O
stay	O
,	O
when	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
brought	O
me	O
,	O
out	O
of	O
one	O
oyster	O
that	O
he	O
happened	O
to	O
open	O
,	O
a	O
true	O
oriental	O
pearl	O
,	O
so	O
large	O
and	O
so	O
fine	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
sold	O
it	O
,	O
since	O
my	O
return	O
,	O
for	O
three-and-fifty	O
pounds	O
.	O

After	O
taking	O
this	O
oyster	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
all	O
our	O
boats	O
out	O
a	O
dredging	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
two	O
days	O
'	O
time	O
so	O
great	O
a	O
quantity	O
there	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
our	O
men	O
had	O
taken	O
above	O
fifty	O
bushels	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
very	O
large	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
were	O
surprised	O
and	O
disappointed	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
opening	O
all	O
those	O
oysters	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
not	O
one	O
pearl	O
,	O
small	O
or	O
great	O
,	O
of	O
any	O
kind	O
whatever	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
concluded	O
that	O
the	O
other	O
was	O
a	O
lucky	O
hit	O
only	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
perhaps	O
there	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
any	O
more	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
in	O
these	O
seas	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
were	O
musing	O
on	O
the	O
oddness	O
of	O
this	O
accident	O
,	O
the	O
boatswain	O
of	O
the	O
Madagascar	O
ship	O
,	O
whose	O
boat	O
's	O
crew	O
had	O
brought	O
in	O
the	O
great	O
oyster	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
pearl	O
was	O
found	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
examining	O
the	O
matter	O
,	O
came	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
true	O
that	O
their	O
boat	O
had	O
brought	O
in	O
the	O
oyster	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
before	O
they	O
went	O
out	O
a	O
dredging	O
in	O
the	O
offing	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
their	O
boat	O
took	O
these	O
oysters	O
on	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
_	O
shoring	O
_	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
called	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
coasting	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
find	O
anything	O
worth	O
their	O
labour	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
afterwards	O
the	O
boats	O
went	O
a	O
dredging	O
in	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
where	O
we	O
rode	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
,	O
finding	O
good	O
store	O
of	O
oysters	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
gone	O
no	O
farther	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
intelligence	O
we	O
ordered	O
all	O
hands	O
to	O
dredging	O
again	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
narrow	O
channel	O
,	O
between	O
this	O
island	O
and	O
a	O
little	O
cluster	O
of	O
islands	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
together	O
extended	O
west	O
,	O
the	O
channel	O
where	O
our	O
men	O
fished	O
might	O
be	O
about	O
a	O
league	O
over	O
,	O
or	O
something	O
better	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
water	O
about	O
five	O
or	O
seven	O
fathoms	O
deep	O

They	O
came	O
home	O
well	O
tired	O
and	O
ill	O
pleased	O
,	O
having	O
taken	O
nothing	O
near	O
so	O
many	O
oysters	O
,	O
as	O
before	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
much	O
better	O
pleased	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
in	O
opening	O
them	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
hundred	O
and	O
fifty-eight	O
pearls	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
perfect	O
colour	O
,	O

of	O
extraordinary	O

besides	O
double	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
a	O
less	O
size	O

and	O
irregular	O
shape	O

This	O
quickened	O
our	O
diligence	O
,	O
and	O
encouraged	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
promised	O
the	O

two	O
pieces	O

eight	O
to	O
each	O

above	O
his	O

Upon	O
this	O
they	O
spread	O
themselves	O
among	O
the	O
islands	O

and	O
fished	O
for	O
a	O
whole	O
week	O

I	O
got	O
such	O
a	O
quantity	O

had	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
the	O
officers	O
who	O
went	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
concealed	O
a	O
considerable	O
quantity	O
among	O
themselves	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
fit	O
to	O
inquire	O
very	O
strictly	O
after	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
.	O

Had	O
we	O
been	O
nearer	O
home	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
at	O
so	O
very	O
great	O
an	O
expense	O
,	O
as	O
three	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
many	O
men	O
at	O
victuals	O
and	O
wages	O
,	O
or	O
had	O
we	O
been	O
where	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
left	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
vessels	O
to	O
fish	O
,	O
and	O
have	O
come	O
to	O
them	O
again	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
given	O
it	O
over	O
while	O
there	O
had	O
been	O
an	O
oyster	O
left	O
in	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
or	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
come	O
at	O
:	O
but	O
as	O
things	O
stood	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
give	O
it	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
to	O
sea	O
.	O

But	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
just	O
giving	O
orders	O
,	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
came	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
officers	O
in	O
the	O
three	O
ships	O
had	O
joined	O
together	O
to	O
make	O
an	O
humble	O
petition	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
give	O
them	O
one	O
day	O
to	O
fish	O
for	O
themselves	O
;	O
that	O
the	O
men	O
had	O
promised	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
consent	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
work	O
for	O
them	O
gratis	O
;	O
and	O
likewise	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
gained	O
anything	O
considerable	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
account	O
for	O
as	O
much	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
wages	O
as	O
should	O
defray	O
the	O
ships	O
'	O
expense	O
,	O
victuals	O
,	O
and	O
wages	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
day	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
so	O
small	O
a	O
request	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
readily	O
consented	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
them	O
I	O
would	O
give	O
them	O
three	O
days	O
,	O
provided	O
they	O
were	O
willing	O
to	O
give	O
the	O
men	O
a	O
largess	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
in	O
proportion	O
to	O
their	O
gain	O
.	O

This	O
they	O
agreed	O
to	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
work	O
they	O
went	O
;	O
but	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
that	O
the	O
fellows	O
worked	O
with	O
a	O
better	O
will	O
,	O
or	O
that	O
the	O
officers	O
gave	O
them	O
more	O
liquor	O
,	O
or	O
that	O
they	O
found	O
a	O
new	O
bank	O
of	O
oysters	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
found	O
out	O
before	O
,	O
but	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
officers	O
got	O
as	O
many	O
pearls	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
extraordinary	O
size	O
and	O
beauty	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
afterwards	O
sold	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
Peru	PNM
,	O
for	O
three	O
thousand	O
two	O
hundred	O
and	O
seventeen	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
had	O
done	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
it	O
was	O
but	O
right	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
made	O
so	O
good	O
a	O
purchase	O
for	O
themselves	O
by	O
the	O
labour	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
the	O
men	O
should	O
have	O
the	O
consideration	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
proposed	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

But	O
now	O
I	O
would	O
make	O
another	O
condition	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
stay	O
three	O
days	O
more	O
,	O
and	O
whatever	O
was	O
caught	O
in	O
these	O
three	O
days	O
should	O
be	O
shared	O
among	O
the	O
men	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
port	O
we	O
came	O
at	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
could	O
be	O
sold	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
men	O
who	O
had	O
now	O
been	O
out	O
so	O
long	O
might	O
have	O
something	O
to	O
buy	O
clothes	O
and	O
liquors	O
,	O
without	O
anticipating	O
their	O
wages	O
;	O
but	O
then	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
condition	O
with	O
the	O
men	O
too	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
that	O
whatever	O
was	O
taken	O
they	O
should	O
deposit	O
it	O
in	O
my	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
the	O
joint	O
trust	O
of	O
three	O
men	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
choosing	O
,	O
one	O
out	O
of	O
each	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
sell	O
the	O
pearl	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
should	O
divide	O
the	O
money	O
among	O
them	O
equally	O
,	O
that	O
so	O
there	O
might	O
be	O
no	O
quarrelling	O
or	O
discontent	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
should	O
play	O
any	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
away	O
.	O

These	O
engagements	O
they	O
all	O
came	O
willingly	O
into	O
,	O
and	O
away	O
they	O
went	O
a	O
dredging	O
,	O
relieving	O
one	O
another	O
punctually	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
three	O
whole	O
days	O
every	O
man	O
worked	O
an	O
equal	O
share	O
of	O
hours	O
with	O
the	O
rest	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
poor	O
men	O
had	O
not	O
so	O
good	O
luck	O
for	O
themselves	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
for	O
their	O
officers	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
they	O
got	O
a	O
considerable	O
quantity	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
very	O
fine	O
ones	O
;	O
among	O
the	O
rest	O
they	O
had	O
two	O
in	O
the	O
exact	O
shape	O
of	O
a	O
pear	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
exactly	O
matched	O
;	O
and	O
these	O
they	O
would	O
needs	O
make	O
me	O
a	O
present	O
of	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
kind	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
proposal	O
for	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
have	O
paid	O
for	O
them	O
two	O
hundred	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
,	O
but	O
one	O
and	O
all	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
paid	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
certainly	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
much	O
troubled	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
accepted	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

And	O
yet	O
the	O
success	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
small	O
but	O
,	O
joined	O
with	O
the	O
two	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
a	O
man	O
which	O
I	O
allowed	O
them	O
on	O
the	O
ships	O
'	O
account	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
like	O
allowance	O
the	O
officers	O
made	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
produce	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
purchase	O
,	O
they	O
divided	O
afterwards	O
about	O
fifteen	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
a	O
man	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
encouragement	O
to	O
them	O
.	O

Thus	O
we	O
spent	O
in	O
the	O
whole	O
,	O
near	O
three	O
weeks	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
called	O
these	O
the	O
Pearl	PNM
Islands	PNM
,	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
given	O
no	O
names	O
to	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
places	O
before	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
the	O
more	O
surprised	O
with	O
this	O
unexpected	O
booty	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
all	O
thought	O
it	O
very	O
unusual	O
to	O
find	O
pearl	O
of	O
so	O
excellent	O
a	O
kind	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
latitude	O
as	O
that	O
of	O
49	O
to	O
50	O
°	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
seems	O
there	O
are	O
riches	O
yet	O
unknown	O
in	O
those	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
have	O
never	O
been	O
yet	O
expected	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
told	O
,	O
by	O
those	O
who	O
pretend	O
to	O
give	O
a	O
reason	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
there	O
was	O
any	O
land	O
directly	O
under	O
the	O
poles	O
,	O
either	O
south	O
or	O
north	O
,	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
found	O
gold	O
of	O
a	O
fineness	O
more	O
than	O
double	O
to	O
any	O
that	O
was	O
ever	O
yet	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
:	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
reason	O
,	O
they	O
say	O
,	O
why	O
the	O
magnetic	O
influence	O
directs	O
to	O
the	O
poles	O
,	O
that	O
being	O
the	O
centre	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
pure	O
metals	O
,	O
and	O
why	O
the	O
needle	O
touched	O
with	O
the	O
loadstone	O
or	O
magnet	O
always	O
points	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
or	O
south	O
pole	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
recommend	O
this	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
certainty	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
evident	O
no	O
demonstration	O
could	O
ever	O
be	O
arrived	O
at	O
,	O
nor	O
could	O
any	O
creature	O
reach	O
to	O
that	O
particular	O
spot	O
of	O
land	O
under	O
the	O
pole	O
,	O
if	O
such	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
,	O
those	O
lands	O
being	O
surrounded	O
with	O
mountains	O
of	O
snow	O
and	O
frozen	O
seas	O

which	O
never	O

either	O
for	O

But	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
our	O
voyage	O
;	O
having	O
thus	O
spent	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
three	O
weeks	O
on	O
this	O
unexpected	O
expedition	O
,	O
we	O
set	O
sail	O

and	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
almost	O
satisfied	O
with	O
the	O
discoveries	O
we	O
had	O
made	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
for	O
bending	O
my	O
course	O
due	O
east	O
and	O
so	O
directly	O
for	O
the	O
south	O
part	O
of	O
America	PNM
;	O
but	O
the	O
winds	O
now	O
blowing	O
fresh	O
from	O
the	O
north-west	O
,	O
and	O
good	O
weather	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
the	O
occasion	O
as	O
a	O
favourable	O
summons	O
,	O
to	O
keep	O
still	O
on	O
southing	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
east	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
56	O

,	O
when	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
all	O
along	O
a	O
warm	O
weather	O
voyage	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
pinched	O
very	O
much	O
with	O
the	O
cold	O
,	O
and	O
particularly	O
complained	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
clothes	O
sufficient	O
for	O
it	O
.	O

But	O
they	O
were	O
brought	O
to	O
be	O
content	O
by	O
force	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
wind	O
continuing	O
at	O
north	O
and	O
north-north-west	O
,	O
and	O
blowing	O
very	O
hard	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
keep	O
on	O
our	O
course	O
farther	O
south	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
than	O
I	O
ever	O
intended	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
swore	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
driven	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
pole	O

Indeed	O
,	O
we	O
rather	O
ran	O
afore	O
it	O
than	O
kept	O
our	O
course	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
this	O
run	O
we	O
suffered	O
the	O
extremest	O
cold	O
,	O
though	O
a	O
northerly	O
wind	O
in	O
those	O
latitudes	O
is	O
the	O
warm	O
wind	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
southerly	O
is	O
here	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
attended	O
with	O
rain	O
and	O
snow	O
,	O
and	O
both	O
freezing	O
violently	O

At	O
length	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
cried	O
out	O
,	O
Land	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
began	O
to	O
rejoice	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
quite	O
of	O
a	O
different	O
opinion	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
fears	O
were	O
but	O
too	O
just	O
,	O
for	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
ever	O
he	O
cried	O
Land	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
asked	O
him	O
in	O
what	O
quarter	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
answered	O
due	O
south	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
almost	O
right	O
ahead	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
orders	O
to	O
wear	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
her	O
about	O
immediately	O
,	O
not	O
doubting	O
but	O
instead	O
of	O
land	O
I	O
should	O
find	O
it	O
a	O
mountain	O
of	O
ice	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
happy	O
for	O
us	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
stout	O
ship	O
under	O
us	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
blew	O
a	O
fret	O
of	O
wind	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
ship	O
came	O
very	O
well	O
about	O
,	O
though	O
when	O
she	O
filled	O
again	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
ice	O
not	O
half	O
a	O
league	O
distance	O
under	O
our	O
stern	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
happened	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
headmost	O
ship	O
,	O
I	O
fired	O
two	O
guns	O
to	O
give	O
notice	O
to	O
our	O
other	O
vessels	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
was	O
our	O
signal	O
to	O
come	O
about	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
which	O
was	O
very	O
uneasy	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
the	O
weather	O
was	O
hazy	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
both	O
out	O
of	O
sight	O
;	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
that	O
we	O
lost	O
one	O
another	O
in	O
those	O
seas	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
being	O
both	O
to	O
windward	O
,	O
and	O
within	O
hearing	O
of	O
my	O
guns	O
,	O
they	O
took	O
the	O
warning	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
about	O
with	O
more	O
leisure	O
and	O
less	O
hazard	O
than	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
.	O

I	O
stood	O
away	O
now	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
,	O
firing	O
guns	O
continually	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
know	O
which	O
way	O
to	O
follow	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
answered	O
me	O
duly	O
,	O
to	O
let	O
me	O
know	O
that	O
they	O
heard	O
me	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
our	O
good	O
fortune	O
also	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
day	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
so	O
near	O
running	O
into	O
this	O
danger	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
the	O

abated	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
weather	O
cleared	O
up	O
;	O
we	O
then	O
called	O
a	O
council	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
no	O
farther	O
south	O
,	O
being	O
then	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
67	O
°	O
south	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
suppose	O
is	O
the	O
farthest	O
southern	O
latitude	O
that	O
any	O
European	O
ship	O
ever	O
saw	O
in	O
those	O
seas	O
.	O

That	O
night	O
it	O
froze	O
extremely	O
hard	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
wind	O
veering	O
to	O
the	O
south-west	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
severest	O
cold	O
that	O
ever	O
I	O
felt	O
in	O
my	O
life	O
;	O
a	O
barrel	O
or	O
cask	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
which	O
stood	O
on	O
the	O
deck	O
,	O
froze	O
entirely	O
in	O
one	O
night	O
into	O
one	O
lump	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
cooper	O
,	O
knocking	O
off	O
the	O
hoops	O
from	O
the	O
cask	O
,	O
took	O
it	O
to	O
pieces	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
barrel	O
of	O
ice	O
stood	O
by	O
itself	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
true	O
shape	O
of	O
the	O
vessel	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
.	O

This	O
wind	O
was	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
favourable	O
to	O
our	O
deliverance	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
stood	O
away	O
now	O
north-east	O
and	O
north-east-by-north	O
,	O
making	O
fresh	O
way	O
with	O
a	O
fair	O
wind	O
.	O

We	O
made	O
no	O
more	O
land	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
62	O
°	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
saw	O
some	O
islands	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
,	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
of	O
us	O
;	O
we	O
believed	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
islands	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
saw	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
with	O
large	O
openings	O
between	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
so	O
willing	O
to	O
get	O
into	O
a	O
warmer	O
climate	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
incline	O
to	O
put	O
in	O
anywhere	O
,	O
till	O
,	O
having	O
run	O
thus	O
fifteen	O
days	O
and	O
the	O
wind	O
still	O
holding	O
southerly	O
,	O
with	O
small	O
alteration	O
and	O
clear	O
weather	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
easily	O
perceive	O
the	O
climate	O
to	O
change	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
weather	O
grow	O
milder	O
.	O

And	O
here	O
taking	O
an	O
observation	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
50	O
°	O
30	O
'	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
our	O
meridian	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
Ladrones	O
west	O
was	O
87	O
°	O
,	O
being	O
almost	O
one	O
semi-diameter	O
of	O
the	O
globe	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
far	O
from	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
America	PNM
,	O
which	O
was	O
my	O
next	O
design	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
the	O
chief	O
design	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
voyage	O
.	O

On	O
this	O
expectation	O
I	O
changed	O
my	O
course	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
away	O
north-by-east	O
,	O
till	O
by	O
an	O
observation	O
I	O
found	O
myself	O
in	O
47	O
°	O
7	O
'	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
standing	O
away	O
east	O
for	O
about	O
eleven	O
days	O
more	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
the	O
tops	O
of	O
the	O
Andes	O
,	O
the	O
great	O
mountains	O
of	O
Chili	PNM
,	O
in	O
South	PNM
America	PNM
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
joy	O
and	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
though	O
at	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
distance	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
our	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
not	O
less	O
than	O
twenty	O
leagues	O
,	O
the	O
mountains	O
being	O
so	O
very	O
high	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
next	O
business	O
was	O
to	O
consider	O
what	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
Andes	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
what	O
port	O
we	O
should	O
direct	O
ourselves	O
first	O
.	O

Upon	O
the	O
whole	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
we	O
were	O
too	O
much	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
still	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
to	O
make	O
directly	O
for	O
the	O
river	O
or	O
port	O
of	O
Valdivia	PNM
,	O
or	O
Baldivia	PNM
,	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
sometimes	O
called	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
40	O
°	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
stood	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
north	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
the	O
pacific	O
,	O
quiet	O
sea	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
termed	O
,	O
showed	O
us	O
a	O
very	O
frowning	O
rough	O
countenance	O
,	O
and	O
proved	O
the	O
very	O
extreme	O
of	O
a	O
contrary	O
disposition	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
blew	O
a	O
storm	O
of	O
wind	O
at	O
east-by-south	O
,	O
and	O
drove	O
us	O
off	O
the	O
coast	O
again	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
abated	O
again	O
for	O
a	O
day	O
or	O
two	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
for	O
six	O
days	O
together	O
it	O
blew	O
excessive	O
hard	O
,	O
almost	O
all	O
at	O
east	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
found	O
no	O
possibility	O
of	O
getting	O
into	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
and	O
besides	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
winds	O
came	O
off	O
that	O
mountainous	O
country	O
in	O
squalls	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
nearer	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
hills	O
the	O
gusts	O
were	O
the	O
more	O
violent	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
run	O
for	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Juan	PNM
Fernandez	PNM
,	O
to	O
refresh	O
ourselves	O
there	O
until	O
the	O
weather	O
was	O
settled	O
;	O
and	O
besides	O
,	O
we	O
wanted	O
fresh	O
water	O
very	O
much	O
.	O

The	O
little	O
that	O
the	O
wind	O
stood	O
southerly	O
helped	O
me	O
in	O
this	O
run	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
came	O
in	O
five	O
days	O
more	O
,	O
fair	O
with	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
joy	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
all	O
our	O
ships	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
as	O
near	O
the	O
watering-place	O
as	O
is	O
usual	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
rode	O
easy	O
,	O
though	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
continued	O
to	O
blow	O
very	O
hard	O
;	O
and	O
being	O
,	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
now	O
about	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
our	O
voyage	O
,	O
I	O
shall	O
break	O
off	O
my	O
account	O
here	O
,	O
as	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
part	O
of	O
my	O
work	O
,	O
and	O
begin	O
again	O
at	O
our	O
departure	O
from	O
hence	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
true	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
got	O
over	O
much	O
the	O
greater	O
run	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
length	O
of	O
way	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
part	O
of	O
our	O
voyage	O
was	O
yet	O
to	O
come	O

and	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
inconsiderable	O
length	O
to	O
run	O
neither	O

to	O
return	O
a	O

to	O
our	O

that	O

of	O
which	O
I	O
must	O
make	O
a	O
few	O

observations	O

It	O
was	O
scarce	O
possible	O
to	O
restrain	O
Englishmen	O
,	O
after	O
so	O
long	O
beating	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
from	O
going	O
on	O

when	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
such	O
a	O
place	O
of	O
refreshment	O
as	O
this	O
;	O
nor	O
indeed	O
was	O
it	O
reasonable	O
to	O
restrain	O
them	O
,	O
considering	O
how	O
we	O
all	O
might	O
be	O
supposed	O
to	O
stand	O
in	O
need	O
of	O
refreshment	O
,	O
and	O
considering	O
that	O
here	O
was	O
no	O
length	O
of	O
ground	O
for	O
the	O
men	O
to	O
wander	O
in	O

no	O

to	O
come	O
at	O
to	O
distract	O
them	O
with	O
their	O
excess	O

,	O
which	O
was	O
still	O
more	O
,	O
no	O
women	O
to	O
disorder	O
or	O
debauch	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
all	O
knew	O
their	O
chief	O
exercise	O
would	O
be	O
hunting	O
goats	O
for	O
their	O
subsistence	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
knew	O
also	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
however	O
they	O
wanted	O
the	O
benefit	O
of	O
fresh	O
provision	O
,	O
they	O
must	O
work	O
hard	O
to	O
catch	O
it	O
before	O
they	O
could	O
taste	O
the	O
sweet	O
of	O
it	O

Upon	O
these	O
considerations	O
,	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
our	O
ships	O
being	O
well	O
moored	O
,	O
and	O
riding	O
safe	O
,	O
we	O
restrained	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
except	O
a	O
proper	O
number	O
to	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
each	O
ship	O
;	O
and	O
those	O
were	O
taken	O
out	O
by	O
lot	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
had	O
their	O
turn	O
also	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
some	O
days	O
afterwards	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
had	O
both	O
fresh	O
water	O
and	O
fresh	O
meat	O
sent	O
them	O
immediately	O

and	O
that	O
in	O
sufficient	O
quantity	O
to	O
their	O
satisfaction	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
looked	O
about	O
us	O

we	O
began	O
first	O
with	O
getting	O
some	O
fresh	O
water	O

for	O
we	O
greatly	O

it	O

Then	O
carrying	O
a	O
small	O
cask	O
of	O
arrack	O
on	O

I	O
made	O
a	O
quantity	O

correcting	O
a	O
little	O
the	O

drink	O
an	O
immoderate	O

the	O

before	O
I	O

this	O
butt	O
filled	O

and	O
before	O
the	O

was	O
put	O
into	O
it	O

fell	O
into	O

themselves	O
too	O
much	O
with	O
the	O

;	O
and	O
two	O

I	O
thought	O
would	O

but	O
our	O

took	O
such	O

of	O
them	O

that	O
they	O
recovered	O

While	O
this	O
was	O

cut	O
down	O

five	O

we	O
made	O
two	O

with	O
some	O
old	O

thus	O
we	O
encamped	O

At	O
the	O

that	O
day	O
they	O
made	O
little	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
sending	O
for	O
more	O
firemen	O
,	O
they	O
made	O
a	O
shift	O
to	O
bring	O
in	O
seventeen	O
goats	O
the	O
same	O
day	O
,	O
whereof	O
we	O
sent	O
five	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
feasted	O
with	O
the	O
rest	O
on	O
shore	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
the	O
men	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
in	O
another	O
manner	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
better	O
conduct	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
hands	O
enough	O
,	O
and	O
fire-arms	O
enough	O
,	O
they	O
spread	O
themselves	O
so	O
far	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
surrounded	O
the	O
creatures	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
driving	O
them	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
fastnesses	O
and	O
retreats	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
occasion	O
to	O
shoot	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
goats	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
from	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
took	O
them	O
everywhere	O
with	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
except	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
old	O
he-goats	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
so	O
surly	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
stand	O
at	O
bay	O
and	O
rise	O
at	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
taken	O
;	O
and	O
these	O
,	O
as	O
being	O
old	O
also	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
they	O
thought	O
,	O
good	O
for	O
nothing	O
,	O
they	O
let	O
go	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
so	O
many	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
these	O
divided	O
themselves	O
into	O
so	O
many	O
little	O
parties	O
,	O
and	O
plyed	O
their	O
work	O
so	O
hard	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
such	O
good	O
luck	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
it	O
looked	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
made	O
a	O
general	O
massacre	O
of	O
the	O
goats	O
,	O
rather	O
than	O
a	O
hunting	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
also	O
might	O
be	O
said	O
not	O
to	O
refresh	O
themselves	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
feast	O
themselves	O
here	O
with	O
fresh	O
provisions	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
we	O
stayed	O
but	O
thirteen	O
days	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
killed	O
three	O
hundred	O
and	O
seventy	O
goats	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
who	O
were	O
on	O
board	O
were	O
very	O
merrily	O
employed	O
,	O
most	O
assuredly	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
do	O
very	O
little	O
but	O
roast	O
and	O
stew	O
,	O
and	O
broil	O
and	O
fry	O
,	O
from	O
morning	O
to	O
night	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
indeed	O
an	O
exceeding	O
good	O
supply	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
extremely	O
fatigued	O
with	O
the	O
last	O
part	O
of	O
their	O
voyage	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
tasted	O
of	O
no	O
fresh	O
provisions	O
for	O
six	O
weeks	O
before	O
.	O

This	O
made	O
them	O
hunt	O
the	O
goats	O
with	O
the	O
more	O
eagerness	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
,	O
they	O
surrounded	O
them	O
so	O
dexterously	O
,	O
and	O
followed	O
them	O
so	O
nimbly	O
,	O
that	O
notwithstanding	O
the	O
difficulties	O
of	O
the	O
rocks	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
goats	O
could	O
hardly	O
ever	O
escape	O
them	O
.	O

Here	O
our	O
men	O
found	O
also	O
very	O
good	O
fish	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
few	O
tortoises	O
,	O
or	O
turtles	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
seamen	O
call	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
valued	O
them	O
not	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
had	O
such	O
plenty	O
of	O
venison	O
;	O
also	O
they	O
found	O
some	O
very	O
good	O
herbs	O
in	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
boiled	O
with	O
the	O
goats	O
'	O
flesh	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
made	O
their	O
broth	O
very	O
savoury	O
and	O
comfortable	O
,	O
and	O
withal	O
very	O
healing	O
,	O
and	O
good	O
against	O
the	O
scurvy	O
,	O
which	O
in	O
those	O
climates	O
Englishmen	O
are	O
very	O
subject	O
to	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
now	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
month	O
of	O
April	O
,	O
1715	O
,	O
having	O
spent	O
almost	O
eight	O
months	O
in	O
this	O
trafficking	O
wandering	O
voyage	O
from	O
Manilla	PNM
hither	O
.	O

And	O
whoever	O
shall	O
follow	O
the	O
same	O
,	O
or	O
a	O
like	O
track	O
,	O
if	O
ever	O
such	O
a	O
thing	O
shall	O
happen	O
,	O
will	O
do	O
well	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
year	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
may	O
find	O
it	O
very	O
well	O
worth	O
while	O
.	O

I	O
doubt	O
not	O
but	O
there	O
are	O
many	O
undiscovered	O
parts	O
of	O
land	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
also	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
shore	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
mentioned	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
stayed	O
trafficking	O
for	O
little	O
bits	O
of	O
gold	O
.	O

And	O
though	O
it	O
is	O
true	O
that	O
such	O
traffick	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
given	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
,	O
is	O
very	O
advantageous	O
in	O
itself	O
,	O
and	O
worth	O
while	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
,	O
especially	O
after	O
having	O
had	O
a	O
good	O
market	O
for	O
an	O
out-ward-bound	O
European	O
cargo	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
pattern	O
of	O
ours	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
Philippines	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
they	O
need	O
not	O
miss	O
,	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
as	O
this	O
trade	O
for	O
gold	O
would	O
be	O
well	O
worth	O
while	O
,	O
so	O
had	O
we	O
gone	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
taken	O
a	O
course	O
more	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
from	O
Manilla	PNM
,	O
not	O
going	O
away	O
east	O
to	O
the	O
Ladrones	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
certainly	O
have	O
fallen	O
in	O
with	O
a	O
country	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
New	PNM
Guinea	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
found	O
plenty	O
of	O
spices	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
of	O
gold	O
.	O

For	O
why	O
may	O
we	O
not	O
be	O
allowed	O
to	O
suppose	O
that	O
the	O
country	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
continent	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
latitude	O
,	O
should	O
produce	O
the	O
same	O
growth	O
?	O

Especially	O
considering	O
them	O
situated	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
called	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
neighbourhood	O
of	O
one	O
another	O
.	O

Had	O
we	O
then	O
proceeded	O
this	O
way	O
,	O
no	O
question	O
but	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
fixed	O
on	O
some	O
place	O
for	O
a	O
settlement	O
,	O
either	O
English	O
or	O
French	O
,	O
whence	O
a	O
correspondence	O
being	O
established	O
with	O
Europe	PNM
,	O
either	O
by	O
Cape	PNM
Horn	PNM
east	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
Cape	PNM
De	PNM
Bona	PNM
Esperance	PNM
west	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
thought	O
fit	O
,	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
found	O
as	O
great	O
a	O
production	O
of	O
the	O
nutmegs	O
and	O
the	O
cloves	O
as	O
at	O
Banda	PNM
and	O
Ternate	PNM
,	O
or	O
have	O
made	O
those	O
productions	O
have	O
been	O
planted	O
there	O
for	O
the	O
future	O
,	O
where	O
no	O
doubt	O
they	O
would	O
grow	O
and	O
thrive	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
they	O
do	O
now	O
in	O
the	O
Moluccas	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
spun	O
out	O
too	O
much	O
time	O
for	O
the	O
business	O
we	O
did	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
we	O
might	O
,	O
as	O
above	O
,	O
discover	O
new	O
places	O
,	O
and	O
get	O
very	O
well	O
too	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
did	O
nothing	O
in	O
comparison	O
of	O
what	O
we	O
might	O
be	O
supposed	O
to	O
have	O
done	O
,	O
had	O
we	O
made	O
the	O
discovery	O
more	O
our	O
business	O
.	O

I	O
can	O
not	O
doubt	O
,	O
also	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
when	O
we	O
stood	O
away	O
south	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
late	O
;	O
for	O
had	O
we	O
stood	O
into	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
67	O
°	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
did	O
afterwards	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
good	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
those	O
islands	O
which	O
we	O
call	O
the	O
Moluccas	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
lie	O
so	O
thick	O
and	O
for	O
so	O
great	O
an	O
extent	O
,	O
go	O
on	O
yet	O
farther	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
scarce	O
to	O
be	O
imagined	O
that	O
they	O
break	O
off	O
just	O
with	O
Gilloto	O
.	O

This	O
I	O
call	O
a	O
mistake	O
in	O
me	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
stood	O
away	O
east	O
from	O
the	O
Philippines	O
to	O
the	O
Ladrones	O
,	O
before	O
I	O
had	O
gone	O
any	O
length	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
.	O

But	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
course	O
set	O
down	O
in	O
this	O
work	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
south-east	O
and	O
by	O
east	O
from	O
the	O
Ladrones	O
,	O
the	O
places	O
I	O
have	O
taken	O
notice	O
of	O
,	O
as	O
these	O
do	O
not	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
,	O
appear	O
to	O
be	O
inconsiderable	O
and	O
of	O
no	O
value	O
,	O
so	O
had	O
we	O
searched	O
farther	O
into	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
doubt	O
not	O
but	O
there	O
are	O
greater	O
things	O
to	O
be	O
discovered	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
a	O
much	O
greater	O
extent	O
of	O
land	O
also	O
.	O

For	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
but	O
just	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
described	O
the	O
shell	O
,	O
having	O
made	O
no	O
search	O
for	O
the	O
kernel	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
more	O
than	O
probable	O
,	O
that	O
within	O
the	O
country	O
there	O
might	O
be	O
greater	O
discoveries	O
made	O
,	O
of	O
immense	O
value	O
too	O
.	O

For	O
even	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
observed	O
several	O
times	O
,	O
whenever	O
we	O
found	O
any	O
people	O
who	O
had	O
gold	O
,	O
and	O
asked	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
by	O
signs	O
we	O
could	O
make	O
them	O
understand	O
,	O
they	O
always	O
pointed	O
to	O
the	O
rivers	O
and	O
the	O
mountains	O
which	O
lay	O
farther	O
up	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
we	O
never	O
made	O
any	O
discovery	O
of	O
,	O
having	O
little	O
in	O
our	O
view	O
but	O
the	O
getting	O
what	O
little	O
share	O
of	O
gold	O
the	O
poor	O
people	O
had	O
about	O
them	O
.	O

Whereas	O
had	O
we	O
taken	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
men	O
sufficient	O
to	O
support	O
themselves	O
,	O
in	O
making	O
a	O
farther	O
search	O
,	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
doubt	O
but	O
there	O
must	O
be	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
that	O
of	O
which	O
the	O
inactive	O
Indians	O
had	O
gotten	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
.	O

Nor	O
had	O
we	O
one	O
skilful	O
man	O
among	O
us	O
to	O
view	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
the	O
earth	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
what	O
treasure	O
of	O
choice	O
vegetables	O
might	O
be	O
there	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
indeed	O
six	O
very	O
good	O
surgeons	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
whom	O
we	O
took	O
in	O
among	O
the	O
Madagascar	PNM
men	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
great	O
reading	O
and	O
judgment	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
acknowledged	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
skill	O
in	O
botanics	O
,	O
having	O
never	O
made	O
it	O
his	O
study	O
.	O

But	O
to	O
say	O
the	O
truth	O
,	O
our	O
doctors	O
themselves	O
-LRB-	O
so	O
we	O
call	O
the	O
surgeons	O
at	O
sea	O
-RRB-	O
were	O
so	O
taken	O
up	O
in	O
their	O
traffick	O
for	O
gold	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
leisure	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
anything	O
else	O
.	O

They	O
did	O
indeed	O
pick	O
up	O
some	O
shells	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
strange	O
figured	O
skeletons	O
of	O
fishes	O
and	O
small	O
beasts	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
things	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
esteemed	O
as	O
rarities	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
never	O
went	O
a	O
simpling	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
or	O
to	O
inquire	O
what	O
the	O
earth	O
brought	O
forth	O
that	O
was	O
rare	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
anywhere	O
else	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
,	O
likewise	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
worth	O
observing	O
,	O
how	O
the	O
people	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
,	O
where	O
it	O
is	O
probable	O
no	O
ships	O
,	O
much	O
less	O
European	O
ships	O
,	O
had	O
ever	O
been	O

and	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
never	O
conversed	O
with	O
enemies	O
,	O
or	O
with	O
nations	O
accustomed	O
to	O
steal	O
and	O
plunder	O
;	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
lived	O
thus	O
,	O
had	O
no	O
fire	O
,	O
no	O
rage	O
in	O
their	O
looks	O
,	O
no	O
jealous	O
fears	O
of	O
strangers	O
doing	O
them	O
harm	O
,	O
and	O
consequently	O
no	O
desire	O
to	O
do	O
harm	O
to	O
others	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
bows	O
and	O
arrows	O
indeed	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
rather	O
to	O
kill	O
the	O
deer	O
and	O
fowls	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
provide	O
themselves	O
with	O
food	O
,	O
than	O
to	O
offend	O
their	O
enemies	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
none	O
.	O

When	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
removing	O
from	O
thence	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
other	O
and	O
different	O
nations	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
ravenous	O
and	O
mischievous	O

either	O

them	O

And	O
to	O
confirm	O
me	O
in	O
this	O
opinion	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
these	O
fierce	O
false	O
Indians	O
had	O
canoes	O
and	O
boats	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
one	O
kind	O

and	O
some	O
of	O
another	O

by	O
which	O
perhaps	O
,	O
they	O
conversed	O
with	O
the	O
islands	O
or	O
other	O
nations	O
near	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
also	O
received	O
ships	O
and	O
vessels	O
from	O
other	O
nations	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
several	O
occasions	O
to	O
be	O
upon	O
their	O

and	O
learned	O
the	O
treacherous	O

cruel	O
parts	O
from	O
others	O
which	O
nature	O
gave	O
them	O
no	O
ideas	O
of	O
before	O

As	O
the	O
natives	O
of	O
these	O
places	O
were	O
tractable	O
and	O
courteous	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
made	O
easily	O
subservient	O
and	O
assistant	O
to	O
any	O
European	O
nation	O
that	O
would	O
come	O
to	O
make	O
settlements	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
especially	O
if	O
those	O
European	O
nations	O
treated	O
them	O
with	O
humanity	O
and	O
courtesy	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
have	O
made	O
it	O
a	O
general	O
observation	O
,	O
concerning	O
the	O
natural	O
disposition	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
savage	O
nations	O
that	O
ever	O
I	O
met	O
with	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
are	O
once	O
but	O
really	O
obliged	O
they	O
will	O
always	O
be	O
very	O
faithful	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
is	O
our	O
people	O
,	O
I	O
mean	O
the	O
Europeans	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
by	O
breaking	O
faith	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
teach	O
them	O
ingratitude	O
,	O
and	O
inure	O
them	O
to	O
treat	O
their	O
new	O
comers	O
with	O
breach	O
of	O
faith	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
cruelty	O
and	O
barbarity	O
.	O

If	O
you	O
once	O
win	O
them	O
by	O
kindness	O
,	O
and	O
doing	O
them	O
good	O
,	O
I	O
mean	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
before	O
they	O
are	O
taught	O
to	O
be	O
rogues	O
by	O
example	O
,	O
they	O
will	O
generally	O
be	O
honest	O
,	O
and	O
be	O
kind	O
also	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
uttermost	O
of	O
their	O
power	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
observed	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
the	O
opinion	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
sailors	O
who	O
have	O
navigated	O
those	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
that	O
farther	O
south	O
there	O
are	O
great	O
tracts	O
of	O
undiscovered	O
land	O
;	O
and	O
some	O
have	O
told	O
us	O
they	O
have	O
seen	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
have	O
called	O
them	O
by	O
such	O
and	O
such	O
name	O
,	O
as	O
,	O
particularly	O
,	O
the	O
Isles	O
of	O
Solomon	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
yet	O
we	O
can	O
read	O
of	O
nobody	O
that	O
ever	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
on	O
them	O
,	O
or	O
that	O
could	O
give	O
any	O
account	O
of	O
them	O

except	O
such	O
as	O
are	O
romantic	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
depended	O
upon	O
.	O

But	O
what	O
has	O
been	O
the	O
reason	O
why	O
we	O
have	O
hitherto	O
had	O
nothing	O
but	O
guesses	O
made	O
at	O
those	O
things	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
all	O
that	O
has	O
been	O

of	O
such	O

has	O
been	O
imperfect	O
?	O

The	O
reason	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
may	O
speak	O
my	O
opinion	O
,	O
has	O
been	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
such	O
a	O
prodigious	O
run	O
from	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
America	PNM
to	O
the	O
islands	O
of	O
the	O
Ladrones	O
,	O
that	O
the	O

it	O
never	O
durst	O
venture	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
of	O

of	O
the	O
trade-winds	O
,	O
lest	O
they	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
subsist	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
water	O
and	O
provisions	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
particularly	O
the	O
case	O
in	O
the	O

from	O
the	O

of	O

Whereas	O

to	O

the	O

I	O

a	O

for	O
a	O

of	O

,	O
it	O
is	O

we	O
could	O

back	O

from	O

that	O

that	O
William	O

and	O
not	O

I	O

they	O

and	O
pass	O
in	O

I	O
have	O

an	O

which	O
I	O
have	O
by	O

at	O

is	O
apparent	O

And	O
it	O
is	O
as	O
true	O
also	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
meet	O
with	O
many	O
islands	O
and	O
unknown	O

in	O
those	O

where	O
they	O

perhaps	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
places	O
were	O
the	O
same	O
I	O
have	O
described	O
in	O
this	O

but	O
why	O
they	O
never	O

that	O

or	O

those	O

so	O
that	O
others	O
in	O

might	O
have	O
touched	O
at	O
them	O
and	O
have	O
received	O
the	O
like	O
benefit	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
give	O
no	O
account	O
of	O

I	O
can	O
not	O
help	O
being	O
of	O
opinion	O
,	O
let	O
our	O
map	O
makers	O
place	O
them	O
where	O
they	O
will	O
,	O
that	O
those	O
islands	O
where	O
we	O
so	O
successfully	O
fished	O
for	O
oysters	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
for	O
pearl	O
,	O
are	O
the	O
same	O
which	O
the	O
ancient	O
geographers	O
have	O
called	O
Solomon	PNM
's	PNM
Islands	PNM
;	O
and	O
though	O
they	O
are	O
so	O
far	O

the	O

of	O
them	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
the	O
less	O
,	O
nor	O
are	O
they	O
more	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
way	O

On	O
the	O
contrary	O
,	O
they	O
lie	O
directly	O
in	O
the	O
track	O
which	O
our	O
navigators	O
would	O
take	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
thought	O
fit	O
,	O
either	O
to	O
go	O
or	O
come	O
between	O
Europe	PNM
and	O
the	O
East	PNM

,	O
seeing	O
they	O
that	O

seldom	O
go	O
less	O
south	O
than	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
63	O

64	O
°	O
;	O
and	O
these	O
islands	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
lie	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
40	O

48	O

themselves	O
near	O
one	O

sixty	O
leagues	O
in	O

from	O
north	O
to	O

Without	O
doubt	O
those	O
islands	O
would	O
make	O
a	O
very	O
noble	O
settlement	O

in	O
order	O
to	O
victual	O
and	O
relieve	O
the	O
European	O
merchants	O
in	O
so	O
long	O
a	O
run	O
as	O
they	O
have	O
to	O
make	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
this	O

came	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
frequented	O
,	O
the	O
calling	O
of	O
those	O
ships	O
there	O
would	O
enrich	O
the	O
islands	O

as	O
the	O
English	O
at	O

enriched	O
by	O
the	O

The	O

our	O

I	O
should	O

that	O
we	O

our	O

as	O

Our	O

were	O

at	O
this	O

especially	O
having	O
been	O
so	O
well	O

up	O
by	O

on	O

it	O

I	O
seemed	O
unwilling	O
at	O

he	O
added	O
to	O
his	O
importunity	O

that	O
he	O

all	O
his	O
crew	O
were	O
desirous	O

if	O

any	O

it	O

He	O
cruised	O
a	O
week	O
without	O
seeing	O
a	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
stood	O
in	O
quite	O
to	O
the	O
Spanish	O
shore	O
in	O
one	O
place	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
wrong	O
.	O

The	O
eighth	O
day	O
,	O
giving	O
over	O
all	O
expectations	O
,	O
he	O
stood	O
off	O
again	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
he	O
spied	O
a	O
sail	O
,	O
which	O
proved	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
large	O
Spanish	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
seemed	O
to	O
stand	O
down	O
directly	O
upon	O
him	O
,	O
which	O
a	O
little	O
checked	O
his	O
forwardness	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
he	O
kept	O
on	O
his	O
course	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
seeing	O
him	O
plainer	O
than	O
probably	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
tacked	O
,	O
and	O
crowding	O
all	O
the	O
sail	O
he	O
could	O
carry	O
,	O
stood	O
in	O
for	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniard	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
sailer	O
,	O
but	O
our	O
ship	O
plainly	O
gained	O
upon	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
came	O
almost	O
up	O
with	O
her	O
;	O
when	O
he	O
saw	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
though	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
loath	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
chasing	O
her	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
he	O
followed	O
,	O
and	O
night	O
coming	O
on	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
changed	O
his	O
course	O
,	O
thinking	O
to	O
get	O
away	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
the	O
moon	O
was	O
just	O
rising	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
resolved	O
to	O
keep	O
her	O
in	O
sight	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
perceived	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
stretched	O
after	O
her	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
canvass	O
they	O
could	O
lay	O
on	O
.	O

This	O
chase	O
held	O
till	O
about	O
midnight	O
,	O
when	O
our	O
ship	O
coming	O
up	O
with	O
her	O
,	O
took	O
her	O
after	O
a	O
little	O
dispute	O
.	O

They	O
pretended	O
,	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
to	O
have	O
nothing	O
on	O
board	O
but	O
timber	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
carrying	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
said	O
,	O
to	O
some	O
port	O
for	O
the	O
building	O
of	O
ships	O
;	O
but	O
our	O
men	O
had	O
the	O
secret	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
confess	O
their	O
treasure	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
any	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
after	O
some	O
hard	O
words	O
with	O
the	O
Spanish	O
commander	O
,	O
he	O
confessed	O
he	O
had	O
some	O
money	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
on	O
our	O
men	O
's	O
promise	O
of	O
good	O
usage	O
,	O
he	O
afterwards	O
very	O
honestly	O
delivered	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
might	O
amount	O
to	O
about	O
sixteen	O
thousand	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
.	O

But	O
he	O
had	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
glad	O
of	O
besides	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
about	O
two	O
hundred	O
great	O
jars	O
of	O
very	O
good	O
wheat	O
flour	O
,	O
a	O
large	O
quantity	O
of	O
oil	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
casks	O
of	O
sweetmeats	O
,	O
all	O
which	O
was	O
to	O
us	O
very	O
good	O
prize	O
.	O

But	O
now	O
our	O
difficulty	O
was	O
,	O
what	O
we	O
should	O
do	O
with	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
so	O
real	O
a	O
difficulty	O
that	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
wish	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
taken	O
her	O
,	O
lest	O
her	O
being	O
suffered	O
to	O
go	O
,	O
she	O
should	O
alarm	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
or	O
if	O
detained	O
,	O
discover	O
us	O
all	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
above	O
one	O
day	O
beyond	O
his	O
orders	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
pleasure	O
of	O
seeing	O
the	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
Madagascar	O
come	O
into	O
the	O
road	O
,	O
with	O
his	O
prize	O
in	O
tow	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
flour	O
and	O
oil	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
booty	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
upon	O
second	O
and	O
better	O
thoughts	O
,	O
we	O
brought	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
to	O
a	O
fair	O
treaty	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
more	O
difficult	O
,	O
brought	O
all	O
our	O
men	O
to	O
consent	O
to	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
case	O
was	O
this	O
.	O

Knowing	O
what	O
I	O
proposed	O
to	O
myself	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
to	O
trade	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
up	O
the	O
Spanish	O
coast	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
pass	O
for	O
French	O
ships	O
,	O
I	O
knew	O
the	O
taking	O
this	O
Spanish	O
ship	O
would	O
betray	O
us	O
all	O
,	O
unless	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
sink	O
the	O
ship	O
and	O
murder	O
all	O
the	O
men	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
resolution	O
of	O
talking	O
with	O
the	O
Spanish	O
captain	O
,	O
and	O
making	O
terms	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
soon	O
made	O
him	O
very	O
glad	O
to	O
accept	O
of	O
.	O

First	O
,	O
I	O
pretended	O
to	O
be	O
angry	O
with	O
the	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
Madagascar	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
ordered	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
put	O
under	O
confinement	O
,	O
for	O
having	O
made	O
a	O
prize	O
of	O
his	O
catholic	O
majesty	O
's	O
subjects	O
,	O
we	O
being	O
subjects	O
to	O
the	O
king	O
of	O
France	PNM
,	O
who	O
was	O
in	O
perfect	O
peace	O
with	O
the	O
king	O
of	O
Spain	PNM
.	O

Then	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
restore	O
him	O
his	O
ship	O
and	O
all	O
his	O
money	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
to	O
his	O
flour	O
and	O
oil	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
men	O
had	O
fallen	O
greedily	O
upon	O
,	O
having	O
a	O
want	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
pay	O
him	O
the	O
full	O
value	O
in	O
money	O
for	O
it	O
all	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
any	O
other	O
loss	O
he	O
had	O
sustained	O
,	O
only	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
oblige	O
him	O
to	O
lie	O
in	O
the	O
road	O
at	O
the	O
island	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
till	O
we	O
returned	O
from	O
our	O
voyage	O
to	O
Lima	PNM
,	O
whither	O
we	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
trade	O
,	O
for	O
which	O
lying	O
I	O
also	O
agreed	O
to	O
pay	O
him	O
demurrage	O
for	O
his	O
ship	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
rate	O
of	O
eight	O
hundred	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
per	O
month	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
I	O
returned	O
not	O
in	O
four	O
months	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
at	O
his	O
liberty	O
to	O
go	O
.	O

The	O
captain	O
,	O
who	O
thought	O
himself	O
a	O
prisoner	O
and	O
undone	O
,	O
readily	O
embraced	O
this	O
offer	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
we	O
secured	O
his	O
ship	O
till	O
our	O
return	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
we	O
found	O
him	O
very	O
honestly	O
at	O
an	O
anchor	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
shall	O
give	O
a	O
farther	O
account	O
in	O
its	O
place	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
now	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
much	O
about	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
our	O
voyage	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
intended	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
stored	O
ourselves	O
with	O
every	O
thing	O
the	O
place	O
afforded	O
,	O
we	O
got	O
ready	O
to	O
proceed	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
dwelt	O
here	O
near	O
a	O
fortnight	O
.	O

By	O
this	O
time	O
the	O
weather	O
was	O
good	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
stood	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
south-east	O
for	O
the	O
port	O
of	O
Baldivia	PNM
,	O
as	O
above	O
,	O
and	O
reached	O
to	O
the	O
mouth	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
harbour	O
in	O
twelve	O
days	O
'	O
sail	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
now	O
to	O
change	O
faces	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
appeared	O
as	O
captain	O
,	O
all	O
things	O
being	O
transacted	O
in	O
his	O
name	O
,	O
and	O
French	O
captains	O
were	O
put	O
into	O
the	O
brigantine	O
,	O
and	O
into	O
the	O
Madagascar	O
ship	O
also	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
thing	O
the	O
captain	O
did	O
was	O
to	O
send	O
a	O
civil	O
message	O
to	O
the	O
Spanish	O
governor	O
,	O
to	O
acquaint	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
being	O
come	O
into	O
those	O
seas	O
as	O
friends	O
,	O
under	O
his	O
most	O
Christian	O
majesty	O
's	O
commission	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
the	O
king	O
of	O
Spain	PNM
's	O
permission	O
,	O
we	O
desired	O
to	O
be	O
treated	O
as	O
allies	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
be	O
allowed	O
to	O
take	O
water	O
and	O
wood	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
buy	O
such	O
refreshments	O
as	O
we	O
wanted	O
,	O
for	O
which	O
we	O
would	O
pay	O
ready	O
money	O
;	O
also	O
we	O
carried	O
French	O
colours	O
,	O
but	O
took	O
not	O
the	O
least	O
notice	O
of	O
our	O
intention	O
to	O
trade	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
received	O
a	O
very	O
civil	O
answer	O
from	O
the	O
governor	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
That	O
being	O
the	O
king	O
of	O
France	PNM
's	O
subjects	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
alliance	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
welcome	O
to	O
wood	O
and	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
any	O
provision	O
the	O
place	O
would	O
afford	O

and	O
that	O
our	O
persons	O
should	O
be	O
safe	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
perfect	O
liberty	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
allow	O
any	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
to	O
lie	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
it	O
being	O
express	O
in	O
his	O
orders	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
not	O
permit	O
any	O
nation	O
not	O
actually	O
in	O
commission	O
from	O
the	O
king	O
of	O

to	O
come	O
on	O
shore	O

stay	O
there	O

not	O
even	O
one	O
night	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
done	O
to	O
prevent	O
disorders	O
.	O

We	O
answered	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
content	O
with	O
that	O
order	O
,	O
seeing	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
desire	O
our	O
men	O
should	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
to	O
stay	O
there	O
,	O
we	O

for	O
any	O
misbehaviour	O

which	O
was	O
frequent	O
among	O

While	O
we	O
continued	O
here	O
,	O
several	O
Spaniards	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
and	O
visited	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
often	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
on	O
the	O

pretence	O
;	O

our	O
supercargo	O

too	O
well	O
not	O
to	O
make	O
use	O
of	O
the	O
occasion	O
,	O
presently	O
let	O
the	O

see	O
that	O

a	O
great	O
cargo	O
of	O

they	O

that	O
they	O
had	O

so	O
we	O
did	O
;	O
for	O

sold	O
a	O

some	O

goods	O

and	O

English	O
cloth	O

but	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
indeed	O
very	O
few	O
such	O

left	O

so	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
willing	O

live	O
among	O

a	O
mortal	O
aversion	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
rivetted	O
in	O
their	O
minds	O
by	O
tradition	O
from	O

ever	O

the	O

that	O

not	O
now	O

on	O
those	O

the	O

remained	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
pride	O

cruel	O

temper	O
of	O
the	O

were	O
such	O
still	O
to	O
those	O
of	O
the	O
country	O

who	O
came	O
under	O
their	O
government	O

They	O
let	O
us	O
know	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
any	O
nation	O
in	O
the	O

would	O

come	O
in	O

assist	O
them	O

Spaniards	O
,	O
and	O
support	O
them	O
in	O
their	O

This	O

to	O
what	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O

I	O
then	O
ordered	O

inquiry	O
to	O
be	O
made	O

whether	O
the	O
mountains	O

in	O
this	O
-LRB-	O

that	O

to	O
be	O
the	O

and	O
that	O

generally	O

went	O
farther	O

the	O

but	O
that	O
when	O
they	O
went	O
from	O
St.	PNM
Jago	PNM
they	O
turned	O
away	O
north	O
some	O

when	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
town	O
called	O
St.	PNM

that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O

that	O
they	O
frequently	O
carried	O
thither	O
great	O
sums	O

in	O
Chilian	O
gold	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
back	O
European	O
goods	O
from	O
thence	O

I	O
had	O
all	O
I	O
wanted	O
now	O
,	O
and	O
bade	O
my	O
men	O
say	O
no	O
more	O
to	O
them	O
on	O
that	O
subject	O
,	O
and	O
only	O
to	O
tell	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
come	O
back	O
and	O
travel	O
a	O
little	O
that	O
way	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
country	O
.	O

The	O
people	O
appeared	O
very	O
well	O
pleased	O
with	O
this	O
intelligence	O
,	O
and	O
answered	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
do	O
so	O
,	O
they	O
should	O
find	O
some	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
Spaniards	O
as	O
Chilians	O
,	O
who	O
would	O
be	O
guides	O
to	O
them	O
through	O
the	O
hills	O
;	O
also	O
assuring	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
find	O
the	O
hills	O
very	O
practicable	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
people	O
as	O
they	O
went	O
along	O
very	O
ready	O
to	O
assist	O
and	O
furnish	O
them	O
with	O
whatever	O
they	O
found	O
they	O
wanted	O
,	O
especially	O
if	O
they	O
come	O
to	O
know	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
or	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
protect	O
them	O
from	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
be	O
the	O
most	O
agreeable	O
thing	O
to	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
seems	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
nations	O
of	O
the	O
Chilians	O
had	O
been	O
driven	O
to	O
live	O
among	O
the	O
hills	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
even	O
beyond	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
avoid	O
the	O
cruelty	O
and	O
tyranny	O
of	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
especially	O
in	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
their	O
planting	O
in	O
that	O
country	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
inquiry	O
I	O
ordered	O
them	O
to	O
make	O
was	O
,	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
possible	O
to	O
pass	O
those	O
hills	O
with	O
horses	O
or	O
mules	O
,	O
or	O
any	O
kind	O
of	O
carriages	O
?	O

and	O
they	O
assured	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
might	O
travel	O
with	O
mules	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
with	O
horses	O
also	O
,	O
but	O
rather	O
with	O
mules	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
to	O
carriages	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
carts	O
or	O
waggons	O
,	O
they	O
allowed	O
that	O
was	O
not	O
practicable	O
.	O

They	O
assured	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
those	O
ways	O
through	O
the	O
hills	O
were	O
much	O
frequented	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
towns	O
,	O
or	O
villages	O
rather	O
,	O
of	O
people	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
valleys	O
between	O
the	O
said	O
hills	O
;	O
some	O
of	O
which	O
villages	O
were	O
very	O
large	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
soil	O
very	O
rich	O
and	O
fruitful	O
,	O
bearing	O
sufficient	O
provisions	O
for	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
very	O
numerous	O
.	O

They	O
added	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
were	O
not	O
much	O
inclined	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
towns	O
as	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
do	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
lived	O
scattered	O
up	O
and	O
down	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
guided	O
by	O
the	O
goodness	O
of	O
the	O
land	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
lived	O
very	O
secure	O
and	O
unguarded	O
,	O
never	O
offering	O
any	O
injury	O
to	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
nor	O
fearing	O
injury	O
from	O
any	O
but	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
.	O

I	O
caused	O
these	O
inquiries	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
prudence	O
and	O
caution	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
had	O
not	O
the	O
least	O
suspicion	O
of	O
our	O
design	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
,	O
having	O
finished	O
our	O
traffick	O
,	O
and	O
taken	O
in	O
water	O
and	O
provisions	O
,	O
we	O
sailed	O
from	O
Baldivia	PNM
,	O
having	O
settled	O
a	O
little	O
correspondence	O
there	O
with	O
two	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
very	O
faithful	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
two	O
Chilian	O
Indians	O
,	O
whom	O
we	O
had	O
in	O
a	O
particular	O
manner	O
engaged	O
,	O
and	O
whom	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
of	O
,	O
we	O
took	O
along	O
with	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
spent	O
about	O
thirteen	O
days	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
taken	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
about	O
six	O
thousand	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
in	O
silver	O
and	O
gold	O
,	O
but	O
most	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
gold	O
,	O
we	O
set	O
sail	O
.	O

Our	O
next	O
port	O
was	O
the	O
Bay	O
of	O
the	O
Conception	O
;	O
here	O
,	O
having	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
men	O
on	O
board	O
who	O
were	O
well	O
acquainted	O
with	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
we	O
ran	O
boldly	O
into	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
in	O
that	O
which	O
they	O
call	O
the	O
Bite	O
,	O
or	O
little	O
bay	O
,	O
under	O
the	O
island	O
Quinquina	PNM
;	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
we	O
sent	O
our	O
boat	O
,	O
with	O
French	O
mariners	O
to	O
row	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
French	O
cockswain	O

with	O
a	O
letter	O
to	O
the	O
Spanish	O
governor	O
,	O
from	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
.	O

Our	O
pretence	O
was	O
always	O
the	O
same	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
his	O
most	O
Christian	O
majesty	O
's	O
commission	O
,	O
&	O
c.	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
desired	O
liberty	O
to	O
wood	O
and	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
buy	O
provisions	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
a	O
very	O
long	O
voyage	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
like	O

Under	O
these	O
pretences	O
,	O
we	O
lay	O
here	O
about	O
ten	O
days	O
,	O
and	O
drove	O
a	O
very	O
considerable	O
trade	O
for	O
such	O
goods	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
sure	O
they	O
wanted	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
taken	O
about	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
eight	O
thousand	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
,	O
we	O
set	O
sail	O
for	O
the	O
port	O
or	O
river	O
that	O
goes	O
up	O
to	O
St.	PNM
Jago	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
expected	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
market	O
,	O
being	O
distant	O
from	O
the	O
Conception	O
about	O
sixty-five	O

St.	PNM

is	O
the	O
capital	O

stands	O
twelve	O

within	O
the	O

there	O
are	O
two	O

R.	PNM

We	O
were	O

to	O
the	O
last	O

as	O

the	O
only	O
port	O
for	O
ships	O
of	O

and	O
where	O
there	O
is	O
security	O
from	O

We	O
found	O

here	O
,	O
without	O
going	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
St.	PNM
Jago	PNM

to	O

down	O

for	O
this	O
being	O
a	O
very	O
rich	O
city	O
,	O
and	O
full	O
of	O
money	O

we	O
found	O
all	O
our	O

no	O

in	O
a	O

the	O

for	O

behind	O
any	O
in	O
the	O
world	O

whatever	O
they	O
do	O
for	O

were	O
so	O
eager	O
for	O
those	O
fine	O
things	O
,	O
that	O
almost	O
any	O
reasonable	O
quantity	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
sold	O
there	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
truth	O
is	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
an	O
unreasonable	O
quantity	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
other	O
markets	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
,	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
let	O
them	O
know	O
what	O
a	O
great	O
stock	O
of	O
goods	O
we	O
had	O
,	O
but	O
took	O
care	O
they	O
had	O
something	O
of	O
everything	O
they	O
wanted	O

We	O
likewise	O
found	O
our	O
spices	O
were	O
an	O
excellent	O
commodity	O
in	O
those	O
parts	O

and	O
sold	O
for	O
a	O
great	O

too	O
,	O
as	O
indeed	O
everything	O
else	O
did	O
,	O
as	O
is	O
said	O
above	O

We	O
found	O
it	O
very	O
easy	O
to	O
sell	O
here	O
to	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
one	O
hundred	O
and	O
thirty	O
thousand	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O

we	O

loose	O

we	O
let	O
none	O
of	O
it	O

We	O
took	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
money	O
in	O

Here	O
we	O
went	O
in	O
without	O

and	O
upon	O
the	O

foot	O

of	O
being	O
French	O

we	O
were	O
well	O
received	O

with	O
the	O

and	O
got	O
letters	O

at	O
Guasco	PNM

a	O

in	O
a	O

the	O
port	O
of	O

Here	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
port	O
,	O
though	O
no	O
trading	O
town	O
or	O
city	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
country	O
being	O
well	O
inhabited	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
acquaint	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
principal	O
Spaniards	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
of	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
,	O
and	O
-LRB-	O
with	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
pleased	O
well	O
enough	O
-RRB-	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
trade	O
with	O
us	O
for	O
such	O
things	O
,	O
which	O
it	O
was	O
easy	O
to	O
see	O
they	O
gave	O
double	O
price	O
for	O
to	O
the	O
merchants	O
who	O
came	O
from	O
Lima	PNM
,	O
and	O
other	O
places	O

This	O
brought	O
them	O
to	O
us	O
with	O
so	O
much	O
eagerness	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
they	O
bought	O
for	O
their	O
own	O
use	O
,	O
not	O
for	O
sale	O
,	O
yet	O
they	O
came	O
furnished	O
with	O
orders	O
,	O
perhaps	O
for	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
families	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
generally	O
rich	O
,	O
would	O
frequently	O
lay	O
out	O
six	O
hundred	O
or	O
eight	O
hundred	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
a	O
man	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
most	O
excellent	O
market	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
above	O
thirty	O
thousand	O
pieces	O
of	O

that	O
is	O
to	O

the	O
value	O
of	O
it	O

for	O
they	O
still	O
paid	O
all	O
in	O

Here	O
we	O
had	O
opportunity	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
quantity	O
of	O
good	O
flour	O
,	O
or	O
wheat	O
meal	O
,	O
of	O
very	O
good	O

to	O

of	O
that	O

of	O
wheat	O
;	O
and	O
withal	O
,	O
had	O
good	O
biscuit	O
baked	O
on	O

so	O
that	O
now	O
we	O
got	O
a	O
large	O
recruit	O
of	O
bread	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
began	O
to	O
make	O
puddings	O

and	O
lived	O
very	O
comfortably	O

We	O
likewise	O
got	O
good	O
sugar	O
at	O
the	O
ingenioes	O

sugar-mills	O

of	O
which	O
there	O
were	O

here	O

and	O
the	O
farther	O

we	O
went	O
their	O

now	O
in	O

We	O
had	O
but	O
one	O
port	O
now	O
of	O
any	O
consequence	O
that	O
we	O
intended	O
to	O
touch	O
at	O

we	O

to	O
the	O
main	O

aimed	O
at	O

which	O
was	O
Lima	PNM

this	O

The	O
people	O
were	O
very	O
shy	O
of	O
us	O
here	O

as	O
having	O
been	O
much	O
upon	O
their	O
guard	O
for	O
some	O
years	O

for	O
fear	O
of	O

but	O
when	O
they	O
understood	O
we	O
were	O
French	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
French	O
captain	O
sent	O
two	O

to	O
them	O
from	O
a	O
merchant	O
at	O
St.	PNM
Jago	PNM
,	O
they	O
were	O
then	O
very	O
well	O
satisfied	O

and	O
we	O
had	O
full	O
freedom	O
of	O
commerce	O
here	O
also	O

From	O

we	O
came	O

Had	O
we	O
made	O
the	O

here	O

we	O
should	O
,	O
at	O

on	O

the	O

upon	O

But	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
having	O
brought	O
letters	O
to	O
a	O
principal	O
merchant	O
of	O
Lima	PNM

he	O
instructed	O
him	O
how	O
to	O
manage	O
himself	O
at	O
his	O
first	O
coming	O
into	O
that	O
port	O

was	O
to	O

to	O

him	O

Upon	O
this	O

the	O

go	O
on	O

understood	O
him	O

and	O
would	O
not	O
grant	O
it	O
by	O
any	O

The	O
reason	O
was	O

because	O
there	O
had	O
been	O
such	O
a	O
general	O
complaint	O
by	O

the	O

Now	O

though	O
this	O
made	O
our	O

it	O
was	O

our	O

But	O
,	O
besides	O
all	O
these	O
difficulties	O

I	O
had	O
other	O
projects	O
in	O

against	O

otherwise	O

had	O
I	O
resolved	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
not	O
have	O
much	O

myself	O
about	O
obtaining	O
a	O
license	O
from	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
a	O
sufficient	O
number	O
of	O
men	O
to	O
have	O
forced	O
our	O
way	O

we	O
should	O
not	O

stood	O

or	O
not	O

But	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
my	O
views	O
lay	O
another	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
head	O
had	O
been	O
long	O
working	O
upon	O
the	O
discourse	O
my	O
men	O
had	O
had	O
with	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
at	O
Baldavia	PNM

I	O
frequently	O
talked	O
with	O
the	O
two	O
Chilian	O
Indians	O
whom	O
I	O
had	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
spoke	O
Spanish	O
pretty	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
whom	O
we	O
had	O
taught	O
to	O
speak	O
a	O
little	O
English	O

I	O
had	O
taken	O
care	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
have	O
all	O
the	O
good	O
usage	O
imaginable	O
on	O
board	O

I	O
had	O
given	O
them	O
each	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
suit	O
of	O
clothes	O
made	O
by	O
our	O
tailor	O
,	O
but	O
after	O
their	O
own	O
manner	O
,	O
with	O
each	O
of	O
them	O
a	O
baize	O

had	O
given	O
them	O
hats	O

shoes	O

and	O
everything	O
they	O
desired	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
mighty	O
well	O
pleased	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
talked	O
very	O
freely	O
with	O
them	O
about	O
the	O
passage	O
of	O
the	O
mountains	O

for	O
that	O
was	O
now	O
my	O
grand	O

While	O
I	O
was	O
coming	O
up	O
the	O
Chilian	O

you	O

at	O

at	O
the	O
Conception	O
,	O
at	O
Arica	PNM
,	O
and	O
even	O
at	O
Lima	PNM
itself	O
,	O
we	O
inquired	O
on	O
all	O

into	O
the	O
situation	O
of	O
the	O
country	O

the	O
manner	O

and	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
country	O
it	O
was	O
beyond	O

and	O
we	O
found	O
them	O
all	O

in	O
the	O

and	O
that	O

for	O
so	O
they	O

was	O
the	O

ridge	O
of	O

as	O
we	O

the	O

was	O
no	O
strange	O
thing	O

That	O
there	O
were	O
not	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
places	O
found	O
out	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
passed	O
as	O
well	O
with	O
horses	O
and	O

as	O
on	O

and	O
even	O
some	O
with	O

,	O
in	O

they	O
told	O
us	O
at	O
Lima	PNM
,	O
that	O
from	O
Potosi	PNM
,	O
and	O
the	O
towns	O
thereabouts	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
long	O
valley	O

which	O
ran	O
for	O
one	O
hundred	O
and	O
sixty	O
leagues	O
in	O
length	O
southward	O

and	O
south-east	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
continued	O
until	O
the	O

it	O
opened	O
into	O
the	O
main	O
level	O
country	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
several	O
rivers	O
which	O
began	O
in	O
that	O
great	O
valley	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
ran	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
and	O
south-east	O
,	O
and	O
afterwards	O
went	O
away	O
east	O
,	O
and	O
east-north-east	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
fell	O
into	O
the	O
great	O
Rio	PNM

,	O
and	O
emptied	O
themselves	O
into	O
the	O
North	PNM
Seas	PNM
;	O
and	O
that	O
merchants	O
travelled	O
to	O
those	O
rivers	O

and	O
then	O
went	O
down	O
in	O

as	O

the	O

or	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
the	O
Ascension	O

and	O
the	O
Buenos	PNM

This	O
was	O
very	O
satisfying	O
you	O
may	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
especially	O
to	O
hear	O
them	O
agree	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
Andes	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
passed	O
;	O
though	O
passing	O

hereabouts	O

-LRB-	O
where	O
I	O

one	O

-RRB-	O
,	O
was	O
no	O
part	O
of	O
my	O
project	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
laid	O
up	O
all	O
these	O
things	O
in	O
my	O
mind	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
act	O
as	O
I	O
should	O
see	O
cause	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
now	O
got	O
into	O
a	O
very	O
hot	O
climate	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
whatever	O
was	O
the	O
cause	O
,	O
my	O
men	O
began	O
to	O
grow	O
very	O
sickly	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
to	O
such	O
a	O
degree	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
once	O
afraid	O
we	O
had	O
got	O
the	O
plague	O
among	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
our	O
surgeons	O
,	O
who	O
we	O
all	O
call	O
doctors	O
at	O
sea	O
,	O
assured	O
me	O
there	O
was	O
nothing	O
of	O
that	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
we	O
buried	O
seventeen	O
men	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
between	O
twenty	O
and	O
thirty	O
more	O
sick	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
dangerously	O
too	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
extremity	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
really	O
very	O
much	O
concerned	O
about	O
it	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
doctors	O
came	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
at	O
the	O
city	O
-LRB-	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
at	O
Lima	PNM
-RRB-	O
to	O
buy	O
some	O
drugs	O
and	O
medicines	O
,	O
to	O
recruit	O
his	O
chest	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
had	O
fallen	O
into	O
company	O
with	O
an	O
Irish	O
Jesuit	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
he	O
found	O
,	O
was	O
an	O
extraordinary	O
good	O
physician	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
had	O
some	O
discourse	O
with	O
him	O
about	O
our	O
sick	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
believed	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
word	O
or	O
two	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
persuade	O
him	O
to	O
come	O
and	O
visit	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
very	O
loath	O
to	O
consent	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
to	O
the	O
surgeon	O
,	O
If	O
he	O
is	O
an	O
Irishman	O
,	O
he	O
speaks	O
English	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
will	O
presently	O
perceive	O
that	O
we	O
are	O
all	O
Englishmen	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
we	O
shall	O
be	O
betrayed	O
;	O
all	O
our	O
designs	O
will	O
be	O
blown	O
up	O
at	O
once	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
farther	O
measures	O
be	O
all	O
broken	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
consent	O
.	O

This	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
speak	O
from	O
the	O
fear	O
of	O
any	O
hurt	O
they	O
could	O
have	O
done	O
me	O
by	O
force	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
reason	O
to	O
value	O
that	O
,	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
have	O
fought	O
my	O
way	O
clear	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
seas	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
put	O
to	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
traded	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
by	O
stratagem	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
many	O
considerable	O
views	O
still	O
behind	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
unwilling	O
to	O
be	O
disappointed	O
by	O
the	O
discovery	O
of	O
my	O
schemes	O
,	O
or	O
that	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
should	O
know	O
upon	O
what	O
a	O
double	O
foundation	O
I	O
acted	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
French	O
ally	O
and	O
merchant	O
,	O
or	O
an	O
English	O
enemy	O
and	O
privateer	O
,	O
just	O
as	O
I	O
pleased	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
opportunity	O
should	O
offer	O
;	O
in	O
which	O
case	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
sure	O
to	O
have	O
trepanned	O
me	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
under	O
pretence	O
of	O
the	O
former	O
,	O
and	O
have	O
used	O
me	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
ever	O
should	O
get	O
an	O
advantage	O
over	O
me	O
,	O
as	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
latter	O
.	O

This	O
made	O
me	O
very	O
cautious	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
good	O
reason	O
for	O
it	O
too	O
;	O
and	O
yet	O
the	O
sickness	O
and	O
danger	O
of	O
my	O
men	O
pressed	O
me	O
very	O
hard	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
advice	O
of	O
a	O
good	O
physician	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
possible	O
,	O
and	O
especially	O
to	O
be	O
satisfied	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
really	O
the	O
plague	O
or	O
no	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
uneasy	O
about	O
that	O
.	O

But	O
my	O
surgeon	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
my	O
apprehension	O
of	O
discovery	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
undertake	O
to	O
prevent	O
it	O
by	O
this	O
method	O
.	O

First	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
he	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
Irishman	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
French	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
I	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
but	O
to	O
order	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
as	O
little	O
English	O
should	O
be	O
spoke	O
in	O
his	O
hearing	O
as	O
possible	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
difficult	O
,	O
for	O
almost	O
all	O
our	O
men	O
had	O
a	O
little	O
French	O
at	O
their	O
tongue	O
's	O
end	O
,	O
by	O
having	O
so	O
many	O
Frenchmen	O
on	O
board	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
others	O
had	O
the	O
Levant	O
jargon	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
call	O
Lingua	PNM
Frank	PNM
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
but	O
due	O
caution	O
,	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
suddenly	O
perceived	O
what	O
countrymen	O
they	O
were	O
.	O

Besides	O
this	O
,	O
the	O
surgeon	O
ordered	O
,	O
that	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
Padre	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
surrounded	O
with	O
French	O
seamen	O
only	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
whom	O
should	O
be	O
ordered	O
to	O
follow	O
him	O
from	O
place	O
to	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
chop	O
in	O
with	O
their	O
nimble	O
tongues	O
,	O
upon	O
some	O
occasion	O
or	O
other	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
hear	O
French	O
spoken	O
wherever	O
he	O
turned	O
himself	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
,	O
which	O
indeed	O
appeared	O
very	O
easy	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
,	O
I	O
agreed	O
to	O
let	O
the	O
doctor	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
accordingly	O
the	O
surgeon	O
brought	O
him	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
where	O
Captain	O

received	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
cabin	O

and	O
treated	O
him	O
very	O
handsomely	O
,	O
but	O
nothing	O
was	O
spoken	O

French	O
or	O
Spanish	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
surgeon	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
pretended	O
himself	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
Irishman	O
,	O
acted	O
as	O
interpreter	O
between	O
the	O
doctor	O
and	O
us	O

Here	O
we	O
told	O
him	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
that	O
were	O
sick	O
;	O
some	O
of	O
them	O

indeed	O
,	O
were	O
French	O

and	O
others	O
that	O
could	O

were	O

to	O

to	O
him	O

those	O
the	O

who	O
were	O

he	O

design	O
in	O
his	O

which	O
,	O
on	O
a	O

he	O
communicated	O
in	O

to	O
the	O
surgeon	O

who	O
conversed	O
with	O
him	O

him	O
to	O

and	O
which	O
was	O
to	O
him	O

indeed	O

of	O
the	O

The	O
case	O
was	O
this	O

He	O
took	O
our	O
surgeon	O
on	O
shore	O
with	O
him	O
one	O
day	O
from	O
the	O
Madagascar	O
ship	O
,	O
where	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
with	O
him	O
to	O
visit	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
sick	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
drinking	O
a	O
glass	O
of	O
wine	O
with	O
him	O

he	O
told	O
him	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
favour	O
to	O

of	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
thing	O
to	O
reveal	O
to	O
him	O
in	O
confidence	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
of	O
the	O
utmost	O
consequence	O
to	O
himself	O
though	O
of	O
no	O
great	O
value	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
-LRB-	O
the	O
surgeon	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
promise	O
the	O
utmost	O
secrecy	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
on	O
his	O
faith	O
and	O
honour	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
put	O
his	O
life	O
into	O
his	O
hands	O
.	O

For	O
,	O
seignior	O
,	O
said	O
he	O
,	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
no	O
other	O
,	O
nor	O
would	O
anything	O
less	O
than	O
my	O
life	O
pay	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
if	O
you	O
should	O
discover	O
it	O
to	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
here	O
,	O
or	O
anywhere	O
else	O
on	O
this	O
coast	O

The	O
surgeon	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
honest	O
man	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
indeed	O
the	O
index	O
of	O
it	O
in	O
his	O
face	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
Padre	O
said	O
afterwards	O
,	O
he	O
inclined	O
to	O
put	O
this	O
confidence	O
in	O
him	O
because	O
he	O
thought	O
he	O
saw	O
something	O
of	O
an	O
honest	O
man	O
in	O
his	O
very	O
countenance	O
.	O

After	O
so	O
frank	O
a	O
beginning	O
,	O
the	O
surgeon	O
made	O
no	O
scruple	O
to	O
tell	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
seeing	O
he	O
inclined	O
to	O
treat	O
him	O
with	O
such	O
confidence	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
put	O
a	O
trust	O
of	O
so	O
great	O
importance	O
in	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
give	O
him	O
all	O
the	O
assurance	O
in	O
his	O
power	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
be	O
as	O
faithful	O
to	O
him	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
possible	O
to	O
be	O
to	O
himself	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
secret	O
should	O
never	O
go	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
mouth	O
to	O
any	O
one	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
such	O
and	O
at	O
such	O
time	O
as	O
he	O
should	O
consent	O
to	O
and	O
direct	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
he	O
used	O
so	O
many	O
solemn	O
protestations	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
Padre	O
made	O
no	O
scruple	O
to	O
trust	O
him	O
with	O
the	O
secret	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
was	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
putting	O
his	O
life	O
into	O
his	O
hands	O
.	O

The	O
case	O
was	O
this	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
him	O
he	O
had	O
heard	O
them	O
talk	O
of	O
going	O
to	O
Ireland	PNM
in	O
their	O
return	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
thirty	O
years	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
country	O
,	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
remote	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
never	O
likely	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
ever	O
see	O
it	O
again	O
,	O
the	O
notion	O
he	O
had	O
entertained	O
that	O
this	O
ship	O
was	O
going	O
thither	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
set	O
him	O
on	O
shore	O
there	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
once	O
more	O
see	O
his	O
native	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
family	O
and	O
friends	O
,	O
had	O
filled	O
his	O
mind	O
with	O
such	O
a	O
surprising	O
joy	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
no	O
longer	O
contain	O
himself	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
procure	O
leave	O
of	O
the	O
captain	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
come	O
privately	O
on	O
board	O
and	O
take	O
his	O
passage	O
home	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
willingly	O
pay	O
whatever	O
the	O
captain	O
should	O
desire	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
done	O
with	O
the	O
greatest	O
secrecy	O
imaginable	O
,	O
or	O
else	O
he	O
was	O
ruined	O
;	O
for	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
discovered	O
and	O
stopped	O
,	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
confined	O
in	O
the	O
Jesuit	O
's	O
house	O
there	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
he	O
lived	O
,	O
without	O
hope	O
of	O
redemption	O
.	O

The	O
surgeon	O
told	O
him	O
the	O
thing	O
was	O
easy	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
give	O
him	O
leave	O
to	O
acquaint	O
one	O
man	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
not	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
certain	O
Englishman	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
a	O
considerable	O
person	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
without	O
whom	O
the	O
captain	O
did	O
nothing	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
secure	O
to	O
trust	O
,	O
by	O
far	O
,	O
than	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
.	O

The	O
Padre	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
without	O
asking	O
him	O
for	O
any	O
reasons	O
,	O
since	O
he	O
had	O
put	O
his	O
life	O
and	O
liberty	O
in	O
his	O
hands	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
trust	O
him	O
with	O
the	O
management	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
,	O
in	O
whatever	O
way	O
he	O
chose	O
to	O
conduct	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
surgeon	O
accordingly	O
brought	O
him	O
on	O
board	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
making	O
a	O
confidence	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
matter	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
turned	O
to	O
the	O
Padre	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
in	O
English	O
,	O
giving	O
him	O
my	O
hand	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
under	O
all	O
the	O
engagements	O
and	O
promises	O
of	O
secrecy	O
that	O
our	O
surgeon	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
,	O
for	O
his	O
security	O
and	O
satisfaction	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
merited	O
too	O
well	O
of	O
us	O
to	O
wish	O
him	O
any	O
ill	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
whole	O
ship	O
should	O
be	O
engaged	O
for	O
his	O
security	O
.	O

That	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
his	O
coming	O
on	O
board	O
and	O
bringing	O
anything	O
off	O
that	O
belonged	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
must	O
take	O
his	O
own	O
measures	O
,	O
and	O
answer	O
to	O
himself	O
for	O
the	O
success	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
,	O
after	O
he	O
was	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
sink	O
the	O
ship	O
under	O
him	O
,	O
or	O
blow	O
her	O
aloft	O
in	O
the	O
air	O
,	O
before	O
we	O
would	O
deliver	O
him	O
up	O
on	O
any	O
account	O
whatever	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
so	O
pleased	O
with	O
my	O
frank	O
way	O
of	O
talking	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
would	O
put	O
his	O
life	O
into	O
my	O
hands	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
freedom	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
before	O
with	O
my	O
surgeon	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
concert	O
measures	O
for	O
his	O
coming	O
on	O
board	O
with	O
secrecy	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
us	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
need	O
of	O
any	O
proposals	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
would	O
acquaint	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
that	O
he	O
intended	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
French	O
ship	O
in	O
the	O
road	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
St.	PNM
Jago	PNM
,	O
where	O
he	O
had	O
several	O
times	O
been	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
manner	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
not	O
the	O
least	O
suspicion	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
very	O
well	O
satisfied	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
make	O
no	O
scruple	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

But	O
his	O
mistake	O
in	O
this	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
his	O
ruin	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
,	O
had	O
it	O
been	O
a	O
Spanish	O
ship	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
mistrusted	O
him	O
,	O
yet	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
named	O
the	O
French	O
ship	O
in	O
the	O
road	O
of	O
Callao	PNM
,	O
they	O
began	O
to	O
question	O
him	O
very	O
smartly	O
about	O
it	O
.	O

Upon	O
which	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
tell	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
since	O
they	O
were	O
doubtful	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
go	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
telling	O
them	O
withal	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
hard	O
to	O
suspect	O
him	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
faithful	O
to	O
his	O
vows	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
reside	O
for	O
near	O
thirty	O
years	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
might	O
frequently	O
have	O
made	O
an	O
escape	O
from	O
them	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
disposed	O
.	O

So	O
,	O
for	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
days	O
,	O
he	O
made	O
no	O
appearance	O
of	O
going	O
at	O
all	O
;	O
but	O
having	O
had	O
private	O
notice	O
from	O
me	O
the	O
evening	O
before	O
we	O
sailed	O
,	O
he	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
came	O
down	O
to	O
Callao	PNM
on	O
a	O
mule	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
surgeon	O
,	O
lying	O
ready	O
with	O
our	O
boat	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
league	O
from	O
the	O
town	O
,	O
as	O
by	O
appointment	O
,	O
took	O
him	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
negro	O
,	O
his	O
servant	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
him	O
safe	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
nor	O
had	O
we	O
received	O
him	O
on	O

half	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
being	O
unmoored	O
and	O
ready	O
to	O
sail	O
,	O
we	O
put	O
out	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
him	O
clear	O
off	O
.	O

He	O
made	O
his	O
excuses	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
come	O
away	O
naked	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
his	O
profession	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
purposed	O
to	O
have	O
furnished	O
himself	O
with	O
some	O
provisions	O
for	O
the	O
voyage	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
unexpected	O
suspicions	O
of	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
their	O
college	O
,	O
or	O
house	O
,	O
had	O
obliged	O
him	O
to	O
come	O
away	O
in	O
a	O
manner	O
that	O
would	O
not	O
admit	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
for	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
rather	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
have	O
made	O
his	O
escape	O
than	O
to	O
have	O
come	O
fairly	O
off	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
he	O
was	O
very	O
welcome	O
-LRB-	O
and	O
indeed	O
so	O
he	O
was	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
already	O
more	O
worth	O
to	O
us	O
than	O
ten	O
times	O
his	O
passage	O
came	O
to	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
entered	O
into	O
immediate	O
pay	O
,	O
as	O
physician	O
to	O
both	O
the	O
ships	O

which	O
I	O
was	O
sure	O
none	O
of	O
our	O
surgeons	O
would	O
repine	O
at	O

rather	O
be	O
glad	O
of	O
;	O
and	O
accordingly	O
I	O
immediately	O
ordered	O
him	O
a	O
cabin	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
apartment	O
adjoining	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
appointed	O
him	O
to	O
eat	O
in	O
my	O
own	O
mess	O
whenever	O
he	O
pleased	O
,	O
or	O
by	O
himself	O
,	O
on	O
his	O
particular	O
days	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
thought	O
proper	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O
conceal	O
from	O
him	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
indeed	O
an	O
English	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
the	O
captain	O
in	O
chief	O
,	O
except	O
,	O
as	O
has	O
been	O
said	O
,	O
upon	O
occasion	O
of	O
coming	O
to	O
any	O
particular	O
town	O
of	O
Spain	PNM
.	O

I	O
let	O
him	O
know	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
commission	O
to	O
make	O
prize	O
of	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
and	O
appear	O
their	O
open	O
enemy	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
chosen	O
to	O
treat	O
them	O
as	O
friends	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
way	O
of	O
commerce	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
seen	O
.	O

He	O
admired	O
much	O
the	O
moderation	O
I	O
had	O
used	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
I	O
had	O
avoided	O
enriching	O
myself	O
with	O
the	O
spoil	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
done	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
made	O
me	O
many	O
compliments	O
upon	O
that	O
head	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
excused	O
hearing	O
,	O
and	O
begged	O
him	O
to	O
forbear	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
we	O
were	O
Christians	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
made	O
a	O
very	O
prosperous	O
voyage	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
resolved	O
not	O
to	O
do	O
any	O
honest	O
man	O
the	O
least	O
injustice	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
avoid	O
it	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
must	O
observe	O
here	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
enter	O
immediately	O
into	O
all	O
this	O
confidence	O
with	O
him	O
neither	O
,	O
nor	O
all	O
at	O
once	O
;	O
neither	O
did	O
I	O
let	O
him	O
into	O
any	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
under	O
the	O
same	O
solemn	O
engagements	O
of	O
secrecy	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
laid	O
upon	O
us	O
,	O
nor	O
till	O
I	O
was	O
come	O
above	O
eighty	O
leagues	O
south	O
from	O
Lima	PNM
.	O

The	O
first	O
thing	O
I	O
took	O
the	O
freedom	O
to	O
speak	O
to	O
him	O
upon	O
was	O
this	O
.	O

Finding	O
his	O
habit	O
a	O
little	O
offensive	O
to	O
our	O
rude	O
seamen	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
him	O
into	O
the	O
cabin	O
the	O
very	O
next	O
day	O
after	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
mention	O
to	O
him	O
what	O
I	O
knew	O
he	O
would	O
soon	O
perceive	O
;	O
namely	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
Protestants	O
,	O
except	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
of	O
the	O
Frenchmen	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
how	O
agreeable	O
that	O
might	O
be	O
to	O
him	O
.	O

He	O
answered	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
offended	O
with	O
that	O
part	O
;	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
none	O
of	O
his	O
business	O
to	O
inquire	O
into	O
any	O
one	O
's	O
opinion	O
any	O
farther	O
than	O
they	O
gave	O
him	O
leave	O
;	O
that	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
his	O
business	O
to	O
cure	O
the	O
souls	O
of	O
men	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
his	O
business	O
on	O
board	O
was	O
to	O
cure	O
their	O
bodies	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
for	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
exercise	O
no	O
other	O
function	O
than	O
that	O
of	O
a	O
physician	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
without	O
my	O
leave	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
was	O
very	O
obliging	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
for	O
his	O
own	O
sake	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
proposal	O
to	O
make	O
him	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
,	O
whether	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
disagreeable	O
to	O
him	O
to	O
lay	O
aside	O
the	O
habit	O
of	O
a	O
religious	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
on	O
that	O
of	O
a	O
gentleman	O
,	O
so	O
to	O
accommodate	O
himself	O
the	O
more	O
easily	O
to	O
the	O
men	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
who	O
perhaps	O
might	O
be	O
rude	O
to	O
him	O
in	O
his	O
habit	O
,	O
seamen	O
being	O
not	O
always	O
men	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
refined	O
manners	O
.	O

He	O
thanked	O
me	O
very	O
sincerely	O
;	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
England	PNM
as	O
well	O
as	O
in	O
Ireland	PNM
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
went	O
dressed	O
there	O
as	O
a	O
gentleman	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
ready	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
now	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
thought	O
fit	O
,	O
to	O
avoid	O
giving	O
any	O
offence	O
;	O
and	O
added	O
that	O
he	O
chose	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
.	O

But	O
then	O
,	O
smiling	O
,	O
said	O
he	O
was	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
loss	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
clothes	O
.	O

I	O
bade	O
him	O
take	O
no	O
care	O
about	O
that	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
would	O
furnish	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
immediately	O
we	O
dressed	O
him	O
up	O
like	O
an	O
Englishman	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
suit	O
of	O
very	O
good	O
clothes	O
,	O
which	O
belonged	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
midshipmen	O
who	O
died	O
.	O

I	O
gave	O
him	O
also	O
a	O
good	O
wig	O
and	O
a	O
sword	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
presently	O
appeared	O
upon	O
the	O
quarter-deck	O
like	O
a	O
grave	O
physician	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
called	O
doctor	O
.	O

From	O
that	O
minute	O
,	O
by	O
whose	O
contrivance	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
,	O
it	O
went	O
current	O
among	O
the	O
seamen	O
that	O
the	O
Spanish	O
doctor	O
was	O
an	O
Englishman	O
and	O
a	O
protestant	O
,	O
and	O
only	O
had	O
put	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
habit	O
to	O
disguise	O
himself	O
and	O
make	O
his	O
escape	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
so	O
universally	O
believed	O
that	O
it	O
held	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
day	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
voyage	O
,	O
for	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
knew	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
care	O
that	O
nobody	O
should	O
ever	O
contradict	O
it	O
:	O
and	O
as	O
for	O
the	O
doctor	O
himself	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
first	O
heard	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
nothing	O
could	O
be	O
more	O
to	O
his	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
take	O
care	O
to	O
confirm	O
the	O
opinion	O
of	O
it	O
among	O
all	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
lay	O
in	O
his	O
power	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
the	O
doctor	O
earnestly	O
desired	O
we	O
would	O
be	O
mindful	O
,	O
that	O
as	O
he	O
should	O
never	O
offer	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
whatever	O
port	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
afterwards	O
,	O
none	O
of	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
might	O
,	O
by	O
inquiry	O
,	O
hear	O
upon	O
any	O
occasion	O
of	O
his	O
being	O
on	O
board	O
our	O
ship	O
;	O
but	O
above	O
all	O
,	O
that	O
none	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
the	O
officers	O
especially	O
,	O
would	O
ever	O
come	O
so	O
much	O
in	O
reach	O
of	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
on	O
shore	O
as	O
to	O
put	O
it	O
in	O
their	O
power	O
to	O
seize	O
upon	O
them	O
by	O
reprisal	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
oblige	O
us	O
to	O
deliver	O
him	O
up	O
by	O
way	O
of	O
exchange	O
.	O

I	O
went	O
so	O
far	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
did	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
also	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
assure	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
should	O
by	O
any	O
stratagem	O
,	O
or	O
by	O
force	O
,	O
get	O
any	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
nay	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
were	O
ourselves	O
,	O
into	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
yet	O
he	O
should	O
,	O
upon	O
no	O
conditions	O
whatever	O
be	O
delivered	O
up	O
.	O

And	O
indeed	O
for	O
this	O
very	O
reason	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
shy	O
of	O
going	O
on	O
shore	O
at	O
all	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
really	O
no	O
business	O
any	O
where	O
but	O
just	O
for	O
water	O
and	O
fresh	O
provisions	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
also	O
taken	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
store	O
of	O
at	O
Lima	PNM
,	O
so	O
we	O
put	O
in	O
nowhere	O
at	O
all	O
on	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Peru	PNM
,	O
because	O
there	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
more	O
particularly	O
liable	O
to	O
the	O
impertinencies	O
of	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
's	O
inquiry	O
;	O
as	O
to	O
force	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
furnished	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
the	O
least	O
apprehensive	O
of	O
that	O
.	O

Being	O
thus	O
,	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
resolved	O
to	O
have	O
no	O
more	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Peru	PNM
,	O
we	O
stood	O
off	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
first	O
land	O
we	O
made	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
unfrequented	O
island	O
in	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
17	O
°	O
13	O
'	O
,	O
where	O
our	O
men	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
in	O
the	O
boats	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
times	O
,	O
to	O
catch	O
tortoises	O
or	O
turtles	O
,	O
being	O
the	O
first	O
we	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
since	O
we	O
came	O
from	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
.	O

And	O
here	O
they	O
took	O
so	O
many	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
such	O
a	O
prodigious	O
quantity	O
of	O
eggs	O
out	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
whole	O
company	O
of	O
both	O
ships	O
lived	O
on	O
them	O
till	O
within	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
days	O
of	O
our	O
coming	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Juan	PNM
Fernandez	PNM
,	O
which	O
was	O
our	O
next	O
port	O
.	O

Some	O
of	O
these	O
tortoises	O
were	O
so	O
large	O
and	O
so	O
heavy	O
that	O
no	O
single	O
man	O
could	O
turn	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
four	O
men	O
could	O
carry	O
to	O
the	O
boats	O
.	O

We	O
met	O
with	O
some	O
bad	O
weather	O
after	O
this	O
,	O
which	O
blew	O
us	O
off	O
to	O
sea	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
blowing	O
very	O
hard	O
at	O
the	O
south-east	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
great	O
a	O
wind	O
as	O
to	O
endanger	O
us	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
lost	O
sight	O
of	O
one	O
another	O
more	O
in	O
this	O
storm	O
than	O
we	O
had	O
done	O
in	O
all	O
our	O
voyage	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
none	O
of	O
us	O
in	O
any	O
great	O
concern	O
for	O
it	O
now	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
had	O
agreed	O
before	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
should	O
lose	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
make	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
our	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Juan	PNM
Fernandez	PNM
;	O
and	O
this	O
we	O
observed	O
now	O
so	O
directly	O
,	O
that	O
both	O
of	O
us	O
shaping	O
our	O
course	O
for	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
storm	O
abated	O
,	O
came	O
in	O
sight	O
of	O
one	O
another	O
long	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
thither	O
,	O
which	O
proved	O
very	O
agreeable	O
to	O
us	O
all	O

We	O
were	O
,	O
including	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
the	O
storm	O

two	O
hundred	O

eighteen	O
days	O
from	O
Lima	PNM

the	O

most	O

the	O

cross	O
contrary	O

and	O
more	O
bad	O
weather	O
than	O
is	O
usual	O
in	O
those	O

we	O
were	O
all	O
in	O
good	O
condition	O

both	O

Here	O
we	O
fell	O
to	O
the	O

And	O
here	O
our	O
new	O

set	O
some	O

to	O

that	O

to	O

some	O

Our	O

but	O
had	O
never	O
observed	O
the	O

kind	O
in	O
England	PNM

They	O
gave	O
me	O
the	O
names	O
of	O
them	O

and	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
only	O
discovery	O
in	O
all	O
my	O

to	O

of	O

which	O
I	O
regret	O
the	O
omission	O
of	O
very	O
much	O

While	O
we	O
were	O
here	O

an	O
odd	O
accident	O
gave	O
me	O
some	O
uneasiness	O

did	O

the	O
road	O
,	O
she	O
lay	O
by	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
she	O
came	O
to	O
look	O
into	O
the	O
port	O
only	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
she	O
perceived	O
that	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
loose	O
our	O
sails	O
to	O
speak	O
with	O
her	O
,	O
she	O
stretched	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
altering	O
her	O
course	O
,	O
stood	O
away	O
north-east	O
,	O
using	O
oars	O
to	O
assist	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
she	O
got	O
away	O
.	O

Nothing	O
could	O
be	O
more	O
evident	O
to	O
us	O
than	O
that	O
she	O
came	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
us	O
,	O
nor	O
could	O
we	O
imagine	O
anything	O
less	O
;	O
from	O
whence	O
we	O
immediately	O
concluded	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
discovered	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
our	O
taking	O
away	O
the	O
doctor	O
had	O
given	O
a	O
great	O
alarm	O
among	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
afterwards	O
came	O
to	O
understand	O
it	O
had	O
done	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
came	O
a	O
little	O
while	O
afterwards	O
to	O
a	O
better	O
understanding	O
about	O
the	O
frigate	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
so	O
uneasy	O
about	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
speak	O
with	O
her	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
Madagascar	O
ship	O
,	O
which	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
,	O
was	O
rather	O
a	O
better	O
sailer	O
than	O
our	O
own	O
,	O
to	O
stand	O
in	O
directly	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
Chili	PNM
,	O
and	O
then	O
to	O
ply	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
,	O
just	O
in	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
till	O
he	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
22	O
°	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
saw	O
nothing	O
in	O
all	O
that	O
run	O
,	O
then	O
to	O
come	O
down	O
again	O
directly	O
into	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
of	O
Juan	PNM
Fernandez	PNM
,	O
but	O
keeping	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
ten	O
leagues	O
off	O
farther	O
than	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
ply	O
off	O
and	O
on	O
in	O
that	O
latitude	O
for	O
five	O
days	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
meet	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
to	O
stand	O
in	O
for	O
the	O
island	O
.	O

While	O
he	O
did	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
the	O
same	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
near	O
fifty	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
being	O
the	O
distance	O
which	O
I	O
thought	O
the	O
frigate	O
kept	O
in	O
as	O
she	O
stood	O
away	O
from	O
me	O
.	O

We	O
made	O
our	O
cruise	O
both	O
of	O
us	O
very	O
punctually	O
;	O
I	O
found	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
station	O
we	O
agreed	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
both	O
stood	O
into	O
the	O
road	O
again	O
from	O
whence	O
we	O
came	O
.	O

We	O
no	O
sooner	O
made	O
the	O
road	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
frigate	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
called	O
her	O
,	O
with	O
another	O
ship	O
at	O
an	O
anchor	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
road	O
where	O
she	O
had	O
seen	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
easy	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
both	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
surprise	O
and	O
hurry	O
at	O
our	O
appearing	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
under	O
sail	O
in	O
so	O
very	O
little	O
time	O
as	O
that	O
we	O
easily	O
saw	O
they	O
had	O
slipped	O
their	O
cables	O
,	O
or	O
cut	O
away	O
their	O
anchors	O
.	O

They	O
fired	O
guns	O
twice	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
found	O
was	O
a	O
signal	O
for	O
their	O
boats	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
;	O
and	O
soon	O
after	O
we	O
saw	O
three	O
boats	O
go	O
off	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
though	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
understood	O
afterwards	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
leave	O
sixteen	O
or	O
seventeen	O
of	O
their	O
men	O
behind	O
them	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
being	O
among	O
the	O
rocks	O
catching	O
of	O
goats	O
,	O
either	O
did	O
not	O
hear	O
the	O
signals	O
,	O
or	O
could	O
not	O
come	O
to	O
their	O
boats	O
time	O
enough	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
saw	O
them	O
in	O
this	O
hurry	O
,	O
we	O
thought	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
something	O
extraordinary	O
,	O
and	O
bore	O
down	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
having	O
the	O
weather-gage	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
ships	O
of	O
pretty	O
good	O
force	O
,	O
and	O
full	O
of	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
saw	O
we	O
were	O
resolved	O
to	O
speak	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
getting	O
away	O
from	O
us	O
,	O
they	O
made	O
ready	O
to	O
engage	O
;	O
and	O
putting	O
themselves	O
upon	O
a-wind	O
,	O
first	O
stretching	O
ahead	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
weather-gage	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
thought	O
they	O
were	O
pretty	O
well	O
,	O
boldly	O
tacked	O
,	O
and	O
lay	O
by	O
for	O
us	O
,	O

the	O

We	O
had	O
our	O

colours	O
out	O

;	O
but	O
being	O
just	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
thought	O
,	O
going	O
to	O

,	O
I	O
told	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
I	O
scorned	O
to	O
hide	O
what	O
nation	O
I	O
was	O
of	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
fight	O
for	O
the	O
honour	O
of	O
our	O
country	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
besides	O
,	O
as	O
these	O
people	O
had	O
spread	O
English	O
colours	O
,	O
I	O
ought	O
to	O
let	O
them	O
know	O
what	O
I	O
was	O
;	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
really	O
English	O
and	O
friends	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
not	O
fight	O
by	O
mistake	O
,	O
and	O
shed	O
the	O
innocent	O
blood	O
of	O
our	O
own	O
countrymen	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
rogues	O
,	O
and	O
counterfeited	O
their	O
being	O
English	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
soon	O
perceive	O
it	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
saw	O
us	O
put	O
out	O
English	O
colours	O
,	O
they	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
lay	O
by	O
awhile	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
we	O
would	O
do	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
as	O
much	O
puzzled	O
as	O
they	O
,	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
came	O
nearer	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
English	O
ships	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
by	O
their	O
bulk	O
as	O
by	O
their	O
way	O
of	O
working	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
I	O
came	O
still	O
nearer	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O
could	O
perceive	O
so	O
plainly	O
by	O
my	O
glasses	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
English	O
seamen	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
signal	O
to	O
our	O
other	O
ship	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
the	O
van	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
just	O
bearing	O
down	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
bring	O
to	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
sent	O
my	O
boat	O
to	O
him	O
to	O
know	O
his	O
opinion	O
.	O

He	O
sent	O
me	O
word	O
,	O
he	O
did	O
believe	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
English	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
more	O
,	O
said	O
he	O
,	O
because	O
they	O
could	O
be	O
no	O
other	O
nation	O
but	O
English	O
or	O
French	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
latter	O
he	O
was	O
sure	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
since	O
we	O
were	O
the	O
largest	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
as	O
plainly	O
see	O
us	O
to	O
be	O
English	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
them	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
he	O
was	O
for	O
fighting	O
them	O
,	O
because	O
they	O
ought	O
to	O
have	O
let	O
us	O
known	O
who	O
they	O
were	O
first	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
fired	O
a	O
gun	O
to	O
bring	O
him	O
too	O
,	O
he	O
lay	O
by	O
a	O
little	O
time	O
till	O
we	O
spoke	O
thus	O
together	O
.	O

While	O
this	O
was	O
doing	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
boats	O
come	O
off	O
with	O
six	O
oars	O
and	O
two	O
men	O
,	O
a	O
lieutenant	O
and	O
trumpeter	O
it	O
seems	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
sitting	O
in	O
the	O
stern	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
holding	O
up	O
a	O
flag	O
of	O
truce	O
;	O
we	O
let	O
them	O
come	O
forward	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
nearer	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
hail	O
them	O
with	O
a	O
speaking	O
trumpet	O
,	O
we	O
asked	O
them	O
what	O
countrymen	O
they	O
were	O
?	O

and	O
they	O
answered	O
Englishmen	O
.	O

Then	O
we	O
asked	O
them	O
whence	O
their	O
ship	O
?	O

Their	O
answer	O
was	O
,	O
from	O
London	PNM
.	O

At	O
which	O
we	O
bade	O
them	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
did	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
soon	O
found	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
countrymen	O
and	O
friends	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
boat	O
went	O
immediately	O
back	O
to	O
let	O
them	O
know	O
it	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
afterwards	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
mere	O
privateers	O
,	O
fitted	O
out	O
from	O
London	PNM
also	O
,	O
but	O
coming	O
last	O
from	O
Jamaica	PNM
;	O
and	O
we	O
let	O
them	O
know	O
no	O
other	O
of	O
ourselves	O
,	O
but	O
declined	O
keeping	O
company	O
,	O
telling	O
them	O
we	O
were	O
bound	O
now	O
upon	O
traffick	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
for	O
purchase	O
;	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
at	O
the	O
East	PNM
Indies	PNM
,	O
had	O
made	O
some	O
prizes	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
going	O
back	O
thither	O
again	O
.	O

They	O
told	O
us	O
they	O
were	O
come	O
into	O
the	O
South	PNM
Seas	PNM
for	O
purchase	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
made	O
little	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
having	O
heard	O
there	O
were	O
three	O
large	O
French	O
men-of-war	O
in	O
those	O
seas	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
Spanish	O
service	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
them	O
wish	O
they	O
had	O
not	O
come	O
about	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
still	O
very	O
doubtful	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
.	O

We	O
assured	O
them	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
the	O
height	O
of	O
Lima	PNM
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
heard	O
of	O
any	O
men-of-war	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
passed	O
for	O
such	O
ourselves	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
were	O
the	O
ships	O
they	O
had	O
heard	O
of	O
;	O
for	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
three	O
sail	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
sometimes	O
carried	O
French	O
colours	O
.	O

This	O
made	O
them	O
very	O
glad	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
certainly	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
passed	O
for	O
three	O
French	O
men-of-war	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
assured	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
went	O
afterwards	O
boldly	O
up	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
several	O
very	O
good	O
prizes	O
.	O

We	O
then	O
found	O
also	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
ships	O
that	O
looked	O
into	O
the	O
road	O
,	O
as	O
above	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
here	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
seeing	O
us	O
then	O
with	O
French	O
colours	O
,	O
took	O
us	O
for	O
the	O
men-of-war	O
they	O
had	O
heard	O
of	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
they	O
added	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
in	O
upon	O
them	O
again	O
,	O
they	O
gave	O
themselves	O
up	O
for	O
lost	O
men	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
resolved	O
to	O
have	O
fought	O
it	O
out	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
to	O
have	O
sunk	O
by	O
our	O
side	O
,	O
or	O
blown	O
themselves	O
up	O
,	O
than	O
be	O
taken	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
sorry	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
made	O
this	O
discovery	O
before	O
we	O
engaged	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
captains	O
were	O
two	O
brave	O
resolute	O
fellows	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
two	O
very	O
good	O
ships	O
under	O
them	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
thirty-six	O
guns	O
,	O
but	O
able	O
to	O
have	O
carried	O
forty-four	O
;	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
called	O
the	O
frigate-built	O
ship	O
,	O
carried	O
twenty-eight	O
guns	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
both	O
full	O
of	O
men	O
.	O

Now	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
should	O
not	O
have	O
feared	O
their	O
force	O
,	O
yet	O
my	O
case	O
differed	O
from	O
what	O
it	O
did	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
had	O
that	O
on	O
board	O
that	O
makes	O
all	O
men	O
cowards	O
,	O
I	O
mean	O
money	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
such	O
a	O
cargo	O
as	O
few	O
British	O
ships	O
ever	O
brought	O
out	O
of	O
those	O
seas	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
that	O
had	O
now	O
no	O
occasion	O
to	O
run	O
needless	O
hazards	O
.	O

So	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
as	O
well	O
pleased	O
without	O
fighting	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
be	O
;	O
besides	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
other	O
projects	O
now	O
in	O
my	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
those	O
of	O
no	O
less	O
consequence	O
than	O

with	O

I	O
would	O
not	O
fear	O
all	O

of	O

that	O

I	O

in	O
my	O

already	O

nothing	O

when	O
I	O
saw	O
farther	O
into	O

myself	O

however	O
,	O
these	O

made	O
me	O
very	O
glad	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
occasion	O
to	O
engage	O
those	O
ships	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
thus	O
to	O
understand	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
all	O
into	O
the	O
road	O
together	O

and	O
I	O
invited	O
the	O
captains	O
of	O
the	O
two	O

on	O

me	O

where	O
I	O
treated	O

I	O
had	O
no	O

out	O

They	O
invited	O
me	O

Captain	O

the	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
Madagascar	O
ship	O
in	O

and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
treated	O
us	O
very	O
nobly	O

After	O
this	O
,	O
we	O
exchanged	O
some	O
presents	O
of	O
refreshments	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
particularly	O
,	O
they	O
sent	O
me	O
a	O
hogshead	O
of	O

which	O
,	O
was	O
very	O
acceptable	O
;	O

I	O

a	O

excusing	O
myself	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
no	O

I	O
sent	O
them	O
also	O
the	O
quantity	O
of	O
one	O

of	O
nutmegs	O
and	O
cloves	O

but	O
the	O
most	O
agreeable	O
present	O
I	O
sent	O
them	O
was	O
twenty	O
pieces	O
of	O
Madagascar	PNM
dried	O
beef	O

cured	O
in	O
the	O

the	O

of	O

they	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
or	O
tasted	O
before	O
;	O
and	O
without	O
question	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
such	O
an	O
excellent	O
way	O
of	O
curing	O
beef	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
I	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
at	O
Madagascar	PNM
again	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
take	O
in	O
a	O
sufficient	O
quantity	O
of	O
beef	O
so	O
preserved	O
to	O
victual	O
the	O

for	O
the	O

I	O
leave	O
it	O

to	O
all	O
English	O
seamen	O
that	O
have	O
occasion	O

use	O
East-India	O

I	O
bought	O
afterwards	O
six	O
hogsheads	O
of	O
rum	O
of	O
these	O

for	O
I	O
found	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
well	O
stored	O
with	O

whatever	O
else	O
they	O
wanted	O

We	O
stayed	O
here	O
twelve	O
or	O
fourteen	O
days	O

took	O
care	O
,	O
by	O
agreement	O

that	O
our	O
men	O
should	O
never	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
the	O

days	O
that	O
their	O
men	O
went	O
on	O

or	O
theirs	O
when	O
ours	O
went	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
to	O
avoid	O
their	O
caballing	O
together	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
avoid	O
quarrelling	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
latter	O
was	O
the	O

We	O
agreed	O

also	O

not	O
to	O

on	O

any	O
of	O

any	O
of	O
the	O

the	O

and	O
this	O
was	O
their	O
advantage	O

for	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
would	O
have	O
given	O
way	O
to	O
that	O

half	O
their	O

would	O
,	O
for	O
aught	O
I	O

have	O
come	O
over	O
to	O
us	O

While	O
we	O
lay	O
here	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
went	O
a-cruising	O

finding	O
the	O

in	O
for	O
the	O

in	O

some	O

I	O

They	O
had	O
some	O

not	O

as	O
we	O
saw	O
them	O
coming	O
in	O
with	O
a	O
prize	O
in	O

we	O
put	O
out	O
our	O
French	O

and	O
gave	O
notice	O
to	O
the	O
privateers	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
for	O
their	O
advantage	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
so	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
indeed	O
it	O

if	O
such	O
a	O

We	O
prevailed	O

to	O
allow	O
us	O

I	O

I	O

Very	O
well	O
,	O
said	O
I	O
,	O
then	O
I	O
think	O
the	O
riches	O
and	O
wealth	O
of	O
America	PNM
is	O
very	O
well	O
searched	O

in	O

No	O

says	O
he	O

it	O
is	O
not	O

neither	O
;	O
for	O
the	O

where	O
even	O
the	O

This	O
he	O

And	O
what	O
,	O
think	O
you	O

seignior	O

said	O
he	O

that	O
in	O

there	O

neither	O

I	O
seemed	O
not	O
to	O
believe	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
believe	O
him	O
at	O
first	O

he	O
returned	O
to	O
me	O
with	O
a	O
question	O

Pray	O

says	O
he	O

how	O
many	O

do	O
you	O
think	O
there	O
may	O
be	O
in	O
this	O
vast	O
country	O
of	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
I	O
could	O
make	O
no	O
guess	O
of	O
the	O
numbers	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
without	O
doubt	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
many	O
thousands	O
,	O
intimating	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
suppose	O
,	O
near	O
a	O
hundred	O
thousand	O
.	O

At	O
which	O
he	O
laughed	O
heartily	O
,	O
and	O
assured	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
not	O
above	O
two	O

five	O

in	O
the	O

besides	O
women	O

and	O
some	O
few	O
soldiers	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
looked	O
upon	O
as	O
nothing	O
to	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
because	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
settled	O
anywhere	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
indeed	O
surprised	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
name	O
several	O
large	O
places	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
had	O
singly	O
more	O
Spaniards	O
in	O
them	O
than	O
what	O
he	O
talked	O
of	O

He	O
presently	O
ran	O
over	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
naming	O
Baldivia	PNM
first	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
most	O
southward	O
,	O
he	O
asked	O
me	O
how	O
many	O
I	O
thought	O
were	O
there	O
?	O

And	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
about	O
three	O
hundred	O
families	O
.	O

He	O
smiled	O
,	O
and	O
assured	O
me	O
there	O
were	O
not	O
above	O
three	O
or	O
four-and-fifty	O
families	O
in	O
the	O
whole	O

and	O
about	O

it	O

the	O

where	O
he	O

In	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
we	O
passed	O
over	O
the	O

came	O
to	O
the	O
capital	O

St.	PNM

,	O
where	O
after	O
I	O
had	O
supposed	O
there	O
were	O
five	O
thousand	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
he	O
protested	O
to	O
me	O
there	O
were	O
not	O
above	O
eight	O
hundred	O
,	O
including	O
the	O
viceroy	O

might	O

nothing	O

for	O

neither	O

Our	O
doctor	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
our	O
interpreter	O
,	O
smiled	O
at	O
this	O
,	O
but	O
merrily	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
was	O
very	O
true	O
,	O
or	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
,	O
intimating	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
the	O
priests	O
do	O
not	O
cultivate	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
yet	O
they	O
might	O
chance	O
to	O
increase	O
the	O
people	O
a	O
little	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
was	O
by	O

to	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
inhabitants	O
at	O
St.	PNM
Jago	PNM
,	O
the	O
doctor	O
agreed	O
with	O
him	O

and	O
said	O
,	O
he	O
believed	O
he	O
had	O
said	O
more	O
than	O
there	O
were	O

rather	O
than	O

As	O
to	O
the	O
kingdom	O
or	O
empire	O
of	O
Peru	PNM
,	O
in	O
which	O
there	O
are	O
many	O

He	O
answered	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
true	O
that	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Lima	PNM
,	O
with	O
the	O
town	O
of	O
Callao	PNM
,	O
was	O
much	O
increased	O
within	O
a	O
few	O
years	O
,	O
and	O
particularly	O
of	O
late	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
settling	O
of	O
between	O
three	O
and	O
four	O
hundred	O
French	O
there	O
,	O
who	O
came	O
by	O
the	O
King	O
of	O

license	PNM
;	O
but	O
that	O
,	O
before	O
the	O
coming	O
of	O
those	O
gentlemen	O
,	O
at	O
which	O
he	O
shook	O
his	O
head	O
,	O
the	O
country	O
was	O
richer	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
were	O
not	O
so	O
many	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
take	O
it	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
now	O
,	O
there	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
reckoned	O
above	O
fifteen	O
hundred	O
families	O
of	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
excluding	O
the	O
soldiers	O
and	O
the	O
clergy	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
above	O
,	O
he	O
reckoned	O
nothing	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
planting	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
.	O

We	O
came	O
then	O
to	O
discourse	O
of	O
the	O
silver	O
mines	O
at	O
Potosi	PNM
,	O
and	O
here	O
he	O
supposed	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
did	O
also	O
,	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
people	O
.	O

But	O
seignior	O
,	O
says	O
he	O
,	O
what	O
people	O
is	O
it	O
you	O
are	O
speaking	O
of	O
?	O

There	O
are	O
many	O
thousands	O
of	O
servants	O
,	O
but	O
few	O
masters	O
;	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
garrison	O
of	O
four	O
hundred	O
soldiers	O
always	O
kept	O
in	O
arms	O
and	O
in	O
good	O
order	O
,	O
to	O
secure	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
keep	O
the	O
negroes	O
,	O
and	O
criminals	O
who	O
work	O
in	O
the	O
mines	O
,	O
in	O
subjection	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
not	O
besides	O
five	O
hundred	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
men	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
whole	O
place	O
and	O
its	O
adjacents	O
.	O

So	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
allow	O
above	O
seven	O
thousand	O
Spaniards	O
in	O
the	O
whole	O
empire	O
of	O
Peru	PNM
,	O
and	O
two	O
thousand	O
five	O
hundred	O
in	O
Chili	O
;	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
allowing	O
twice	O
as	O
many	O
as	O
both	O
these	O
in	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Mexico	PNM
only	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
discourse	O
was	O
over	O
,	O
I	O
asked	O
him	O
what	O
he	O
inferred	O
from	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
wealth	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
not	O
being	O
discovered	O
?	O

He	O
answered	O
,	O
It	O
was	O
evident	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
people	O
that	O
the	O
wealth	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
lay	O
hid	O
;	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
infinitely	O
more	O
lay	O
uninquired	O
after	O
than	O
had	O
yet	O
been	O
known	O
;	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
several	O
mountains	O
in	O
Peru	PNM
equally	O
rich	O
in	O
silver	O
with	O
that	O
of	O
Potosi	PNM
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
for	O
Chili	PNM
,	O
says	O
he	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
country	O
where	O
we	O
live	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
more	O
gold	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
in	O
the	O
mountains	O
of	O
the	O
Andes	O
,	O
and	O
more	O
easy	O
to	O
come	O
at	O
,	O
than	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
world	O
besides	O
.	O

Nay	O
,	O
says	O
he	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
passion	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
more	O
gold	O
every	O
year	O
washed	O
down	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
Andes	O
of	O
Chili	PNM
into	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
lost	O
there	O
,	O
than	O
all	O
the	O
riches	O
that	O
go	O
from	O
New	PNM
Spain	PNM
to	O
Europe	PNM
in	O
twenty	O
years	O
amount	O
to	O
.	O

This	O
discourse	O
fired	O
my	O
imagination	O
you	O
may	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
renewed	O
it	O
upon	O
all	O
occasions	O
,	O
taking	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
time	O
every	O
day	O
to	O
talk	O
with	O
this	O
Spaniard	O
upon	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
cultivation	O
of	O
the	O
lands	O
,	O
improvement	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
like	O
;	O
always	O
making	O
such	O
inquiries	O
into	O
the	O
state	O
of	O
the	O
mountains	O
of	O
the	O
Andes	O
as	O
best	O
suited	O
my	O
purpose	O
,	O
but	O
yet	O
so	O
as	O
not	O
to	O
give	O
him	O
the	O
least	O
intimation	O
of	O
my	O
design	O
.	O

One	O
day	O
,	O
conversing	O
with	O
him	O
again	O
about	O
the	O
great	O
riches	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
mountains	O
and	O
rivers	O
,	O
as	O
above	O
,	O
I	O
asked	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
seeing	O
the	O
place	O
was	O
so	O
rich	O
,	O
why	O
were	O
they	O
not	O
all	O
princes	O
,	O
or	O
as	O
rich	O
as	O
princes	O
,	O
who	O
dwelt	O
there	O
?	O

He	O
shook	O
his	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
reproach	O
upon	O
them	O
many	O
ways	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
pressed	O
him	O
to	O
explain	O
himself	O
,	O
he	O
answered	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
occasioned	O
by	O
two	O
things	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
pride	O
and	O
sloth	O
.	O

Seignior	O
,	O
says	O
he	O
,	O
we	O
have	O
so	O
much	O
pride	O
that	O
we	O
have	O
no	O
avarice	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
do	O
not	O
covet	O
enough	O
to	O
make	O
us	O
work	O
for	O
it	O
.	O

We	O
walk	O
about	O
sometimes	O
,	O
says	O
he	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
banks	O
of	O
the	O
streams	O
that	O
come	O
down	O
from	O
the	O
mountains	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
see	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
gold	O
lie	O
on	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
we	O
will	O
vouchsafe	O
to	O
lay	O
off	O
our	O
cloak	O
,	O
and	O
step	O
forward	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
up	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
sure	O
to	O
carry	O
home	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
stand	O
under	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
not	O
strip	O
and	O
go	O
to	O
work	O
in	O
the	O
water	O
to	O
wash	O
it	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
sand	O
,	O
or	O
take	O
the	O
pains	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
together	O
;	O
nor	O
perhaps	O
dishonour	O
ourselves	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
to	O
be	O

carrying	O
a	O

no	O
,	O
not	O
for	O
all	O
the	O

I	O
laughed	O
then	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
he	O
was	O
disposed	O
to	O
jest	O
with	O
his	O

,	O
or	O
to	O
speak	O

pains	O
as	O
was	O
required	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
effectually	O
rich	O

but	O
that	O
I	O
supposed	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
me	O
understand	O
him	O
as	O
he	O
spoke	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
I	O
might	O
understand	O
as	O
favourably	O
as	O
I	O
pleased	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
should	O
find	O
the	O
fact	O
to	O
be	O
true	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
up	O
with	O
him	O
to	O
Villa	PNM
Rica	PNM
,	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
Baldivia	PNM
;	O
and	O
,	O
with	O
that	O
,	O
he	O
made	O
his	O
compliment	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
invited	O
me	O
to	O
his	O
house	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
with	O
a	O
_	O
con	O
licentia	O
_	O
,	O
seignior	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
with	O
pardon	O
for	O
so	O
much	O
freedom	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
lived	O
in	O
so	O
rich	O
a	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
there	O
was	O
so	O
inexhaustible	O
a	O
treasure	O
of	O
gold	O
,	O
how	O
came	O
he	O
to	O
fall	O
into	O
this	O
state	O
of	O
captivity	O
?	O

and	O
what	O
made	O
him	O
venture	O
himself	O
upon	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
to	O
fall	O
into	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
pirates	O
?	O

He	O
answered	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
very	O
foot	O
of	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
complaining	O
of	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
having	O
seen	O
so	O
much	O
of	O
the	O
wealth	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
he	O
lived	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
reproached	O
himself	O
with	O
that	O
very	O
indolence	O
which	O
he	O
now	O
blamed	O
all	O
his	O
countrymen	O
for	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
resolved	O
in	O
conjunction	O
with	O
two	O
of	O
his	O
neighbours	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
and	O
men	O
of	O
good	O
substance	O
,	O
to	O
set	O
to	O
work	O
in	O
a	O
place	O
in	O
the	O
mountains	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
found	O
some	O
gold	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
seen	O
much	O
washed	O
down	O
by	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
find	O
what	O
might	O
be	O
done	O
in	O
a	O
thorough	O
search	O
after	O
the	O
fund	O
or	O
mine	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
sure	O
was	O
not	O
far	O
off	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
Lima	PNM
,	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
supplied	O
,	O
to	O
Panama	PNM

to	O
buy	O

work	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
carry	O
it	O
on	O
with	O
the	O

success	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
feeling	O
discourse	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
such	O
an	O
impression	O
on	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
secretly	O
resolved	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
Baldivia	PNM
,	O
I	O
would	O
go	O
up	O
with	O
this	O
sincere	O
Spaniard	O
,	O
for	O
so	O
I	O
thought	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
I	O
found	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
be	O
an	O
eyewitness	O
to	O
the	O
discovery	O
which	O
I	O
thought	O
was	O
made	O
to	O
my	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
I	O
found	O
now	O
I	O
could	O
make	O
more	O
effectual	O
than	O
by	O
all	O
the	O
attempts	O
I	O
was	O
like	O
to	O
make	O
by	O
secondhand	O
.	O

From	O
this	O
time	O
I	O
treated	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
with	O
more	O
than	O
ordinary	O
courtesy	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
captain	O
of	O
a	O
great	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
cargo	O
upon	O
me	O
of	O
other	O
gentleman	O
's	O
estates	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
said	O
so	O
much	O
of	O
those	O
things	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
tempted	O
to	O
give	O
him	O
a	O
visit	O
as	O
he	O
desired	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
those	O
wonderful	O
mountains	O
of	O
the	O
Andes	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
do	O
him	O
so	O
much	O
honour	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
obliged	O
to	O
any	O
long	O
stay	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
procure	O
mules	O
for	O
me	O
at	O
Baldivia	PNM
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
go	O
not	O
to	O
his	O
house	O
only	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
the	O
mountain	O
itself	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
all	O
that	O
I	O
desired	O
,	O
and	O
be	O
back	O
again	O
in	O
fourteen	O
days	O
at	O
the	O
farthest	O
.	O

I	O
shook	O
my	O
head	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
never	O
left	O
importuning	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
once	O
or	O
twice	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
afraid	O
to	O
venture	O
myself	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
would	O
send	O
for	O
his	O
two	O
sons	O
,	O
and	O
leave	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
as	O
hostages	O
for	O
my	O
safety	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
fully	O
satisfied	O
as	O
to	O
that	O
point	O
,	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
let	O
him	O
know	O
my	O
mind	O
yet	O
;	O
but	O
every	O
day	O
we	O
dwelt	O
upon	O
the	O
same	O
subject	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
travelled	O
through	O
the	O
mountains	O
and	O
valleys	O
so	O
duly	O
in	O
every	O
day	O
's	O
discourse	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
afterwards	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
places	O
we	O
had	O
talked	O
of	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
as	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
looked	O
over	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
map	O
before	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
if	O
the	O
Andes	O
were	O
a	O
mere	O
wall	O
of	O
mountains	O
,	O
contiguous	O
and	O
without	O
intervals	O
and	O
spaces	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
fortification	O
,	O
or	O
boundary	O
to	O
a	O
country	O
?	O

or	O
whether	O
they	O
lay	O
promiscuous	O
,	O
and	O
distant	O
from	O
one	O
another	O
?	O

and	O
whether	O
there	O
lay	O
any	O
way	O
over	O
them	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
beyond	O
?	O

He	O
smiled	O
when	O
I	O
talked	O
of	O
going	O
over	O
them	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
infinitely	O
high	O
,	O
that	O
no	O
human	O
creature	O
could	O
live	O
upon	O
the	O
top	O
;	O
and	O
withal	O
so	O
steep	O
and	O
so	O
frightful	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
there	O
was	O
even	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
stairs	O
up	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
down	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
no	O
man	O
would	O
dare	O
to	O
mount	O
up	O
,	O
or	O
venture	O
down	O
.	O

But	O
that	O
as	O
for	O
the	O
notion	O
of	O
the	O
hills	O
being	O
contiguous	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
wall	O
that	O
had	O
no	O
gates	O
,	O
that	O
was	O
all	O
fabulous	O
;	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
several	O
fair	O
entrances	O
in	O
among	O
the	O
mountains	O
,	O
and	O
large	O
pleasant	O
and	O
fruitful	O
valleys	O
among	O
the	O
hills	O
,	O
with	O
pleasant	O
rivers	O
,	O
and	O
numbers	O
of	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
and	O
cattle	O
and	O
provisions	O
of	O
all	O
sorts	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
delightful	O
places	O
to	O
live	O
in	O
that	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
whole	O
world	O
were	O
among	O
the	O
valleys	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
very	O
centre	O
of	O
the	O
highest	O
and	O
most	O
dreadful	O
mountains	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
said	O
I	O
,	O
seignior	O
,	O
but	O
how	O
do	O
they	O
go	O
out	O
of	O
one	O
valley	O
into	O
another	O
?	O

and	O
whither	O
do	O
they	O
go	O
at	O
last	O
?	O

He	O
answered	O
me	O
,	O
those	O
valleys	O
are	O
always	O
full	O
of	O
pleasant	O
rivers	O
and	O
brooks	O
,	O
which	O
fall	O
from	O
the	O
hills	O
,	O
and	O
are	O
formed	O
generally	O
into	O
one	O
principal	O
stream	O
to	O
every	O
vale	O
:	O
and	O
that	O
as	O
these	O
must	O
have	O
their	O
outlets	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
hills	O
or	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
so	O
,	O
following	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
those	O
streams	O
,	O
one	O
is	O
always	O
sure	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
way	O
out	O
of	O
one	O
valley	O
into	O
another	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
into	O
the	O
open	O
country	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
frequent	O
to	O
pass	O
from	O
one	O
side	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
body	O
of	O
the	O
mountains	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
go	O
much	O
higher	O
up	O
hill	O
or	O
down	O
hill	O
,	O
compared	O
to	O
the	O
hills	O
in	O
other	O
places	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
true	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
abrupt	O
visible	O
parting	O
in	O
the	O
mountains	O
,	O
that	O
should	O
seem	O
like	O
a	O
way	O
cut	O
through	O
from	O
the	O
bottom	O
to	O
the	O
top	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
be	O
indeed	O
frightful	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
as	O
they	O
pass	O
from	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
valleys	O
to	O
others	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
ascents	O
and	O
descents	O
,	O
windings	O
and	O
turnings	O
,	O
sloping	O
up	O
and	O
sloping	O
down	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
may	O
stand	O
on	O
those	O
little	O
ridges	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
the	O
waters	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
run	O
to	O
the	O
west	O
,	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
to	O
the	O
east	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
country	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
?	O

and	O
how	O
long	O
time	O
it	O
would	O
take	O
up	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
from	O
one	O
side	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
?	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
there	O
were	O
ways	O
indeed	O
that	O
were	O
more	O
mountainous	O
and	O
uneasy	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
men	O
kept	O
upon	O
the	O
sides	O
or	O
declivity	O
of	O
the	O
hills	O
;	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
natives	O
would	O
go	O
,	O
and	O
guide	O
others	O
to	O
go	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
might	O
pass	O
the	O
whole	O
ridge	O
of	O
the	O
Andes	O
in	O
eight	O
or	O
nine	O
days	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
those	O
ways	O
were	O
esteemed	O
very	O
dismal	O
,	O
lonely	O
,	O
and	O
dangerous	O
,	O
because	O
of	O
wild	O
beasts	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
through	O
the	O
valleys	O
,	O
the	O
way	O
was	O
easy	O
and	O
pleasant	O
,	O
and	O
perfectly	O
safe	O
,	O
only	O
farther	O
about	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
those	O
ways	O
a	O
man	O
might	O
be	O
sixteen	O
or	O
seventeen	O
days	O
going	O
through	O
.	O

I	O
laid	O
up	O
all	O
this	O
in	O
my	O
heart	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
use	O
of	O
as	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
occasion	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
acknowledged	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
surprising	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
perfectly	O
agreeing	O
with	O
the	O
notion	O
that	O
I	O
always	O
entertained	O
of	O
those	O
mountains	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
riches	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
the	O
facility	O
of	O
access	O
to	O
and	O
from	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
easy	O
passage	O
from	O
one	O
side	O
to	O
another	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
discourse	O
I	O
had	O
with	O
him	O
upon	O
this	O
subject	O
I	O
began	O
thus	O
:	O
Well	O
,	O
seignior	O
,	O
said	O
I	O
,	O
we	O
are	O
now	O
come	O
quite	O
through	O
the	O
valleys	O
and	O
passages	O
of	O
the	O
Andes	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
methinks	O
I	O
see	O
a	O
vast	O
open	O
country	O
before	O
me	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
;	O
pray	O
tell	O
me	O
,	O
have	O
you	O
ever	O
been	O
so	O
far	O
as	O
to	O
look	O
into	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
country	O
it	O
is	O
?	O

He	O
answered	O
gravely	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
far	O
enough	O
several	O
times	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
into	O
the	O
vast	O
country	O
I	O
spoke	O
of	O
;	O
And	O
such	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
,	O
said	O
he	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
come	O
upon	O
the	O
rising	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
hills	O
we	O
see	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
country	O
without	O
end	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
any	O
descriptions	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
but	O
little	O
,	O
added	O
he	O
,	O
only	O
this	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
fruitful	O
country	O
on	O
that	O
side	O
next	O
the	O
hills	O
;	O
what	O
it	O
is	O
farther	O
,	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
if	O
there	O
were	O
any	O
considerable	O
rivers	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
way	O
they	O
generally	O
run	O
?	O

He	O
said	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
but	O
that	O
from	O
such	O
a	O
ridge	O
of	O
mountains	O
as	O
the	O
Andes	O
there	O
must	O
be	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
rivers	O
on	O
that	O
side	O
,	O
as	O
there	O
were	O
apparently	O
on	O
this	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
country	O
was	O
infinitely	O
larger	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
course	O
,	O
in	O
proportion	O
,	O

necessarily	O
follow	O
that	O
those	O

rivers	O
would	O
run	O
one	O
into	O
another	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
form	O
great	O
navigable	O
rivers	O
,	O
as	O
was	O
the	O
case	O
in	O
the	O
Rio	PNM

Plata	PNM

which	O
originally	O
sprung	O
from	O
the	O

hills	O

about	O
the	O
city	O
La	PNM
Plata	PNM

in	O

and	O
swallowing	O
up	O
all	O
the	O

by	O

of	O
its	O
course	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
greatest	O
rivers	O
in	O
the	O
world	O

That	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
observed	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
those	O
rivers	O
ran	O
rather	O
south-eastward	O
than	O
northward	O

he	O
believed	O
they	O
ran	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
sea	O

a	O
great	O
way	O
farther	O

the	O

as	O
to	O

in	O

that	O
he	O

nothing	O

This	O

was	O
so	O

that	O
nothing	O
could	O
be	O
more	O

and	O
was	O

indeed	O

extremely	O
satisfactory	O

It	O
was	O
also	O
very	O
remarkable	O
that	O
this	O
agreed	O
exactly	O
with	O
the	O
accounts	O
before	O
given	O
me	O
by	O
the	O
two	O
Chilian	O
Indians	O

which	O
I	O
had	O
on	O

with	O
whom	O
I	O
still	O
continued	O
to	O
discourse	O

as	O
occasion	O
presented	O

but	O
whom	O
,	O
at	O
this	O

I	O
removed	O
into	O
the	O
Madagascar	O
ship	O

to	O
make-room	O
for	O
these	O
Spanish	O
prisoners	O

I	O
observed	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
was	O
made	O
very	O
sensible	O
,	O
by	O
my	O
doctor	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
obligation	O
both	O
he	O
and	O
his	O
fellow-prisoners	O
were	O
under	O
to	O
me	O

in	O
my	O
persuading	O
the	O
privateers	O
to	O
set	O
them	O
at	O

in	O
undertaking	O

from	O

The	O
sense	O
of	O
the	O
favour	O

I	O
say	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
still	O
doing	O
him	O

in	O
the	O
civil	O

for	O
that	O
I	O

nothing	O

I	O

it	O
made	O
him	O
exceedingly	O
importunate	O
with	O

with	O
my	O

who	O
spoke	O

perfectly	O
well	O

to	O

I	O
made	O
him	O
no	O
promise	O

but	O
talked	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
lived	O
by	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
sailed	O
to	O
his	O
door	O
in	O
my	O
ship	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
made	O
him	O
a	O
visit	O

He	O
returned	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
wished	O
he	O
could	O
make	O
the	O
river	O
of	O
Baldivia	PNM
navigable	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
bring	O
my	O
ship	O
up	O
to	O
his	O
door	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
venture	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
that	O
neither	O
I	O
,	O
nor	O
any	O
of	O
my	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O

should	O
starve	O

we	O
were	O
with	O
him	O

In	O
the	O
interval	O
of	O
these	O
discourses	O
,	O
I	O
asked	O
my	O
doctor	O
his	O
opinion	O
,	O
whether	O
he	O
thought	O
I	O
might	O
trust	O
this	O
Spaniard	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
mind	O
to	O
go	O
up	O
and	O
see	O
the	O
country	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
?	O

Seignior	O
,	O
says	O
he	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
are	O
,	O
in	O
some	O
respects	O
,	O
the	O
worst	O
nation	O
under	O
the	O
sun	O
;	O
they	O
are	O
cruel	O
,	O
inexorable	O
,	O
uncharitable	O
,	O
voracious	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
several	O
cases	O
,	O
treacherous	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
in	O
two	O
things	O
,	O
they	O
are	O
to	O
be	O
depended	O
upon	O
beyond	O
all	O
the	O
nations	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
;	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
give	O
their	O
honour	O
,	O
to	O
perform	O
anything	O

and	O
when	O
they	O
have	O
a	O

for	O
any	O
favour	O
received	O
.	O

And	O
here	O
he	O
entertained	O
me	O
with	O
a	O
long	O
story	O
of	O
a	O
merchant	O
of	O
Carthagena	PNM
,	O
who	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
sloop	O
,	O
was	O
shipwrecked	O
at	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
taken	O
up	O
by	O
an	O
English	O
merchant	O
on	O
board	O
a	O
ship	O
bound	O
to	O
London	PNM
from	O
Barbadoes	PNM
,	O
or	O
some	O
other	O
of	O
our	O
islands	O
;	O
that	O
the	O
English	O
merchant	O
,	O
meeting	O
another	O
English	O
ship	O
bound	O
to	O
Jamaica	PNM
,	O
put	O
the	O
Spanish	O
merchant	O
on	O
board	O
him	O
,	O
paid	O
him	O
for	O
his	O
passage	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
him	O
to	O
set	O
him	O
on	O
shore	O
on	O
the	O
Spanish	O
coast	O
,	O
as	O
near	O
to	O
Carthagena	PNM
as	O
he	O
could	O
.	O

This	O
Spanish	O
merchant	O
could	O
never	O
rest	O
till	O
he	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
ship	O
himself	O
from	O
Carthagena	PNM
to	O
the	O
Havannah	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
galleons	O
;	O
from	O
thence	O
to	O
Cadiz	PNM
in	O
Old	PNM
Spain	PNM
;	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
to	O
London	PNM
,	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
the	O
English	O
merchant	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
him	O
a	O
present	O
to	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
a	O
thousand	O
pistoles	O
for	O
saving	O
his	O
life	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
his	O
civility	O
in	O
returning	O
him	O
to	O
Jamaica	PNM
,	O
&	O
c.	O
Whether	O
the	O
story	O
was	O
true	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
his	O
inference	O
from	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
that	O
a	O
Spaniard	O
never	O
forgot	O
a	O
kindness	O
.	O

But	O
take	O
it	O
withal	O
,	O
says	O
the	O
doctor	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
believe	O
it	O
is	O
as	O
much	O
the	O
effect	O
of	O
their	O
pride	O
as	O
of	O
their	O
virtue	O
;	O
for	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
said	O
he	O
,	O
they	O
never	O
forget	O
an	O
ill	O
turn	O
any	O
more	O
than	O
they	O
do	O
a	O
good	O
one	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
frequently	O
entail	O
their	O
enmities	O
on	O
their	O
families	O
,	O
and	O
prosecute	O
the	O
revenge	O
from	O
one	O
generation	O
to	O
another	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
heir	O
has	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
estate	O
of	O
his	O
ancestors	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
family	O
broils	O
upon	O
his	O
hands	O
as	O
he	O
comes	O
to	O
his	O
estate	O
.	O

From	O
all	O
this	O
he	O
inferred	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
this	O
Spaniard	O
found	O
himself	O
so	O
very	O
much	O
obliged	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
might	O
depend	O
upon	O
it	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
so	O
much	O
pride	O
in	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
could	O
pull	O
down	O
the	O
Andes	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
wanted	O
it	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
do	O
it	O
for	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
nothing	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
greater	O
satisfaction	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
than	O
to	O
find	O
some	O
way	O
or	O
other	O
how	O
to	O
requite	O
me	O
.	O

All	O
these	O
discourses	O
shortened	O
our	O
voyage	O

and	O
we	O
arrived	O
fair	O
and	O
softly	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
it	O

very	O
good	O

And	O
here	O
I	O
took	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
unaccountable	O

and	O
I	O
must	O

acknowledge	O

resolutions	O

that	O
ever	O

by	O
no	O

any	O

Such	O
was	O
the	O
unsatisfied	O
thirst	O
of	O
new	O
discoveries	O
which	O
I	O
brought	O
out	O
of	O

However	O

for	O
the	O
rashness	O
of	O

myself	O
so	O

as	O
to	O

it	O

that	O
I	O

And	O
first	O

I	O
found	O
out	O
a	O
safe	O

for	O

to	O

and	O
this	O
neither	O

in	O

Here	O
the	O

about	O

and	O
about	O
half	O
a	O

I	O
left	O

I	O

an	O

And	O
I	O
made	O
all	O

me	O
that	O
they	O
would	O

When	O

I	O
were	O
on	O
board	O
.	O

This	O
encouraged	O
me	O
greatly	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
now	O
resolved	O
nothing	O
should	O
hinder	O
me	O
.	O

Having	O
thus	O
concluded	O
everything	O
,	O
then	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
till	O
then	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
my	O
Spaniard	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
almost	O
resolved	O
to	O
go	O
along	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
at	O
which	O
he	O
appeared	O
exceedingly	O
pleased	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
surprise	O
of	O
joy	O
.	O

I	O
should	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
before	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
set	O
all	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
prisoners	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
at	O
their	O
own	O
request	O
,	O
just	O
between	O
the	O
port	O
of	O
Tucapel	PNM
and	O
the	O
bay	O
of	O
the	O
Conception	O
,	O
excepting	O
two	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
lived	O
in	O
the	O
open	O
country	O
beyond	O
Baldivia	PNM
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
observed	O
,	O
were	O
very	O
glad	O
to	O
be	O
set	O
on	O
shore	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
so	O
to	O
travel	O
home	O
,	O
having	O
lost	O
what	O
little	O
they	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
whom	O
he	O
communicated	O
nothing	O
of	O
the	O
discourse	O
we	O
had	O
so	O
frequently	O
held	O
,	O
concerning	O
the	O
affair	O
of	O
the	O
mountains	O
.	O

I	O
also	O
dismissed	O
now	O
the	O
two	O
Chilian	O
Indians	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
without	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
reward	O
,	O
not	O
proportioned	O
to	O
their	O
trouble	O
and	O
time	O
only	O
,	O
but	O
proportioned	O
to	O
what	O
I	O
seemed	O
to	O
expect	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
filled	O
them	O
still	O
with	O
expectations	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
come	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
take	O
a	O
journey	O
with	O
them	O
into	O
the	O
mountains	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
it	O
became	O
necessary	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
,	O
use	O
the	O
utmost	O
freedom	O
with	O
my	O
new	O
friend	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
,	O
being	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
to	O
put	O
my	O
life	O
in	O
his	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
prosperity	O
of	O
my	O
whole	O
adventure	O
,	O
both	O
ship	O
and	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
was	O
sensible	O
that	O
I	O
did	O
put	O
my	O
life	O
into	O
his	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
token	O
of	O
my	O
confidence	O
in	O
him	O
,	O
even	O
such	O
a	O
one	O
that	O
he	O
,	O
being	O
a	O
stranger	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
had	O
no	O
reason	O
to	O
expect	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
desired	O
me	O
to	O
consider	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
Christian	O
,	O
not	O
a	O
savage	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
one	O
I	O
had	O
laid	O
the	O
highest	O
obligation	O
upon	O
,	O
in	O
voluntarily	O
taking	O
him	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
the	O
freebooters	O
,	O
where	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
lost	O
his	O
life	O
.	O

And	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
place	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
some	O
recommendation	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
gentleman	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
find	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
honour	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
lastly	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
appear	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
make	O
any	O
advantage	O
of	O
me	O
,	O
or	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
get	O
anything	O
by	O
using	O
me	O
ill	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
even	O
that	O
was	O
no	O
argument	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
should	O
find	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
his	O
house	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
in	O
a	O
condition	O
to	O
want	O
anything	O
that	O
might	O
be	O
gained	O
,	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
to	O
procure	O
it	O
by	O
such	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
villany	O
and	O
treachery	O
as	O
to	O
betray	O
and	O
destroy	O
the	O
man	O
who	O
had	O
saved	O
his	O
life	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
him	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
the	O
devil	O
safe	O
to	O
his	O
country	O
and	O
family	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
carried	O
away	O
God	O
knows	O
whither	O
.	O

But	O
to	O
conclude	O
all	O
,	O
he	O
desired	O
me	O
to	O
accept	O
the	O
offer	O
he	O
had	O
made	O
me	O
at	O
sea	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
send	O
for	O
his	O
two	O
sons	O
,	O
and	O
leave	O
them	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O
as	O
hostages	O
for	O
my	O
safety	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
used	O
on	O
board	O
no	O
otherwise	O
than	O
I	O
was	O
used	O
with	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
ashamed	O
to	O
accept	O
such	O
an	O
offer	O
as	O
this	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
pressed	O
it	O
earnestly	O
,	O
and	O
importuned	O
the	O
doctor	O
to	O
move	O
me	O
to	O
accept	O
it	O
,	O
telling	O
him	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
easy	O
if	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
the	O
doctor	O
advised	O
me	O
to	O
agree	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
accordingly	O
,	O
he	O
hired	O
a	O
messenger	O
and	O
a	O
mule	O
,	O
and	O
sent	O
away	O
for	O
his	O
two	O
sons	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
such	O
expedition	O
the	O
messenger	O
made	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
six	O
days	O
he	O
returned	O
with	O
the	O
two	O
sons	O
and	O
three	O
servants	O
,	O
all	O
on	O
horseback	O
.	O

His	O
two	O
sons	O
were	O
very	O
pretty	O
,	O
well-behaved	O
youths	O
,	O
who	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
gentlemen	O
in	O
their	O
very	O
countenances	O
;	O
the	O
eldest	O
was	O
about	O
thirteen	O
years	O
old	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
about	O
eleven	O
.	O

I	O
treated	O
them	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
their	O
father	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
possible	O
respect	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
entertained	O
them	O
two	O
days	O
,	O
left	O
orders	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
treated	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
manner	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
gone	O
;	O
and	O
to	O
this	O
I	O
added	O
aloud	O
,	O
that	O
their	O
father	O
might	O
hear	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
whenever	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
mind	O
to	O
go	O
away	O
,	O
they	O
should	O
let	O
them	O
go	O
.	O

But	O
their	O
father	O
laid	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
solemn	O
charges	O
upon	O
them	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
not	O
stir	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
till	O
I	O
came	O
back	O
safe	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
gave	O
them	O
leave	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
made	O
them	O
promise	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
young	O
gentlemen	O
kept	O
their	O
word	O
so	O
punctually	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
when	O
our	O
supercargo	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
left	O
in	O
command	O
,	O
offered	O
to	O
let	O
them	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
several	O
times	O
,	O
to	O
divert	O
them	O
with	O
shooting	O
and	O
hunting	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
stir	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
till	O
I	O
came	O
back	O
again	O
.	O

Having	O
gone	O
this	O
length	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
everything	O
ready	O
for	O
my	O
adventure	O
,	O
we	O
set	O
out	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
,	O
the	O
Spanish	O
doctor	O
,	O
the	O
old	O
mutineer	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
my	O
second	O
mate	O
,	O
but	O
who	O
was	O
now	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
Madagascar	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
myself	O
,	O
with	O
two	O
midshipmen	O
,	O
whom	O
he	O
took	O
as	O
servants	O
,	O
but	O
whom	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
directors	O
of	O
the	O
main	O
enterprise	O
.	O

As	O
to	O
the	O
number	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
my	O
Spaniard	O
made	O
no	O
scruple	O
of	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
half	O
my	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O
.	O

We	O
set	O
out	O
,	O
some	O
on	O
horses	O
and	O
some	O
on	O
mules	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
get	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
and	O
myself	O
rode	O
on	O
two	O
very	O
good	O
horses	O
,	O
being	O
the	O
same	O
that	O
his	O
two	O
sons	O
came	O
on	O
.	O

We	O
arrived	O
at	O
a	O
noble	O
country-seat	O
,	O
about	O
a	O
league	O
short	O
of	O
the	O
town	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
only	O
to	O
put	O
in	O
for	O
refreshment	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
soon	O
found	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
really	O
his	O
dwelling-house	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
his	O
family	O
and	O
servants	O
resided	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
were	O
received	O
like	O
princes	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
as	O
much	O
ceremony	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
prince	O
that	O
entertained	O
us	O
.	O

The	O
major-domo	O
,	O
or	O
steward	O
of	O
his	O
house	O
,	O
received	O
us	O
,	O
took	O
in	O
our	O
baggage	O
,	O
and	O
ordered	O
our	O
servants	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
care	O
of	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
sufficient	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
did	O
all	O
that	O
pride	O
and	O
ostentation	O
was	O
capable	O
of	O
inspiring	O
him	O
with	O
,	O
to	O
entertain	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
truth	O
is	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
lived	O
in	O
a	O
country	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
more	O
capable	O
of	O
gratifying	O
his	O
pride	O
;	O
for	O
here	O
,	O
without	O
anything	O
uncommon	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
show	O
more	O
gold	O
plate	O
than	O
many	O
good	O
families	O
in	O
our	O
country	O
have	O
of	O
silver	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
for	O
silver	O
,	O
it	O
quite	O
eclipsed	O
the	O
appearance	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
took	O
away	O
the	O
very	O
use	O
of	O
pewter	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
see	O
one	O
vessel	O
,	O
no	O
not	O
in	O
the	O
meanest	O
part	O
of	O
his	O
house	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
true	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
had	O
not	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
plate	O
,	O
or	O
of	O
any	O
household	O
furniture	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
see	O
,	O
except	O
what	O
belonged	O
to	O
the	O
apartment	O
of	O
his	O
wife	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
observed	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
women	O
never	O
appeared	O
,	O
except	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
gardens	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
being	O
under	O
veils	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
know	O
the	O
lady	O
from	O
her	O
women	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
maids	O
from	O
the	O
mistress	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
lodged	O
every	O
one	O
in	O
separate	O
apartments	O
,	O
very	O
well	O
furnished	O
,	O
but	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
very	O
nobly	O
indeed	O
,	O
though	O
all	O
the	O
materials	O
for	O
furniture	O
there	O
must	O
be	O
at	O
an	O
excessive	O
price	O
.	O

The	O
way	O
of	O
lodging	O
upon	O
quilts	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
beds	O
made	O
pavilion-wise	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
Spanish	O
custom	O
,	O
I	O
need	O
not	O
describe	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
surprised	O
me	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
rooms	O
hung	O
with	O
very	O
rich	O
tapestries	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
where	O
they	O
must	O
cost	O
so	O
dear	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
Chilian	O
wine	O
served	O
us	O
up	O
in	O
round	O
gold	O
cups	O
,	O
and	O
water	O
in	O
large	O
silver	O
decanters	O
,	O
that	O
held	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
,	O
five	O
quarts	O
apiece	O
;	O
these	O
stood	O
in	O
our	O
chamber	O
.	O

Our	O
chocolate	O
was	O
brought	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
manner	O
,	O
in	O
deep	O
cups	O
,	O
all	O
of	O
gold	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
made	O
in	O
vessels	O
all	O
of	O
silver	O
.	O

It	O
would	O
be	O
tiresome	O
to	O
the	O
reader	O
to	O
particularise	O
my	O
account	O
with	O
the	O
relation	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
fine	O
things	O
our	O
host	O
had	O
in	O
his	O
house	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
persuaded	O
but	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
borrowed	O
all	O
the	O
plate	O
in	O
the	O
town	O
to	O
furnish	O
out	O
his	O
sideboard	O
and	O
table	O
.	O

But	O
my	O
doctor	O
told	O
me	O
it	O
was	O
nothing	O
but	O
what	O
was	O
very	O
usual	O
among	O
them	O
that	O
were	O
men	O
of	O
any	O
substance	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
apparent	O
he	O
was	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
silversmiths	O
at	O
St.	PNM
Jago	PNM
supplied	O
them	O
generally	O
with	O
their	O
plate	O
ready	O
wrought	O
,	O
in	O
exchange	O
-LRB-	O
with	O
allowance	O
for	O
the	O
quality	O
-RRB-	O
for	O
the	O
gold	O
which	O
they	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
mountains	O
,	O
or	O
in	O
the	O
brooks	O
and	O
streams	O
which	O
came	O
from	O
the	O
mountains	O
,	O
into	O
which	O
the	O
hasty	O
showers	O
of	O
winter	O
rain	O
frequently	O
washed	O
down	O
pretty	O
large	O
lumps	O
,	O
and	O
others	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
smaller	O
,	O
they	O
washed	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
sands	O
by	O
the	O
ordinary	O
methods	O
of	O
washing	O
of	O
ore	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
better	O
satisfied	O
in	O
this	O
particular	O
when	O
,	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
talking	O
to	O
our	O
new	O
landlord	O
about	O
the	O
mountains	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
wealth	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
asked	O
him	O
if	O
he	O
could	O
show	O
me	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
gold	O
which	O
was	O
usually	O
washed	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
hills	O
by	O
the	O
rain	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
natural	O
figure	O
in	O
which	O
it	O
was	O
found	O
?	O

He	O
smiled	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
could	O
show	O
me	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
conducted	O
us	O
into	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
closet	O
,	O
where	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
variety	O
of	O
odd	O
things	O
gathered	O
up	O
about	O
the	O
mountains	O
and	O
rivers	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
fine	O
shells	O
,	O
stones	O
in	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
stars	O
,	O
heavy	O
pieces	O
of	O
ore	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
like	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
after	O
this	O
,	O
he	O
pulled	O
out	O
a	O
great	O
leather	O
bag	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
,	O
near	O
fifty	O
pounds	O
weight	O
in	O
it	O
.	O

Here	O
,	O
seignior	O
,	O
says	O
he	O
,	O
here	O
is	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
dirt	O
of	O
the	O
earth	O
;	O
and	O
turning	O
it	O
out	O
upon	O
the	O
table	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
easy	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
all	O
mixed	O
with	O
gold	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
pieces	O
were	O
of	O
different	O
forms	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
scarce	O
looking	O
like	O
gold	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
being	O
so	O
mixed	O
with	O
the	O
spar	O
or	O
with	O
earth	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
appear	O
so	O
plain	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
in	O
every	O
bit	O
there	O
was	O
something	O
of	O
the	O
clear	O
gold	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
the	O
smaller	O
the	O
lumps	O
,	O
the	O
purer	O
the	O
gold	O
appeared	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
surprised	O
at	O
the	O
quantity	O
,	O
more	O
than	O
at	O
the	O
quality	O
of	O
the	O
metal	O
,	O
having	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
seen	O
the	O
gold	O
which	O
the	O
Indians	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
countries	O
I	O
have	O
described	O
,	O
which	O
seemed	O
to	O
have	O
little	O
or	O
no	O
mixture	O
.	O

But	O
then	O
I	O
was	O
to	O
have	O
considered	O
,	O
that	O
what	O
those	O
Indians	O
gathered	O
was	O
farther	O
from	O
the	O
hills	O
which	O
it	O
came	O
from	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
those	O
rough	O
,	O
irregular	O
pieces	O
would	O
not	O
drive	O
so	O
far	O
in	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
but	O
would	O
lodge	O
themselves	O
in	O
the	O
earth	O
and	O
sand	O
of	O
the	O
rivers	O
nearer	O
home	O
;	O
and	O
also	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
not	O
knowing	O
how	O
to	O
separate	O
the	O
gold	O
by	O
fire	O
from	O
the	O
dross	O
and	O
mixture	O
above	O
,	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
those	O
rough	O
pieces	O
worth	O
their	O
taking	O
up	O
,	O
whereas	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
here	O
understood	O
much	O
better	O
what	O
they	O
were	O
about	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
the	O
closet	O
.	O

When	O
he	O
had	O
shown	O
us	O
this	O
leather	O
pouch	O
of	O
gold	O
,	O
he	O
swept	O
the	O
ore	O
to	O
one	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
table	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
ledges	O
round	O
it	O
to	O
keep	O
it	O
from	O
running	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
up	O
another	O
bag	O
full	O
of	O
large	O
pieces	O
of	O
stone	O
,	O
great	O
lumps	O
of	O
earth	O
,	O
and	O
pieces	O
of	O
various	O
shapes	O
,	O
all	O
of	O
which	O
had	O
some	O
gold	O
in	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
gotten	O
out	O
but	O
by	O
fire	O
.	O

These	O
,	O
he	O
told	O
us	O
,	O
their	O
servants	O
bring	O
home	O
as	O
they	O
find	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
mountains	O
,	O
lying	O
loose	O
here	O
and	O
there	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
go	O
after	O
their	O
cattle	O
.	O

But	O
still	O
,	O
I	O
asked	O
him	O
if	O
they	O
found	O
no	O
pieces	O
of	O
pure	O
gold	O
;	O
upon	O
this	O
he	O
turned	O
to	O
a	O
great	O
old	O
cabinet	O
,	O
full	O
of	O
pretty	O
large	O
drawers	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
pulling	O
out	O
one	O
drawer	O
,	O
he	O
showed	O
us	O
a	O
surprising	O
number	O
of	O
pieces	O
of	O
pure	O
clean	O
gold	O
,	O
some	O
round	O
,	O
some	O
long	O
,	O
some	O
flat	O
,	O
some	O
thick	O
,	O
all	O
of	O
irregular	O
shapes	O
,	O
and	O
worked	O
roundish	O
at	O
the	O
ends	O
with	O
rolling	O
along	O
on	O
the	O
sands	O
;	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
weighed	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
ounce	O
,	O
some	O
more	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
less	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
lifted	O
the	O
drawer	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
there	O
could	O
be	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
between	O
twenty	O
and	O
thirty	O
pounds	O
weight	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

Then	O
he	O
pulled	O
out	O
another	O
drawer	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
almost	O
full	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
kind	O
of	O
metal	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
small	O
as	O
sand	O
,	O
the	O
biggest	O
not	O
so	O
big	O
as	O
pins	O
heads	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
might	O
very	O
properly	O
be	O
called	O
gold	O
dust	O
.	O

After	O
this	O
sight	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
surprised	O
at	O
anything	O
he	O
could	O
show	O
us	O
of	O
the	O
kind	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
how	O
long	O
such	O
a	O
treasure	O
might	O
be	O
amassing	O
together	O
in	O
that	O
country	O
?	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
was	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
pains	O
they	O
might	O
take	O
in	O
the	O
search	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
twelve	O
years	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
done	O
little	O
or	O
nothing	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
had	O
he	O
had	O
twenty	O
negroes	O
to	O
have	O
set	O
on	O
work	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
had	O
,	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
procured	O
more	O
than	O
this	O
in	O
one	O
year	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
how	O
much	O
gold	O
in	O
weight	O
he	O
thought	O
there	O
might	O
be	O
in	O
all	O
he	O
had	O
shown	O
me	O
?	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
never	O
troubled	O
themselves	O
to	O
weigh	O
,	O
but	O
when	O
the	O
silversmith	O
at	O
St.	PNM
Jago	PNM
came	O
to	O
bring	O
home	O
any	O
vessel	O
,	O
or	O
when	O
the	O
merchants	O
from	O
Lima	PNM
came	O
to	O
Baldivia	PNM
with	O
European	O
goods	O
,	O
then	O
they	O
bought	O
what	O
they	O
wanted	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

That	O
they	O
were	O
sensible	O
they	O
gave	O
excessive	O
prices	O
for	O
everything	O
,	O
even	O
ten	O
or	O
twenty	O
for	O
one	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
gold	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
was	O
the	O
growth	O
of	O
that	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
things	O

such	O
as	O

were	O
the	O

of	O
Europe	PNM

they	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
much	O
to	O
give	O
what	O
was	O
asked	O
for	O
those	O
things	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
in	O
this	O
country	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
kept	O
large	O
plantations	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O

had	O
great	O
numbers	O
of	O
cattle	O

ingenios	O

as	O
they	O
call	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
making	O
sugar	O

and	O
land	O
,	O
under	O
management	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
maintenance	O
of	O
themselves	O
and	O
families	O
,	O
yet	O
did	O
not	O
wholly	O
neglect	O
the	O
getting	O
gold	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
mountains	O
,	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
such	O
plenty	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
the	O
town	O
adjacent	O
is	O
called	O
Villa	PNM

,	PNM
or	O
the	O
Rich	O
Town	O

being	O

as	O
it	O
were	O

at	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

in	O
the	O

them	O

After	O
I	O
had	O
sufficiently	O
admired	O
the	O
vast	O
quantity	O
of	O
gold	O
he	O
had	O
,	O
he	O
made	O
signs	O
to	O
the	O
doctor	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
take	O
any	O
piece	O
or	O
any	O
quantity	O
that	O
I	O
pleased	O
;	O
but	O
thought	O
I	O
might	O
take	O
it	O
as	O
an	O
affront	O
to	O
have	O
him	O
offer	O
me	O
any	O
particular	O
small	O
parcel	O
.	O

The	O
doctor	O
hinted	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
bade	O
him	O
return	O
him	O
thanks	O
;	O
but	O
to	O
let	O
him	O
know	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
have	O
any	O
of	O
that	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
glad	O
to	O
take	O
up	O
a	O
piece	O
or	O
two	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
chance	O
should	O
present	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
mountains	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
show	O
in	O
my	O
own	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
tell	O
them	O
that	O
I	O
took	O
it	O
up	O
with	O
my	O
own	O
hands	O
.	O

He	O
answered	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
go	O
with	O
me	O
himself	O
;	O
and	O
doubted	O
not	O
but	O
to	O
carry	O
me	O
where	O
I	O
should	O
fully	O
satisfy	O
my	O
curiosity	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
content	O
to	O
climb	O
a	O
little	O
among	O
the	O
rocks	O
.	O

I	O
now	O
began	O
to	O
see	O
plainly	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
manner	O
of	O
need	O
to	O
have	O
taken	O
his	O
sons	O
for	O
hostages	O
for	O
my	O
safety	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
fain	O
have	O
sent	O
for	O
them	O
back	O
again	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
would	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
give	O
me	O
leave	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
give	O
that	O
over	O
.	O

A	O
day	O
or	O
two	O
after	O
,	O
I	O
desired	O
he	O
would	O
give	O
me	O
leave	O
to	O
send	O
for	O
one	O
person	O
more	O
from	O
the	O
ships	O
,	O
who	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
mind	O
should	O
see	O
the	O
country	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
send	O
for	O
some	O
few	O
things	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
want	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
withal	O
,	O
to	O
satisfy	O
my	O
men	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
safe	O
and	O
well	O
.	O

This	O
he	O
consented	O
to	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
sent	O
away	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
midshipmen	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
called	O
my	O
servants	O

and	O
with	O
him	O
two	O
servants	O
of	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
,	O
my	O
landlord	O

as	O
I	O
styled	O
him	O
,	O
with	O
four	O
mules	O
and	O
two	O
horses	O

I	O
gave	O
my	O
midshipman	O
my	O
orders	O
and	O
directions	O

under	O
my	O
hand	O
,	O
to	O
my	O
supercargo	O
,	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
resolved	O
to	O
be	O
even	O
with	O
my	O
Spaniard	O
for	O
all	O
his	O
good	O
usage	O
of	O
me	O

The	O
midshipman	O
and	O
his	O
two	O
companions	O
did	O
not	O
return	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
ten	O
days	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
came	O
back	O
pretty	O
well	O

and	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
come	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
on	O

The	O
whole	O
of	O
this	O
time	O
my	O
landlord	O
and	O
I	O
spent	O
in	O
surveying	O
the	O
country	O

and	O
viewing	O
his	O
plantation	O

As	O
for	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Villa	PNM

it	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
most	O
proper	O
to	O
go	O
there	O
in	O
public	O

and	O
the	O
doctor	O
knew	O
that	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
Spaniard	O

and	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
went	O
several	O
times	O
_	O
incognito	O

it	O
was	O
of	O
no	O

it	O

One	O
night	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
very	O
strange	O
fright	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
behaved	O
myself	O
very	O
much	O

and	O
,	O
chancing	O
to	O
open	O
my	O

saw	O
a	O
great	O
light	O
of	O

to	O

seemed	O

at	O
Wapping	PNM

Rotherhithe	O

where	O
people	O
are	O
always	O
terrified	O
with	O

out	O

Fire	O

fire	O

The	O
first	O
thing	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
thought	O
of	O
on	O
this	O
occasion	O
should	O
have	O
been	O

that	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
what	O
the	O
words	O
fire	O

fire	O

meant	O

and	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
expected	O
they	O
should	O
understand	O
me	O

I	O
should	O
have	O
cried	O
Fuego	O

Fuego	O

However	O
,	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
got	O
up	O

and	O
my	O
Madagascar	O
captain	O

for	O
we	O
all	O
lay	O
near	O
one	O
another	O

and	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
noise	O
,	O
they	O
waked	O
the	O
whole	O
house	O
;	O
and	O
my	O
landlord	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
afterwards	O
confessed	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
suspect	O
some	O
mischief	O
,	O
his	O
steward	O
having	O
come	O
to	O
his	O
chamber	O
door	O

and	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
the	O
strangers	O
were	O
up	O
in	O
arms	O
;	O
in	O
which	O
mistake	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
all	O
had	O
our	O
throats	O
cut	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
poor	O
Spaniard	O
not	O
to	O
blame	O
neither	O

But	O
our	O
doctor	O
coming	O
hastily	O
in	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
unriddled	O
the	O
whole	O
matter	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
this	O
:	O
that	O
a	O
volcano	O
,	O
or	O
burning	O
vent	O
among	O
the	O
hills	O
,	O
being	O
pretty	O
near	O
the	O
Spanish	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
as	O
there	O
are	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
Andes	O
,	O
had	O
flamed	O
out	O
that	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
such	O
a	O
terrible	O
light	O
in	O
the	O
air	O
as	O
made	O
us	O
think	O
the	O
fire	O
had	O
at	O

been	O
in	O
the	O

or	O
in	O

of	O
the	O
house	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
accordingly	O
,	O
had	O
put	O
me	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
fright	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
,	O
having	O
told	O
me	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
he	O
ran	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
Spanish	O
servants	O

and	O
told	O
them	O
what	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
it	O
all	O
was	O
,	O
and	O
bade	O
them	O
go	O

satisfy	O
their	O
master	O

which	O
they	O
did	O

and	O
all	O
was	O
well	O
again	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
for	O
myself	O
,	O
I	O
sat	O
up	O
almost	O
all	O
the	O
night	O
staring	O
out	O
from	O
the	O
window	O
at	O
the	O
eruption	O
of	O
fire	O
upon	O
the	O
hills	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
like	O
wonderful	O
appearance	O
I	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
before	O
.	O

I	O
sincerely	O
begged	O
my	O
landlord	O
's	O
pardon	O
for	O
disturbing	O
his	O
house	O
,	O
and	O
asked	O
him	O
if	O
those	O
eruptions	O
were	O
frequent	O
?	O

He	O
said	O
no	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
frequent	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
constant	O
,	O
either	O
in	O
one	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
hills	O
or	O
another	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
in	O
my	O
passing	O
the	O
mountains	O
I	O
should	O
see	O
several	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
alarmed	O
with	O
them	O
?	O

and	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
attended	O
with	O
earthquakes	O
?	O

He	O
said	O
,	O
he	O
believed	O
that	O
among	O
the	O
hills	O
themselves	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
some	O
shakings	O
of	O
the	O
earth	O
,	O
because	O
sometimes	O
were	O
found	O
pieces	O
of	O
the	O
rocks	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
broken	O
off	O
and	O
fallen	O
down	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
among	O
those	O
that	O
sometimes	O
parts	O
of	O
stone	O
were	O
found	O
which	O
had	O
gold	O
interspersed	O
in	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
melted	O
and	O
run	O
together	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
shown	O
me	O
some	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
for	O
earthquakes	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
never	O
heard	O
of	O
any	O
since	O
he	O
came	O
thither	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
upwards	O
of	O
fifteen	O
years	O
,	O
including	O
three	O

that	O

at	O
St.	PNM

One	O
day	O
,	O
being	O
out	O
on	O
horseback	O
with	O
my	O
landlord	O
,	O
we	O
rode	O
up	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
mountains	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
showed	O
me	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
an	O
entrance	O
as	O
he	O
called	O
it	O
,	O
into	O
them	O
,	O
frightful	O
enough	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
as	O
shall	O
be	O
described	O
in	O
its	O
place	O

He	O
then	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
was	O
the	O
way	O
he	O
intended	O
to	O
carry	O
me	O
when	O
he	O
should	O
go	O
to	O
show	O
me	O
the	O
highest	O
hills	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
turned	O
short	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
smiling	O
,	O
said	O
it	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
yet	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
had	O
promised	O
me	O
a	O
safe	O
return	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
hostages	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
yet	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
capitulated	O
for	O
time	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
he	O
need	O
not	O
capitulate	O
with	O
me	O
for	O
time	O
;	O
for	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
two	O
ships	O
to	O
stay	O
my	O
coming	O
,	O
and	O
between	O
three	O
and	O
four	O
hundred	O
men	O
eating	O
me	O
up	O
all	O
the	O
while	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
whether	O
I	O
should	O
ever	O
go	O
away	O
again	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
give	O
me	O
house	O
room	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
as	O
to	O
that	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
sent	O
my	O
men	O
some	O
provisions	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
starve	O
if	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
go	O
back	O
for	O
some	O
days	O
.	O

This	O
surprised	O
me	O
not	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
discovered	O
it	O
in	O
my	O
countenance	O
.	O

Nay	O
,	O
seignior	O
,	O
says	O
he	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
only	O
sent	O
them	O
some	O
victuals	O
to	O
maintain	O
my	O
two	O
hostages	O
,	O
for	O
you	O
know	O
they	O
must	O
not	O
want	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
good	O
manners	O
in	O
me	O
to	O
ask	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
sent	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
understood	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
my	O
midshipman	O
returned	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
sent	O
down	O
sixteen	O
cows	O
or	O
runts	O
,	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
what	O
else	O
to	O
call	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
black	O
cattle	O
,	O
thirty	O
hogs	O
,	O
thirteen	O
large	O
Peruvian	O
sheep	O
,	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
great	O
calves	O
,	O
and	O
three	O
casks	O
of	O
Chilian	O
wine	O
,	O
with	O
an	O
assurance	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
have	O
more	O
provisions	O
when	O
that	O
was	O
spent	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
amazed	O
at	O
all	O
this	O
munificence	O
of	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
glad	O
I	O
was	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
sent	O
my	O
midshipman	O
for	O
the	O
things	O
I	O
intended	O
to	O
present	O
him	O
with	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
as	O
well	O
able	O
to	O
requite	O
him	O
for	O
a	O
large	O
present	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
resolved	O
it	O
before	O
I	O
knew	O
he	O
had	O
sent	O
anything	O
to	O
the	O
ships	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
this	O
exchanging	O
of	O
presents	O
was	O
but	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
generous	O
barter	O
or	O
commerce	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
to	O
gold	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
either	O
of	O
us	O
so	O
much	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
equal	O
in	O
value	O
to	O
what	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
give	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
present	O
situated	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
my	O
midshipman	O
returned	O
with	O
the	O
horses	O
and	O
servants	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
he	O
had	O
brought	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
sent	O
for	O
into	O
a	O
place	O
which	O
I	O
desired	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
to	O
allow	O
me	O
to	O
open	O
my	O
things	O
in	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
my	O
doctor	O
to	O
desire	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
to	O
let	O
me	O
speak	O
with	O
him	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
first	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
must	O
give	O
me	O
his	O
parole	O
of	O
honour	O
not	O
to	O
take	O
amiss	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
say	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
custom	O
in	O
our	O
country	O
,	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
presents	O
to	O
the	O

with	O
the	O
knowledge	O
and	O
consent	O
of	O
their	O

,	O
without	O
any	O
evil	O
design	O
,	O
or	O
without	O
giving	O
any	O
offence	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
I	O
knew	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
among	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
.	O

That	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
had	O
the	O
honour	O
yet	O
either	O
to	O
see	O
his	O
lady	O
or	O
his	O
daughter	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
heard	O
he	O
had	O
both	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
pleased	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
messenger	O
of	O
a	O
trifle	O
I	O
had	O
caused	O
my	O
man	O
to	O
bring	O

and	O
would	O
present	O
it	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
take	O
it	O
as	O
an	O
offence	O
,	O
he	O
should	O
see	O
beforehand	O
what	O
it	O
was	O

and	O
I	O
would	O
content	O
myself	O
with	O
his	O
accepting	O
it	O
in	O
their	O

He	O
told	O
me	O

smiling	O
,	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
bring	O
me	O
thither	O
to	O
take	O
any	O
presents	O
of	O
me	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
already	O
done	O
enough	O
,	O
in	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
given	O
him	O
his	O
liberty	O

which	O
was	O
the	O
most	O
valuable	O
gift	O
in	O
the	O
world	O

and	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
his	O

I	O
had	O
already	O
made	O
her	O
the	O
best	O

I	O

having	O
given	O
her	O
back	O
her	O

That	O
it	O
is	O
true	O

it	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
custom	O
of	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
to	O
let	O
their	O
wives	O
appear	O
in	O
any	O
public	O
entertainment	O
of	O
friends	O

but	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
resolved	O
to	O
break	O
through	O
that	O
custom	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
told	O
his	O
wife	O
what	O
a	O
friend	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
to	O
her	O
family	O

and	O
that	O
she	O
should	O
thank	O
me	O
for	O
it	O
in	O

and	O
that	O
then	O
,	O
what	O
present	O
I	O
had	O

for	O
her	O
,	O
since	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
maker	O
of	O

she	O
should	O
do	O
herself	O
the	O
honour	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
with	O
her	O

from	O
mistaking	O
them	O

or	O
taking	O
it	O
ill	O
from	O
his	O

this	O
was	O
the	O

me	O

the	O
more	O
he	O
was	O

his	O

I	O
must	O
confess	O
I	O
was	O
surprised	O

for	O
I	O
did	O
not	O

in	O

The	O
lady	O

dress	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
easily	O
describe	O

she	O
was	O
really	O
a	O
charming	O
woman	O

of	O
about	O
forty	O

of	O

gave	O
her	O
veil	O
to	O
her	O

when	O
her	O
husband	O
took	O
her	O
by	O
the	O

Her	O
daughter	O
I	O
took	O
to	O
be	O
about	O
twelve	O

which	O
the	O

count	O
marriageable	O

my	O

the	O
most	O
obliging	O
manner	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
a	O
modest	O
graceful	O
way	O
of	O
speech	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
describe	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
indeed	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
who	O
are	O
said	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
haughty	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
acquainted	O
with	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
desired	O
the	O
doctor	O
to	O
tell	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
,	O
her	O
husband	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
requested	O
his	O
lady	O
to	O
accept	O
a	O
small	O
present	O
which	O
my	O
midshipman	O
had	O
brought	O
for	O
her	O
from	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
I	O
took	O
in	O
my	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
led	O
his	O
wife	O
forward	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
must	O
needs	O
say	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
mean	O
present	O
,	O
besides	O
its	O
being	O
of	O
ten	O
times	O
the	O
value	O
in	O
that	O
place	O
as	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
at	O
London	PNM
;	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
now	O
very	O
glad	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
mentioned	O
above	O
,	O
I	O
always	O
reserved	O
a	O
small	O
quantity	O
of	O
all	O
goods	O
unsold	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
them	O
to	O
dispose	O
of	O
as	O
occasion	O
should	O
offer	O
.	O

First	O
,	O
I	O
presented	O
her	O
with	O
a	O
very	O
fine	O
piece	O
of	O
Dutch	O
Holland	O
,	O
worth	O
in	O
London	PNM
about	O
seven	O
shillings	O
an	O
ell	O
,	O
and	O
thirty-six	O
ells	O
in	O
length	O
,	O
and	O
worth	O
in	O
Chili	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
fifteen	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
per	O
ell	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
;	O
or	O
it	O
was	O
rather	O
likely	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
kingdom	O
of	O
Chili	PNM
had	O
not	O
such	O
another	O
.	O

Then	O
I	O
gave	O
her	O
two	O
pieces	O
of	O
China	PNM
damask	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
pieces	O
of	O
China	PNM
silks	O
,	O
called	O
atlasses	O
,	O
flowered	O
with	O
gold	O
;	O
two	O
pieces	O
of	O
fine	O
muslin	O
,	O
one	O
flowered	O
the	O
other	O
plain	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
very	O
fine	O
chintz	O
,	O
or	O
printed	O
calico	O
;	O
also	O
a	O
large	O
parcel	O
of	O
spices	O
,	O
made	O
up	O
in	O
elegant	O
papers	O
,	O
being	O
about	O
six	O
pounds	O
of	O
nutmegs	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
twice	O
as	O
many	O
cloves	O
.	O

And	O
lastly	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
young	O
lady	O
I	O
gave	O
one	O
piece	O
of	O
damask	O
,	O
two	O
pieces	O
of	O
China	PNM
taffity	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
fine	O
striped	O
muslin	O
.	O

After	O
all	O
this	O
was	O
delivered	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
ladies	O
had	O
received	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
given	O
them	O
their	O
women	O
to	O
hold	O
,	O
I	O
pulled	O
out	O
a	O
little	O
box	O
in	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
two	O
couple	O
of	O
large	O
pearls	O
,	O
of	O
that	O
pearl	O
which	O
I	O
mentioned	O
we	O
found	O
at	O
the	O
Pearl	PNM
Islands	PNM
,	O
very	O
well	O
matched	O
for	O
ear-rings	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
the	O
lady	O
one	O
pair	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
daughter	O
the	O
other	O
;	O
and	O
now	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
a	O
present	O
fit	O
for	O
an	O
ambassador	O
to	O
carry	O
to	O
a	O
prince	O
.	O

The	O
ladies	O
made	O
all	O
possible	O
acknowledgment	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
honour	O
that	O
day	O
to	O
dine	O
with	O
them	O
in	O
public	O
.	O

My	O
landlord	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
,	O
told	O
me	O
I	O
had	O
given	O
them	O
such	O
a	O
present	O
as	O
the	O
viceroy	O
of	O
Mexico	O
's	O
lady	O
would	O
have	O
gone	O
fifty	O
leagues	O
to	O
have	O
received	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
done	O
with	O
my	O
host	O
;	O
for	O
after	O
dinner	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
him	O
into	O
the	O
same	O
room	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
I	O
hoped	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
all	O
my	O
presents	O
to	O
the	O
ladies	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
nothing	O
left	O
to	O
show	O
my	O
respect	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
I	O
presented	O
him	O
with	O
three	O
negro	O
men	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
bought	O
at	O
Callao	PNM
for	O
my	O
own	O
use	O
,	O
but	O
knew	O
I	O
could	O
supply	O
myself	O
again	O
,	O
at	O
or	O
in	O
my	O
way	O
home	O
,	O
at	O
a	O
moderate	O
price	O
;	O
in	O
the	O
next	O
place	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
him	O
three	O
pieces	O
of	O
black	O
Colchester	O
baize	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
are	O
coarse	O
ordinary	O
things	O
in	O
England	PNM
,	O
that	O
a	O
footman	O
would	O
scarce	O
wear	O
,	O
are	O
a	O
habit	O
for	O
a	O
prince	O
in	O
that	O
country	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
very	O
fine	O
English	O
serge	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
really	O
very	O
valuable	O
in	O
England	PNM
,	O
but	O
much	O
more	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
another	O
piece	O
of	O
crimson	O
broadcloth	O
,	O
and	O
six	O
pieces	O
of	O
fine	O
silk	O
druggets	O
for	O
his	O
two	O
sons	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
I	O
finished	O
my	O
presents	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniard	O
stood	O
still	O
and	O
looked	O
on	O
all	O
the	O
while	O
I	O
was	O
laying	O
out	O
my	O
presents	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
as	O
one	O
in	O
a	O
transport	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
not	O
one	O
word	O
till	O
all	O
was	O
over	O
;	O
but	O
then	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
very	O
gravely	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
now	O
time	O
for	O
him	O
to	O
turn	O
me	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
house	O
:	O
For	O
seignior	O
,	O
says	O
he	O
,	O
no	O
man	O
ought	O
to	O
suffer	O
himself	O
to	O
be	O
obliged	O
beyond	O
his	O
power	O
of	O
return	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
have	O
no	O
possible	O
way	O
of	O
making	O
any	O
return	O
to	O
you	O
equal	O
to	O
such	O
things	O
as	O
these	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
true	O
the	O
present	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
him	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
rated	O
by	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
things	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
where	O
it	O
then	O
was	O
,	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
valued	O
at	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
hundred	O
pounds	O
sterling	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
to	O
reckon	O
them	O
as	O
they	O
cost	O
me	O
,	O
did	O
not	O
altogether	O
amount	O
to	O
above	O
one	O
hundred	O
pounds	O
,	O
except	O
the	O
three	O
negroes	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
cost	O
me	O
at	O
Lima	PNM
one	O
thousand	O
two	O
hundred	O
pieces	O
of	O
eight	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
as	O
sensible	O
of	O
the	O
price	O
of	O
those	O
negroes	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
of	O
the	O
occasion	O
he	O
had	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
the	O
work	O
he	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
for	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
me	O
about	O
an	O
hour	O
after	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
had	O
looked	O
over	O
all	O
the	O
particulars	O
of	O
the	O
noble	O
presents	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
the	O
value	O
was	O
too	O
great	O
for	O
him	O
to	O
accept	O
,	O
or	O
for	O
any	O
man	O
to	O
offer	O
him	O
,	O
yet	O
since	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
at	O
so	O
much	O
trouble	O
to	O
send	O
for	O
the	O
things	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
thought	O
him	O
worthy	O
such	O
a	O
bounty	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
come	O
back	O
to	O
tell	O
me	O
that	O
he	O
accepted	O
thankfully	O
all	O
my	O
presents	O
,	O
both	O
to	O
himself	O
and	O
to	O
his	O
wife	O
and	O
daughter	O
,	O
except	O
only	O
the	O
three	O
negroes	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
bought	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
the	O
particular	O
traffick	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
take	O
them	O
as	O
a	O
present	O
,	O
but	O
would	O
be	O
equally	O
obliged	O
,	O
and	O
take	O
it	O
for	O
as	O
much	O
a	O
favour	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
allow	O
him	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
smiled	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
he	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
agree	O
upon	O
that	O
;	O
for	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
yet	O
know	O
what	O
favours	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
ask	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
expense	O
I	O
should	O
put	O
him	O
to	O
;	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
design	O
in	O
my	O
view	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
to	O
crave	O
his	O
assistance	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
yet	O
communicated	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
he	O
might	O
perhaps	O
find	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
pay	O
dear	O
enough	O
for	O
all	O
the	O
little	O
presents	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
meantime	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
himself	O
easy	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
three	O
negro	O
men	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
him	O
my	O
word	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
pay	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
only	O
not	O
yet	O
.	O

He	O
could	O
have	O
nothing	O
to	O
object	O
against	O
an	O
offer	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
,	O
because	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
guess	O
what	O
I	O
meant	O
,	O
but	O
gave	O
me	O
all	O
the	O
assurance	O
of	O
service	O
and	O
assistance	O
that	O
lay	O
in	O
his	O
power	O
in	O
anything	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
to	O
do	O
in	O
that	O
country	O
.	O

But	O
here	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
it	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
understood	O
,	O
that	O
all	O
this	O
was	O
carried	O
on	O
with	O
a	O
supposition	O
that	O
we	O
acted	O
under	O
a	O
commission	O
from	O
the	O
King	O
of	O
France	PNM
;	O
and	O
though	O
he	O
knew	O
many	O
of	O
us	O
were	O
English	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
an	O
Englishman	O
in	O
particular	O
,	O
yet	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
such	O
a	O
commission	O
,	O
and	O
produced	O
it	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
Frenchmen	O
in	O
that	O
sense	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
nor	O
did	O
he	O
entertain	O
us	O
under	O
any	O
other	O
idea	O
.	O

The	O
sequel	O
of	O
this	O
story	O
will	O
also	O
make	O
it	O
sufficiently	O
appear	O
that	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
make	O
such	O
presents	O
as	O
these	O
in	O
mere	O
ostentation	O
,	O
or	O
only	O
upon	O
the	O
compliment	O
of	O
a	O
visit	O
to	O
a	O
Spanish	O
gentleman	O
,	O
any	O
more	O
than	O
I	O
would	O
leave	O
my	O
ship	O
and	O
a	O
cargo	O
of	O
such	O
value	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
manner	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
tour	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
had	O
views	O
sufficient	O
to	O
justify	O
such	O
measures	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
consequence	O
of	O
those	O
measures	O
will	O
be	O
the	O
best	O
apology	O
for	O
my	O
conduct	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
who	O
will	O
impartially	O
consider	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
now	O
spent	O
a	O
fortnight	O
,	O
and	O
something	O
more	O
,	O
in	O
ceremony	O
and	O

However	O
,	O
even	O
in	O
this	O
way	O
of	O
living	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
idle	O
as	O
I	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
,	O
for	O

not	O

myself	O
sufficiently	O
of	O
the	O
parts	O
which	O
I	O
did	O
not	O

I	O
found	O
the	O
country	O
not	O
only	O
fruitful	O
in	O
the	O
soil	O

but	O
wonderfully	O
temperate	O

from	O

that	O
it	O
was	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
concerning	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
they	O
were	O
the	O
most	O
quiet	O
and	O
inoffensive	O
people	O
,	O
since	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
had	O
reduced	O
them	O
by	O
force	O
,	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
desired	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
numerous	O
or	O
warlike	O
,	O
the	O
warlike	O
and	O
obstinate	O
part	O
of	O
them	O
having	O
fled	O
farther	O
off	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
overpowered	O
by	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
;	O
that	O
,	O
for	O
those	O
who	O
were	O
left	O
,	O
they	O
lived	O
secure	O
under	O
the	O
protection	O
of	O
the	O
Spanish	O
governor	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
fed	O
cattle	O
and	O
planted	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
sold	O
the	O
product	O
of	O
their	O
lands	O
chiefly	O
to	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
covet	O
to	O
be	O
rich	O
,	O
only	O
to	O
obtain	O
clothes	O
,	O
arms	O
,	O
powder	O
and	O
shot	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
suffered	O
to	O
have	O
but	O
sparingly	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
good	O
assurance	O
of	O
their	O
fidelity	O
.	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
treacherous	O
and	O
perfidious	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
dangerous	O
trusting	O
themselves	O
among	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
mountains	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
retired	O
places	O
where	O
they	O
dwelt	O
?	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
quite	O
the	O
contrary	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
honest	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
harmless	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
venture	O
to	O
send	O
his	O
two	O
sons	O
into	O
the	O
mountains	O
a-hunting	O
,	O
with	O
each	O
of	O
them	O
a	O
Chilian	O
for	O
his	O
guide	O
;	O
and	O
let	O
them	O
stay	O
with	O
the	O
said	O
natives	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
nights	O
and	O
days	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
be	O
in	O
no	O
uneasiness	O
about	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
ever	O
known	O
to	O
do	O
any	O
foul	O
or	O
treacherous	O
thing	O
by	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
since	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
that	O
country	O

Having	O
thus	O
finally	O
informed	O
myself	O
of	O
things	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
now	O
to	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
high	O
time	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
particulars	O
which	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
inquire	O
after	O
,	O
viz.	O

the	O
passages	O

the	O

discovered	O
on	O

side	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
accordingly	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
my	O
patron	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
,	O
by	O
himself	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
a	O

and	O
was	O
now	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
remote	O
part	O
of	O
the	O

he	O
could	O
not	O
but	O
think	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
glad	O
to	O
see	O
everything	O
extraordinary	O
that	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
give	O
some	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
into	O
Europe	PNM

better	O

from	O
what	O
others	O
had	O
done	O
who	O

there	O
before	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
mind	O

if	O
he	O
would	O
give	O
me	O
his	O
assistance	O
,	O
to	O
enter	O
into	O
the	O
passages	O

which	O
he	O
had	O
told	O
me	O
so	O
much	O
of	O
in	O
the	O
mountains	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
possible	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
always	O
thought	O
it	O

to	O
take	O
a	O
prospect	O
of	O
the	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
light	O
piece	O
of	O
work	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
the	O
discoveries	O
might	O
not	O
answer	O
my	O
trouble	O
,	O
there	O
being	O
little	O
to	O
be	O

but	O
steep	O
precipices	O

rocks	O

immuring	O
us	O
on	O

innumerable	O
rills	O

brooks	O
of	O

falling	O
from	O
the	O

making	O
a	O
barbarous	O

unpleasant	O
sound	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
sound	O
echoed	O
and	O
reverberated	O
from	O
innumerable	O
cavities	O
among	O
the	O
rocks	O

and	O
these	O
all	O
pouring	O
down	O
into	O
one	O
middle	O

which	O
we	O
should	O
always	O
find	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
or	O
other	O
of	O
us	O
as	O
we	O
went	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
sometimes	O
we	O
should	O
be	O

to	O
pass	O
those	O

as	O

the	O

on	O

at	O
the	O
trouble	O
of	O
pulling	O
off	O

He	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
meet	O

indeed	O

with	O
provisions	O
enough	O

with	O
an	O
innocent	O

harmless	O
people	O

who	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
their	O
ability	O
,	O
would	O
entertain	O
us	O
very	O
willingly	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
I	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
a	O
stranger	O

would	O
be	O
sorely	O
put	O
to	O
it	O
for	O

for	O
so	O
many	O
of	O
us	O

However	O
,	O
he	O
said	O

as	O
he	O
had	O
perhaps	O
at	O
first	O
raised	O
this	O
curiosity	O
in	O
me	O

by	O
giving	O
me	O
a	O
favourable	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
place	O

he	O
would	O
be	O
very	O
far	O
from	O

me	O
now	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
resolved	O

he	O
would	O
not	O

endeavour	O
to	O
make	O
everything	O
as	O
pleasant	O
to	O
me	O
as	O
he	O
could	O

that	O
he	O

me	O

see	O
us	O
safe	O

desired	O
me	O
not	O
to	O

in	O
too	O
much	O

for	O
that	O
he	O
must	O

for	O
the	O
journey	O

up	O
fourteen	O

as	O

my	O

that	O
he	O

accordingly	O
we	O

My	O

the	O

had	O
six	O
also	O
,	O
viz.	O

his	O

as	O
I	O

him	O
before	O

Just	O

his	O

for	O

as	O
we	O
saw	O
occasion	O

I	O
was	O
as	O
well	O
pleased	O
with	O
this	O
circumstance	O
as	O
with	O
any	O
my	O
landlord	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
so	O
entire	O
a	O
confidence	O
in	O
the	O
native	O
Chilians	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
saw	O
plainly	O
,	O
some	O
time	O
after	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
wrong	O
,	O
for	O
nothing	O
could	O
be	O
more	O
honest	O
,	O
quiet	O
,	O
and	O
free	O
from	O
design	O
,	O
than	O
those	O
people	O
,	O
except	O
the	O
poor	O
honest	O
people	O
where	O
we	O
dressed	O
up	O
the	O
king	O
and	O
queen	O
,	O
as	O
already	O
mentioned	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
late	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
before	O
we	O
got	O
out	O
,	O
having	O
all	O
this	O
equipage	O
to	O
furnish	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
travelling	O
very	O
gently	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
about	O
two	O
hours	O
before	O
sunset	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
entrance	O
of	O
the	O
mountains	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
to	O
my	O
surprise	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
go	O
in	O
upon	O
a	O
level	O
,	O
without	O
any	O
ascent	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
that	O
was	O
considerable	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
gone	O
up	O
upon	O
a	O
sharp	O
ascent	O
,	O
for	O
near	O
two	O
miles	O
,	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
.	O

The	O
entrance	O
was	O
agreeable	O
enough	O
,	O
the	O
passage	O
being	O
near	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
broad	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
left	O
hand	O
was	O
a	O
small	O
river	O
,	O
whose	O
channel	O
was	O
deep	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
water	O
shallow	O
,	O
there	O
having	O
been	O
but	O
little	O
rain	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
;	O
the	O
water	O
ran	O
very	O
rapid	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
my	O
Spaniard	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
was	O
sometimes	O
exceeding	O
fierce	O
.	O

The	O
entrance	O
lay	O
inclining	O
a	O
little	O
south	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
so	O
straight	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
near	O
a	O
mile	O
before	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
prodigious	O
height	O
of	O
the	O
hills	O
on	O
both	O
sides	O
,	O
and	O
before	O
us	O
,	O
appearing	O
one	O
over	O
another	O
,	O
gave	O
such	O
a	O
prospect	O
of	O
horror	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
confess	O
it	O
was	O
frightful	O
at	O
first	O
to	O
look	O
on	O
the	O
stupendous	O
altitude	O
of	O
the	O
rocks	O
;	O
everything	O
above	O
us	O
looking	O
one	O
higher	O
than	O
another	O
was	O
amazing	O
;	O
and	O
to	O
see	O
how	O
in	O
some	O
places	O
they	O
hung	O
over	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
over	O
the	O
passage	O
,	O
it	O
created	O
a	O
dread	O
of	O
being	O
overwhelmed	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
rocks	O
and	O
precipices	O
of	O
the	O
Andes	O
,	O
on	O
our	O
right	O
hand	O
,	O
had	O
here	O
and	O
there	O
vast	O
cliffs	O
and	O
entrances	O
,	O
which	O
looked	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
different	O
thoroughfares	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
look	O
full	O
into	O
them	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
no	O
passage	O
at	O
the	O
farther	O
end	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
went	O
off	O
in	O
slopes	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
gulleys	O
made	O
by	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
in	O
hasty	O
rains	O
,	O
came	O
pouring	O
down	O
from	O
the	O
hills	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
,	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
made	O
such	O
noises	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
impossible	O
to	O
conceive	O
,	O
unless	O
by	O
having	O
seen	O
and	O
heard	O
the	O
like	O
before	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
falling	O
from	O
a	O
height	O
twenty	O
times	O
as	O
high	O
as	O
our	O
own	O
Monument	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
much	O
higher	O
,	O
and	O
meeting	O
in	O
the	O
passage	O
with	O
many	O
dashes	O
and	O
interruptions	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
impossible	O
to	O
describe	O
how	O
the	O
sound	O
,	O
crossing	O
and	O
interfering	O
,	O
mingled	O
itself	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
several	O
noises	O
sunk	O
one	O
into	O
another	O
,	O
increasing	O
the	O
whole	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
many	O
waters	O
joining	O
increased	O
the	O
main	O
stream	O
.	O

We	O
entered	O
this	O
passage	O
about	O
two	O
miles	O
the	O
first	O
night	O
;	O
after	O
the	O
first	O
length	O
,	O
which	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
held	O
about	O
three	O
quarters	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
,	O
we	O
turned	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
,	O
short	O
on	O
the	O
right	O
hand	O
;	O
the	O
river	O
leaving	O
us	O
,	O
seemed	O
to	O
come	O
through	O
a	O
very	O
narrow	O
but	O
deep	O
hollow	O
of	O
the	O
mountains	O
,	O
where	O
there	O
was	O
little	O
more	O
breadth	O
at	O
the	O
bottom	O
than	O
the	O
channel	O
took	O
up	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
rocks	O
inclined	O
backward	O
as	O
they	O
ascended	O
,	O
as	O
placed	O
in	O
several	O
stages	O
,	O
though	O
all	O
horrid	O
and	O
irregular	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
nothing	O
but	O
blackness	O
and	O
terror	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
glad	O
our	O
passage	O
did	O
not	O
turn	O
on	O
that	O
side	O
,	O
but	O
wondered	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
leave	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
more	O
when	O
I	O
found	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
we	O
went	O
,	O
having	O
first	O
mounted	O
gently	O
a	O
green	O
pleasant	O
slope	O
,	O
it	O
declined	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
new	O
rivulet	O
begin	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
water	O
running	O
south-east	O
or	O
thereabouts	O
.	O

This	O
discovery	O
made	O
me	O
ask	O
if	O
the	O
water	O
went	O
away	O
into	O
the	O
new	O
world	O
beyond	O
the	O
hills	O
?	O

My	O
patron	O
smiled	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
,	O
No	O
seignior	O
,	O
not	O
yet	O
;	O
we	O
shall	O
meet	O
with	O
the	O
other	O
river	O
again	O
very	O
quickly	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
again	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
a	O
little	O
farther	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
passage	O
open	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
very	O
pleasant	O
plain	O
,	O
which	O
declined	O
a	O
little	O
gradually	O
,	O
widening	O
to	O
the	O
left	O
,	O
or	O
east	O
side	O
;	O
on	O
the	O
right	O
side	O
of	O
this	O
we	O
saw	O
another	O
vast	O
opening	O
like	O
the	O
first	O
,	O
which	O
went	O
in	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
closed	O
up	O
as	O
the	O
first	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
sloping	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
hills	O
,	O
a	O
most	O
astonishing	O
inconceivable	O
height	O
.	O

My	O
patron	O
stopping	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
getting	O
down	O
,	O
or	O
alighting	O
from	O
his	O
mule	O
,	O
gave	O
him	O
to	O
his	O
man	O
,	O
and	O
asking	O
me	O
to	O
alight	O
,	O
told	O
me	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
night	O
's	O
entertainment	O
I	O
was	O
to	O
meet	O
with	O
in	O
the	O
Andes	O
,	O
and	O
hoped	O
I	O
was	O
prepared	O
for	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
very	O
well	O
consent	O
to	O
accept	O
of	O
such	O
entertainment	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
journey	O
of	O
my	O
own	O
contriving	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
content	O
to	O
take	O
up	O
with	O
,	O
in	O
compliment	O
to	O
me	O
.	O

I	O
looked	O
round	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
there	O
were	O
any	O
huts	O
or	O
cots	O
of	O
the	O
mountaineers	O
thereabouts	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
perceived	O
none	O
;	O
only	O
I	O
observed	O
something	O
like	O
a	O
house	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
really	O
a	O
house	O
of	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
said	O
mountaineers	O
,	O
upon	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
a	O
precipice	O
as	O
high	O
from	O
where	O
we	O
stood	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
summit	O
of	O
the	O
cupola	PNM
of	PNM
St.	PNM
Paul	PNM
's	PNM
,	PNM
and	O
I	O
saw	O
some	O
living	O
creatures	O
,	O
whether	O
men	O
or	O
women	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
tell	O
,	O
looking	O
from	O
thence	O
down	O
upon	O
us	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
understood	O
afterwards	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
ways	O
to	O
come	O
at	O
their	O
dwelling	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
very	O
easy	O
and	O
agreeable	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
lanes	O
and	O
plains	O
where	O
they	O
fed	O
their	O
cattle	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
everything	O
growing	O
that	O
they	O
desired	O
.	O

My	O
patron	O
,	O
making	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
an	O
invitation	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
walk	O
,	O
took	O
me	O
up	O
that	O
dark	O
chasm	O
,	O
or	O
opening	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
right	O
hand	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
have	O
just	O
mentioned	O
.	O

Here	O
,	O
sir	O
,	O
said	O
he	O
,	O
if	O
you	O
will	O
venture	O
to	O
walk	O
a	O
few	O
steps	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
likely	O
we	O
may	O
show	O
you	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
product	O
of	O
this	O
country	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
recollecting	O
that	O
night	O
was	O
approaching	O
,	O
he	O
added	O
,	O
I	O
see	O
it	O
is	O
too	O
dark	O
;	O
perhaps	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
better	O
to	O
defer	O
it	O
till	O
the	O
morning	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
we	O
walked	O
back	O
towards	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
had	O
left	O
our	O
mules	O
and	O
servants	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
thither	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
complete	O
camp	O
fixed	O
,	O
three	O
very	O
handsome	O
tents	O
raised	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
bar	O
set	O
up	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
mules	O
were	O
tied	O
one	O
to	O
another	O
to	O
graze	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
servants	O
and	O
the	O
baggage	O
lay	O
together	O
,	O
with	O
an	O
open	O
tent	O
over	O
them	O
.	O

My	O
patron	O
led	O
me	O
into	O
the	O
first	O
tent	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
let	O
me	O
know	O
that	O
I	O
must	O
make	O
a	O
shift	O
with	O
that	O
lodging	O
,	O
the	O
place	O
not	O
affording	O
any	O
better	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
had	O
quilts	O
laid	O
very	O
commodiously	O
for	O
me	O
and	O
my	O
three	O
comrades	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
lodged	O
very	O
comfortably	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
before	O
we	O
went	O
to	O
rest	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
third	O
tent	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
handsome	O
table	O
,	O
covered	O
with	O
a	O
cold	O
treat	O
of	O
roasted	O
mutton	O
and	O
beef	O
,	O
very	O
well	O
dressed	O
,	O
some	O
potted	O
or	O
baked	O
venison	O
,	O
with	O
pickles	O
,	O
conserves	O
,	O
and	O
fine	O
sweetmeats	O
of	O
various	O
sorts	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
ate	O
very	O
freely	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
bade	O
us	O
depend	O
upon	O
it	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
not	O
fare	O
so	O
well	O
the	O
next	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
worse	O
every	O
night	O
,	O
till	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
lie	O
entirely	O
at	O
a	O
mountaineer	O
's	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
better	O
to	O
us	O
than	O
he	O
pretended	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
our	O
chocolate	O
as	O
regularly	O
as	O
we	O
used	O
to	O
have	O
it	O
in	O
his	O
own	O
house	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
soon	O
ready	O
to	O
pursue	O
our	O
journey	O
.	O

We	O
went	O
winding	O
now	O
from	O
the	O
south-east	O
to	O
the	O
left	O
,	O
till	O
our	O
course	O
looked	O
east	O
by	O
north	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
again	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
river	O
in	O
view	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
observed	O
here	O
,	O
that	O
my	O
two	O
midshipmen	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
of	O
my	O
patron	O
's	O
servants	O
,	O
had	O
,	O
by	O
his	O
direction	O
,	O
been	O
very	O
early	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
climbing	O
up	O
the	O
rocks	O
in	O
the	O
opening	O
on	O
the	O
right	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
come	O
back	O
again	O
about	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
after	O
we	O
set	O
out	O
;	O
when	O
,	O
missing	O
my	O
two	O
men	O
,	O
I	O
inquired	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
patron	O
said	O
they	O
were	O
coming	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
he	O
saw	O
them	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
we	O
halted	O
for	O
them	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
were	O
come	O
almost	O
up	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
he	O
called	O
to	O
his	O
men	O
in	O
Spanish	O
,	O
to	O
ask	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
had	O
Una	O
bon	O
vejo	O
?	O

They	O
answered	O
,	O
Poco	O
,	O
poco	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
quite	O
up	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
midshipmen	O
showed	O
me	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
small	O
bits	O
of	O
clean	O
perfect	O
gold	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
picked	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
hill	O
or	O
gullet	O
where	O
the	O
water	O
trickled	O
down	O
from	O
the	O
rocks	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
,	O
had	O
they	O
had	O
time	O
,	O
they	O
should	O
have	O
found	O
much	O
more	O
,	O
the	O
water	O
being	O
quite	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
nobody	O
having	O
been	O
there	O
since	O
the	O
last	O
hard	O
rain	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
had	O
three	O
small	O
bits	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
also	O
.	O

I	O
said	O
nothing	O
for	O
the	O
present	O
,	O
but	O
charged	O
my	O
midshipmen	O
to	O
mark	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
we	O
went	O
on	O
.	O

We	O
followed	O
up	O
the	O
stream	O
of	O
this	O
water	O
for	O
three	O
days	O
more	O
,	O
encamping	O
every	O
night	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
time	O
we	O
passed	O
by	O
several	O
such	O
openings	O
into	O
the	O
rocks	O
on	O
either	O
side	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
fourth	O
day	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
prospect	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
pleasant	O
valley	O
and	O
river	O
below	O
us	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
,	O
keeping	O
its	O
course	O
almost	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
;	O
the	O
valley	O
reaching	O
near	O
four	O
miles	O
in	O
length	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
some	O
places	O
near	O
two	O
miles	O
broad	O
.	O

This	O
sight	O
was	O
perfectly	O
surprising	O
,	O
because	O
here	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
vale	O
fruitful	O
,	O
level	O
,	O
and	O
inhabited	O
,	O
there	O
being	O
several	O
small	O
villages	O
or	O
clusters	O
of	O
houses	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
the	O
Chilians	O
live	O
in	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
low	O
houses	O
,	O
covered	O
with	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
sedge	O
,	O
and	O
sheltered	O
with	O
little	O
rows	O
of	O
thick	O
grown	O
trees	O
,	O
but	O
of	O
what	O
kind	O
we	O
knew	O
not	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
no	O
way	O
through	O
the	O
valley	O
,	O
nor	O
which	O
way	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
go	O
out	O
,	O
but	O
perceived	O
it	O
everywhere	O
bounded	O
with	O
prodigious	O
mountains	O
,	O
look	O
to	O
which	O
side	O
of	O
it	O
we	O
would	O
.	O

We	O
kept	O
still	O
on	O
the	O
right	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
now	O
the	O
south-east	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
followed	O
it	O
up	O
the	O
stream	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
still	O
less	O
than	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
lessened	O
every	O
step	O
we	O
went	O
,	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
rills	O
we	O
left	O
behind	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
here	O
we	O
encamped	O
the	O
fifth	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
this	O
time	O
the	O
Spanish	O
gentleman	O
victualled	O
us	O
;	O
then	O
we	O
turned	O
again	O
to	O
the	O
right	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
new	O
and	O
beautiful	O
prospect	O
of	O
another	O
valley	O
,	O
as	O
broad	O
as	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
above	O
a	O
mile	O
in	O
length	O
.	O

After	O
we	O
had	O
passed	O
through	O
this	O
valley	O
,	O
my	O
patron	O
rode	O
up	O
to	O
a	O
poor	O
cottage	O
of	O
a	O
Chilian	O
Indian	O
without	O
any	O
ceremony	O
,	O
and	O
calling	O
us	O
all	O
about	O
him	O
,	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
there	O
we	O
would	O
go	O
to	O
dinner	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
a	O
smoke	O
indeed	O
_	O
in	O
_	O
the	O
house	O
,	O
rather	O
than	O
coming	O
_	O
out	O
_	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
little	O
that	O
did	O
,	O
smothered	O
through	O
a	O
hole	O
in	O
the	O
roof	O
instead	O
of	O
a	O
chimney	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
to	O
this	O
house	O
,	O
as	O
an	O
inn	O
,	O
my	O
patron	O
had	O
sent	O
away	O
his	O
major-domo	O
and	O
another	O
servant	O
;	O
and	O
there	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
as	O
busy	O
as	O
two	O
professed	O
cooks	O
,	O
boiling	O
and	O
stewing	O
goats	O
'	O
flesh	O
and	O
fowls	O
,	O
making	O
up	O
soups	O
,	O
broths	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
messes	O
,	O
which	O
it	O
seems	O
they	O
were	O
used	O
to	O
provide	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
homely	O
the	O
cottage	O
was	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
very	O
savoury	O
and	O
good	O
.	O

Immediately	O
a	O
loose	O
tent	O
was	O
pitched	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
our	O
table	O
set	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
dinner	O
served	O
in	O
;	O
and	O
afterwards	O
,	O
having	O
reposed	O
ourselves	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
the	O
custom	O
there	O
is	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
ready	O
to	O
travel	O
again	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
leisure	O
all	O
this	O
while	O
to	O
observe	O
and	O
wonder	O
at	O
the	O
admirable	O
structure	O
of	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
which	O
may	O
serve	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
eighth	O
wonder	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
;	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
supposing	O
there	O
were	O
but	O
seven	O
before	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
a	O
very	O
hot	O
sun	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
reflection	O
from	O
the	O
mountains	O
made	O
it	O
still	O
hotter	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
height	O
of	O
the	O
rocks	O
on	O
every	O
side	O
began	O
to	O
cast	O
long	O
shadows	O
before	O
three	O
o'clock	O
,	O
except	O
where	O
the	O
openings	O
looked	O
towards	O
the	O
west	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
those	O
shadows	O
reached	O
us	O
,	O
the	O
cool	O
breezes	O
of	O
the	O
air	O
came	O
naturally	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
our	O
way	O
exceeding	O
pleasant	O
and	O
refreshing	O
.	O

The	O
place	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
was	O
green	O
and	O
flourishing	O
,	O
and	O

pleased	O
with	O
their	O
liberty	O
from	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
Spaniards	O

who	O
very	O

when	O

and	O
then	O
they	O
used	O
the	O
Chilians	O
always	O

because	O

were	O

them	O
for	O

the	O

of	O
those	O

By	O

of	O
the	O

The	O

at	O

with	O
us	O

and	O
he	O
hearing	O
my	O

say	O
thus	O

ran	O
presently	O
to	O
the	O
hollow	O
channel	O
in	O

where	O
there	O
was	O
a	O

which	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
by	O

perhaps	O
two	O

three	O
feet	O

had	O
made	O

which	O

though	O
there	O
was	O
no	O

had	O
water	O
in	O

with	O

two	O
of	O
the	O
servants	O
and	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
scoop	O
,	O
he	O
presently	O
threw	O
out	O
the	O

with	O
the	O

whatever	O

away	O
;	O
and	O
among	O
that	O
which	O
remained	O

we	O
might	O
plainly	O
see	O
little	O
lumps	O
of	O
gold	O
shining	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
grains	O
of	O
sand	O

and	O
sometimes	O
one	O

two	O
a	O
little	O

This	O
was	O
demonstration	O
enough	O
to	O
us	O

I	O
took	O
up	O
some	O
small	O

about	O
the	O
quantity	O
of	O
half	O
a	O

left	O
my	O

to	O
take	O
up	O
more	O

and	O
they	O
stayed	O
indeed	O
so	O
long	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
scarce	O
see	O
their	O
way	O
to	O
overtake	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
away	O
about	O
two	O
ounces	O
in	O
all	O
,	O
the	O
Chilian	O
and	O
the	O
servants	O
freely	O
giving	O
them	O
all	O
they	O
found	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
travelled	O
about	O
nine	O
miles	O
more	O
in	O
this	O
winding	O
frightful	O
narrow	O
way	O
,	O
it	O
began	O
to	O
grow	O
towards	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
patron	O
talked	O
of	O
taking	O
up	O
our	O
quarters	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
before	O
;	O
but	O
his	O
gentleman	O
put	O
him	O
in	O
a	O
mind	O
of	O
a	O
Chilian	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
old	O
servants	O
,	O
who	O
lived	O
in	O
a	O
turning	O
among	O
the	O
mountains	O
,	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
we	O
might	O
be	O
accommodated	O
with	O
a	O
house	O
,	O
or	O
place	O
at	O
least	O
,	O
for	O
our	O
cookery	O
.	O

Very	O
true	O
,	O
says	O
our	O
patron	O
,	O
we	O
will	O
go	O
thither	O
;	O
and	O
there	O
,	O
seignior	O
,	O
says	O
he	O
,	O
turning	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
you	O
shall	O
see	O
an	O
emblem	O
of	O
complete	O
felicity	O
,	O
even	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
this	O
seat	O
of	O
horror	O
;	O
and	O
you	O
shall	O
see	O
a	O
prince	O
greater	O
,	O
and	O
more	O
truly	O
so	O
,	O
than	O
King	O
Philip	O
,	O
who	O
is	O
the	O
greatest	O
man	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
we	O
went	O
softly	O
on	O
,	O
his	O
gentleman	O
having	O
advanced	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
turning	O
or	O
opening	O
on	O
our	O
left	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
beheld	O
a	O
deep	O
large	O
valley	O
,	O
almost	O
circular	O
,	O
and	O
of	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
diameter	O
,	O
and	O
abundance	O
of	O
houses	O
or	O
cottages	O
interspersed	O
all	O
over	O
it	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
whole	O
valley	O
looked	O
like	O
an	O
inhabited	O
village	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
ground	O
like	O
a	O
planted	O
garden	O
.	O

We	O
who	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
for	O
some	O
miles	O
ascending	O
,	O
were	O
so	O
high	O
above	O
the	O
valley	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
looked	O
as	O
the	O
lowlands	O
in	O
England	PNM
do	O
below	O
Box	O
Hill	O
in	O
Surrey	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
ask	O
how	O
we	O
should	O
get	O
down	O
?	O

but	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
come	O
into	O
a	O
wider	O
space	O
than	O
before	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
had	O
more	O
daylight	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
the	O
hollow	O
way	O
had	O
rendered	O
it	O
near	O
dusk	O
before	O
,	O
now	O
it	O
was	O
almost	O
clear	O
day	O
again	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
parted	O
with	O
the	O
first	O
Chilian	O
that	O
I	O
mentioned	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
ordered	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
midshipmen	O
to	O
give	O
him	O
a	O
hat	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
black	O
baize	O
,	O
enough	O
to	O
make	O
him	O
a	O
cloak	O
,	O
which	O
so	O
obliged	O
the	O
man	O
that	O
he	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
way	O
to	O
testify	O
his	O
joy	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
knew	O
what	O
I	O
was	O
doing	O
in	O
this	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
ordered	O
my	O
midshipman	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
make	O
his	O
acquaintance	O
with	O
him	O
against	O
another	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
gift	O
ill	O
bestowed	O
,	O
as	O
will	O
appear	O
in	O
its	O
place	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
now	O
obliged	O
to	O
quit	O
our	O
mules	O
,	O
who	O
all	O
took	O
up	O
their	O
quarters	O
at	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
,	O
while	O
we	O
,	O
by	O
footings	O
made	O
in	O
the	O
rocks	O
,	O
descended	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
might	O
say	O
,	O
down	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
stairs	O
of	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
long	O
,	O
but	O
with	O
many	O
plain	O
places	O
between	O
,	O
like	O
foot-paces	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
ease	O
of	O
going	O
and	O
coming	O
.	O

Thus	O
,	O
winding	O
and	O
turning	O
to	O
avoid	O
the	O
declivity	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
very	O
safe	O
to	O
the	O
bottom	O
,	O
where	O
my	O
patron	O
's	O
gentleman	O
brought	O
our	O
new	O
landlord	O
,	O
that	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
,	O
who	O
came	O
to	O
pay	O
his	O
compliments	O
to	O
us	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
dressed	O
in	O
a	O
jerkin	O
made	O
of	O
otter-skin	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
doublet	O
,	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
long	O
Spanish	O
breeches	O
,	O
of	O
leather	O
dressed	O
after	O
the	O
Spanish	O
fashion	O
,	O
green	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
soft	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
looked	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
but	O
what	O
the	O
skin	O
was	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
guess	O
;	O
he	O
had	O
over	O
it	O
a	O
mantle	O
of	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
cotton	O
,	O
dyed	O
in	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
grave	O
brown	O
colours	O
,	O
and	O
thrown	O
about	O
him	O
like	O
a	O
Scotsman	O
's	O
plaid	O
;	O
he	O
had	O
shoes	O
of	O
a	O
particular	O
make	O
,	O
tied	O
on	O
like	O
sandals	O
,	O
flat-heeled	O
,	O
no	O
stockings	O
,	O
his	O
breeches	O
hanging	O
down	O
below	O
the	O
calf	O
of	O
his	O
leg	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
shoes	O
lacing	O
up	O
above	O
his	O
ancles	O

He	O
had	O
on	O
a	O
cap	O
of	O
the	O
skin	O
of	O
some	O
small	O
beast	O
like	O
a	O
racoon	O

with	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
the	O
tail	O
hanging	O
out	O
from	O
the	O
crown	O
of	O
his	O
head	O
backward	O
,	O
a	O
long	O
pole	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
servant	O
,	O
as	O
oddly	O
dressed	O
as	O
himself	O
,	O
carried	O
his	O
gun	O
;	O
he	O
had	O
neither	O
spado	O
nor	O

When	O
our	O
patron	O
came	O
up	O
,	O
the	O
Chilian	O
stepped	O
forward	O
and	O
made	O
him	O
three	O
very	O
low	O
bows	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
they	O
talked	O
together	O
,	O
not	O
in	O

but	O
in	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
mountain	O
jargon	O

some	O

scarce	O
understood	O
one	O

After	O
a	O
few	O
words	O

I	O
understood	O
he	O
said	O
something	O
of	O
a	O
stranger	O
come	O

then	O
,	O
I	O
supposed	O

the	O

then	O
the	O
Chilian	O
came	O
towards	O
me	O

made	O
me	O
three	O
bows	O

bade	O
me	O
welcome	O
in	O

As	O

he	O

his	O
barbarian	O

I	O

his	O

for	O
he	O
was	O
as	O

I	O
saw	O
,	O
and	O
taking	O
his	O

from	O
him	O
presented	O
it	O
to	O
me	O

My	O
patron	O
bade	O
me	O
take	O
it	O

for	O
he	O
saw	O
me	O
at	O
a	O
loss	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
telling	O
me	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
greatest	O
compliment	O
that	O
a	O
Chilian	O
could	O
pay	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
he	O
would	O
be	O
very	O

out	O

if	O
it	O
was	O

would	O
think	O
we	O

more	O

Our	O

set	O
up	O
their	O
tents	O

abroad	O
as	O
before	O

but	O
my	O

told	O
me	O
the	O
Chilian	O
would	O
take	O
it	O
very	O
ill	O
if	O
he	O

I	O

up	O

we	O

in	O

The	O
mattress	O

had	O
a	O

and	O
which	O
came	O
round	O

so	O
that	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
in	O

it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
a	O

The	O

such	O
as	O
it	O
was	O

might	O
be	O
nearly	O
as	O
hard	O

and	O
the	O
covering	O
was	O
of	O
the	O

as	O
the	O

which	O

it	O
seems	O

is	O
the	O
manufacture	O
of	O
the	O
Chilian	O
women	O

and	O
is	O
made	O
very	O
dexterously	O
;	O
it	O
looked	O
wild	O

agreeably	O
enough	O

and	O
proper	O
to	O

so	O
I	O
slept	O
very	O

in	O
it	O

But	O
,	O
I	O
must	O
confess	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
surprised	O
at	O
the	O
aspect	O
of	O
things	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
here	O

It	O
was	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
told	O
you	O
above	O

near	O
night	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
this	O
man	O

cottage	O

palace	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
called	O
it	O
-RRB-	O

and	O
,	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
taking	O
our	O
repast	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
very	O
good	O
,	O
it	O
grew	O
quite	O
night	O

We	O
had	O
wax	O
candles	O
brought	O
in	O
to	O
accommodate	O
us	O
with	O
light	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
my	O
patron	O
's	O
man	O
had	O
provided	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
place	O
had	O
so	O
little	O
communication	O
with	O
the	O

by	O
windows	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
saw	O
nothing	O

was	O
without	O

After	O
supper	O
my	O

turned	O
to	O

Come	O

is	O

this	O

I	O

But	O
you	O
will	O
presently	O

when	O
I	O

you	O
that	O

when	O
we	O

Soon	O
after	O
this	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
servants	O
opened	O
the	O

that	O
went	O
into	O
the	O

the	O
door	O

What	O

You	O

I	O

then	O
he	O

on	O

the	O

When	O
first	O
we	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
long	O
narrow	O
way	O
I	O
mentioned	O
last	O
,	O
I	O
observed	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
blew	O
very	O
hard	O
aloft	O
among	O
the	O
hills	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
made	O
a	O
noise	O
like	O
thunder	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
thought	O
nothing	O
of	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
a	O
thing	O
usual	O

But	O
now	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
this	O
terrible	O
sight	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
heard	O
the	O
same	O
thunder	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
found	O
the	O
air	O
calm	O
and	O
quiet	O
,	O
I	O
soon	O
understood	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
continued	O
thunder	O
,	O
occasioned	O
by	O
the	O
roaring	O
of	O
the	O
fire	O
in	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

It	O
must	O
be	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
as	O
may	O
be	O
supposed	O
,	O
before	O
a	O
traveller	O
,	O
unacquainted	O
with	O
such	O
things	O
,	O
could	O
make	O
them	O
familiar	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
the	O
horror	O
and	O
surprise	O
might	O
abate	O
,	O
after	O
proper	O
reflections	O
on	O
the	O
nature	O
and	O
reason	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
astonishment	O
upon	O
me	O
for	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
;	O
every	O
different	O
place	O
to	O
which	O
I	O
turned	O
my	O
eye	O
presented	O
me	O
with	O
a	O
new	O
scene	O
of	O
horror	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
frighted	O
at	O
the	O
fire	O
being	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
over	O
my	O
head	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
could	O
see	O
nothing	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
air	O
looked	O
as	O
if	O
it	O
were	O
all	O
on	O
fire	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
persuade	O
myself	O
but	O
it	O
would	O
cast	O
down	O
the	O
rocks	O
and	O
mountains	O
on	O
my	O
head	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
laughed	O
out	O
of	O
that	O
notion	O
by	O
the	O
company	O
.	O

After	O
a	O
while	O
,	O
I	O
asked	O
them	O
if	O
these	O
volcanoes	O
did	O
not	O
cast	O
out	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
liquid	O
fire	O

as	O
I	O
had	O

an	O

Mount-Ætna	PNM
,	O
which	O
cast	O
out	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
are	O
told	O
,	O
a	O
prodigious	O
stream	O
of	O
fire	O

and	O
run	O
several	O
leagues	O
into	O

Upon	O
my	O
putting	O
this	O
question	O
to	O
my	O
patron	O
,	O
he	O
asked	O
the	O
Chilian	O
how	O
long	O
ago	O
it	O
was	O
since	O
such	O
a	O
stream	O
,	O
calling	O
it	O
by	O
a	O
name	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
,	O
ran	O
fire	O
?	O

He	O
answered	O
,	O
it	O
ran	O
now	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
disposed	O
to	O
walk	O
but	O
three	O
furlongs	O
we	O
should	O
see	O
it	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
little	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
but	O
asked	O
me	O
if	O
I	O
cared	O
to	O
walk	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
by	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
light	O
?	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
surprising	O
place	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
supposed	O
he	O
would	O
lead	O
me	O
into	O
no	O
danger	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
he	O
would	O
assure	O
me	O
he	O
would	O
lead	O
me	O
into	O
no	O
danger	O
;	O
that	O
these	O
things	O
were	O
very	O
familiar	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
depend	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
hazard	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
flames	O
which	O
gave	O
all	O
this	O
light	O
were	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
miles	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
more	O
.	O

We	O
walked	O
along	O
the	O
plain	O
of	O
the	O
valley	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
,	O
when	O
another	O
great	O
valley	O
opened	O
to	O
the	O
right	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
us	O
a	O
more	O
dreadful	O
prospect	O
than	O
any	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
before	O
;	O
for	O
at	O
the	O
farther	O
end	O
of	O
this	O
second	O
valley	O
,	O
but	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
three	O
miles	O
from	O
where	O
we	O
stood	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
livid	O
stream	O
of	O
fire	O
come	O
running	O
down	O
the	O
sides	O
of	O
the	O
mountain	O
for	O
near	O
three	O
quarters	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
in	O
length	O
,	O
running	O
like	O
melted	O
metal	O
into	O
a	O
mould	O
,	O
until	O
,	O
I	O
supposed	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
came	O
nearer	O
the	O
bottom	O
,	O
it	O
cooled	O
and	O
separated	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
went	O
out	O
of	O
itself	O
.	O

Beyond	O
this	O
,	O
over	O
the	O
summit	O
of	O
a	O
prodigious	O
mountain	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
see	O
the	O
tops	O
of	O
the	O
clear	O
flame	O
of	O
a	O
volcano	O
,	O
a	O
dreadful	O
one	O
,	O
no	O
doubt	O
,	O
could	O
we	O
have	O
seen	O
it	O
all	O
;	O
and	O
from	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
which	O
it	O
was	O
supposed	O
this	O
stream	O
of	O
fire	O
came	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
Chilian	O
assured	O
us	O
that	O
the	O
fire	O
itself	O
was	O
eight	O
leagues	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
liquid	O
fire	O
which	O
we	O
saw	O
came	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
mountain	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
two	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
great	O
volcano	O
itself	O
,	O
running	O
like	O
liquid	O
metal	O
out	O
of	O
a	O
furnace	O
.	O

They	O
told	O
me	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
melted	O
gold	O
ran	O
down	O
with	O
the	O
other	O
inflamed	O
earth	O
in	O
that	O
stream	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
much	O
of	O
the	O
metal	O
was	O
afterwards	O
found	O
there	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
I	O
was	O
to	O
take	O
upon	O
trust	O
.	O

The	O
sight	O
,	O
as	O
will	O
easily	O
be	O
supposed	O
,	O
was	O
best	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
enough	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

As	O
for	O
my	O
two	O
midshipmen	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
almost	O
frightened	O
out	O
of	O
all	O
their	O
resolutions	O
of	O
going	O
any	O
farther	O
in	O
this	O
horrible	O
place	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
we	O
stopped	O
they	O
came	O
mighty	O
seriously	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
begged	O
,	O
for	O
God	O
's	O
sake	O
,	O
not	O
to	O
venture	O
any	O
farther	O
upon	O
the	O
faith	O
of	O
these	O
Spaniards	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
certainly	O
carry	O
us	O
all	O
into	O
some	O
mischief	O
or	O
other	O
,	O
and	O
betray	O
us	O
.	O

I	O
bade	O
them	O
be	O
easy	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
saw	O
nothing	O
in	O
it	O
all	O
that	O
looked	O
like	O
treachery	O
;	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
true	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
terrible	O
place	O
to	O
look	O
on	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
what	O
was	O
natural	O
and	O
familiar	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
soon	O
out	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

They	O
told	O
me	O
very	O
seriously	O
that	O
they	O
believed	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
hell	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
bear	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
entreated	O
me	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
them	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
think	O
of	O
that	O
,	O
but	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
endure	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
give	O
consent	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
go	O
back	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
for	O
the	O
present	O
to	O
the	O
Chilian	O
's	O
house	O
again	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
got	O
a	O
plentiful	O
draught	O
of	O
Chilian	O
wine	O
,	O
for	O
my	O
patron	O
had	O
taken	O
care	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
good	O
quantity	O
of	O
it	O
with	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
my	O
two	O
midshipmen	O
,	O
who	O
got	O
very	O
drunk	O
over	O
night	O
,	O
had	O
courage	O
enough	O
to	O
venture	O
forward	O
again	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
light	O
of	O
the	O
sun	O
put	O
quite	O
another	O
face	O
upon	O
things	O
,	O
and	O
nothing	O
of	O
the	O
fire	O
was	O
then	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
,	O
only	O
the	O
smoke	O
.	O

All	O
our	O
company	O
lodged	O
in	O
the	O
tents	O
here	O
,	O
but	O
myself	O
and	O
my	O
patron	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
,	O
who	O
lodged	O
within	O
the	O
Chilian	O
's	O
house	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
.	O

This	O
Chilian	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
man	O
among	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
valley	O
I	O
spoke	O
of	O
,	O
which	O
lay	O
round	O
his	O
dwelling	O
,	O
was	O
called	O
his	O
own	O
.	O

He	O
lived	O
in	O
a	O
perfect	O
state	O
of	O
tranquility	O
,	O
neither	O
enjoying	O
or	O
coveting	O
anything	O
but	O
what	O
was	O
necessary	O
,	O
and	O
wanting	O
nothing	O
that	O
was	O
so	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
gold	O
merely	O
for	O
the	O
trouble	O
of	O
picking	O
it	O
up	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
found	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
little	O
gulleys	O
and	O
rills	O
of	O
water	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
came	O
down	O
from	O
the	O
mountains	O
on	O
every	O
side	O
;	O
yet	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
find	O
that	O
he	O
troubled	O
himself	O
to	O
lay	O
up	O
any	O
great	O
quantity	O
,	O
more	O
than	O
served	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
Villa	PNM
Rica	PNM
and	O
buy	O
what	O
he	O
wanted	O
for	O
himself	O
and	O
family	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
a	O
wife	O
and	O
some	O
daughters	O
,	O
but	O
no	O
sons	O
;	O
these	O
lived	O
in	O
a	O
separate	O
house	O
,	O
about	O
a	O
furlong	O
from	O
that	O
where	O
he	O
lived	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
kept	O
there	O
as	O
a	O
family	O
by	O
themselves	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
any	O
sons	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
lived	O
with	O
him	O
.	O

He	O
did	O
not	O
offer	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
us	O
any	O
part	O
of	O
our	O
way	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
other	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
having	O
entertained	O
us	O
with	O
great	O
civility	O
,	O
took	O
his	O
leave	O
.	O

I	O
caused	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
midshipmen	O
to	O
make	O
him	O
a	O
present	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
away	O
,	O
of	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
black	O
baize	O
,	O
enough	O
to	O
make	O
him	O
a	O
cloak	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
did	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
blue	O
English	O
serge	O
,	O
enough	O
to	O
make	O
him	O
a	O
jerkin	O
and	O
breeches	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
accepted	O
as	O
a	O
great	O
bounty	O
.	O

We	O
set	O
out	O
again	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
very	O
early	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
having	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
sat	O
up	O
late	O
,	O
and	O
drank	O
freely	O
over	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
,	O
that	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
gone	O
to	O
sleep	O
it	O
had	O
rained	O
very	O
hard	O
,	O
and	O
though	O
the	O
rain	O
was	O
over	O
before	O
we	O
went	O
out	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
falling	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
from	O
the	O
hills	O
made	O
such	O
a	O
confused	O
noise	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
echoed	O
so	O
backward	O
and	O
forward	O
from	O
all	O
sides	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
like	O
a	O
strange	O
mixture	O
of	O
distant	O
thunder	O
,	O
and	O
though	O
we	O
knew	O
the	O
causes	O
,	O
yet	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
but	O
be	O
surprising	O
to	O
us	O
for	O
awhile	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
set	O
forward	O
,	O
the	O
way	O
under	O
foot	O
being	O
pretty	O
good	O
;	O
and	O
first	O
he	O
went	O
up	O
the	O
steps	O
again	O
by	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
come	O
down	O
,	O
our	O
last	O
host	O
waiting	O
on	O
us	O
thither	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
I	O
gave	O
him	O
back	O
his	O
gun	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
take	O
it	O
before	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
valley	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
pleasantest	O
by	O
day	O
and	O
the	O
most	O
dismal	O
by	O
night	O
that	O
ever	O
I	O
saw	O
,	O
I	O
observed	O
abundance	O
of	O
goats	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
tame	O
in	O
the	O
enclosures	O
,	O
as	O
wild	O
upon	O
the	O
rocks	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
found	O
afterwards	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
last	O
were	O
perfectly	O
wild	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
be	O
had	O
,	O
like	O
those	O
at	O
Juan	PNM
Fernandez	PNM
,	O
by	O
any	O
one	O
who	O
could	O
catch	O
them	O
.	O

My	O
patron	O
sent	O
off	O
two	O
of	O
his	O
men	O
,	O
just	O
as	O
a	O
huntsman	O
casts	O
off	O
his	O
hounds	O
,	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
catch	O
goats	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
brought	O
us	O
in	O
three	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
shot	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
and	O
these	O
we	O
carried	O
with	O
us	O
for	O
our	O
evening	O
supply	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
made	O
no	O
dinner	O
this	O
day	O
,	O
having	O
fed	O
heartily	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
about	O
nine	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
chocolate	O
two	O
hours	O
before	O
that	O
.	O

We	O
travelled	O
now	O
along	O
the	O
narrow	O
winding	O
passage	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
mentioned	O
before	O
,	O
for	O
about	O
four	O
hours	O
,	O
until	O
I	O
found	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
ascended	O
but	O
gently	O
,	O
yet	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
done	O
so	O
for	O
almost	O
twenty	O
miles	O
together	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
got	O
up	O
to	O
a	O
frightful	O
height	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
expect	O
some	O
very	O
difficult	O
descent	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
were	O
made	O
easy	O
about	O
two	O
o'clock	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
way	O
not	O
only	O
declined	O
again	O
to	O
the	O
east	O
,	O
but	O
grew	O
wider	O
,	O
though	O
with	O
frequent	O
turnings	O
and	O
windings	O
about	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
seldom	O
see	O
above	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
before	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
went	O
on	O
thus	O
pretty	O
much	O
on	O
a	O
level	O
,	O
now	O
rising	O
,	O
now	O
falling	O
;	O
but	O
still	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
height	O
from	O
our	O
first	O
entrance	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
running	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
it	O
flowed	O
neither	O
east	O
nor	O
west	O
,	O
but	O
ran	O
all	O
down	O
the	O
little	O
turnings	O
that	O
we	O
frequently	O
met	O
with	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
of	O
our	O
way	O
,	O
which	O
my	O
patron	O
told	O
me	O
fell	O
all	O
into	O
the	O
great	O
valley	O
where	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
fire	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
passed	O
off	O
by	O
a	O
general	O
channel	O
north-west	O
,	O
until	O
it	O
found	O
its	O
way	O
out	O
into	O
the	O
open	O
country	O
of	O
Chili	PNM
,	O
and	O
so	O
to	O
the	O

we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
take	O
up	O
with	O
on	O
the	O
green	O

as	O
we	O
did	O
the	O
first	O

,	O
by	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
our	O
proveditor-general	O
,	O
my	O
patron	O
,	O
we	O
fared	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
our	O
goat	O

flesh	O
being	O
reduced	O
into	O
so	O
many	O
sorts	O
of	O
venison	O

that	O
none	O
of	O
us	O
could	O
distinguish	O
it	O
from	O
the	O
best	O
venison	O
we	O
ever	O
tasted	O

Here	O
we	O
slept	O
without	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
frightful	O
things	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
night	O
before	O

that	O

in	O

at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O

in	O

that	O
gave	O
us	O
no	O
disturbance	O
at	O

In	O
the	O
morning	O
our	O
two	O
hunters	O
shot	O
a	O
deer	O

or	O
rather	O
a	O
young	O

before	O
we	O
were	O
awake	O

this	O

the	O
first	O

met	O
with	O
in	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
our	O
travel	O

and	O
thus	O
we	O
were	O
provided	O
for	O
dinner	O
even	O
before	O
breakfast-time	O
;	O
as	O
for	O
our	O
breakfast	O

it	O
was	O
always	O
a	O

that	O
is	O

We	O
set	O
out	O
very	O
merrily	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
that	O
were	O
Englishmen	O
could	O
not	O
refrain	O
smiling	O
at	O
one	O

to	O

lay	O
in	O

as	O
we	O

never	O

We	O
travelled	O
this	O
day	O
pretty	O
smartly	O
,	O
having	O
rested	O
at	O
noon	O
about	O
two	O
hours	O
,	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
by	O
my	O
calculation	O
,	O
went	O
about	O
twenty-two	O
English	O
miles	O
in	O
all	O
.	O

About	O
five	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
into	O
a	O
broad	O
,	O
plain	O
open	O
place	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
properly	O
a	O
valley	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
lay	O
very	O
level	O
for	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
together	O
,	O
our	O
way	O
lying	O
almost	O
east-south-east	O

After	O
we	O
had	O
marched	O
so	O
about	O
two	O
miles	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
the	O
way	O
go	O
evidently	O
down	O
hill	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
more	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
singular	O
satisfaction	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
water	O
from	O
the	O
mountains	O
ran	O
plainly	O
eastward	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
consequently	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
North	PNM
Sea	PNM
.	O

We	O
saw	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
several	O
huts	O
or	O
houses	O
of	O
the	O
mountaineer	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
but	O
went	O
near	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
kept	O
on	O
our	O
way	O
,	O
going	O
down	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
pretty	O
steep	O
places	O
,	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
dangerous	O
,	O
though	O
something	O
difficult	O

We	O
encamped	O
again	O
the	O
next	O
night	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
still	O
our	O
good	O
caterer	O
had	O
plenty	O
of	O
food	O
for	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
observed	O
that	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
set	O
forward	O
,	O
our	O
tents	O
were	O
left	O
standing	O

the	O
baggage	O
mules	O
tied	O
together	O

and	O
our	O

lessened	O

,	O
which	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
inquired	O
about	O

he	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
hoped	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
good	O
quarters	O
quickly	O
without	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
him	O
for	O
the	O
present	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
unriddled	O
itself	O
soon	O
after	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
travelled	O
four	O
days	O
more	O
in	O
that	O
narrow	O
way	O
,	O
yet	O
he	O
always	O
found	O
us	O
lodging	O
at	O
the	O
cottages	O
of	O
the	O
mountaineers	O

The	O
sixth	O
day	O
we	O
went	O
all	O

up	O
hill	O
;	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
,	O
the	O

turned	O
short	O

a	O
vast	O
wide	O
country	O
,	O
boundless	O
to	O
the	O
eye	O

delivered	O
us	O
entirely	O
from	O

in	O
which	O
we	O
had	O

so	O

Any	O
one	O
may	O
guess	O
what	O
an	O

this	O
was	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
to	O
whom	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
main	O

of	O
our	O

We	O
made	O
no	O

the	O

extending	O
to	O
the	O

this	O
our	O

could	O
not	O
tell	O
us	O
one	O
word	O
of	O

owning	O
frankly	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
never	O
been	O
one	O
step	O
farther	O
than	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
then	O
stood	O

and	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
there	O
only	O
once	O
,	O
to	O
satisfy	O
his	O
curiosity	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
did	O
now	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
lived	O
where	O
he	O
did	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
servants	O
and	O
provisions	O
at	O

as	O
he	O
had	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
impossible	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
have	O
restrained	O
my	O
curiosity	O
so	O
far	O
as	O
not	O
to	O
have	O
searched	O
through	O
that	O
whole	O
country	O
to	O
the	O
sea-side	O
long	O
ago	O

I	O
also	O
told	O
him	O
it	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
pleasant	O
and	O
fruitful	O
soil	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
no	O
doubt	O
,	O
was	O
capable	O
of	O
cultivations	O
and	O
improvements	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
only	O
to	O
have	O
possessed	O
such	O
a	O
country	O
in	O
his	O
Catholic	O
majesty	O
's	O
name	O
,	O
it	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
worth	O
while	O
to	O
undertake	O
the	O
discovery	O
for	O
the	O
honour	O
of	O
Spain	PNM
;	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
could	O
be	O
no	O
room	O
to	O
question	O
but	O
his	O
Catholic	O
majesty	O
would	O
have	O
honoured	O
the	O
man	O
who	O
should	O
have	O
undertaken	O
such	O
a	O
thing	O
with	O
some	O
particular	O
mark	O
of	O

which	O
might	O
be	O
of	O
consequence	O
to	O
him	O
and	O
his	O
family	O

He	O
answered	O
me	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
that	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
seemed	O
already	O
to	O
have	O
more	O
dominions	O
in	O
America	PNM
than	O
they	O
could	O
keep	O
,	O
and	O
much	O
more	O
than	O
they	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
reap	O
the	O
benefit	O
of	O
,	O
and	O
still	O
more	O
infinitely	O
than	O
they	O
could	O
improve	O
,	O
and	O
especially	O
in	O
those	O
parts	O
called	O
South	PNM
America	PNM
.	O

And	O
he	O
,	O
moreover	O
,	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
next	O
to	O
a	O
miracle	O
they	O
could	O
keep	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
were	O
not	O
the	O
natives	O
so	O
utterly	O
destitute	O
of	O
support	O
from	O
any	O
other	O

as	O

to	O

either	O
arms	O
or	O
ammunition	O
put	O
into	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
impossible	O
,	O
since	O
I	O
might	O
easily	O
see	O
they	O
were	O
men	O
that	O
wanted	O
not	O
strength	O
of	O
body	O
or	O
courage	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
evident	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
want	O
numbers	O
,	O
seeing	O
they	O
were	O
already	O
ten	O

we	O

we	O
possess	O
there	O
with	O
a	O

men	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
for	O
two	O
reasons	O
:	O
First	O
,	O
We	O
are	O
possessed	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
daily	O
increasing	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
may	O
in	O

extend	O
ourselves	O
farther	O

The	O
great	O

Parana	PNM

we	O

to	O
put	O
ourselves	O
out	O
of	O
a	O
capacity	O
of	O

farther	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
we	O
keep	O
the	O
possession	O
.	O

Secondly	O
,	O
We	O
have	O
a	O
communication	O
from	O

with	O
Peru	PNM

The	O
great	O
river	O

out	O
of	O
the	O

,	O
in	O
Peru	PNM
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
trade	O
is	O
carried	O
on	O
by	O
that	O
river	O

and	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
dangerous	O
to	O
let	O
foreigners	O
into	O
the	O
secret	O
of	O
that	O
trade	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
might	O
entirely	O
cut	O
off	O
,	O
especially	O
when	O
they	O
should	O
find	O
how	O
small	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
Spaniards	O
are	O
planted	O
there	O
to	O
preserve	O
it	O
,	O
seeing	O
there	O
are	O
not	O
six	O
hundred	O
Spaniards	O
in	O
all	O
that	O

which	O
,	O
by	O
the	O

of	O
that	O

is	O
more	O
than	O
one	O
thousand	O
six	O
hundred	O
miles	O
in	O
length	O
.	O

I	O
confess	O
,	O
said	O
I	O
,	O
these	O
are	O
just	O
grounds	O
for	O
your	O
keeping	O
the	O
possession	O
of	O
that	O
river	O
.	O

They	O
are	O
so	O
,	O
said	O
he	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
more	O
because	O
of	O
so	O
powerful	O
a	O
colony	O
as	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
have	O
in	O
the	O
Brazils	PNM

which	O
bound	O

who	O

it	O
from	O
the	O

the	O

neither	O

that	O
if	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
rivers	O
went	O
away	O
towards	O
the	O
north	O

they	O
certainly	O
run	O
all	O
into	O
the	O
great	O
Rio	PNM

;	O
but	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
went	O
east	O

or	O
southerly	O
,	O
they	O
must	O
go	O
directly	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O

which	O
was	O
ordinarily	O
called	O

or	O

as	O
by	O

That	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
magnitude	O
of	O
those	O
rivers	O
he	O
could	O
say	O
little	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
reasonable	O
to	O
suppose	O
there	O
must	O
be	O
some	O
very	O
considerable	O
rivers	O
,	O
and	O
whose	O
streams	O
must	O
needs	O
be	O
capable	O
of	O
navigation	O
,	O
seeing	O
abundance	O
of	O
water	O
must	O
continually	O
flow	O
from	O
the	O
mountains	O
where	O
we	O
then	O
were	O
,	O
and	O
its	O
being	O
at	O
least	O
four	O
hundred	O
miles	O
from	O
the	O
sea-side	O
,	O
those	O
small	O
streams	O
must	O
necessarily	O
join	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
form	O
large	O
rivers	O
in	O
the	O
plain	O
country	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
enough	O
in	O
this	O
discourse	O
fully	O
to	O
satisfy	O
all	O
my	O
curiosity	O
,	O
and	O
sufficiently	O
to	O
heighten	O
my	O
desire	O
of	O
making	O
the	O
farther	O
discoveries	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
in	O
my	O
thoughts	O
.	O

We	O
pitched	O
our	O
little	O
camp	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
sat	O
down	O
to	O
our	O
repast	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
though	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
lodge	O
,	O
yet	O
my	O
patron	O
had	O
taken	O
care	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
furnished	O
sufficiently	O
for	O
dinner	O
,	O
and	O
have	O
a	O
good	O
house	O
to	O
eat	O
it	O
in	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
a	O
tent	O
as	O
before	O
.	O

The	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
stood	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
come	O
down	O
hill	O
for	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
,	O
yet	O
seemed	O
very	O
high	O
from	O
the	O
ordinary	O
surface	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
us	O
therefore	O
an	O
exceeding	O
fine	O
prospect	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
the	O
country	O
declining	O
gradually	O
for	O
near	O
ten	O
miles	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
thought	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
would	O
allow	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
great	O
river	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
learned	O
afterwards	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
rather	O
a	O
great	O
lake	O
than	O
a	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
supplied	O
by	O
the	O
smaller	O
rivers	O
,	O
or	O
rivulets	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
mountains	O
,	O
which	O
met	O
there	O
as	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
receptacle	O
of	O
waters	O
,	O
and	O
out	O
of	O
this	O
lake	O
they	O
all	O
issued	O
again	O
in	O
one	O
river	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
shall	O
have	O
occasion	O
to	O
give	O
a	O
farther	O
account	O
hereafter	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
were	O
at	O
dinner	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
my	O
midshipmen	O
to	O
take	O
their	O
observations	O
of	O
every	O
distant	O
object	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
everything	O
with	O
their	O
glasses	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
did	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
of	O
this	O
lake	O
;	O
but	O
my	O
patron	O
could	O
give	O
no	O
account	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
having	O
never	O
been	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
said	O
before	O
,	O
one	O
step	O
farther	O
that	O
way	O
than	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
my	O
men	O
showed	O
me	O
plainly	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
lake	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
went	O
a	O
large	O
river	O
from	O
it	O
towards	O
the	O
east-south-east	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
enough	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
way	O
lay	O
all	O
the	O
schemes	O
I	O
had	O
laid	O
.	O

I	O
took	O
this	O
opportunity	O
to	O
ask	O
my	O
midshipmen	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
taken	O
such	O
observations	O
in	O
their	O
passage	O
of	O
the	O
mountains	O
as	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
sure	O
they	O
could	O
find	O
their	O
way	O
through	O
to	O
this	O
place	O
again	O
without	O
guides	O
?	O

And	O
they	O
assured	O
me	O
they	O
could	O
.	O

Then	O
I	O
put	O
it	O
to	O
them	O
whether	O
they	O
thought	O
it	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
practicable	O
to	O
travel	O
over	O
that	O
vast	O
level	O
country	O
to	O
the	O
North	PNM
Seas	PNM
?	PNM

and	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
sufficient	O
discovery	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
so	O
as	O
that	O
hereafter	O
Englishmen	O
coming	O
to	O
the	O
coast	O
on	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
those	O
seas	O
,	O
might	O
penetrate	O
to	O
these	O
golden	O
mountains	O
,	O
and	O
reap	O
the	O
benefit	O
of	O
the	O
treasure	O
without	O
going	O
a	O
prodigious	O
length	O
above	O
Cape	PNM
Horn	PNM
and	O
the	O
Terra	PNM
del	PNM
Fuego	PNM
,	O
which	O
was	O
always	O
attended	O
with	O
innumerable	O
dangers	O
,	O
and	O
without	O
breaking	O
through	O
the	O
kingdom	O
of	O
Chili	PNM
and	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
'	O
settlements	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
soon	O
be	O
at	O
peace	O
with	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
be	O
shut	O
out	O
that	O
way	O
by	O
our	O
own	O
consents	O
?	O

One	O
of	O
my	O
men	O
began	O
to	O
speak	O
of	O
the	O
difficulties	O
of	O
such	O
an	O
attempt	O
,	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
provisions	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
dangers	O
which	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
exposed	O
to	O
on	O
the	O
way	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
a	O
bold	O
,	O
brisk	O
fellow	O
,	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
made	O
no	O
question	O
but	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
easily	O
done	O
,	O
and	O
especially	O
because	O
all	O
the	O
rivers	O
they	O
should	O
meet	O
with	O
would	O
,	O
of	O
course	O
,	O
run	O
along	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
sure	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
tide	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
called	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
he	O
added	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
be	O
content	O
to	O
be	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
men	O
who	O
should	O
undertake	O
it	O
,	O
provided	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
assured	O
that	O
the	O
ships	O
in	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
would	O
not	O
go	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
pretend	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
found	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
we	O
would	O
talk	O
farther	O
about	O
it	O
;	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
such	O
a	O
thought	O
in	O
my	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
strong	O
inclination	O
to	O
undertake	O
it	O
myself	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
answer	O
it	O
to	O
leave	O
the	O
ships	O
,	O
which	O
depended	O
so	O
much	O
upon	O
my	O
care	O
of	O
the	O
voyage	O
.	O

After	O
some	O
talk	O
of	O
the	O
reasonableness	O
of	O
such	O
an	O
undertaking	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
methods	O
of	O
performing	O
it	O
,	O
my	O
second	O
midshipman	O
began	O
to	O
come	O
into	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
practicable	O
enough	O
,	O
and	O
added	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
he	O
used	O
some	O
cautions	O
in	O
his	O
first	O
hearing	O
proposals	O
,	O
yet	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
undertook	O
that	O
enterprise	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
find	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
do	O
as	O
much	O
of	O
his	O
duty	O
in	O
it	O
as	O
another	O
man	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
he	O
did	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
as	O
will	O
appear	O
in	O
its	O
proper	O
place	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
,	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
preparing	O
to	O
be	O
satisfied	O
with	O
our	O
journey	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
patron	O
coming	O
to	O
me	O
and	O
asking	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
for	O
returning	O
,	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
say	O
how	O
many	O
days	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
before	O
I	O
should	O
say	O
I	O
had	O
enough	O
of	O
that	O
prospect	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
return	O
when	O
he	O
pleased	O
,	O
only	O
I	O
had	O
one	O
question	O
to	O
ask	O
him	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
,	O
whether	O
the	O
mountains	O
were	O
as	O
full	O
of	O
gold	O
on	O
this	O
side	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
on	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
Chili	PNM
?	O

As	O
to	O
that	O
,	O
seignior	O
,	O
says	O
he	O
,	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
to	O
be	O
certain	O
is	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
trial	O
,	O
that	O
you	O
may	O
be	O
sure	O
we	O
do	O
not	O
speak	O
without	O
proof	O
;	O
so	O
he	O
called	O
his	O
gentleman	O
,	O
and	O
another	O
servant	O
that	O
was	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
me	O
to	O
call	O
my	O
two	O
midshipmen	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
speaking	O
something	O
to	O
his	O
own	O
servants	O
first	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
language	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
supposed	O
,	O
he	O
turned	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
,	O
Come	O
,	O
let	O
us	O
sit	O
down	O
and	O
rest	O
ourselves	O
,	O
while	O
they	O
go	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
what	O
they	O
can	O
do	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
they	O
went	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
my	O
men	O
told	O
me	O
afterwards	O
,	O
they	O
searched	O
in	O
the	O
small	O
streams	O
of	O
water	O
which	O
they	O
found	O
running	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
some	O
larger	O
gulleys	O
or	O
channels	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
found	O
little	O
or	O
no	O
water	O
running	O
,	O
but	O
where	O
,	O
upon	O
hasty	O
rains	O
,	O
great	O
shoots	O
of	O
water	O
had	O
been	O
used	O
to	O
run	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
water	O
stood	O
still	O
in	O
the	O
holes	O
and	O
falls	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
described	O
once	O
before	O
on	O
the	O
like	O
occasion	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
gone	O
above	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
plainly	O
heard	O
my	O
two	O
Englishmen	O
halloo	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
could	O
easily	O
distinguish	O
from	O
the	O
voices	O
of	O
any	O
other	O
nation	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
I	O
ran	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
tent	O
,	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
followed	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
saw	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
midshipmen	O
running	O
towards	O
us	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
went	O
to	O
meet	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
what	O
with	O
hallooing	O
and	O
running	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
hardly	O
speak	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
recovering	O
his	O
breath	O
,	O
said	O
,	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
desire	O
me	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
behold	O
a	O
sight	O
which	O
I	O
never	O
saw	O
in	O
my	O
life	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
eager	O
enough	O
to	O
go	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
went	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
tent	O
to	O
my	O
patron	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Spanish	O
doctor	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
share	O
in	O
the	O
curiosity	O
;	O
he	O
did	O
so	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
followed	O
soon	O
after	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
such	O
a	O
wonder	O
as	O
indeed	O
I	O
never	O
saw	O
before	O
,	O
for	O
there	O
they	O
were	O
sitting	O
down	O
round	O
a	O
little	O
puddle	O
,	O
or	O
hole	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
might	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
rain	O
,	O
the	O
water	O
running	O
hastily	O
from	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
the	O
rock	O
,	O
about	O
two	O
foot	O
higher	O
than	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
had	O
made	O
a	O
pit	O
under	O
it	O
with	O
the	O
fall	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
tail	O
of	O
a	O
mill	O
,	O
only	O
much	O
less	O
.	O

Here	O
they	O
took	O
up	O
the	O
sand	O
or	O
gravel	O
with	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
every	O
handful	O
brought	O
up	O
with	O
it	O
such	O
a	O
quantity	O
of	O
gold	O
as	O
was	O
surprising	O
;	O
for	O
there	O
they	O
sat	O
picking	O
it	O
out	O
,	O
just	O
as	O
the	O
boys	O
in	O
London	PNM
,	O
who	O
go	O
with	O
a	O
broom	O
and	O
a	O
hat	O
,	O
pick	O
out	O
old	O
iron	O
,	O
nails	O

and	O
pins	O
from	O
the	O
channels	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
lay	O
as	O
thick	O
.	O

I	O
stood	O
and	O
looked	O
at	O
them	O
awhile	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
confessed	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
pleasant	O
sight	O
enough	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
reflecting	O
immediately	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
end	O
of	O
this	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
only	O
upon	O
the	O
enquiry	O
,	O
Come	O
away	O
,	O
said	O
I	O
,	O
laughing	O
to	O
my	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
do	O
not	O
stand	O
picking	O
up	O

all	O

;	O
do	O
you	O
know	O
how	O
far	O
we	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
our	O
lodgings	O
?	O

I	O
can	O
make	O
no	O
guess	O
what	O
quantity	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
found	O
here	O
in	O
places	O
which	O
had	O
,	O
for	O
hundreds	O
of	O
years	O
,	O
washed	O
gold	O
from	O
the	O
hills	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
never	O
had	O
a	O
man	O
come	O
to	O
pick	O
any	O
of	O
it	O
up	O
before	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
soon	O
satisfied	O
that	O
here	O
was	O
enough	O
,	O
even	O
to	O
make	O
all	O
the	O
world	O
say	O
they	O
had	O
enough	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
I	O
called	O
off	O
my	O
people	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
away	O
.	O

It	O
seems	O
,	O
the	O
quantity	O
of	O
gold	O
which	O
is	O
thus	O
washed	O
down	O
is	O
not	O
small	O
,	O
since	O
my	O
men	O
,	O
inquiring	O
afterwards	O
among	O
the	O
Chilians	O
,	O
heard	O
them	O
talk	O
of	O
the	O
great	O
lake	O
of	O
water	O
which	O
I	O
mentioned	O
just	O
now	O
that	O
we	O
saw	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
call	O
the	O
Golden	PNM
Lake	PNM
,	O
and	O
where	O
was	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
said	O
,	O
prodigious	O
quantities	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
not	O
that	O
our	O
men	O
supposed	O
any	O
gold	O
was	O
there	O
in	O
mines	O
,	O
or	O
in	O
the	O
ordinary	O
soil	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
waters	O
from	O
the	O
hills	O
,	O
running	O
with	O
very	O
rapid	O
currents	O
at	O
certain	O
times	O
in	O
the	O
rainy	O
seasons	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
the	O
melting	O
of	O
the	O
snows	O
,	O
had	O
carried	O
the	O
gold	O
so	O
far	O
as	O
that	O
lake	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
so	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
days	O
of	O
the	O
general	O
deluge	O
,	O
no	O
people	O
ever	O
applying	O
themselves	O
to	O
gather	O
the	O
least	O
grain	O
of	O
it	O
up	O
again	O
,	O
it	O
might	O
well	O
be	O
increased	O
to	O
such	O
a	O
quantity	O
as	O
might	O
entitle	O
that	O
water	O
to	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
the	O
Golden	O
Lake	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
little	O
streams	O
and	O
sluices	O
of	O
water	O
that	O
run	O
into	O
it	O

the	O

Rivers	PNM
,	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
Golden	PNM
Lake	PNM
.	O

But	O
my	O
present	O
business	O
was	O
to	O
know	O
only	O
if	O
the	O
gold	O
was	O
here	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
to	O
trouble	O
myself	O
to	O
pick	O
it	O
up	O
;	O
my	O
views	O
lay	O
another	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
end	O
was	O
fully	O
answered	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
came	O
back	O
to	O
my	O
patron	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
all	O
my	O
men	O
with	O
me	O
.	O

You	O
live	O
in	O
a	O
golden	O
country	O
,	O
seignior	O
,	O
says	O
I	O
;	O
my	O
men	O
are	O
stark	O
mad	O
to	O
see	O
so	O
much	O
gold	O
,	O
and	O
nobody	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
.	O

Should	O
the	O
world	O
know	O
what	O
treasure	O
you	O
have	O
here	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
answer	O
for	O
it	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
not	O
flock	O
hither	O
in	O
armies	O
,	O
and	O
drive	O
you	O
all	O
away	O
.	O

They	O
need	O
not	O
do	O
that	O
,	O
seignior	O
,	O
says	O
he	O
,	O
for	O
here	O
is	O
enough	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
us	O
too	O
.	O

We	O
now	O
packed	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
our	O
return	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
without	O
regret	O
that	O
I	O
turned	O
my	O
back	O
upon	O
this	O
pleasant	O
country	O
,	O
the	O
most	O
agreeable	O
place	O
of	O
its	O
kind	O
that	O
ever	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
in	O
all	O
my	O
life	O
,	O
or	O
ever	O
shall	O
be	O
in	O
again	O
,	O
a	O
country	O
rich	O
,	O
pleasant	O
,	O
fruitful	O
,	O
wholesome	O
,	O
and	O
capable	O
of	O
everything	O
for	O
the	O
life	O
of	O
man	O
that	O
the	O
heart	O
could	O
entertain	O
a	O
wish	O
for	O
.	O

But	O
my	O
present	O
work	O
was	O
to	O
return	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
mounted	O
our	O
mules	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
meantime	O
,	O
the	O
pleasure	O
of	O
contemplating	O
what	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
,	O
and	O
applying	O
ourselves	O
to	O
such	O
farther	O
measures	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
concerted	O
among	O
us	O
.	O

In	O
about	O
four	O
hours	O
we	O
returned	O
to	O
our	O
camp	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
called	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
no	O
little	O
pain	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
we	O
had	O
come	O
down	O
hill	O
easily	O
and	O
insensibly	O
to	O
the	O
opening	O
for	O
some	O
miles	O
,	O
yet	O
we	O
had	O
a	O
hard	O
pull	O
uphill	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
again	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
we	O
reached	O
to	O
our	O
tents	O
in	O
good	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
our	O
first	O
encampment	O
with	O
pleasure	O
enough	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
weary	O
with	O
the	O
fatigue	O
of	O
a	O
hard	O
day	O
's	O
journey	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
day	O
we	O
reached	O
our	O
good	O
Chilian	O
's	O
mansion-house	O
,	O
or	O
palace	O
,	O
for	O
such	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
called	O
,	O
considering	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
considering	O
the	O
entertainment	O
;	O
for	O
now	O
he	O
had	O
some	O
time	O
to	O
provide	O
for	O
us	O
,	O
knowing	O
we	O
would	O
come	O
back	O
again	O
.	O

He	O
met	O
us	O
with	O
three	O
mules	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
servants	O
,	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
before	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
descent	O
going	O
down	O
to	O
his	O
house	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
took	O
notice	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
he	O
did	O
to	O
guide	O
us	O
a	O
way	O
round	O
to	O
his	O
house	O
without	O
going	O
down	O
those	O
uneasy	O
steps	O
;	O
so	O
we	O
came	O
on	O
our	O
mules	O
to	O
his	O
door	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
on	O
his	O
mules	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
my	O
patron	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
,	O
to	O
whom	O
I	O
observed	O
he	O
showed	O
an	O
extraordinary	O
respect	O
,	O
and	O
Captain	O
Merlotte	O
and	O
myself	O
,	O
mount	O
his	O
fresh	O
mules	O
to	O
carry	O
us	O
to	O
his	O
house	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
came	O
thither	O
,	O
I	O
observed	O
he	O
wanted	O
the	O
assistance	O
of	O
my	O
patron	O
's	O
servants	O
for	O
his	O
cookery	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
had	O
provided	O
abundance	O
of	O
food	O
,	O
he	O
owned	O
he	O
knew	O
not	O
how	O
to	O
prepare	O
it	O
to	O
our	O
liking	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
assisted	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
midshipmen	O
pretending	O
to	O
cook	O
too	O
,	O
made	O
them	O
roast	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
venison	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
kid	O
,	O
or	O
young	O
goat	O
,	O
admirable	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
putting	O
no	O
garlick	O
or	O
onions	O
into	O
the	O
sauce	O
,	O
but	O
their	O
own	O
juices	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
little	O
wine	O
,	O
it	O
pleased	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
so	O
well	O
,	O
that	O
my	O
man	O
passed	O
for	O
an	O
extraordinary	O
cook	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
the	O
favour	O
asked	O
of	O
him	O
to	O
dress	O
some	O
more	O
after	O
the	O
same	O
manner	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
's	O
house	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
here	O
several	O
sorts	O
of	O
wildfowl	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
Chilian	O
had	O
shot	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
gone	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
knew	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
by	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
kinds	O
we	O
have	O
in	O
England	PNM
,	O
except	O
some	O
teal	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
good	O
.	O

The	O
day	O
was	O
agreeable	O
and	O
pleasant	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
night	O
dreadful	O
,	O
as	O
before	O
,	O
being	O
all	O
fire	O
and	O
flame	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
though	O
we	O
understood	O
both	O
what	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
make	O
it	O
familiar	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
for	O
my	O
life	O
.	O

The	O
Chilian	O
persuaded	O
us	O
to	O
stay	O
all	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
his	O
endeavour	O
to	O
divert	O
us	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
possible	O
;	O
my	O
two	O
midshipmen	O
went	O
out	O
with	O
him	O
a-hunting	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
called	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
a-shooting	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
fifty	O
years	O
of	O
age	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
killed	O
ten	O
of	O
them	O
at	O
his	O
sport	O
,	O
running	O
up	O
the	O
hills	O
,	O
and	O
leaping	O
from	O
rock	O
to	O
rock	O
like	O
a	O
boy	O
of	O
seventeen	O
.	O

At	O
his	O
gun	O
he	O
was	O
so	O
sure	O
a	O
marksman	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
seldom	O
missed	O
anything	O
he	O
shot	O
at	O
,	O
whether	O
running	O
,	O
flying	O
,	O
or	O
sitting	O

They	O
brought	O
home	O
with	O
them	O
several	O
fowls	O
,	O
two	O
fawns	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
full-grown	O
deer	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
had	O
nothing	O
but	O
boiling	O
,	O
stewing	O
,	O
and	O
broiling	O
,	O
all	O
that	O
evening	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
we	O
walked	O
out	O
to	O
view	O
the	O
hills	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
stupendous	O
precipices	O
which	O
surrounded	O
us	O
.	O

As	O
for	O
looking	O
for	O
gold	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
the	O
places	O
where	O
there	O
was	O
enough	O
to	O
be	O
had	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
was	O
become	O
now	O
so	O
familiar	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
troubled	O
not	O
ourselves	O
about	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
business	O
not	O
worth	O
our	O
while	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
two	O
midshipmen	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
got	O
about	O
the	O
quantity	O
of	O
five	O

six	O
ounces	O

while	O
we	O
were	O
chatting	O
or	O
reposing	O
in	O
the	O
Chilian	O

house	O

Here	O
it	O
was	O
that	O
I	O
entered	O
into	O
a	O
confidence	O
with	O
my	O
patron	O
,	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
,	O
concerning	O
my	O
grand	O
design	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
,	O
that	O
my	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
open	O
country	O
beyond	O
these	O
hills	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
particular	O
account	O
he	O
had	O
given	O
me	O
of	O
it	O
also	O
,	O
had	O
raised	O
a	O
curiosity	O
in	O
me	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
scarce	O
withstand	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
thereupon	O
formed	O
a	O
design	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
farther	O
me	O
with	O
his	O
assistance	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
mind	O
to	O
put	O
in	O
practice	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
was	O
to	O
hazard	O
perishing	O
in	O
the	O
attempt	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
very	O
readily	O
,	O
nothing	O
should	O
be	O
wanting	O
on	O
his	O
part	O
to	O
give	O
me	O

either	O
by	O

Seignior	O

says	O
he	O

I	O

at	O
the	O
design	O
you	O

;	O
you	O
are	O

the	O

the	O

that	O
is	O

some	O

make	O

we	O

This	O
was	O

he	O

I	O

This	O
was	O
so	O

and	O
so	O
extraordinary	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
nothing	O

to	O

myself	O

I	O
had	O
nothing	O

a	O

of	O
hats	O

and	O
three	O
pair	O
of	O

one	O

the	O

a	O

he	O
had	O

us	O

the	O

We	O
made	O
little	O

anywhere	O

in	O
our	O

;	O
but	O
,	O
making	O
much	O
such	O

back	O
as	O
we	O
did	O

,	O
we	O
came	O
the	O
fourteenth	O
day	O
to	O
our	O
patron	O

having	O
made	O
the	O

through	O
in	O
something	O

sixteen	O

the	O

including	O
our	O

at	O
the	O
Chilian	O

one	O

The	O
length	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
my	O
calculations	O
,	O
I	O
reckoned	O
to	O
be	O
about	O
one	O
hundred	O
and	O
seventy-five	O
English	O
miles	O
,	O
taking	O
it	O
with	O
all	O
its	O
windings	O
and	O
turnings	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
not	O
a	O
few	O
,	O
but	O
which	O
had	O
this	O
conveniency	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
gave	O
a	O
more	O
easy	O
and	O
agreeable	O
passage	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
the	O
English	O
proverb	O
abundantly	O
good	O

namely	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
farthest	O
way	O

the	O

The	O
civilities	O
I	O
received	O
after	O
this	O
from	O
my	O
generous	O
Spaniard	O
were	O
agreeable	O
to	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
his	O
usage	O
of	O
me	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
,	O
that	O
had	O
so	O
great	O
a	O
charge	O
upon	O
us	O
at	O
the	O
sea-side	O
,	O
could	O
not	O
spare	O
long	O
time	O
in	O
those	O
ceremonies	O
,	O
any	O
more	O
than	O
I	O
do	O
now	O
for	O
relating	O
them	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
enough	O
to	O
mention	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
excused	O
,	O
at	O
parting	O
,	O
from	O
going	O
back	O
with	O
us	O
quite	O
to	O
the	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
excused	O
it	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
Nay	O
,	O
seignior	O
,	O
give	O
me	O
leave	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
fetch	O
my	O
hostages	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
resisting	O
him	O
,	O
so	O
we	O
went	O
all	O
together	O
,	O
after	O
staying	O
two	O
days	O
more	O
at	O
his	O
house	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
all	O
safe	O
to	O
our	O
ships	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
gone	O
forty-six	O
days	O
from	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
the	O
ship	O
in	O
very	O
good	O
condition	O
,	O
all	O
safe	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
and	O
well	O
,	O
except	O
that	O
the	O
men	O
seemed	O
to	O
have	O
contracted	O
something	O
of	O
the	O
scurvy	O
,	O
which	O
our	O
Spanish	O
doctor	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
soon	O
recovered	O
them	O
from	O
.	O

Here	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
two	O
Spanish	O
youths	O
,	O
our	O
patron	O
's	O
hostages	O
,	O
very	O
well	O
also	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
well	O
pleased	O
with	O
their	O
entertainment	O
;	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
lieutenants	O
had	O
been	O
teaching	O
them	O
navigation	O
,	O
and	O
something	O
of	O
the	O
mathematics	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
made	O
very	O
good	O
improvement	O
in	O
those	O
studies	O
,	O
considering	O
the	O
time	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
there	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
,	O
their	O
father	O
,	O
was	O
so	O
pleased	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
not	O
having	O
gold	O
enough	O
to	O
offer	O
the	O
lieutenant	O
,	O
as	O
an	O
acknowledgment	O
for	O
his	O
teaching	O
them	O
,	O
he	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
ring	O
from	O
his	O
finger	O
,	O
having	O
a	O
fine	O
large	O
emerald	O
in	O
it	O
of	O
some	O
value	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
him	O
a	O
long	O
Spanish	O
compliment	O
for	O
having	O
nothing	O
of	O
greater	O
consequence	O
to	O
offer	O
him	O
.	O

We	O
now	O
made	O
preparations	O
for	O
sailing	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
absence	O
,	O
had	O
laid	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
considerable	O
supply	O
of	O
provisions	O
,	O
particularly	O
excellent	O
pork	O
,	O
and	O
tolerable	O
good	O
beef	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
goats	O
and	O
hogs	O
alive	O
,	O
as	O
many	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
stow	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
had	O
now	O
my	O
principal	O
undertaking	O
to	O
manage	O
,	O
I	O
mean	O
that	O
of	O
sending	O
out	O
my	O
little	O
army	O
for	O
discovery	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
communicated	O
my	O
design	O
to	O
the	O
supercargo	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
person	O
whom	O
I	O
intrusted	O
with	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
command	O
of	O
the	O
ships	O
,	O
they	O
unanimously	O
approved	O
of	O
the	O
scheme	O
.	O

My	O
next	O
business	O
was	O
to	O
resolve	O
upon	O
whom	O
to	O
confer	O
the	O
command	O
of	O
the	O
expedition	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
,	O
by	O
general	O
consent	O
,	O
fell	O
upon	O
the	O
lieutenant	O
of	O
the	O
Madagascar	O
ship	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
taught	O
the	O
young	O
Spaniards	O
navigation	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
the	O
rather	O
,	O
because	O
he	O
was	O
naturally	O
a	O
bold	O
enterprising	O
man	O
,	O
and	O
also	O
an	O
excellent	O
geographer	O
;	O
indeed	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
general	O
artist	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
man	O
faithful	O
and	O
vigilant	O
in	O
whatever	O
he	O
undertook	O
,	O
nor	O
was	O
it	O
a	O
little	O
consideration	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
so	O
agreeable	O
to	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
and	O
his	O
sons	O
,	O
of	O
whose	O
aid	O
we	O
knew	O
he	O
would	O
stand	O
in	O
so	O
much	O
need	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
had	O
communicated	O
to	O
him	O
the	O
design	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
had	O
both	O
approved	O
of	O
the	O
undertaking	O
itself	O
,	O
and	O
accepted	O
the	O
command	O
,	O
we	O
constituted	O
him	O
captain	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
two	O
midshipmen	O
we	O
made	O
lieutenants	O
for	O
the	O
expedition	O
,	O
promising	O
each	O
of	O
them	O
500	O

l.	O
_	O
if	O
they	O
performed	O
it	O
.	O

As	O
for	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
good	O
agreement	O
with	O
him	O
for	O
his	O
reward	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
engaged	O
to	O
give	O
him	O
a	O
thousand	O
pounds	O
in	O
gold	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
met	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
journey	O
was	O
performed	O
effectually	O
.	O

We	O
then	O
laid	O
open	O
the	O
design	O
to	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
it	O
to	O
every	O
one	O
's	O
choice	O
to	O
go	O
,	O
or	O
not	O
to	O
go	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
pleased	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
wanting	O
men	O
to	O
go	O
volunteers	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
fain	O
to	O
decide	O
it	O
by	O
lot	O
among	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
so	O
eager	O
to	O
undertake	O
it	O
.	O

Then	O
I	O
gave	O
them	O
articles	O
and	O
conditions	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
who	O
ventured	O
should	O
engage	O
themselves	O
to	O
comply	O
with	O

and	O
particularly	O

that	O
they	O
should	O
not	O
mutiny	O

upon	O
pain	O
of	O
being	O
shot	O
to	O
death	O
when	O
we	O
met	O
,	O
or	O
upon	O
the	O
spot	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
captain	O
thought	O
it	O
necessary	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
not	O
straggle	O
from	O
their	O
company	O
,	O
nor	O
be	O
tempted	O
by	O
the	O
view	O
of	O
picking	O
up	O
gold	O
to	O
stay	O
behind	O

when	O
the	O
company	O
beat	O

that	O
all	O
the	O
gold	O
they	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
should	O

should	O

made	O
up	O

;	O
but	O
as	O
for	O

they	O
had	O
only	O
seven	O

,	O
in	O
case	O
any	O
man	O
was	O
sick	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
rest	O

they	O
were	O
to	O
shift	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
;	O
the	O
season	O
was	O
hot	O

in	O
the	O

they	O
set	O
out	O

of	O
October	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
on	O

is	O
the	O

so	O
that	O
the	O
covering	O
was	O
more	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
from	O
the	O
heat	O

the	O

It	O
was	O
needful	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
their	O
defence	O
,	O
to	O
furnish	O
them	O
with	O
arms	O
and	O
ammunition	O
;	O
so	O
I	O
gave	O
to	O
every	O
man	O
a	O
musket	O

a	O
pistol	O

with	O
three	O

barrels	O
of	O
fine	O
powder	O
for	O
store	O
,	O
and	O
lead	O
in	O
proportion	O
;	O
and	O
these	O
things	O
were	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
the	O
heaviest	O
part	O
of	O
their	O
baggage	O
,	O
excepting	O
the	O
carpenters	O
'	O
tools	O
and	O
the	O
surgeon	O
's	O
box	O
of	O
medicines	O
.	O

As	O
for	O
the	O
carrying	O
all	O
these	O
things	O
,	O
they	O
might	O
easily	O
furnish	O
themselves	O
with	O
mules	O
or	O
horses	O
for	O
carriage	O
,	O
while	O
they	O
had	O
money	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
you	O
may	O
judge	O
how	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
wanting	O
,	O
by	O
what	O
has	O
been	O
said	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
.	O

We	O
gave	O
them	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
a	O
good	O
large	O
pack	O
of	O
European	O
goods	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
agreeable	O
presents	O
where	O
they	O
received	O
favours	O
;	O
such	O
as	O
black	O
baize	O

not	O

scissors	O

such	O
things	O
,	O
to	O
please	O
the	O
natives	O
of	O
the	O
plain	O
country	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
should	O
meet	O
with	O
any	O
.	O

They	O
desired	O
a	O
few	O
hand	O
granadoes	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
gave	O
them	O
about	O
a	O
dozen	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
heavy	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
troublesome	O
to	O
have	O
carried	O
more	O
.	O

The	O
Spaniard	O
stayed	O
till	O
all	O
this	O
was	O
done	O
,	O
and	O
till	O
the	O
men	O
were	O
ready	O
to	O
march	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
told	O
us	O
privately	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
proper	O
for	O
him	O
to	O
march	O
along	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
or	O
to	O
appear	O
openly	O
to	O
countenance	O
the	O
enterprise	O
;	O
that	O
my	O
two	O
lieutenants	O
knew	O
the	O
way	O
perfectly	O
well	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
go	O
before	O
to	O
his	O
own	O
house	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
should	O
hear	O
of	O
him	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
.	O

All	O
the	O
mules	O
and	O
horses	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
lent	O
us	O
to	O
bring	O
us	O
back	O
he	O
left	O
with	O
them	O
to	O
carry	O
their	O
baggage	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
new	O
captain	O
had	O
bought	O
six	O
more	O
privately	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
.	O

The	O
last	O
instructions	O
I	O
gave	O
to	O
our	O
men	O
were	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
make	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
their	O
way	O
over	O
the	O
country	O
beyond	O
the	O
mountains	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
take	O
the	O
exact	O
distances	O
of	O
places	O
,	O
and	O
keep	O
a	O
journal	O
of	O
their	O
march	O
,	O
set	O
up	O
crosses	O
and	O
marks	O
at	O
all	O
proper	O
stations	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
steer	O
their	O
course	O
as	O
near	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
between	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
40	O
°	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
would	O
enter	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
latitude	O
of	O
45	O
°	O
south	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
go	O
an	O
east-south-east	O
course	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
wherever	O
they	O
made	O
the	O
shore	O
they	O
should	O
seek	O
for	O
a	O
creek	O
or	O
port	O
where	O
the	O
ships	O
might	O
come	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
,	O
and	O
look	O
out	O
night	O
and	O
day	O
for	O
the	O
ships	O
;	O
the	O
signals	O
also	O
were	O
agreed	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
had	O
two	O
dozen	O
of	O
rockets	O
to	O
throw	O
up	O
if	O
they	O
discovered	O
us	O
at	O
sea	O
;	O
they	O
had	O
all	O
necessary	O
instruments	O
for	O

also	O
,	O
and	O
perspective	O
glasses	O
,	O
pocket	O
compasses	O

&	O
c.	O

and	O
thus	O
they	O
set	O
out	O
,	O
October	O
24th	O
,	O
1715	O
.	O

We	O
stayed	O
five	O
days	O
after	O
they	O
began	O
their	O
march	O
,	O
by	O
agreement	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
any	O
opposition	O
should	O
be	O
offered	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
or	O
any	O
umbrage	O
taken	O
at	O
their	O
design	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
executed	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
notice	O

But	O
as	O
the	O
Spaniards	O
in	O
the	O

,	O
who	O
are	O
the	O
most	O
supinely	O
negligent	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
had	O
not	O
the	O
least	O
shadow	O
of	O

and	O
took	O
them	O
only	O
to	O
be	O
French	O

the	O
two	O

they	O
knew	O
nothing	O

went	O
away	O

,	O
no	O

We	O
stayed	O
three	O
days	O
longer	O
than	O
we	O
appointed	O
,	O
and	O
hearing	O
nothing	O
amiss	O
from	O
them	O

we	O
were	O

that	O
all	O
was	O
right	O

them	O

so	O
we	O
put	O
to	O

till	O
we	O
were	O
out	O

then	O
we	O
stood	O
away	O
due	O

with	O
a	O
fresh	O
gale	O
at	O
north-west-by-west	O

though	O
the	O

chopped	O
about	O

we	O
had	O
calms	O

as	O
before	O
,	O
but	O
something	O
more	O
bushy	O
,	O
and	O
here	O
and	O
there	O
a	O
few	O
trees	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
off	O

There	O
is	O
a	O
large	O
river	O
which	O
empties	O
itself	O
into	O
this	O
bay	O
.	O

Finding	O
no	O
news	O
here	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
Madagascar	O
ship	O
to	O
weigh	O
and	O
stand	O
farther	O
north	O
,	O
keeping	O
as	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
as	O
he	O
might	O
with	O
safety	O
,	O
and	O
causing	O
his	O
men	O
to	O
look	O
out	O
for	O
the	O
signals	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
discovered	O
,	O
they	O
should	O
give	O
us	O
notice	O
by	O
firing	O
three	O
guns	O
.	O

They	O
sailed	O
the	O
height	O
of	O
Cape	PNM
Blanco	PNM
,	O
where	O
the	O
land	O
falling	O
back	O
,	O
makes	O
a	O
deep	O
bay	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sea	O
receives	O
into	O
it	O
a	O
great	O
river	O
at	O
several	O
mouths	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
twenty	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
all	O
farther	O
north	O
.	O

Here	O
they	O
stood	O
into	O
the	O
bay	O
until	O
they	O
made	O
the	O
land	O
again	O
;	O
for	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
opening	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
see	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
the	O
land	O
lying	O
very	O
low	O
.	O

The	O
captain	O
was	O
doubtful	O
what	O
he	O
should	O
do	O
upon	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
so	O
large	O
a	O
bay	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
loath	O
to	O
stand	O
farther	O
in	O
,	O
lest	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
pushing	O
out	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
again	O
afterwards	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
gale	O
springing	O
up	O
from	O
the	O
seaward	O
,	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
shut	O
into	O
a	O
bay	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
knowledge	O
of	O
the	O
ground	O
;	O
and	O
upon	O
this	O
caution	O
,	O
they	O
resolved	O
among	O
themselves	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
for	O
that	O
evening	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
put	O
farther	O
out	O
to	O
sea	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
he	O
weighed	O
and	O
stood	O
off	O
to	O
sea	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
weather	O
being	O
very	O
fine	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
little	O
wind	O
that	O
blew	O
being	O
south-west-by-south	O
,	O
he	O
ventured	O
to	O
stand	O
in	O
for	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
where	O
he	O
found	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
small	O
creeks	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
large	O
river	O
;	O
and	O
sending	O
in	O
his	O
shallop	O
to	O
sound	O
,	O
and	O
find	O
out	O
a	O
good	O
place	O
to	O
ride	O
in	O
,	O
upon	O
their	O
making	O
the	O
signal	O
to	O
him	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
found	O
such	O
a	O
place	O
,	O
he	O
stood	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
in	O
eleven	O
fathom	O
good	O
ground	O
,	O
half	O
a	O
league	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
well	O
defended	O
from	O
the	O
northerly	O
and	O
easterly	O
winds	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
the	O
winds	O
we	O
had	O
any	O
reason	O
to	O
fear	O
.	O

Having	O
thus	O
brought	O
his	O
ship	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
,	O
he	O
sent	O
his	O
shallop	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
to	O
give	O
me	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
desire	O
me	O
to	O
come	O
up	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
which	O
accordingly	O
we	O
did	O
;	O
and	O
here	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
ride	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
in	O
hopes	O
to	O
hear	O
from	O
our	O
little	O
army	O
.	O

We	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
some	O
or	O
other	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
every	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
especially	O
when	O
five	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
going	O
on	O
shore	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
had	O
shot	O
three	O
Peruvian	O
sheep	O
and	O
a	O
black	O
wild	O
bull	O
;	O
for	O
after	O
that	O
they	O
ranged	O
the	O
country	O
far	O
and	O
near	O
to	O
find	O
more	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
never	O
come	O
within	O
shot	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
except	O
three	O
bulls	O
and	O
a	O
cow	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
killed	O
after	O
a	O
long	O
and	O
tedious	O
chase	O
.	O

We	O
lay	O
here	O
till	O
the	O
16th	O
of	O
February	O
,	O
without	O
any	O
news	O
of	O
our	O
travellers	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
called	O
them	O
.	O

All	O
the	O
hopes	O
we	O
had	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
five	O
of	O
our	O
men	O
asking	O
my	O
leave	O
to	O
travel	O
,	O
swore	O
to	O
me	O
they	O
would	O
go	O
quite	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
Andes	O
but	O
they	O
would	O
find	O
them	O
;	O
nay	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
Spanish	O
gentleman	O
himself	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
hear	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
obliged	O
me	O
to	O
stay	O
twenty	O
days	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
no	O
longer	O
.	O

This	O
I	O
readily	O
promised	O
,	O
and	O
giving	O
them	O
everything	O
they	O
asked	O
,	O
and	O
two	O
Peruvian	O
sheep	O
to	O
carry	O
their	O
ammunition	O
,	O
with	O
two	O
dozen	O
of	O

a	O

away	O
they	O
went	O
;	O
and	O
from	O
them	O
we	O
had	O
yet	O
heard	O
no	O
news	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
was	O
our	O

hope	O

They	O
travelled	O

as	O
they	O
afterwards	O
gave	O
an	O
account	O
,	O
one	O
hundred	O
and	O
twenty	O
miles	O
up	O
the	O
country	O

till	O
they	O
were	O
at	O

forced	O
to	O
resolve	O
to	O
kill	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
guinacoes	O
,	O
or	O
sheep	O
,	O
to	O
satisfy	O
their	O
hunger	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
grief	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
their	O
luggage	O
was	O
heavy	O
to	O
carry	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
they	O
only	O
resolved	O
on	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
just	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
roused	O
a	O
deer	O
with	O
a	O
fawn	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
by	O
great	O
good	O
luck	O
shot	O
them	O
both	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
having	O
killed	O
the	O
doe	O
,	O
the	O
fawn	O
stood	O
still	O
by	O
her	O
till	O
he	O
had	O
loaded	O
his	O
piece	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
shot	O
that	O
also	O

This	O
supplied	O
them	O
for	O
four	O

five	O
days	O
plentifully	O

and	O
the	O
last	O

in	O
hopes	O
to	O

-RRB-	O

saw	O
something	O
black	O
come	O
driving	O
down	O
the	O
stream	O
;	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
reach	O
it	O

but	O
calling	O
one	O
of	O
his	O

their	O

was	O
such	O

that	O
the	O

a	O

,	O
when	O

he	O

it	O
was	O
a	O
man	O

this	O
made	O
them	O
conclude	O
their	O

were	O
not	O
far	O
off	O

and	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
coming	O
by	O

Upon	O
this	O

they	O
made	O
to	O
the	O
first	O

they	O
could	O
come	O
at	O

and	O
there	O
they	O
encamped	O

and	O
at	O
night	O
fired	O
some	O
rockets	O

and	O
after	O
the	O
third	O
rocket	O
was	O
fired	O
,	O
they	O
,	O
to	O
their	O
great	O
joy	O

saw	O
two	O

soon	O

that	O
a	O

;	O
and	O
in	O
two	O

they	O
all	O
joyfully	O
met	O

We	O
had	O
been	O
here	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
impatiently	O
expecting	O
them	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
the	O
man	O
at	O
the	O
main-top	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
ordered	O
to	O
look	O
out	O
,	O
called	O
aloud	O
to	O
us	O
below	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
saw	O
a	O
flash	O
of	O
fire	O
;	O
and	O
immediately	O
,	O
the	O
men	O
looking	O
to	O
landward	O
,	O
they	O
saw	O
two	O
rockets	O
rise	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
air	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
answered	O
by	O
firing	O
three	O
rockets	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
returned	O
by	O
one	O
rocket	O
,	O
to	O
signify	O
that	O
they	O
saw	O
our	O
men	O
's	O
signal	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
joyful	O
exchange	O
of	O
distant	O
language	O
to	O
both	O
sides	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
there	O
,	O
for	O
,	O
being	O
impatient	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
put	O
out	O
and	O
sailed	O
about	O
ten	O
leagues	O
farther	O
;	O
but	O
our	O
ship	O
fired	O
three	O
guns	O
to	O
give	O
me	O
notice	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
we	O
heard	O
not	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
we	O
knew	O
they	O
fired	O
too	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
it	O
being	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
very	O
attentive	O
with	O
their	O
eyes	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
ears	O
,	O
saw	O
plainly	O
the	O
three	O
flashes	O
of	O
the	O

though	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
hear	O
the	O
report	O

This	O
was	O
such	O
certain	O
intelligence	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
so	O
impatient	O
to	O
know	O
how	O
things	O
went	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
having	O
also	O
a	O
small	O
gale	O
of	O
wind	O
,	O
I	O
weighed	O
immediately	O

and	O
stood	O
back	O
again	O
to	O
our	O

;	O
it	O
was	O
not	O

however	O

till	O
the	O
second	O
day	O
after	O
we	O
weighed	O
that	O
we	O
came	O
up	O

them	O

having	O
little	O

no	O
wind	O
all	O
the	O
first	O
day	O
;	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
they	O
spied	O
us	O

and	O
fired	O
the	O
three	O
guns	O
again	O
,	O
being	O
the	O
signal	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
got	O
news	O
of	O
our	O
friends	O

Nothing	O
could	O
be	O
more	O
to	O
my	O
satisfaction	O
than	O
to	O
hear	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
got	O
news	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
as	O
much	O
to	O
their	O
satisfaction	O
as	O
to	O
ours	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
I	O
mean	O
our	O
little	O
army	O
;	O
for	O
if	O
any	O
disaster	O
had	O
happened	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
odd	O
condition	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
subsist	O

yet	O
they	O
would	O

been	O
out	O
of	O
all	O
hope	O
of	O
ever	O
returning	O
to	O
their	O
own	O
country	O

Upon	O
the	O
signal	O
I	O
stood	O
into	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
anchor	O
at	O
about	O
a	O

of	O
our	O

as	O

,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O

in	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
waiting	O
for	O
another	O
signal	O
from	O
our	O
men	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
judge	O
which	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
to	O
go	O
ashore	O
at	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
take	O
some	O
proper	O
measures	O
to	O
come	O
at	O
them	O
.	O

About	O
five	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
our	O
eyes	O
being	O
all	O
up	O
in	O

,	O
and	O
towards	O
the	O
hills	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
appointed	O
signals	O
,	O
beheld	O

to	O
our	O
great	O
surprise	O

a	O
canoe	O

rowing	O
to	O
us	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
mouth	O

Immediately	O
we	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
our	O
perspective	O
glasses	O

one	O
said	O
it	O

one	O
thing	O

and	O
one	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
another	O
,	O
until	O
I	O
fetched	O
a	O
large	O
telescope	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
cabin	O

and	O
with	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
easily	O
see	O
they	O
were	O
my	O
own	O
men	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
our	O
inexpressible	O
satisfaction	O
that	O
they	O
soon	O
after	O
came	O
directly	O
on	O
board	O

It	O
might	O
very	O
well	O
take	O
up	O
another	O
volume	O
to	O
give	O
a	O

account	O
of	O

How	O

the	O

assured	O

in	O

one	O

that	O
if	O

they	O
should	O
have	O
all	O

and	O
should	O
leave	O
him	O
behind	O
in	O
the	O

desolate	O
place	O

How	O
this	O
appeased	O

the	O
Spaniard	O

left	O
them	O

with	O
sixteen	O

that	O

down	O

with	O

in	O

I	O

another	O

How	O
,	O
at	O
the	O

end	O
of	O
the	O

,	O
they	O
found	O
that	O
it	O

itself	O
into	O
a	O

,	O
running	O
away	O
with	O
a	O

to	O
the	O
south-south-east	O

and	O
afterwards	O
to	O
the	O

encouraged	O

to	O
build	O
canoes	O

in	O
which	O
they	O
embarked	O

which	O

brought	O
them	O
down	O
to	O
the	O

we	O

but	O
that	O
they	O

staved	O

in	O
one	O

lost	O
a	O

parcel	O
of	O
their	O

to	O
their	O
great	O
surprise	O
and	O
mortification	O

How	O
at	O
one	O
place	O
,	O
they	O
split	O
two	O
of	O
their	O

where	O
they	O
could	O
find	O
no	O

upon	O

in	O

he	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
the	O
rest	O
murdered	O
for	O
them	O

upon	O
this	O

he	O
ordered	O

would	O
be	O

this	O

or	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
all	O
murdered	O

for	O
he	O
ran	O
to	O
the	O
two	O

which	O
the	O

had	O
plundered	O

where	O

in	O

was	O

the	O
price	O

the	O

after	O
eight	O
days	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
hospitable	O
wealthy	O
Chilian	O
's	O
house	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
mentioned	O
before	O
;	O
and	O
here	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
had	O
contrived	O
it	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
all	O
kind	O
of	O
needful	O
stores	O
for	O
provisions	O
laid	O
up	O

as	O
it	O
were	O

on	O
purpose	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
here	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
fed	O
only	O
,	O
but	O
feasted	O
.	O

Here	O
,	O
again	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
discovered	O
a	O
cursed	O
conspiracy	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
had	O
it	O
taken	O
effect	O
,	O
would	O
,	O
besides	O
the	O
baseness	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
,	O
have	O
ended	O
in	O
their	O
total	O
destruction	O
;	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
resolved	O
to	O
rob	O
this	O
Chilian	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
so	O
kind	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
lieutenants	O
discovered	O
and	O
detected	O
this	O
villanous	O
contrivance	O
,	O
and	O
quashed	O
it	O
,	O
so	O
as	O
never	O
to	O
let	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
know	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
to	O
end	O
this	O
part	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
one-and-twenty	O
days	O
in	O
this	O
traverse	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
go	O
on	O
so	O
easy	O
and	O
so	O
fast	O
,	O
now	O
they	O
were	O
a	O
little	O
army	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
did	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
but	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
;	O
at	O
length	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
view	O
of	O
the	O
open	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
being	O
all	O
encamped	O
at	O
the	O
edge	O
of	O
a	O
descent	O
,	O
the	O
generous	O
Spaniard	O
-LRB-	O
and	O
his	O
three	O
servants	O
-RRB-	O
took	O
his	O
leave	O
,	O
wishing	O
them	O
a	O
good	O
journey	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
went	O
back	O
,	O
having	O
,	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
,	O
brought	O
them	O
some	O
deer	O
,	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
cows	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
sheep	O
,	O
for	O
their	O
subsisting	O
at	O
their	O
entrance	O
into	O
,	O
and	O
travel	O
through	O
,	O
the	O
plain	O
country	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
they	O
began	O
to	O
descend	O
towards	O
the	O
plain	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
met	O
with	O
more	O
difficulty	O
here	O
than	O
they	O
expected	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
observed	O
that	O
the	O
way	O
for	O
some	O
miles	O
went	O
with	O
an	O
ascent	O
towards	O
the	O
farthest	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
;	O
that	O
continued	O
ascent	O
had	O
,	O
by	O
degrees	O
,	O
brought	O
them	O
to	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
some	O
places	O
,	O
impassable	O
descent	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
however	O
my	O
guide	O
found	O
his	O
way	O
down	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
through	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
easy	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
so	O
many	O
in	O
number	O
,	O
and	O
encumbered	O
with	O
mules	O
and	O
horses	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
their	O
baggage	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
not	O
known	O
that	O
our	O
ships	O
were	O
gone	O
away	O
,	O
there	O
had	O
been	O
some	O
odds	O
but	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
Israelites	O
of	O
old	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
murmured	O
against	O
their	O
leader	O
,	O
and	O
have	O
all	O
gone	O
back	O
to	O
Egypt	PNM
.	O

In	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
at	O
their	O
wits	O
'	O
end	O
,	O
and	O
knew	O
not	O
what	O
course	O
to	O
take	O
for	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
,	O
trying	O
and	O
essaying	O
to	O
get	O
down	O
here	O
and	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
frightened	O
with	O
precipices	O
and	O
rocks	O
,	O
and	O
climbing	O
up	O
to	O
get	O
back	O
again	O
.	O

The	O
whole	O
of	O
the	O
matter	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
missed	O
a	O
narrow	O
way	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
should	O
have	O
turned	O
off	O
to	O
the	O
south-east	O
,	O
the	O
marks	O
which	O
our	O
men	O
had	O
made	O
before	O
having	O
not	O
been	O
so	O
regular	O
and	O
exact	O
just	O
there	O
,	O
as	O
in	O
other	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
or	O
some	O
other	O
turning	O
being	O
so	O
very	O
like	O
the	O
same	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
took	O
one	O
for	O
the	O
other	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
,	O
going	O
straight	O
forward	O
too	O
far	O
before	O
they	O
turned	O
,	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
an	O
opening	O
indeed	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
the	O
plain	O
country	O
under	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
done	O
before	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
descent	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
practicable	O
.	O

After	O
they	O
had	O
puzzled	O
themselves	O
here	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
lieutenants	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
man	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
seeing	O
a	O
hut	O
or	O
house	O
of	O
a	O
Chilian	O
at	O
some	O
distance	O
,	O
rode	O
away	O
towards	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
passing	O
into	O
a	O
valley	O
that	O
lay	O
between	O
,	O
he	O
met	O
with	O
a	O
river	O
which	O
he	O
could	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
get	O
over	O
with	O
the	O
mules	O
,	O
so	O
he	O
came	O
back	O
again	O
in	O
despair	O
.	O

The	O
captain	O
then	O
resolved	O
to	O
send	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
honest	O
rich	O
Chilian	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
entertained	O
them	O
so	O
well	O
,	O
for	O
a	O
guide	O
,	O
or	O
to	O
desire	O
him	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
such	O
directions	O
as	O
they	O
might	O
not	O
mistake	O
.	O

But	O
as	O
the	O
person	O
sent	O
back	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
had	O
taken	O
the	O
journal	O
which	O
I	O
mentioned	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
therefore	O
greatly	O
vexed	O
at	O
missing	O
his	O
way	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
manner	O
,	O
so	O
he	O
had	O
his	O
eyes	O
in	O
every	O
corner	O
,	O
and	O
pulled	O
out	O
his	O
pocket-book	O
at	O
every	O
turning	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
how	O
the	O
marks	O
of	O
the	O
places	O
agreed	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
the	O
very	O
next	O
morning	O
after	O
he	O
set	O
out	O
,	O
he	O
spied	O
the	O
turning	O
where	O
they	O
should	O
all	O
have	O
gone	O
in	O
,	O
to	O
have	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
at	O
before	O
;	O
this	O
being	O
so	O
remarkable	O
a	O
discovery	O
,	O
he	O
came	O
back	O
again	O
directly	O
,	O
without	O
going	O
on	O
to	O
the	O
Chilian	O
's	O
house	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
two	O
days	O
'	O
journey	O
farther	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
were	O
revived	O
with	O
this	O
discovery	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
agreed	O
to	O
march	O
back	O
;	O
so	O
,	O
having	O
lost	O
about	O
six	O
days	O
in	O
this	O
false	O
step	O
,	O
they	O
got	O
into	O
the	O
right	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
four	O
more	O
,	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
descent	O
were	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
before	O
.	O

Here	O
the	O
hill	O
was	O
still	O
very	O
high	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
passage	O
down	O
was	O
steep	O
and	O
difficult	O
enough	O
;	O
but	O
still	O
it	O
was	O
practicable	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
could	O
see	O
the	O
marks	O
of	O
cattle	O
having	O
passed	O
there	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
gone	O
in	O
drifts	O
or	O
droves	O
;	O
also	O
it	O
was	O
apparent	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
by	O
some	O
help	O
and	O
labour	O
of	O
hands	O
,	O
the	O
way	O
might	O
be	O
led	O
winding	O
and	O
turning	O
on	O
the	O
slope	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
,	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
much	O
easier	O
to	O
get	O
down	O
than	O
it	O
was	O
now	O
.	O

It	O
cost	O
them	O
no	O
small	O
labour	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
to	O
get	O
down	O
,	O
chiefly	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
mules	O
,	O
which	O
very	O
often	O
fell	O
down	O
with	O
their	O
loads	O
;	O
and	O
our	O
men	O
said	O
,	O
they	O
believed	O
they	O
could	O
with	O
much	O
more	O
ease	O
have	O
mounted	O
up	O
from	O
the	O
east	O
side	O
to	O
the	O
top	O
than	O
they	O
came	O
from	O
the	O
west	O
side	O
to	O
the	O
bottom	O
.	O

They	O
encamped	O
one	O
night	O
on	O
the	O
declivity	O
of	O
the	O
hill	O
,	O
but	O
got	O
up	O
early	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
at	O
the	O
bottom	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
plain	O
ground	O
by	O
noon	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
came	O
there	O
they	O
encamped	O
and	O
refreshed	O
themselves	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
went	O
to	O
dinner	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
being	O
very	O
hot	O
there	O
,	O
the	O
cool	O
breezes	O
of	O
the	O
mountains	O
having	O
now	O
left	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
more	O
inclined	O
to	O
sleep	O
than	O
to	O
eat	O
;	O
so	O
the	O
captain	O
ordered	O
the	O
tent	O
to	O
be	O
set	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
made	O
the	O
whole	O
day	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
calling	O
a	O
council	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
to	O
consider	O
what	O
course	O
they	O
should	O
steer	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
they	O
should	O
go	O
on	O
.	O

Here	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
this	O
resolution	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
send	O
two	O
men	O
a	O
considerable	O
way	O
up	O
the	O
hill	O
again	O
,	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
strictest	O
observation	O
they	O
could	O
of	O
the	O
plain	O
with	O
the	O
largest	O
glasses	O
they	O
had	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
mark	O
which	O
way	O
the	O
nearest	O
river	O
or	O
water	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
should	O
direct	O
their	O
course	O
first	O
to	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
it	O
lay	O
south	O
,	O
or	O
any	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
east	O
of	O
the	O
south	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
follow	O
on	O
the	O
bank	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
large	O
enough	O
to	O
carry	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
make	O
them	O
some	O
canoes	O
or	O
shallops	O
,	O
or	O
what	O
they	O
could	O
do	O
with	O
the	O
most	O
ease	O
,	O
to	O
carry	O
them	O
on	O
by	O
water	O
;	O
also	O
,	O
they	O
directed	O
them	O
to	O
observe	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
see	O
any	O
cattle	O
feeding	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
like	O
.	O

The	O
messengers	O
returned	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
word	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
east	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
on	O
to	O
south-east	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
discover	O
nothing	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
seen	O
a	O
great	O
lake	O
,	O
or	O
lough	O
of	O
water	O
,	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
,	O
which	O
looked	O
like	O
a	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
lay	O
from	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
of	O
the	O
east	O
,	O
about	O
two	O
points	O
;	O
adding	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
but	O
it	O
might	O
afterwards	O
empty	O
itself	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
their	O
opinion	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
their	O
way	O
thither	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
the	O
whole	O
body	O
decamped	O
,	O
and	O
marched	O
east-north-east	O
,	O
very	O
cheerfully	O
,	O
but	O
found	O
the	O
way	O
much	O
longer	O
than	O
they	O
expected	O
;	O
for	O
though	O
from	O
the	O
mountains	O
the	O
country	O
seemed	O
to	O
lie	O
flat	O
and	O
plain	O
,	O
yet	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
measure	O
it	O
by	O
their	O
feet	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
little	O
hills	O
;	O
little	O
,	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
compared	O
to	O
the	O
great	O
mountains	O
,	O
but	O
great	O
to	O
them	O
who	O
were	O
to	O
travel	O
over	O
them	O
in	O
the	O
heat	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
but	O
very	O
indifferent	O
support	O
as	O
to	O
provisions	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
the	O
captain	O
very	O
prudently	O
ordered	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
travel	O
only	O
three	O
hours	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
and	O
three	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
and	O
encamp	O
in	O
the	O
heat	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
,	O
to	O
refresh	O
themselves	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
.	O

The	O
best	O
thing	O
they	O
met	O
with	O
in	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
plenty	O
of	O
water	O

for	O

they	O
were	O
not	O
yet	O

any	O
large	O

considerable	O
river	O
,	O
yet	O
every	O

from	O

seemed	O
to	O
be	O

a	O

They	O

or	O

Besides	O
all	O
this	O

the	O
days	O
which	O

of	O
rest	O
were	O

it	O

more	O
than	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
rest	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
halted	O
every	O
third	O
day	O

In	O
this	O
exercise	O
they	O
did	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
meet	O
with	O
such	O
success	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
made	O
shift	O
to	O
kill	O
one	O
sort	O
of	O
creature	O
or	O
another	O
every	O
day	O
,	O
sufficient	O
to	O
keep	O
them	O
from	O

;	O
sometimes	O
they	O
met	O
with	O

with	O

sometimes	O
with	O

of	O
several	O

so	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
pretty	O
well	O
for	O
food	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
the	O
seventh	O
day	O
,	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
at	O
first	O
small	O
,	O
but	O
having	O
received	O
another	O
small	O
river	O
or	O
two	O
from	O
the	O
northern	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
it	O
began	O
to	O
seem	O
large	O
enough	O
for	O
their	O
purpose	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
ran	O
east-south-east	O
,	O
they	O
concluded	O
it	O
would	O
run	O
into	O
the	O
lake	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
fleet	O
down	O
this	O
river	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
make	O
anything	O
to	O
carry	O
them	O
.	O

But	O
their	O
first	O
discouragement	O
was	O
,	O
the	O
country	O
was	O
all	O
open	O
,	O
with	O
very	O
little	O
wood	O
,	O
and	O
no	O
trees	O
,	O
or	O
very	O
few	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
large	O
enough	O
to	O
make	O
canoes	O
,	O
or	O
boats	O
of	O
any	O
sort	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
skill	O
of	O
their	O
carpenters	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
four	O
,	O
soon	O
conquered	O
this	O
difficulty	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
coming	O
to	O
a	O
low	O
swampy	O
ground	O
on	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
a	O
tree	O
something	O
like	O
a	O
beech	O
,	O
very	O
firm	O
good	O
sort	O
of	O
wood	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
soft	O
enough	O
to	O
yield	O
to	O
their	O
tools	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
this	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
first	O
made	O
them	O
some	O
rafts	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
thought	O
might	O
carry	O
them	O
along	O
till	O
the	O
river	O
was	O
bigger	O
.	O

While	O
this	O
was	O
doing	O
,	O
which	O
took	O
up	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
,	O
the	O
men	O
straggled	O
up	O
and	O
down	O
;	O
some	O
with	O
their	O

to	O

some	O
with	O

one	O
of	O

not	O
in	O

in	O
a	O
little	O
brook	O
,	O
which	O
afterwards	O
ran	O
into	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
found	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
shining	O
stuff	O
among	O
the	O
sand	O

,	O
in	O

cried	O

a	O

Now	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O

all	O
was	O
not	O

that	O

for	O
the	O

no	O

the	O

out	O
at	O

all	O
our	O

a-rummaging	O
the	O

they	O
had	O

very	O
small	O

fine	O
,	O
not	O
only	O
in	O
this	O
brook	O

but	O
in	O
several	O
others	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
spent	O
their	O
time	O
more	O
cheerfully	O

because	O
they	O

some	O

All	O

at	O

were	O

when	O
on	O
a	O

all	O

their	O

They	O

observed	O
a	O

some	O
of	O
them	O
even	O
below	O

and	O
they	O
did	O
believe	O
it	O
rained	O
among	O
the	O

in	O
the	O
plain	O
where	O
they	O
lay	O

all	O

it	O
was	O

the	O

But	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
night	O

the	O
carpenters	O
and	O
their	O
assistants	O

who	O
had	O
set	O
up	O
a	O
little	O
tent	O
near	O
the	O
river	O

were	O
alarmed	O
with	O
a	O
great	O
roaring	O
noise	O

as	O
they	O
thought	O

in	O
the	O
river	O

though	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
upwards	O
;	O
presently	O
after	O

they	O

the	O

begin	O
to	O
come	O
into	O
their	O
tent	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
running	O
out	O

they	O
found	O
the	O

all	O
the	O

To	O
their	O
great	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
break	O
of	O
day	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
see	O
enough	O
to	O
make	O
their	O
way	O
from	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
land	O
very	O
happily	O
rising	O
a	O
little	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
they	O
immediately	O
fled	O
thither	O

Two	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
so	O
much	O
presence	O
of	O
mind	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
pick	O
up	O
their	O
working-tools	O
,	O
at	O

some	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
carry	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
water	O
rising	O
gradually	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
carpenters	O
ventured	O
back	O
to	O
save	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
put	O
to	O
some	O
difficulty	O
to	O
get	O
back	O
again	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
the	O
water	O
rose	O
to	O
such	O
a	O
height	O
that	O
it	O
carried	O
away	O
their	O
tent	O
,	O
and	O
everything	O
that	O
was	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
was	O
worse	O

their	O
rafts	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
almost	O
finished	O
four	O
large	O
ones	O
-RRB-	O
were	O
lifted	O
off	O
from	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
framed	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
dry	O
dock	O

and	O
dashed	O
all	O
to	O
pieces	O

and	O
the	O
timber	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
all	O
carried	O
away	O

The	O
smaller	O
brooks	O
also	O
swelled	O
in	O
proportion	O
to	O
the	O
large	O
river	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
our	O
men	O
lay	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
surrounded	O
with	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
terrible	O
consternation	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
lay	O
in	O
a	O
hard	O
dry	O
piece	O
of	O
ground	O
,	O
too	O
high	O
for	O
the	O
land-flood	O
to	O
reach	O
them	O
,	O
yet	O
,	O
had	O
the	O
rains	O
continued	O
in	O
the	O
mountains	O
,	O
they	O
might	O
have	O
lain	O
there	O
till	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
obliged	O
to	O
eat	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
there	O
had	O
been	O
an	O
end	O
of	O
our	O
new	O
discovery	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
weather	O
cleared	O
up	O
among	O
the	O
hills	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
which	O
heartened	O
them	O
up	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
the	O
flood	O
rose	O
so	O
soon	O
,	O
so	O
the	O
current	O
being	O
furiously	O
rapid	O
,	O
the	O
waters	O
ran	O
off	O
again	O
as	O
easily	O
as	O
they	O
came	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
two	O
days	O
the	O
water	O
was	O
all	O
gone	O
again	O
.	O

But	O
our	O
little	O
float	O
was	O
shipwrecked	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
carpenters	O
finding	O
how	O
dangerous	O
such	O
great	O
unwieldy	O
rafts	O
would	O
be	O
,	O
resolved	O
to	O
set	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
build	O
one	O
large	O
float	O
with	O
sides	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
punt	O
or	O
ferry-boat	O
.	O

They	O
worked	O
so	O
hard	O
at	O
this	O
,	O
ten	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
always	O
working	O
with	O
them	O
to	O
help	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
five	O
days	O
they	O
had	O
her	O
finished	O
;	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
they	O
wanted	O
was	O
pitch	O
and	O
tar	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
her	O
upper	O
work	O
keep	O
out	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
they	O
made	O
a	O
shift	O
to	O
fetch	O
a	O
juice	O
out	O
of	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
wood	O
they	O
had	O
cut	O
,	O
by	O
help	O
of	O
fire	O
,	O
that	O
answered	O
the	O
end	O
tolerably	O
well	O
.	O

But	O
that	O
which	O
made	O
this	O
disappointment	O
less	O
afflicting	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
our	O
men	O
hunting	O
about	O
the	O
small	O
streams	O
where	O
this	O
water	O
had	O
come	O
down	O
so	O
furiously	O
,	O
found	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
more	O
gold	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
more	O
for	O
the	O
late	O
flood	O
.	O

This	O
made	O
them	O
run	O
straggling	O
up	O
the	O
streams	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
captain	O
said	O
,	O
he	O
thought	O
once	O
they	O
would	O
run	O
quite	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
mountains	O
again	O
.	O

But	O
this	O
was	O
his	O
ignorance	O
too	O
;	O
for	O
after	O
awhile	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
nearer	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
rising	O
of	O
the	O
hills	O
the	O
quantity	O
abated	O
;	O
for	O
where	O
the	O
streams	O
were	O
so	O
furious	O
,	O
the	O
water	O
washed	O
it	O
all	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
carried	O
it	O
down	O
with	O
it	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
by	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
five	O
days	O
,	O
the	O
men	O
found	O
but	O
little	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
come	O
back	O
again	O
.	O

But	O
then	O
they	O
discovered	O
that	O
,	O
though	O
there	O
was	O
less	O
in	O
the	O
higher	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
rivers	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
more	O
farther	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
found	O
it	O
so	O
well	O
worth	O
while	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
went	O
looking	O
along	O
for	O
gold	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
towards	O
the	O
lake	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
their	O

the	O

to	O
come	O
after	O

At	O
last	O

hunger	O
called	O
them	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
once	O
more	O
all	O
the	O
company	O
were	O
got	O
together	O
again	O
;	O
and	O
now	O
they	O
began	O
to	O
load	O
the	O
float	O
,	O
indeed	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
called	O
a	O
luggage-boat	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
it	O
answered	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
relief	O
to	O
our	O
men	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
load	O
it	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
carry	O
near	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
to	O
put	O
in	O
it	O
.	O

Besides	O
that	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
all	O
obliged	O
to	O
march	O
on	O
foot	O
by	O
shore	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
this	O
particular	O
inconvenience	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
whenever	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
any	O
small	O
river	O
or	O
brook	O
which	O
ran	O
into	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
as	O
was	O
very	O
often	O
the	O
case	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
forced	O
to	O
march	O
up	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
to	O
get	O
over	O
it	O
,	O
or	O
unload	O
the	O
great	O
float	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
ferry-boat	O
of	O
it	O
to	O
waft	O
them	O
over	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
they	O
were	O
resolved	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
they	O
came	O
at	O
where	O
timber	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
had	O
for	O
building	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
go	O
to	O
work	O
again	O
and	O
make	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
more	O
floats	O
,	O
not	O
so	O
big	O
as	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
that	O
so	O
they	O
might	O
embark	O
themselves	O
,	O
their	O
baggage	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
provisions	O
too	O
,	O
all	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
take	O
the	O
full	O
benefit	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
where	O
it	O
would	O
afford	O
them	O
help	O
;	O
and	O
not	O
some	O
sail	O
on	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
go	O
on	O
foot	O
upon	O
the	O
land	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
be	O
very	O
fatiguing	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
found	O
timber	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
convenient	O
place	O
,	O
they	O
went	O
all	O
hands	O
to	O
work	O
to	O
build	O
more	O
floats	O
or	O
boats	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
while	O
this	O
was	O
doing	O
,	O
all	O
the	O
spare	O
men	O
spent	O
their	O
time	O
and	O
pains	O
in	O
searching	O
about	O
for	O
gold	O
in	O
the	O
brooks	O
and	O
small	O
streams	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
those	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
at	O
before	O
as	O
others	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
after	O
they	O
had	O

plundered	O
them	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
discovery	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
found	O
some	O
gold	O
after	O
the	O
hasty	O
rain	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
loath	O
to	O
give	O
it	O
over	O

though	O
they	O

assured	O
there	O

where	O

All	O
this	O
while	O
their	O
making	O
the	O
floats	O
went	O
slowly	O
on	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
men	O
thought	O
it	O
a	O
great	O
hardship	O
to	O
keep	O
chopping	O
of	O
blocks	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
called	O
it	O
,	O
while	O
their	O

were	O
picking	O
up	O
gold	O

though	O
they	O
knew	O
they	O
were	O
to	O
have	O
their	O
share	O
of	O
what	O
they	O
found	O
,	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
all	O
the	O
while	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
seems	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
satisfaction	O
in	O
the	O
work	O
of	O
picking	O
up	O
gold	O
,	O
besides	O
the	O
mere	O
gain	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
at	O
length	O
the	O
gold	O
failing	O
,	O
they	O
began	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
their	O
more	O
immediate	O
work	O
,	O
which	O
was	O

going	O
forward	O

and	O
the	O

themselves	O

if	O

they	O
began	O
to	O
embark	O

fall	O
down	O
the	O
river	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
grew	O
sick	O
of	O
their	O
navigation	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
few	O
days	O
,	O
for	O
before	O
they	O

the	O

which	O
was	O

three	O
days	O

going	O

they	O
ran	O
several	O
times	O
on	O

were	O
obliged	O
to	O
lighten	O
their	O
floats	O
to	O
get	O
them	O
off	O
again	O

then	O
load	O
again	O

and	O
lighten	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
off	O
and	O
on	O
,	O
till	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
tired	O
of	O
them	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
much	O

have	O
carried	O
all	O
their	O

and	O
have	O
travelled	O
by	O
land	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
cast	O
off	O
two	O
of	O
them	O

put	O
all	O
their	O

which	O
,	O
at	O

though	O
large	O

were	O
but	O
poor	O
crazy	O
things	O

At	O

they	O
came	O
in	O
sight	O
of	O
their	O

lake	O

and	O
the	O
next	O

they	O
entered	O
into	O
the	O
open	O
part	O

or	O
sea	O
of	O
it	O

which	O
they	O

Their	O
floats	O

by	O
what	O

by	O

so	O
they	O
had	O
no	O

This	O

them	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
came	O
into	O
the	O

to	O
keep	O

the	O

made	O
the	O

they	O

unless	O
they	O
went	O
on	O

and	O
got	O
upon	O
some	O
rising	O
ground	O
.	O

Here	O
,	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
the	O
shore	O
steep	O
too	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
depth	O
of	O
water	O
close	O
to	O
land	O

which	O
made	O
them	O
very	O
uneasy	O
;	O
for	O

if	O
the	O

had	O
disturbed	O
the	O

they	O
would	O

shipwrecked	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O

However	O
,	O
after	O
they	O
had	O
gone	O
for	O
two	O
days	O
along	O
the	O
side	O

by	O
the	O
help	O
of	O
towing	O

setting	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
they	O

they	O
came	O
to	O
a	O

a	O
fair	O

to	O
their	O
great	O
joy	O

But	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
shore	O

their	O
satisfaction	O

its	O
safety	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
much	O
more	O

on	O

treasure	O
that	O
was	O
to	O
enrich	O
them	O
all	O
for	O
ever	O
;	O
accordingly	O
,	O
they	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
such	O
an	O
avaricious	O
spirit	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
as	O

plundering	O
an	O
enemy	O

that	O

and	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
proved	O

they	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
right	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
in	O
this	O
gust	O
of	O
their	O

they	O
considered	O

and	O
upon	O
what	O
tender	O
and	O
ticklish	O
terms	O
their	O
navigation	O
stood	O

They	O
had	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
drawn	O
their	O
two	O
floats	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
they	O
could	O

and	O
with	O
pieces	O
of	O
wood	O

stuck	O
in	O
on	O

brought	O
them	O

ride	O

had	O
not	O
taken	O
the	O

thought	O
about	O

But	O
they	O

in	O
two	O

three	O
days	O
;	O
for	O

the	O
very	O
second	O
night	O
they	O
felt	O
a	O
little	O
unusual	O
rising	O
of	O
the	O
water	O

as	O
they	O
thought	O

though	O
without	O
any	O

;	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
they	O
found	O
the	O
water	O
of	O
the	O
lake	O
was	O
swelled	O
about	O
two	O
feet	O
perpendicular	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
their	O

by	O
that	O

lay	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
farther	O
from	O
the	O

than	O
they	O
did	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
water	O
still	O
increasing	O
.	O

This	O
made	O
them	O
imagine	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
tide	O
in	O
the	O
lake	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
after	O
a	O
little	O
time	O
it	O
would	O
abate	O
again	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
soon	O
found	O
their	O
mistake	O
;	O
for	O
after	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
they	O
perceived	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
perfectly	O
fine	O
and	O
clear	O
before	O
,	O
grew	O
by	O
degrees	O
of	O
a	O
paler	O
colour	O
,	O
thick	O
and	O
whitish	O
,	O
till	O
at	O
last	O
it	O
was	O
quite	O
white	O
and	O
muddy	O
,	O
as	O
is	O
usual	O
in	O
land	O
floods	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
it	O
still	O
continued	O
rising	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
continued	O
thrusting	O
in	O
their	O
floats	O
farther	O
and	O
farther	O
towards	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
till	O
they	O
had	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
lost	O
all	O
the	O
fine	O
golden	O
sands	O
they	O
were	O
at	O
work	O
upon	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
the	O
lake	O
overflowed	O
the	O
land	O
so	O
far	O
beyond	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
lake	O

for	O
they	O
could	O
scarce	O
see	O
to	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
water	O

even	O
on	O

a	O

It	O
may	O
be	O
easily	O
judged	O
that	O
this	O
put	O
them	O
into	O
great	O
consternation	O

they	O
might	O
well	O
conclude	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
all	O

that	O

light	O
of	O
this	O
fire	O
,	O
the	O
two	O
men	O
also	O
gave	O
themselves	O
so	O
much	O
light	O
as	O
to	O
find	O
more	O
dry	O
wood	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
afterwards	O
,	O
their	O
fire	O
was	O
so	O
strong	O
and	O
good	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
made	O
the	O
green	O
wood	O
burn	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
dry	O
.	O

Their	O
companions	O
on	O
the	O
floats	O
were	O
now	O
come	O
into	O
the	O
shoal	O
water	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
these	O
men	O
waded	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
their	O
floats	O
did	O
not	O
draw	O
above	O
a	O
foot	O
or	O
eighteen	O
inches	O
water	O
at	O
most	O
,	O
they	O
went	O
on	O
still	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
at	O
length	O
,	O
being	O
within	O
about	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
of	O
the	O
hillock	O
where	O
the	O
two	O
men	O
were	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
the	O
water	O
so	O
shallow	O
that	O
their	O
floats	O
would	O
not	O
swim	O
.	O

Upon	O
this	O
,	O
more	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
went	O
overboard	O
with	O
poles	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
sounding	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
a	O
deeper	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
with	O
long	O
paddling	O
about	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
the	O
ground	O
fall	O
off	O
a	O
little	O
in	O
one	O
place	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
they	O
got	O
their	O
floats	O
about	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
farther	O
;	O
but	O
then	O
the	O
water	O
was	O
shallow	O
again	O
,	O
not	O
above	O
a	O
foot	O
of	O
water	O
:	O
so	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
fain	O
to	O
be	O
content	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
running	O
fast	O
aground	O
,	O
they	O
immediately	O
began	O
,	O
though	O
dark	O
,	O
and	O
themselves	O
very	O
much	O
fatigued	O
,	O
to	O
unload	O
their	O
floats	O
and	O
carry	O
all	O
on	O
shore	O
on	O
their	O
backs	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
thing	O
they	O
took	O
care	O
to	O
land	O
,	O
was	O
their	O
ammunition	O
,	O
their	O
gunpowder	O
and	O
arms	O
,	O
not	O
forgetting	O
the	O
ammunition	O
de	O
bouche	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
French	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
mean	O
their	O
victuals	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
with	O
great	O
joy	O
,	O
got	O
to	O
their	O
comrades	O
.	O

Then	O
they	O
fetched	O
their	O
proper	O
materials	O
for	O
their	O
tent	O
,	O
and	O
set	O
it	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
refreshed	O
themselves	O
,	O
they	O
went	O
all	O
to	O
sleep	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
said	O
,	O
without	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
a	O
sentinel	O
placed	O
for	O
their	O
guard	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
saw	O
no	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
feared	O
no	O
enemies	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
supposed	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
weary	O
enough	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
want	O
rest	O
,	O
even	O
in	O
the	O
extremest	O
manner	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
morning	O
they	O
had	O
time	O
enough	O
to	O
reflect	O
upon	O
the	O
madness	O
of	O
such	O
rash	O
adventures	O
.	O

Their	O
floats	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
remained	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
left	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
water	O
was	O
ebbed	O
away	O
from	O
them	O
for	O
more	O
than	O
two	O
miles	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
almost	O
to	O
the	O
deep	O
half	O
mile	O
mentioned	O
above	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
heard	O
a	O
surprising	O
noise	O
and	O
roaring	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
on	O
the	O
lake	O
itself	O
,	O
the	O
body	O
of	O
which	O
was	O
now	O
above	O
seven	O
miles	O
from	O
them	O
.	O

They	O
could	O
not	O
imagine	O
what	O
this	O
roaring	O
should	O
mean	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
felt	O
no	O
wind	O
,	O
nor	O
could	O
they	O
perceive	O
any	O
clouds	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
that	O
looked	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
brought	O
any	O
squalls	O
of	O
wind	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
are	O
often	O
observed	O
to	O
do	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
nearer	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
it	O
had	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
swell	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
certainly	O
some	O
more	O
violent	O
motion	O
at	O
the	O
farther	O
distance	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
while	O
,	O
looking	O
behind	O
them	O
towards	O
the	O
shore	O
where	O
their	O
comrades	O
were	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
the	O
water	O
began	O
to	O
spread	O
over	O
the	O
flat	O
ground	O
again	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
,	O
they	O
hastened	O
back	O
,	O
but	O
having	O
a	O
good	O
way	O
to	O
go	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
wade	O
knee	O
deep	O
before	O
they	O
reached	O
to	O
the	O
hillock	O
where	O
their	O
tent	O
stood	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
many	O
hours	O
on	O
shore	O
before	O
they	O
found	O
the	O
wind	O
began	O
to	O
rise	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
roaring	O
,	O
which	O
before	O
they	O
heard	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
grew	O
louder	O
and	O
nearer	O
,	O
till	O
at	O
length	O
the	O
floats	O
were	O
lifted	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
driven	O
on	O
shore	O
by	O
the	O
wind	O
,	O
which	O
increased	O
to	O
a	O
storm	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
water	O
swelled	O
and	O
grew	O
rough	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
upon	O
the	O
lee	O
shore	O
,	O
the	O
floats	O
were	O
soon	O
broken	O
in	O
pieces	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
some	O
one	O
way	O
and	O
some	O
another	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
it	O
overcast	O
and	O
grew	O
cloudy	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
about	O
midnight	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
their	O
share	O
of	O
a	O
violent	O
rain	O
,	O
which	O
yet	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
see	O
was	O
more	O
violent	O
towards	O
the	O
mountains	O
of	O
the	O
Andes	O
,	O
and	O
towards	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
which	O
they	O
came	O
down	O
in	O
the	O
floats	O
.	O

The	O
consequence	O
of	O
this	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
third	O
day	O
,	O
the	O
waters	O
of	O
the	O
lake	O
swelled	O
again	O
to	O
a	O
frightful	O
height	O
;	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
frightful	O
to	O
them	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
up	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
supposed	O
it	O
rose	O
about	O
two	O
fathoms	O
perpendicularly	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
wind	O
continuing	O
fresh	O
,	O
the	O
water	O
was	O
all	O
a	O
white	O
foam	O
of	O
froth	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
had	O
they	O
been	O
favoured	O
with	O
even	O
a	O
good	O
large	O
boat	O
under	O
them	O
,	O
she	O
would	O
scarce	O
have	O
lived	O
there	O
.	O

Their	O
tent	O
was	O
a	O
sufficient	O
shelter	O
from	O
the	O
rain	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
on	O
dry	O
land	O
,	O
and	O
too	O
high	O
to	O
be	O
reached	O
by	O
any	O
inundation	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
concern	O
upon	O
them	O
about	O
their	O
safety	O
,	O
but	O
took	O
this	O
for	O
sufficient	O
notice	O
,	O
not	O
to	O
come	O
up	O
the	O
lake	O
again	O
in	O
haste	O
,	O
unless	O
they	O
were	O
better	O
provided	O
with	O
boats	O
to	O
ride	O
out	O
a	O
storm	O
.	O

Our	O
men	O
began	O
now	O
to	O
think	O
they	O
had	O
taken	O
their	O
leave	O
of	O
the	O
golden	O
lake	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
they	O
knew	O
not	O
how	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
leaving	O
it	O
so	O
soon	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
now	O
fourteen	O
or	O
fifteen	O
leagues	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
found	O
so	O
much	O
gold	O
,	O
nor	O
did	O
they	O
know	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
it	O
by	O
land	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
for	O
going	O
by	O
water	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
unprovided	O
for	O
several	O
ways	O
;	O
besides	O
,	O
the	O
waters	O
kept	O
up	O
to	O
a	O
considerable	O
height	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
winds	O
blew	O
fresh	O
for	O
six	O
or	O
eight	O
days	O
,	O
without	O
intermission	O
.	O

All	O
these	O
obstructions	O
joined	O
together	O
,	O
put	O
them	O
upon	O
considering	O
of	O
pursuing	O
their	O
march	O
by	O
land	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
coast	O
the	O
lake	O
as	O
near	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
,	O
till	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
they	O
should	O
find	O
that	O
the	O
waters	O
had	O
some	O
outlet	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
lake	O
emptied	O
itself	O
by	O
some	O
river	O
towards	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
concluded	O
it	O
certainly	O
must	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
not	O
yet	O
seen	O
any	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
or	O
any	O
sign	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
,	O
not	O
near	O
them	O
;	O
they	O
saw	O
,	O
or	O
fancied	O
they	O
saw	O
,	O
some	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
none	O
came	O
within	O
reach	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
doubtful	O
whether	O
they	O
really	O
saw	O
them	O
or	O
not	O
.	O

Before	O
they	O
decamped	O
for	O
a	O
march	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
needful	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
provisions	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
made	O
them	O
the	O
more	O
desirous	O
of	O
finding	O
out	O
some	O
conversible	O
creatures	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
vain	O
.	O

They	O
killed	O
a	O
wild	O
cow	O
and	O
a	O
deer	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
all	O
they	O
could	O
get	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
;	O
and	O
with	O
this	O
they	O
set	O
forward	O
,	O
taking	O
their	O
course	O
east	O
,	O
and	O
rather	O
northerly	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
come	O
into	O
the	O
same	O
latitude	O
they	O
set	O
out	O
in	O
,	O
at	O
their	O
first	O
embarking	O
on	O
the	O
river	O
.	O

After	O
they	O
had	O
marched	O
thus	O
for	O
about	O
three	O
days	O
,	O
keeping	O
the	O
lake	O
on	O
the	O
north	O
side	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
always	O
in	O
view	O
,	O
at	O
length	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
third	O
day	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
coming	O
to	O
a	O
little	O
hill	O
,	O
which	O
gave	O
them	O
the	O
prospect	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
for	O
some	O
length	O
north-east	O
,	O
they	O
saw	O
plainly	O
a	O
river	O
issuing	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
lake	O
,	O
and	O
running	O
first	O
east	O
,	O
then	O
bending	O
to	O
the	O
south	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
also	O
easy	O
to	O
perceive	O
that	O
this	O
river	O
,	O
was	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
much	O
broader	O
than	O
its	O
usual	O
course	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
see	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
trees	O
,	O
which	O
probably	O
grew	O
on	O
the	O
banks	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
standing	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
the	O
banks	O
being	O
overflowed	O
both	O
ways	O
very	O
considerably	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
mounted	O
the	O
hill	O
which	O
they	O
stood	O
on	O
,	O
to	O
greater	O
height	O
,	O
they	O
discovered	O
farther	O
north	O
,	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
of	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
miles	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
their	O
account	O
,	O
a	O
much	O
larger	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
looked	O
,	O
compared	O
to	O
the	O
first	O
,	O
rather	O
like	O
a	O
sea	O
than	O
a	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
likewise	O
issued	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
lake	O
,	O
and	O
ran	O
east-by-south	O
towards	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
which	O
river	O
they	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
manner	O
swelled	O
with	O
a	O
land-water	O
to	O
a	O
prodigious	O
degree	O
.	O

This	O
prospect	O
brought	O
them	O
to	O
a	O
more	O
serious	O
consultation	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
measures	O
they	O
should	O
take	O
to	O
proceed	O
on	O
their	O
journey	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
easily	O
see	O
there	O
was	O
little	O
or	O
no	O
use	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
of	O
the	O
rivers	O
for	O
their	O
travelling	O
,	O
while	O
they	O
were	O
thus	O
above	O
the	O
ordinary	O
banks	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
know	O
the	O
proper	O
channels	O
,	O
and	O
also	O
that	O
the	O
currents	O
were	O
exceeding	O
swift	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
stock	O
themselves	O
with	O
provisions	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
and	O
continue	O
their	O
journey	O
by	O
land	O
.	O

To	O
this	O
purpose	O
they	O
first	O
made	O
it	O
their	O
business	O
to	O
catch	O
some	O
more	O
guinacoes	O
,	O
or	O
large	O
sheep	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
knew	O
would	O
not	O
only	O
feed	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
also	O
carry	O
their	O
luggage	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
still	O
heavy	O
and	O
very	O
troublesome	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
absolutely	O
necessary	O
too	O
.	O

But	O
all	O
their	O
endeavour	O
was	O
in	O
vain	O
,	O
for	O
though	O
they	O
saw	O
several	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
country	O
was	O
pretty	O

Among	O

they	O
shot	O

were	O
a	O

especially	O
on	O
the	O

the	O

where	O
they	O
found	O

But	O
the	O
most	O

thing	O
to	O
them	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
yet	O
met	O
with	O
,	O
was	O
still	O
to	O
come	O

They	O
had	O
descended	O
from	O
the	O
hill	O
where	O
they	O
at	O

discovered	O
the	O
smaller	O
river	O

and	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
set	O
up	O

resolving	O
to	O
march	O
on	O
the	O

grounds	O
as	O
near	O
the	O
river	O
as	O
they	O
could	O

so	O
as	O
to	O
be	O
out	O
of	O
danger	O
of	O
the	O
water	O

that	O
they	O
might	O

some	O
way	O
over	O

at	O
the	O
great	O

which	O
they	O
judged	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
stream	O
most	O
proper	O
for	O
their	O
business	O

Here	O
they	O
found	O
a	O
rich	O
pleasant	O
country	O

level	O

fruitful	O
,	O
not	O
so	O
low	O
as	O

not	O
so	O

several	O

rising	O
on	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
hill	O
they	O
came	O
from	O

ran	O
winding	O
this	O

that	O

as	O
if	O
to	O

out	O
the	O

and	O
near	O
the	O
river	O
were	O
some	O
woods	O

large	O
trees	O

The	O
men	O
,	O
not	O
forgetting	O
the	O
main	O
chance	O

fell	O
to	O
washing	O
and	O
searching	O
the	O
sand	O

in	O
these	O

for	O
gold	O

the	O

to	O
be	O
over	O

they	O

They	O
had	O
also	O
an	O
occasion	O

that	O

the	O

there	O
was	O

could	O
they	O
find	O
in	O
their	O
hearts	O
to	O

,	O
not	O
knowing	O
but	O
the	O
waters	O
might	O
still	O
rise	O
higher	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
two	O
rivers	O
might	O
swell	O
into	O
one	O

and	O
so	O
they	O
should	O
be	O

up	O

or	O
if	O

they	O
might	O
be	O

some	O
island	O

where	O
they	O
should	O
perish	O
for	O

so	O
they	O

that	O

that	O
it	O

three	O

they	O
were	O

when	O
looking	O
towards	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
just	O
below	O
them	O

they	O
saw	O
a	O
prodigious	O
number	O
of	O

in	O
the	O

and	O
swimming	O
towards	O
the	O
shore	O
where	O
they	O
were	O

They	O
first	O
imagined	O
they	O
were	O
porpoises	O

but	O
could	O
not	O

anything	O
of	O

at	O
such	O
a	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O

when	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
looking	O
at	O
them	O
through	O
the	O
glass	O
,	O
cried	O
out	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
black	O
cattle	O

and	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
perceive	O
their	O
horns	O

heads	O
;	O
upon	O
this	O

others	O
looking	O
with	O
their	O

also	O

said	O
the	O

immediately	O
every	O

ran	O
to	O
his	O

and	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
it	O
rained	O
hard	O

away	O
they	O
marched	O
down	O

the	O
river	O

side	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
speed	O
they	O
could	O

By	O
that	O
time	O
they	O
reached	O
the	O
river	O
bank	O
,	O
their	O
wonder	O
increased	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
found	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
vast	O
multitude	O
of	O
black	O
cattle	O

who	O

finding	O
the	O
waters	O
rise	O
between	O

the	O

and	O
were	O
swimming	O
over	O

this	O
side	O
for	O

It	O
may	O
very	O
well	O
be	O
imagined	O
,	O
the	O
fellows	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
wanted	O
a	O
few	O
such	O
guests	O
as	O
these	O
,	O
yet	O
were	O
terrified	O
with	O
their	O
multitude	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
consider	O
what	O
course	O
to	O
take	O
when	O
the	O
creatures	O
should	O
come	O
to	O
land	O
,	O
for	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
them	O

Upon	O
the	O
whole	O
,	O
after	O
a	O
short	O
consultation	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
creatures	O
came	O
on	O
apace	O
,	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
get	O
into	O
a	O
low	O
ground	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
perceived	O
they	O
directed	O
their	O
course	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
which	O
there	O
were	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
trees	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
all	O
get	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
trees	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
lie	O
ready	O
to	O
shoot	O
among	O
them	O
as	O
they	O
landed	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
they	O
did	O
so	O
,	O
excepting	O
five	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
by	O
cutting	O
down	O
some	O
large	O
boughs	O
of	O
a	O
tree	O
,	O
had	O
got	O
into	O
a	O
little	O
thicket	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
they	O
so	O
fortified	O
with	O
the	O
boughs	O
of	O
the	O
trees	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
thought	O
themselves	O
secure	O
within	O
;	O
and	O
there	O
they	O
posted	O
themselves	O
,	O
resolving	O
to	O
wait	O
the	O
coming	O
of	O
the	O
cattle	O
,	O
and	O
take	O
their	O
hazard	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
creatures	O
came	O
to	O
land	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
wonderful	O
to	O
observe	O
how	O
they	O
lowed	O
and	O
roared	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
were	O
to	O
bid	O
one	O
another	O
welcome	O
on	O
shore	O
;	O
and	O
spreading	O
themselves	O
upon	O
the	O
neighbouring	O
plain	O
,	O
immediately	O
lay	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
rolling	O
and	O
stretching	O
themselves	O
,	O
gave	O
our	O
people	O
notice	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
swam	O
a	O
great	O
way	O
and	O
were	O
very	O
much	O
tired	O
.	O

Our	O
fellows	O
soon	O
laid	O
about	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
five	O
who	O
had	O
fixed	O
themselves	O
in	O
the	O
thicket	O
had	O
the	O
fairest	O
opportunity	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
killed	O
eleven	O
or	O
twelve	O
of	O
them	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
set	O
their	O
foot	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
lamed	O
as	O
many	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
trial	O
of	O
skill	O
,	O
for	O
as	O
they	O
killed	O
as	O
many	O
as	O
they	O
knew	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
their	O
choice	O
of	O
beef	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
killed	O
a	O
bull	O
they	O
let	O
him	O
lie	O
,	O
as	O
having	O
no	O
use	O
for	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
chose	O
the	O
cows	O
,	O
as	O
what	O
they	O
thought	O
was	O
only	O
fit	O
for	O
eating	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
now	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
trial	O
of	O
skill	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
maim	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
bulls	O
so	O
as	O
not	O
to	O
kill	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
bring	O
them	O
to	O
carry	O
their	O
luggage	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
fruitless	O
attempt	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
afterwards	O
told	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
baggage-horse	O
of	O
a	O
wild	O
bull	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
they	O
brought	O
it	O
so	O
far	O
to	O
pass	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
having	O
wounded	O
several	O
young	O
bulls	O
very	O
much	O
,	O
after	O
they	O
had	O
run	O
roaring	O
about	O
with	O
the	O
hurt	O
,	O
they	O
lay	O
down	O
and	O
bled	O
so	O
,	O
as	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
likely	O
they	O
would	O
bleed	O
to	O
death	O
,	O
as	O
several	O
of	O
them	O
really	O
did	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
surgeon	O
observing	O
two	O
of	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
low	O
enough	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
go	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
do	O
what	O
he	O
would	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
he	O
soon	O
stopped	O
the	O
bleeding	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
word	O
,	O
healed	O
the	O
wounds	O
.	O

All	O
the	O
while	O
they	O
were	O
under	O
cure	O
he	O
caused	O
grass	O
and	O
boughs	O
of	O
trees	O
to	O
be	O
brought	O
to	O
them	O
for	O
food	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
days	O
the	O
creatures	O
were	O
very	O
well	O
;	O
then	O
he	O
caused	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
hampered	O
with	O
ropes	O
,	O
and	O
tied	O
together	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
neither	O
fight	O
with	O
their	O
heads	O
,	O
or	O
run	O
away	O
with	O
their	O
heels	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
thus	O
brought	O
them	O
to	O
a	O
place	O
just	O
by	O
their	O
tent	O
,	O
he	O
caused	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
kept	O
so	O
hungry	O
,	O
and	O
almost	O
starved	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
when	O
meat	O
was	O
carried	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
tame	O
and	O
thankful	O
,	O
that	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
eat	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
stretch	O
out	O
their	O
heads	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
let	O
a	O
little	O
looser	O
,	O
would	O
follow	O
him	O
about	O
for	O
a	O
handful	O
of	O
grass	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
dog	O
for	O
a	O
bone	O
.	O

When	O
he	O
had	O
brought	O
them	O
thus	O
to	O
hand	O
,	O
he	O
,	O
by	O
degrees	O
,	O
loaded	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
taught	O
them	O
to	O
carry	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
unruly	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
load	O
them	O
with	O
more	O
than	O
they	O
could	O
well	O
carry	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
them	O
stand	O
under	O
that	O
load	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
hours	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
come	O
himself	O
and	O
bring	O
them	O
meat	O
,	O
and	O
take	O
the	O
load	O
off	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
they	O
knew	O
him	O
so	O
well	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
let	O
him	O
do	O
anything	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

When	O
our	O
people	O
came	O
to	O
decamp	O
,	O
they	O
tied	O
them	O
both	O
together	O
,	O
with	O
such	O
ropes	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
them	O
carry	O
a	O
very	O
great	O
weight	O
.	O

They	O
tried	O
the	O
same	O
experiment	O
with	O
two	O
more	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
failed	O
;	O
one	O
died	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
proved	O
untractable	O
,	O
sullen	O
,	O
and	O
outrageous	O
.	O

The	O
men	O
had	O
now	O
lain	O
here	O
twelve	O
days	O

having	O
plenty	O
of	O

in	O
which	O

the	O

ran	O
off	O

and	O
the	O
rivers	O
came	O
to	O
their	O
old	O
channels	O

clear	O

The	O
men	O
would	O
gladly	O

to	O
the	O

shore	O
of	O
the	O

to	O
some	O

to	O
look	O

but	O
that	O
was	O

now	O

so	O
they	O
marched	O
on	O

in	O
about	O
two	O

they	O

as	O
is	O
said	O
before	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
get	O
over	O
the	O
first	O
river	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
;	O
they	O
had	O
not	O
gone	O
far	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
found	O
the	O
river	O
so	O
shallow	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
easily	O
forded	O
it	O
,	O
bulls	O
and	O
all	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
being	O
safely	O
landed	O
,	O
they	O
travelled	O
across	O
the	O
country	O
to	O
the	O
great	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
found	O
also	O
very	O
low	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
like	O
to	O
be	O
forded	O
as	O
the	O
other	O
was	O
.	O

Now	O
they	O
thought	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
their	O
business	O
,	O
and	O
here	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
a	O
tree	O
or	O
two	O
might	O
be	O
found	O
,	O
big	O
enough	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
large	O
canoe	O
to	O
carry	O
them	O
down	O
this	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
seemed	O
large	O
,	O
so	O
the	O
current	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
less	O
rapid	O
and	O
furious	O
,	O
the	O
channel	O
being	O
deep	O
and	O
full	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
not	O
searched	O
long	O
but	O
they	O
found	O
three	O
trees	O
that	O
they	O
thought	O
large	O
enough	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
immediately	O
went	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
felled	O
and	O
shaped	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
four	O
days	O
'	O
time	O
they	O
had	O
three	O
handsome	O
canoes	O
,	O
one	O
larger	O
than	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
and	O
able	O
to	O
carry	O
in	O
all	O
fifteen	O
or	O
sixteen	O
men	O
;	O
but	O
these	O
were	O
not	O
enough	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
look	O
out	O
farther	O
,	O
for	O
two	O
trees	O
more	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
took	O
them	O
up	O
more	O
time	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
in	O
about	O
a	O
week	O
,	O
they	O
launched	O
them	O
all	O
;	O
as	O
for	O
days	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
lost	O
their	O
account	O
of	O
time	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
sometimes	O
no	O
rule	O
to	O
distinguish	O
one	O
day	O
from	O
another	O
,	O
so	O
at	O
last	O
they	O
quite	O
forgot	O
the	O
days	O
,	O
and	O
knew	O
not	O
a	O
Sunday	O
from	O
a	O
working-day	O
any	O
longer	O
.	O

While	O
these	O
canoes	O
were	O
making	O
,	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
old	O
trade	O
,	O
fell	O
to	O
rummaging	O
the	O
shores	O
of	O
this	O
river	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
done	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
for	O
gold	O
,	O
nor	O
did	O
they	O
wholly	O
lose	O
their	O
labour	O
,	O
for	O
,	O
in	O
several	O
places	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
some	O
;	O
and	O
here	O
it	O
was	O
that	O
a	O
certain	O
number	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
taking	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
canoes	O
that	O
were	O
first	O
made	O
,	O
took	O
a	O
voyage	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
heads	O
,	O
not	O
only	O
without	O
command	O
,	O
but	O
against	O
command	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
made	O
a	O
little	O
mast	O
and	O
sail	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
went	O
up	O
towards	O
the	O
lake	O

resolving	O
to	O
go	O
quite	O
into	O
the	O
lake	O
to	O
find	O
another	O
golden	O
shore	O
,	O
or	O
gold	O
coast	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
called	O
it	O
.	O

To	O
give	O
a	O
particular	O
account	O
of	O
this	O
wild	O
undertaking	O
,	O
would	O
be	O
too	O
long	O
,	O
nor	O
would	O
the	O
rogues	O
give	O
much	O
account	O
of	O
it	O
themselves	O
;	O
only	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
found	O
a	O
sand	O
pretty	O
rich	O
in	O
gold	O
,	O
worked	O
upon	O
it	O
five	O
days	O
indefatigably	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
a	O
sufficient	O
quantity	O
,	O
had	O
they	O
brought	O
it	O
back	O
,	O
to	O
have	O
tempted	O
the	O
rest	O
to	O
have	O
gone	O
all	O
away	O
to	O
the	O

place	O

But	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
five	O
days	O
,	O
some	O
were	O
for	O
returning	O
and	O
others	O
for	O
staying	O
longer	O
,	O
till	O
the	O
majority	O
prevailed	O
to	O
come	O
back	O

representing	O
to	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
that	O
their	O
friends	O
would	O
be	O

and	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
left	O
to	O
starve	O
in	O
that	O
wild	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
should	O
never	O
get	O
home	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
all	O
got	O
into	O
the	O
canoe	O
again	O
,	O
but	O
quarrelled	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
in	O

and	O
that	O
to	O
such	O
an	O
unreasonable	O
height	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
they	O
fought	O
,	O
overset	O
the	O

lost	O
all	O
their	O

their	O

except	O
three	O

were	O
lashed	O
under	O
their	O
thouts	O

or	O
benches	O
of	O
the	O
canoe	O
,	O
spoiled	O
their	O
ammunition	O
and	O
provisions	O
,	O
and	O
drowned	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
company	O

so	O
they	O
came	O
home	O
to	O
the	O
rest	O
mortified	O
,	O
wet	O

and	O
almost	O
famished	O

This	O
was	O
a	O

to	O
them	O

put	O
a	O

to	O
their	O

and	O
yet	O
six	O

to	O

a	O
canoe	O

them	O

and	O
they	O
would	O
go	O
back	O
they	O

to	O
the	O

where	O

they	O
did	O

they	O

if	O

go	O
to	O
the	O
rich	O

Europe	PNM
with	O
the	O

the	O

though	O

four	O

By	O

their	O

the	O
madness	O
of	O

pursue	O
the	O
voyage	O

that	O

However	O

to	O

them	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
some	O
measure	O
to	O
please	O
them	O
,	O
he	O
promised	O

that	O
if	O
they	O
met	O
with	O
any	O
success	O
in	O
the	O
search	O
after	O
gold	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
they	O
were	O
in	O

as	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
question	O
but	O
they	O
should	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
consent	O
to	O
any	O
reasonable	O
stop	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
propose	O

not	O
exceeding	O
five	O

in	O
a	O

the	O
places	O
to	O

less	O
than	O
five	O
leagues	O
off	O
from	O
one	O
another	O

Upon	O
these	O
terms	O
they	O
consented	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
embarked	O
and	O
came	O
away	O
,	O
though	O
extremely	O
mortified	O
for	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
companions	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
a	O
brave	O
stout	O
fellow	O
,	O
very	O
well	O
beloved	O
by	O
all	O
the	O
company	O
,	O
but	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
remedy	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
came	O
on	O
in	O
five	O
canoes	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
a	O
good	O
stock	O
of	O
provisions	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
viz.	O
,	O
good	O
fresh	O
beef	O
cured	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
and	O
fifteen	O
Peruvian	O
sheep	O
alive	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
got	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
between	O
the	O
two	O
rivers	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
it	O
easy	O
to	O
catch	O
those	O
creatures	O
,	O
who	O
before	O
that	O
would	O
not	O
come	O
near	O
them	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
they	O
came	O
down	O
the	O
river	O
apace	O
,	O
till	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
another	O
golden	O
shore	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
finding	O
some	O
quantity	O
of	O
gold	O
,	O
they	O
claimed	O
their	O
captain	O
's	O
promise	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
accordingly	O
,	O
they	O
went	O
all	O
on	O
shore	O
to	O
work	O
,	O
and	O
pretty	O
good	O
success	O
they	O
had	O
,	O
picking	O
up	O
from	O
among	O
the	O
sands	O
a	O
considerable	O
quantity	O
of	O
gold	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
stayed	O
four	O
of	O
the	O
five	O
days	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
cleared	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
not	O
of	O
a	O
long	O
extent	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
they	O
cheerfully	O
came	O
on	O
.	O

They	O
proceeded	O
now	O
for	O
eleven	O
days	O
together	O
very	O
willingly	O
,	O
but	O
then	O
found	O
the	O
channel	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
divided	O
itself	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
went	O
away	O
to	O
the	O
left	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
to	O
the	O
right	O
.	O

They	O
could	O
not	O
judge	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
best	O
to	O
take	O
;	O
but	O
not	O
questioning	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
meet	O
again	O
soon	O
,	O
they	O
took	O
the	O
southernmost	O
channel	O
,	O
as	O
being	O
most	O
direct	O
in	O
their	O
latitude	O
;	O
and	O
thus	O
they	O
coursed	O
for	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
days	O
more	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
put	O
into	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
a	O
little	O
river	O
that	O
fell	O
into	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
good	O
harbour	O
for	O
their	O
little	O
fleet	O
.	O

Here	O
,	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
put	O
in	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
provisions	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
had	O
eaten	O
up	O
all	O
their	O
guinacoes	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
two	O
tame	O
bulls	O
too	O
,	O
the	O
last	O
of	O
which	O
they	O
soon	O
repented	O
,	O
as	O
will	O
be	O
shown	O
presently	O
.	O

After	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
a-hunting	O
,	O
and	O
shot	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
deer	O
and	O
a	O
cow	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
hare	O
,	O
as	O
large	O
as	O
an	O
English	O
fox	O
,	O
they	O
set	O
forward	O
again	O
very	O
merry	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
more	O
,	O
because	O
they	O
had	O
another	O
little	O
piece	O
of	O
a	O
gold	O
coast	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
for	O
two	O
days	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
very	O
good	O
luck	O
again	O
;	O
but	O
judge	O
how	O
they	O
were	O
surprised	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
what	O
a	O
consternation	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
when	O
,	O
coming	O
farther	O
down	O
the	O
same	O
river	O
,	O
they	O
heard	O
a	O
terrible	O
noise	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
as	O
of	O
a	O
mighty	O
cataract	O
,	O
or	O
waterfall	O
,	O
which	O
increased	O
as	O
they	O
came	O
forward	O
,	O
till	O
it	O
grew	O
so	O
loud	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
hear	O
themselves	O
speak	O
,	O
much	O
less	O
hear	O
one	O
another	O
.	O

As	O
they	O
approached	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
more	O
frightful	O
;	O
so	O
at	O
length	O
,	O
lest	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
hurried	O
into	O
it	O
before	O
they	O
were	O
aware	O
,	O
they	O
went	O
all	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
doing	O
all	O
by	O
signs	O
and	O
dumb	O
postures	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O
hear	O
any	O
sound	O
but	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
cataract	O
.	O

Though	O
the	O
noise	O
was	O
so	O
great	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
near	O
six	O
miles	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
from	O
whence	O
it	O
came	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
perceived	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
went	O
back	O
to	O
bring	O
on	O
the	O
boats	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
brought	O
them	O
as	O
near	O
the	O
place	O
as	O
they	O
durst	O
,	O
and	O
ran	O
them	O
on	O
shore	O
into	O
a	O
little	O
hollow	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
bank	O
,	O
just	O
large	O
enough	O
to	O
hold	O
them	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
had	O
thus	O
secured	O
the	O
boats	O
,	O
they	O
went	O
to	O
view	O
the	O
waterfall	O
;	O
but	O
how	O
were	O
they	O
astonished	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
found	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
five	O
waterfalls	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
about	O
two	O
miles	O
from	O
each	O
other	O
,	O
some	O
more	O
,	O
some	O
less	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
water	O
fell	O
from	O
a	O
prodigious	O
height	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
any	O
boat	O
to	O
launch	O
down	O
the	O
cataract	O
without	O
being	O
dashed	O
in	O
pieces	O
.	O

The	O
men	O
now	O
saw	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
remedy	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
must	O
lose	O
the	O
benefit	O
of	O
their	O
five	O
canoes	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
comfortable	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
come	O
above	O
four	O
hundred	O
miles	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
time	O
,	O
with	O
safety	O
and	O
pleasure	O
.	O

These	O
cataracts	O
made	O
the	O
river	O
perfectly	O
useless	O
to	O
them	O
for	O
above	O
twenty	O
miles	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
to	O
drag	O
their	O
canoes	O
that	O
length	O
over	O
land	O
;	O
so	O
,	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
they	O
unloaded	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
for	O
their	O
own	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
they	O
turned	O
one	O
,	O
the	O
biggest	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
adrift	O
,	O
and	O
let	O
it	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
first	O
cataract	O
,	O
placing	O
themselves	O
so	O
beyond	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
see	O
it	O
come	O
down	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
did	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
the	O
vexation	O
of	O
seeing	O
it	O
dashed	O
all	O
to	O
pieces	O
on	O
the	O
rocks	O
below	O
.	O

As	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
remedy	O
,	O
they	O
plainly	O
saw	O
they	O
must	O
leave	O
their	O
boats	O
behind	O
them	O
.	O

And	O
now	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
time	O
to	O
repent	O
killing	O
their	O
two	O
tamed	O
bulls	O
,	O
who	O
would	O
have	O
done	O
them	O
good	O
service	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
late	O
to	O
look	O
back	O
upon	O
what	O
was	O
done	O
and	O
over	O
so	O
many	O
days	O
before	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
now	O
no	O
means	O
left	O
them	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
would	O
go	O
forward	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
take	O
their	O
baggage	O
upon	O
their	O
shoulders	O
and	O
travel	O
on	O
foot	O
.	O

The	O
only	O
help	O
they	O
had	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
got	O
five	O
guinacoes	O
left	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
were	O
hungry	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
fain	O
have	O
eaten	O
,	O
yet	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
carried	O
at	O
least	O
five	O
hundred	O
weight	O
of	O
their	O
luggage	O
,	O
they	O
chose	O
to	O
fast	O
and	O
walk	O
rather	O
than	O
feast	O
and	O
work	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
went	O
on	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
till	O
they	O
got	O
past	O
these	O
falls	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
above	O
twenty	O
miles	O
,	O
cost	O
them	O
five	O
days	O
'	O
labour	O
;	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
which	O
,	O
they	O
encamped	O
again	O
to	O
refresh	O
themselves	O
,	O
and	O
consider	O
of	O
what	O
was	O
next	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
thus	O
long	O
upon	O
this	O
short	O
journey	O
for	O
many	O
reasons	O
.	O

1	O
.	O

Because	O
they	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
employ	O
the	O
best	O
part	O
of	O
two	O
days	O
in	O
hunting	O
for	O
their	O
food	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
time	O
,	O
five	O
of	O
them	O
swimming	O
over	O
the	O
river	O
to	O
shoot	O
at	O
some	O
black	O
cattle	O
,	O
extremely	O
fatigued	O
themselves	O
in	O
pursuing	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
did	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
shoot	O
five	O
cows	O
and	O
bulls	O
;	O
but	O
then	O
it	O
was	O
at	O
such	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
more	O
pains	O
to	O
drag	O
the	O
flesh	O
along	O
to	O
the	O
river	O
's	O
side	O
than	O
it	O
was	O
worth	O
,	O
only	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
indeed	O
hunger-starved	O
,	O
and	O
must	O
have	O
it	O

They	O
found	O
still	O
some	O
little	O
quantity	O
of	O
gold	O
in	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
below	O

where	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
by	O
falling	O
with	O
great	O

had	O
made	O
a	O
pit	O

of	O
a	O
vast	O

and	O
had	O
thrown	O
up	O
a	O
shoal	O
again	O
,	O
at	O
perhaps	O
a	O
little	O
distance	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
took	O
up	O
some	O
gold	O
whenever	O
the	O
water	O
was	O
low	O
enough	O
to	O
come	O
at	O
it	O

The	O
weight	O
of	O

made	O
them	O
travel	O
heavy	O
,	O
and	O
seldom	O
above	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
miles	O
a	O
day	O
.	O

Being	O
now	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
open	O
river	O
,	O
they	O
thought	O
of	O
building	O
more	O
floats	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
discouraged	O
from	O
this	O
consideration	O
by	O
not	O
knowing	O
but	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
'	O
march	O
there	O
might	O
be	O
more	O
waterfalls	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
all	O
their	O
labour	O
would	O
be	O
lost	O
;	O
so	O
they	O
took	O
up	O
their	O
tent	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
travel	O
again	O
.	O

But	O
here	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
kept	O
the	O
river	O
close	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
seamen	O
call	O
it	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
at	O
a	O
full	O
stop	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
coming	O
in	O
of	O
another	O
river	O
from	O
the	O
south-west	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
when	O
it	O
joined	O
the	O
river	O
they	O
were	O
along	O
by	O
,	O
was	O
above	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
broad	O
,	O
and	O
how	O
to	O
get	O
over	O
it	O
they	O
knew	O
not	O
.	O

They	O
sent	O
two	O
men	O
up	O
the	O
additional	O
river	O
some	O
length	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
brought	O
word	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
indeed	O
narrower	O
by	O
much	O
,	O
but	O
nowhere	O
fordable	O
,	O
but	O
deep	O
and	O
rapid	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
they	O
sent	O
two	O
more	O
nimble	O
fellows	O
down	O
the	O
coast	O
of	O
the	O
great	O
river	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
there	O
were	O
any	O
more	O
waterfalls	O
,	O
who	O
brought	O
them	O
word	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
none	O
for	O
upwards	O
of	O
sixty	O
miles	O
.	O

While	O
they	O
lay	O
here	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
the	O
influx	O
,	O
expecting	O
the	O
return	O
of	O
their	O
scouts	O
,	O
they	O
used	O
what	O
diligence	O
they	O
could	O
in	O
getting	O
provisions	O
;	O
and	O
among	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
they	O
killed	O
three	O
cows	O
and	O
a	O
bull	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
largest	O
river	O
;	O
but	O
not	O
knowing	O
how	O
to	O
bring	O
them	O
over	O
,	O
they	O
at	O
last	O
concluded	O
to	O
go	O
,	O
as	O
many	O
as	O
could	O
swim	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
better	O
half	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
sit	O
down	O
by	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
roast	O
and	O
broil	O
upon	O
the	O
spot	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
eat	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
bring	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
for	O
their	O
companions	O
.	O

For	O
this	O
purpose	O
they	O
got	O
boughs	O
of	O
trees	O
,	O
and	O
bound	O
them	O
together	O
,	O
then	O
wrapped	O
the	O
meat	O
in	O
the	O
hides	O
,	O
and	O
laid	O
it	O
on	O
the	O
wood	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
little	O
contrivances	O
to	O
convey	O
it	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
no	O
part	O

the	O
meat	O
was	O

What	O
they	O
got	O
on	O
their	O
own	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
they	O
made	O
better	O
shift	O
with	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
return	O
of	O
their	O
scouts	O
they	O
found	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
remedy	O
but	O
to	O
build	O
some	O
new	O
vessels	O
,	O
of	O
one	O
kind	O
or	O
other	O
,	O
to	O
take	O
in	O
their	O
baggage	O
and	O
provision	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
made	O
after	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
their	O
first	O
floats	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
found	O
no	O
trees	O
large	O
enough	O
to	O
make	O
canoes	O
;	O
when	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
made	O
one	O
great	O
float	O
,	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
make	O
two	O
small	O
boats	O
,	O
like	O
yawls	O
or	O
skiffs	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
they	O
might	O
tow	O
their	O
large	O
float	O
or	O
barge	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
this	O
they	O
might	O
do	O
with	O
small	O
timbers	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
line	O
them	O
within	O
and	O
without	O
with	O
the	O
bulls	O
'	O
hides	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
so	O
dexterously	O
joined	O
,	O
and	O
lapped	O
and	O
rolled	O
one	O
over	O
another	O
,	O
that	O
no	O
water	O
came	O
through	O
,	O
or	O
but	O
very	O
little	O
.	O

With	O
these	O
two	O
boats	O
they	O
ferried	O
over	O
the	O
small	O
rivers	O
with	O
ease	O
,	O
each	O
boat	O
carrying	O
six	O
men	O
,	O
besides	O
two	O
to	O
row	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
over	O
the	O
small	O
rivers	O
,	O
the	O
two	O
boats	O
served	O
to	O
tow	O
their	O
great	O
punt	O
or	O
barge	O
close	O
by	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

The	O
greatest	O
difficulty	O
was	O
for	O
tow-lines	O
to	O
draw	O
the	O
boats	O
by	O
,	O
and	O
those	O
they	O
supplied	O
by	O
twisting	O
a	O
strong	O
tough	O
kind	O
of	O
flag	O
or	O
rush	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
,	O
with	O
much	O
application	O
and	O
labour	O
,	O
they	O
made	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
rope-yarn	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
twisting	O
it	O
again	O
,	O
made	O
it	O
very	O
strong	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
the	O
voiture	O
with	O
which	O
they	O
conveyed	O
themselves	O
quite	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
boats	O
it	O
was	O
that	O
we	O
spied	O
,	O
as	O
above	O
,	O
coming	O
to	O
us	O
in	O
the	O
bay	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
yet	O
above	O
four	O
hundred	O
and	O
fifty	O
miles	O
to	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
nor	O
could	O
they	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
tell	O
or	O
guess	O
how	O
far	O
off	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
.	O

They	O
went	O
on	O
more	O
or	O
less	O
every	O
day	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
but	O
slowly	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
without	O
great	O
labour	O
,	O
both	O
of	O
rowing	O
and	O
towing	O
.	O

Their	O
provisions	O
also	O
cost	O
them	O
much	O
pains	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
obliged	O
first	O
to	O
hunt	O
and	O
kill	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
bring	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
camp	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
was	O
always	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
river	O
's	O
side	O
.	O

After	O
they	O
had	O
travelled	O
thus	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
following	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
place	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
on	O
a	O
sudden	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
see	O
no	O
farther	O
bank	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
looked	O
all	O
water	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
sea	O
.	O

This	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
account	O
for	O
;	O
so	O
,	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
they	O
rowed	O
towards	O
it	O
with	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
little	O
boats	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
surprised	O
to	O
find	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
northern	O
branch	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
seen	O
go	O
off	O
before	O
they	O
came	O
at	O
the	O
waterfalls	O
,	O
which	O
river	O
being	O
now	O
increased	O
with	O
many	O
other	O
great	O
waters	O
,	O
was	O
now	O
so	O
great	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
be	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
miles	O
over	O
,	O
and	O
rather	O
received	O
the	O
river	O
they	O
were	O
on	O
,	O
than	O
ran	O
into	O
that	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
after	O
this	O
,	O
it	O
contracted	O
itself	O
again	O
,	O
though	O
still	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
supposed	O
near	O
a	O
mile	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
over	O

They	O
were	O
far	O
from	O
being	O
pleased	O
at	O
this	O
conjunction	O
of	O
the	O
waters	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
great	O
water	O
being	O
thus	O
joined	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
the	O
stream	O
or	O
current	O
more	O
violent	O

and	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
upon	O
the	O
least	O
stirring	O
of	O
the	O
wind	O
,	O
more	O
turbulent	O
than	O
it	O
was	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
their	O
great	O
float	O
drew	O

little	O
water	O

and	O
swam	O
flat	O
upon	O
the	O
surface	O

she	O
was	O
ready	O
to	O

upon	O
every	O

obliged	O
them	O
almost	O
every	O

into	O
a	O

preserve	O
her	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
wind	O
blew	O
from	O
shore	O

they	O
had	O
enough	O
to	O
do	O
to	O
keep	O
her	O
from	O
driving	O
off	O
from	O
the	O
river	O

and	O
,	O
when	O
there	O
was	O

yet	O
it	O
made	O
a	O
rippling	O

of	O

that	O
they	O
had	O
much	O

All	O
the	O
country	O
on	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
this	O
river	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
higher	O
ground	O
than	O
ordinary	O

which	O
was	O
its	O
security	O
from	O
land-floods	O

and	O
their	O
security	O
too	O
;	O
for	O
sometimes	O
the	O
river	O
was	O
seen	O
to	O
rise	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
to	O
overflow	O
a	O
great	O
extent	O
of	O
land	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O

Hence	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
might	O
be	O
esteemed	O
the	O
most	O
fruitful	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
might	O
be	O
the	O
better	O
land	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
but	O
half	O
the	O
art	O
and	O
industry	O
of	O
an	O
European	O
nation	O
to	O
assist	O
the	O
natural	O
fertility	O
of	O
the	O
soil	O

by	O
keeping	O
the	O
water	O
in	O
its	O

banking	O

from	O
the	O
inundations	O

were	O
frequently	O
sent	O
down	O
from	O
the	O

from	O
the	O
country	O

But	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
now	O
was	O
,	O
those	O

lands	O
lay	O
great	O
part	O
of	O
the	O

;	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
better	O
or	O
worse	O
for	O
the	O
soil	O
,	O
that	O
no	O
judgment	O
can	O

till	O
some	O

it	O

This	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
they	O
were	O
now	O
in	O
resembled	O

as	O
they	O
hinted	O

the	O
county	O
of	O
Dorsetshire	PNM
and	O
the	O
downs	O
about	O

only	O
not	O
lying	O
so	O
high	O
from	O
the	O

the	O

a	O

as	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
about	O
Salisbury	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
other	O
parts	O

Here	O
they	O
found	O
a	O
greater	O
quantity	O
of	O
deer	O
than	O
they	O
had	O
seen	O
in	O
all	O
their	O
journey	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
often	O
had	O
the	O
good	O
luck	O
to	O
kill	O
for	O
their	O
supply	O
of	O
food	O
,	O
the	O
creatures	O
not	O
being	O
so	O
shy	O
and	O
wild	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
found	O
farther	O
within	O
the	O
country	O
.	O

It	O
may	O
be	O
noted	O
here	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
observable	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
all	O
this	O
journey	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
learn	O
that	O
they	O
saw	O
either	O
wolf	O
or	O
fox	O
,	O
bear	O
or	O
lion	O
,	O
or	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
any	O
other	O
ravenous	O
creature	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
the	O
least	O
reason	O
to	O
be	O
shy	O
or	O
afraid	O
of	O
,	O
or	O
which	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
were	O
frightful	O
to	O
the	O
deer	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
may	O
be	O
the	O
reason	O
why	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
the	O
latter	O
animals	O
is	O
so	O
great	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
is	O
greater	O
there	O
than	O
at	O
other	O
places	O
.	O

After	O
they	O
had	O
feasted	O
themselves	O
here	O
for	O
some	O
days	O
,	O
they	O
resolved	O
to	O
begin	O
their	O
new	O
kind	O
of	O
navigation	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
they	O
could	O
make	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
went	O
very	O
heavily	O
along	O
,	O
and	O
every	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
the	O
water	O
was	O
too	O
rough	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
were	O
fain	O
to	O
put	O
into	O
harbour	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
lie	O
there	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
days	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
they	O
plyed	O
their	O
time	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
they	O
could	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
the	O
current	O
setting	O
over	O
to	O
their	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
running	O
strong	O
by	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
go	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
rate	O
,	O
insomuch	O
that	O
one	O
time	O
they	O
said	O
they	O
went	O
about	O
thirty	O
miles	O
in	O
a	O
day	O
,	O
having	O
,	O
besides	O
the	O
current	O
,	O
a	O
little	O
gale	O
of	O
wind	O
right	O
astern	O
.	O

They	O
reckoned	O
that	O
they	O
went	O
near	O
two	O
hundred	O
miles	O
in	O
this	O
manner	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
made	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
these	O
two	O
hundred	O
miles	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
by	O
their	O
reckoning	O
,	O
that	O
our	O
five	O
men	O
who	O
travelled	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
so	O
far	O
,	O
found	O
them	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
saw	O
the	O
hat	O
swimming	O
down	O
the	O
stream	O
;	O
which	O
hat	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
let	O
fall	O
overboard	O
in	O
the	O
night	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
,	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
travelled	O
thus	O
far	O
with	O
great	O
difficulty	O
,	O
the	O
river	O
being	O
so	O
large	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
observed	O
it	O
growing	O
larger	O
and	O
larger	O
the	O
farther	O
they	O
went	O
,	O
so	O
,	O
they	O
said	O
,	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
doubt	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
,	O
they	O
should	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
sea	O
.	O

They	O
also	O
observed	O
,	O
that	O
now	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
found	O
the	O
waters	O
larger	O
and	O
the	O
rivers	O
wider	O
,	O
they	O
killed	O
more	O
fowls	O
than	O
formerly	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
particularly	O
,	O
more	O
of	O
the	O
duck-foot	O
kind	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
perceive	O
any	O
sea-fowls	O
,	O
or	O
such	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
used	O
to	O
.	O

They	O
saw	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
wild	O
swans	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
geese	O
,	O
as	O
also	O
duck	O
,	O
mallard	O
,	O
and	O
teal	O
;	O
and	O
these	O
,	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
increased	O
as	O
they	O
drew	O
nearer	O
the	O
sea	O
.	O

They	O
could	O
give	O
very	O
little	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
fish	O
which	O
the	O
rivers	O
produced	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
sometimes	O
catched	O
a	O
few	O
in	O
the	O
smaller	O
river	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
had	O
neither	O
fishing-hook	O
or	O
nets	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
only	O
omission	O
in	O
my	O
fitting	O
them	O
out	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
opportunity	O
to	O
furnish	O
themselves	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
,	O
likewise	O
,	O
no	O
salt	O
,	O
neither	O
was	O
it	O
possible	O
to	O
furnish	O
them	O
with	O
any	O
,	O
so	O
they	O
cured	O
their	O
meat	O
in	O
the	O
sun	O
,	O
and	O
seasoned	O
it	O
with	O
that	O
excellent	O
sauce	O
called	O
hunger	O

The	O
account	O
they	O
gave	O
of	O
discovering	O
our	O
five	O
men	O
was	O
thus	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
been	O
,	O
for	O
two	O
days	O
,	O
pretty	O
successful	O
in	O
their	O
navigation	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
described	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
stop	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
in	O
at	O
the	O
mouth	O
of	O
a	O
little	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
them	O
a	O
good	O
harbour	O
.	O

The	O
reason	O
of	O
their	O
stay	O
was	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
victuals	O
,	O
so	O
by	O
consent	O
they	O
all	O
went	O
a-hunting	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
at	O
night	O
,	O
having	O
shot	O
two	O
guinacoes	O
and	O
a	O
deer	O
,	O
they	O
went	O
to	O
supper	O
together	O
in	O
their	O
great	O
tent	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
fed	O
heartily	O
on	O
such	O
good	O
provisions	O
,	O
they	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
merry	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
captain	O
and	O
officers	O
,	O
having	O
a	O
little	O
store	O
left	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
much	O
,	O
they	O
pulled	O
out	O
their	O
bottles	O
,	O
and	O
drank	O
every	O
one	O
a	O
dram	O
to	O
their	O
good	O
voyage	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
the	O
merry	O
meeting	O
of	O
their	O
ships	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
every	O
man	O
the	O
same	O
.	O

But	O
their	O
mirth	O
was	O
increased	O
beyond	O
expressing	O
,	O
when	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
without	O
the	O
tent	O
door	O
,	O
cried	O
out	O
,	O
it	O
lightened	O

One	O
said	O
he	O
saw	O
the	O
flash	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
sure	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
said	O
,	O
he	O
thought	O
he	O
saw	O
it	O
too	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
happened	O
,	O
their	O
backs	O
were	O
towards	O
the	O
east	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
see	O
the	O
occasion	O

This	O
lightning	O
was	O
certainly	O
the	O
first	O
flash	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
five	O
men	O

rockets	O

the	O

it	O

up	O
in	O

When	O
the	O
captain	O
heard	O
the	O
men	O
say	O
it	O
lightened	O
,	O
he	O
jumped	O
from	O
his	O
seat	O
,	O
and	O
called	O
aloud	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
tell	O
which	O
way	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
foolishly	O
replied	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
north-west	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
way	O
their	O
faces	O
were	O
when	O
they	O
saw	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
word	O
was	O
no	O
sooner	O
spoken	O
but	O
the	O
two	O
fellows	O
fell	O
a-hallooing	O
and	O
roaring	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
distracted	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
they	O
saw	O
a	O
rocket	O
rise	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
air	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
.	O

So	O
nimble	O
were	O
the	O
men	O
at	O
this	O
word	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
tent	O
in	O
a	O
moment	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
the	O
last	O
flash	O
of	O
the	O
rocket	O
with	O
the	O
stars	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
spreading	O
themselves	O
in	O
the	O

shone	O
with	O
the	O
usual	O
bright	O
light	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
known	O
those	O

This	O
made	O
them	O
all	O
set	O
up	O
a	O
shout	O
of	O
joy	O

as	O

their	O

who	O
were	O
yet	O
many	O

from	O
them	O

the	O
captain	O

who	O
knew	O
what	O
they	O
were	O
to	O
do	O
on	O
this	O
occasion	O

ran	O
to	O
their	O

took	O
out	O
their	O

rockets	O

other	O
materials	O

and	O
prepared	O
to	O
answer	O
the	O

They	O
were	O
on	O
a	O
low	O

,	O
but	O
,	O
at	O
less	O
than	O
a	O
mile	O
distant	O

the	O

up	O
to	O
a	O
round	O
crown	O

pretty	O
high	O

away	O
they	O
ran	O
thither	O

and	O
set	O
up	O
a	O

But	O

making	O
these	O
preparations	O

behold	O

to	O
confirm	O
their	O
news	O

they	O
saw	O
a	O
third	O
rocket	O
rise	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
air	O

in	O
the	O

place	O

It	O
was	O
near	O
an	O
hour	O
from	O
the	O
first	O

as	O
they	O
called	O
it	O

before	O
they	O
could	O
get	O
all	O
things	O
ready	O
;	O
but	O
then	O
they	O
fired	O
two	O
rockets	O
from	O
the	O

hill	O

soon	O
after	O
one	O
another	O

at	O
about	O
ten	O

a	O

which	O
was	O

was	O
perfectly	O
understood	O

the	O
rockets	O
performing	O
extremely	O

Upon	O
this	O
they	O

another	O

up	O

was	O

This	O

a	O
very	O

night	O

an	O

them	O

and	O
this	O
discouraged	O
them	O
a	O
little	O

that	O

looked	O
out	O

with	O

that	O
it	O

were	O
not	O
above	O
four	O

five	O

they	O
answered	O
the	O
rockets	O
punctually	O
,	O
and	O
proceeding	O
early	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
they	O
met	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
joyfully	O
enough	O
,	O
as	O
has	O
been	O
said	O

We	O
were	O
overjoyed	O
at	O
meeting	O
,	O
as	O
may	O
be	O
easily	O
conceived	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
pitiful	O
boat	O
,	O
or	O
periagua	O
,	O
they	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
in	O
,	O
a	O
little	O
surprised	O
us	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
wonder	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
swim	O
under	O
them	O
,	O
especially	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
out	O
into	O
the	O
open	O
sea	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
boat	O
in	O
reach	O
,	O
we	O
hauled	O
it	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
ship	O
for	O
a	O
relic	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
taking	O
two	O

we	O

out	O

as	O
these	O

told	O
us	O
,	O
about	O
seventeen	O
miles	O
up	O
the	O
river	O
still	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
not	O
come	O
any	O
farther	O
,	O
their	O
boats	O
being	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
bring	O
them	O
along	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
river	O
growing	O
very	O
broad	O
and	O
dangerous	O
.	O

The	O
eldest	O
of	O
my	O
midshipmen	O
came	O
in	O
this	O
first	O
boat	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
captain	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
stayed	O
with	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
very	O
unruly	O
,	O
and	O
frequently	O
quarrelling	O
and	O
wrangling	O
about	O
their	O
wealth	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
was	O
very	O
considerable	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
above	O
twice	O
as	O
far	O
up	O
the	O
river	O
as	O
the	O
men	O
told	O
us	O
,	O
having	O
halted	O
after	O
the	O
boat	O
left	O
them	O

When	O
our	O
boats	O
came	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
them	O
in	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
set	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
tents	O
put	O
up	O
there	O
,	O
till	O
I	O
had	O
settled	O
matters	O
a	O
little	O
with	O

having	O
had	O
an	O
account	O
how	O
mutinous	O

fractious	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
made	O
them	O
all	O
stay	O
there	O
till	O
I	O
had	O
fully	O
adjusted	O
everything	O
with	O
them	O
about	O
their	O
treasure	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
was	O
so	O
much	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
scarce	O
knew	O
how	O
to	O
govern	O
themselves	O
under	O
the	O
thought	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

Here	O
I	O
proposed	O
conditions	O
to	O
them	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
gold	O
should	O
be	O
shared	O
before	O
they	O
went	O
on	O

,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
put	O
on	O

the	O

,	O
as	O
goods	O
for	O
every	O

that	O
I	O
would	O
give	O

and	O
I	O
offered	O

that	O

full	O

This	O
they	O

on	O

because	O
they	O

done	O
some	O
things	O

they	O

I	O
might	O

promised	O

to	O
inquire	O
no	O

In	O

had	O
