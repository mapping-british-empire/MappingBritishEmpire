the	O

The	O

not	O

with	O
a	O

of	O
characters	O

Romance	O

no	O
doubt	O
,	O
owes	O
its	O
origin	O
to	O
ignorance	O
,	O
vanity	O

and	O
superstition	O

In	O
the	O
dark	O
ages	O
of	O
the	O
World	O
,	O
when	O
a	O
man	O

rendered	O
himself	O

his	O

The	O
vulgar	O
easily	O
swallowed	O
the	O

implored	O
his	O
protection	O

and	O
yielded	O
the	O
tribute	O
of	O
homage	O
and	O
praise	O
,	O
even	O
to	O
adoration	O
;	O
his	O
exploits	O
were	O
handed	O
down	O
to	O
posterity	O
with	O
a	O
thousand	O
exaggerations	O
;	O
they	O
were	O
repeated	O
as	O
incitements	O
to	O
virtue	O
;	O
divine	O
honours	O
were	O
paid	O
,	O
and	O
altars	O
erected	O
to	O
his	O
memory	O

for	O
the	O
encouragement	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
attempted	O
to	O
imitate	O
his	O
example	O
;	O
and	O
hence	O
arose	O
the	O
heathen	O
mythology	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
no	O
other	O
than	O
a	O
collection	O
of	O
extravagant	O
romances	O
.	O

As	O
learning	O
advanced	O
,	O
and	O
genius	O
received	O
cultivation	O
,	O
these	O
stories	O
were	O
embellished	O
with	O
the	O
graces	O
of	O
poetry	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
the	O
better	O
recommend	O
themselves	O
to	O
the	O
attention	O
;	O
they	O
were	O
sung	O
in	O
public	O
,	O
at	O
festivals	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
instruction	O
and	O
delight	O
of	O
the	O
audience	O
;	O
and	O
rehearsed	O
before	O
battle	O
,	O
as	O
incentives	O
to	O
deeds	O
of	O
glory	O
.	O

Thus	O
tragedy	O
and	O
the	O
epic	O
muse	O
were	O
born	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
progress	O
of	O
taste	O
,	O
arrived	O
at	O
perfection	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
no	O
wonder	O
that	O
the	O
ancients	O
could	O
not	O
relish	O
a	O
fable	O
in	O
prose	O
,	O
after	O
they	O
had	O
seen	O
so	O
many	O
remarkable	O
events	O
celebrated	O
in	O
verse	O
by	O
their	O
best	O
poets	O
;	O
we	O
therefore	O
find	O
no	O
romance	O
among	O
them	O
during	O
the	O
era	O
of	O
their	O
excellence	O
,	O
unless	O
the	O
Cyropaedia	O
of	O
Xenophon	O
may	O
be	O
so	O
called	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
till	O
arts	O
and	O
sciences	O
began	O
to	O
revive	O
after	O
the	O
irruption	O
of	O
the	O
barbarians	O
into	O
Europe	PNM
,	O
that	O
anything	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
appeared	O
.	O

But	O
when	O
the	O
minds	O
of	O
men	O
were	O
debauched	O
by	O
the	O
imposition	O
of	O
priestcraft	O
to	O
the	O
most	O
absurd	O
pitch	O
of	O
credulity	O
,	O
the	O
authors	O
of	O
romance	O
arose	O
,	O
and	O
losing	O
sight	O
of	O
probability	O
,	O
filled	O
their	O
performances	O
with	O
the	O
most	O
monstrous	O
hyperboles	O
.	O

If	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
equal	O
the	O
ancient	O
poets	O
in	O
point	O
of	O
genius	O
they	O
were	O
resolved	O
to	O
excel	O
them	O
in	O
fiction	O
,	O
and	O
apply	O
to	O
the	O
wonder	O
,	O
rather	O
than	O
the	O
judgment	O
,	O
of	O
their	O
readers	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
they	O
brought	O
necromancy	O
to	O
their	O
aid	O
,	O
and	O
instead	O
of	O
supporting	O
the	O
character	O
of	O
their	O
heroes	O
by	O
dignity	O
of	O
sentiment	O
and	O
practice	O
,	O
distinguished	O
them	O
by	O
their	O
bodily	O
strength	O

activity	O

and	O
extravagance	O
of	O
behaviour	O

Although	O
nothing	O
could	O
be	O
more	O
ludicrous	O
and	O
unnatural	O
than	O
the	O
figures	O
they	O
drew	O
,	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
want	O
patrons	O
and	O
admirers	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
world	O
actually	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
infected	O
with	O
the	O
spirit	O
of	O
knight-errantry	O
,	O
when	O
Cervantes	O
,	O
by	O
an	O
inimitable	O
piece	O
of	O
ridicule	O
,	O
reformed	O
the	O
taste	O
of	O
mankind	O

chivalry	O
in	O
the	O

The	O

method	O
has	O
been	O
practised	O
by	O
other	O
Spanish	O

French	O
authors	O

and	O
by	O
none	O

Monsieur	O
Le	O
Sage	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
in	O
his	O
Adventures	O
of	O
Gil	O
Blas	O
,	O
has	O
described	O
the	O
knavery	O
and	O
foibles	O
of	O
life	O
,	O
with	O
infinite	O
humour	O
and	O
sagacity	O

The	O
following	O

have	O

on	O
his	O
plan	O

taking	O

liberty	O

however	O

to	O
differ	O
from	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
execution	O

where	O
I	O
thought	O
his	O
particular	O
situations	O
were	O
uncommon	O

or	O
peculiar	O
to	O
the	O
country	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
scene	O
is	O
laid	O

The	O
disgraces	O
of	O
Gil	O
Blas	O
are	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
most	O
part	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
rather	O
excite	O
mirth	O
than	O
compassion	O
;	O
he	O
himself	O
laughs	O
at	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
his	O
transitions	O
from	O
distress	O
to	O
happiness	O
,	O
or	O
at	O
least	O
ease	O
,	O
are	O
so	O
sudden	O

that	O
neither	O
the	O

has	O
time	O
to	O
pity	O
him	O
,	O
nor	O
himself	O
to	O
be	O
acquainted	O
with	O
affliction	O
.	O

This	O
conduct	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
,	O
not	O
only	O
deviates	O
from	O
probability	O
,	O
but	O
prevents	O
that	O
generous	O
indignation	O

which	O
ought	O
to	O
animate	O
the	O
reader	O
against	O
the	O
sordid	O
and	O
vicious	O
disposition	O
of	O
the	O
world	O

I	O
have	O
attempted	O
to	O
represent	O
modest	O
merit	O
struggling	O
with	O
every	O
difficulty	O
to	O
which	O
a	O
friendless	O
orphan	O
is	O
exposed	O

from	O
his	O

from	O
the	O
selfishness	O

envy	O

and	O
base	O
indifference	O
of	O
mankind	O

To	O
secure	O
a	O
favourable	O
prepossession	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
allowed	O
him	O
the	O
advantages	O
of	O
birth	O
and	O
education	O
,	O
which	O
in	O
the	O
series	O
of	O
his	O
misfortunes	O

I	O
hope	O

engage	O
the	O
ingenuous	O
more	O

in	O
his	O

and	O
though	O
I	O
foresee	O
,	O
that	O
some	O
people	O
will	O
be	O
offended	O
at	O
the	O
mean	O
scenes	O
in	O
which	O
he	O
is	O
involved	O
,	O
I	O
persuade	O
myself	O
that	O
the	O
judicious	O
will	O
not	O
only	O
perceive	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
describing	O
those	O
situations	O
to	O
which	O
he	O
must	O
of	O
course	O
be	O
confined	O

in	O
his	O
low	O

six	O

our	O

In	O

of	O
our	O

for	O
the	O

I	O
resolved	O

of	O
the	O
usher	O

going	O
out	O
to	O
make	O
water	O

which	O
he	O

did	O
at	O
four	O

and	O
shut	O

that	O

This	O
being	O
done	O
,	O
the	O
assault	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
begun	O
by	O
my	O
advancing	O
to	O
my	O
master	O
and	O
spitting	O
in	O
his	O

I	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
seconded	O
by	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
strongest	O
boys	O
in	O
the	O
school	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
devoted	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
their	O
business	O
was	O
to	O
join	O
me	O
in	O
dragging	O
the	O
tyrant	O
to	O
a	O
bench	O

over	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
laid	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
bare	O
posteriors	O
heartily	O
flogged	O
,	O
with	O
his	O
own	O
birch	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
proposed	O
to	O
wrest	O
from	O
him	O
in	O
his	O
struggle	O
;	O
but	O
if	O
we	O
should	O
find	O
him	O
too	O
many	O
for	O
us	O
all	O
three	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
demand	O
the	O
assistance	O
of	O
our	O
competitors	O
,	O
who	O
should	O
be	O
ready	O
to	O
enforce	O
us	O

oppose	O
anything	O
that	O
might	O
be	O
undertaken	O
for	O

One	O
of	O
my	O
principal	O

was	O
called	O
Jeremy	O
Gawky	O

son	O
and	O
heir	O
of	O
a	O
wealthy	O

in	O
the	O

the	O
name	O
of	O
the	O

Hugh	O

the	O
cadet	O
of	O
a	O

which	O
had	O
given	O
shoemakers	O
to	O
the	O
village	O
time	O
out	O
of	O
mind	O

I	O
had	O
once	O
saved	O
Gawky	O
's	O
life	O
,	O
by	O
plunging	O
into	O
a	O
river	O
and	O
dragging	O
him	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
being	O
drowned	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
often	O
rescued	O
him	O
from	O
the	O
clutches	O
of	O
those	O
whom	O
his	O
insufferable	O
arrogance	O
had	O
provoked	O
to	O
a	O
resentment	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
sustain	O
;	O
and	O
many	O
times	O
saved	O
his	O
reputation	O
and	O
posteriors	O
,	O
by	O
performing	O
his	O
exercises	O
at	O
school	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
wondered	O
at	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
particular	O
regard	O
for	O
me	O
and	O
my	O
interests	O
.	O

The	O
attachment	O
of	O
Strap	O
flowed	O
from	O
a	O
voluntary	O
,	O
disinterested	O
inclination	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
manifested	O
itself	O
on	O
many	O
occasions	O
in	O
my	O
behalf	O
,	O
he	O
having	O
once	O
rendered	O
me	O
the	O
same	O
service	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
rendered	O
Gawky	O
,	O
by	O
saving	O
my	O
life	O
at	O
the	O
risk	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
;	O
and	O
often	O
fathered	O
offences	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
committed	O
,	O
for	O
which	O
he	O
suffered	O
severely	O
,	O
rather	O
than	O
I	O
should	O
feel	O
the	O
weight	O
of	O
the	O
punishment	O
.	O

These	O
two	O
champions	O
were	O
the	O
more	O
willing	O
to	O
engage	O
in	O
this	O
enterprise	O
,	O
because	O

a	O

The	O

easily	O
perceive	O
that	O
this	O

the	O

making	O
my	O

subservient	O
to	O
their	O
malice	O

when	O
I	O
communicated	O
the	O

he	O
appeared	O
so	O
disconcerted	O
that	O

concluded	O
him	O
wonderfully	O
affected	O
with	O
the	O
misery	O
of	O
my	O
condition	O

looked	O
upon	O
him	O
as	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
extensive	O
sympathy	O

benevolence	O

under	O
this	O
mistake	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
recovering	O
himself	O

my	O

Whereupon	O
I	O
recounted	O
the	O

,	O
when	O
I	O
repeated	O
the	O
answer	O
I	O
made	O
to	O
his	O
ungenerous	O
remonstrance	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
my	O
leaving	O
his	O

this	O

at	O
all	O
affected	O

whatever	O
his	O
might	O
be	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
gave	O
to	O
understand	O
with	O
some	O
warmth	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
imagine	O
he	O
would	O
so	O
unreasonably	O
espouse	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
a	O
scoundrel	O
who	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
expelled	O
from	O

This	O
heat	O
of	O
mine	O
gave	O
him	O
all	O
the	O
advantage	O
he	O
desired	O
over	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
discourse	O
,	O
after	O
much	O
altercation	O
,	O
concluded	O
in	O
his	O
desiring	O
never	O
to	O
see	O
me	O
again	O
in	O
that	O
place	O
;	O
to	O
which	O
desire	O
I	O
yielded	O
my	O
consent	O
,	O
assuring	O
him	O

that	O
,	O
had	O
I	O
been	O
as	O
well	O
acquainted	O
with	O
his	O
principles	O
formerly	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
now	O

he	O
never	O
should	O
have	O
had	O
an	O
opportunity	O
of	O

that	O
request	O

thus	O

On	O
my	O

I	O
met	O
my	O
comrade	O

his	O

had	O
sent	O

some	O

to	O
town	O

for	O
his	O
improvement	O
in	O
writing	O

,	O
and	O
other	O
modish	O

As	O
I	O
had	O
lived	O
with	O
him	O
since	O
his	O
arrival	O
on	O
the	O
footing	O
of	O
our	O
old	O
intimacy	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
no	O
scruple	O
of	O
informing	O
him	O
of	O
the	O
lowness	O
of	O
my	O
circumstances	O
,	O
and	O
asking	O
a	O
small	O
supply	O
of	O
money	O
,	O
to	O
answer	O
my	O
present	O
expense	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
he	O
pulled	O
out	O
a	O
handful	O
of	O
halfpence	O
with	O
a	O
shilling	O
or	O
two	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
swore	O
that	O
was	O
all	O
he	O
had	O
to	O
keep	O
his	O
pocket	O
till	O
next	O
quarter-day	O
he	O
having	O
lost	O
the	O
greatest	O
part	O
of	O
his	O
allowance	O
the	O
night	O
before	O
at	O
billiards	O

Though	O
this	O
assertion	O
might	O
very	O
well	O
be	O
true	O

I	O
was	O
extremely	O
mortified	O
at	O
his	O
indifference	O

he	O
neither	O

any	O
sympathy	O
for	O
my	O
mishap	O
nor	O
desire	O

alleviating	O
my	O
distress	O
;	O
and	O
accordingly	O
I	O
left	O
him	O
without	O
uttering	O
one	O
word	O
:	O
but	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
afterwards	O
understood	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
the	O
person	O
who	O
had	O
formerly	O
betrayed	O
me	O
to	O
the	O
malice	O
of	O
my	O
cousins	O
,	O
to	O
whom	O
likewise	O
he	O
had	O
carried	O
the	O
tidings	O
of	O
my	O
forlorn	O
situation	O
,	O
which	O
afforded	O
them	O
great	O
matter	O
of	O
triumph	O
and	O
exultation	O
,	O
I	O
determined	O
with	O
myself	O
to	O
call	O
him	O
to	O
a	O
severe	O
account	O
for	O
which	O
purpose	O
I	O
borrowed	O
a	O
sword	O
,	O
and	O
wrote	O
a	O
challenge	O

desiring	O
him	O
to	O
meet	O
me	O
at	O
a	O
certain	O
time	O
and	O
place	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
an	O
opportunity	O
of	O
punishing	O
his	O
perfidy	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
expense	O
of	O
his	O
blood	O

He	O
accepted	O
the	O
invitation	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
betook	O
myself	O
to	O
the	O
field	O

though	O
not	O
without	O
feeling	O
considerable	O
repugnance	O
to	O
the	O

which	O
frequently	O
attacked	O
me	O

the	O

revenge	O

the	O
shame	O

retracting	O

of	O

repel	O

So	O
saying	O
,	O
he	O
retired	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
me	O
under	O
dreadful	O
apprehensions	O
,	O
which	O
vanished	O
entirely	O
at	O
our	O
next	O
meeting	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
behaved	O
with	O
unusual	O
complacency	O

and	O
treated	O
me	O
with	O
a	O
glass	O
of	O
punch	O
after	O
dinner	O

By	O
this	O
conduct	O
I	O
got	O
the	O
ascendancy	O
over	O
him	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
,	O
and	O
became	O
so	O
necessary	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
in	O
managing	O
his	O
business	O
while	O
he	O
was	O
engaged	O
at	O
the	O
bottle	O

that	O

began	O
to	O

I	O

the	O

with	O
the	O

in	O
which	O
I	O
succeeded	O
beyond	O

I	O
was	O
on	O
very	O
good	O
terms	O
with	O
my	O
master	O

wife	O
,	O
whose	O
esteem	O
I	O
acquired	O

Mrs.	O

in	O
the	O
most	O

invent	O

as	O

as	O
by	O
rendering	O
her	O
some	O
Christian	O
offices	O
,	O
when	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
too	O
familiar	O
with	O
the	O
dram	O

to	O
which	O
she	O
had	O
oftentimes	O
recourse	O
for	O
consolation	O

under	O
the	O
affliction	O
she	O
suffered	O
from	O
a	O
barbarous	O
husband	O

In	O
this	O
manner	O
I	O
lived	O
,	O
without	O
hearing	O

neither	O

for	O
the	O

my	O

allowed	O
me	O
no	O

the	O

me	O
with	O

I	O
was	O
no	O

My	O

was	O
the	O

of	O

was	O
wholly	O
engrossed	O
in	O
laying	O
up	O
a	O
stock	O
of	O

that	O
might	O
secure	O
me	O
against	O
the	O
caprice	O
of	O

for	O
the	O

I	O
became	O
such	O
a	O
sloven	O
,	O
and	O
contracted	O
such	O
an	O
air	O
of	O
austerity	O
,	O
that	O
everybody	O
pronounced	O
me	O
crestfallen	O
;	O
and	O
Gawky	O
returned	O
to	O
town	O
without	O
running	O
any	O

from	O
my	O
resentment	O

which	O
was	O
by	O
this	O

pretty	O
much	O
cooled	O

restrained	O
by	O

that	O
I	O
never	O
so	O

as	O
thought	O

When	O
I	O
deemed	O
myself	O
sufficiently	O

I	O
began	O
to	O
cast	O
about	O
for	O

into	O

in	O

that	O
might	O

for	O
the	O

I	O
had	O
undergone	O
;	O

,	O
as	O
this	O
could	O

without	O
a	O
small	O
sum	O
of	O
money	O
to	O
equip	O
me	O
for	O
the	O

I	O
was	O
in	O
the	O

well	O
knowing	O
that	O

would	O
never	O
put	O
me	O
in	O

him	O

But	O
a	O

happened	O
about	O

determined	O
him	O
in	O

This	O
was	O
no	O

than	O
the	O
pregnancy	O
of	O

I	O
reflected	O
on	O
what	O
might	O
be	O
the	O
effect	O
of	O
the	O
highwayman	O

disappointment	O

solicited	O
me	O
strongly	O

and	O
so	O
elude	O
the	O

who	O
would	O

on	O
us	O
as	O
accomplices	O
of	O

I	O
represented	O
to	O

cause	O
to	O
think	O

He	O
got	O

into	O

I	O
were	O
about	O

on	O

we	O

a	O
crowd	O
on	O

road	O
coming	O
towards	O
us	O

shouting	O
and	O
hallooing	O
all	O

As	O
it	O

we	O

a	O

in	O
the	O

with	O

The	O
highwayman	O
,	O
not	O
being	O
so	O
well	O
mounted	O
as	O
the	O
two	O
servants	O
who	O
went	O
in	O
pursuit	O
of	O
him	O

was	O
soon	O
overtaken	O

and	O
,	O
after	O
having	O
discharged	O
his	O
pistols	O
,	O
made	O
prisoner	O
without	O
any	O
further	O
opposition	O

They	O
were	O
carrying	O
him	O
in	O
triumph	O
,	O
amidst	O
the	O
acclamations	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
people	O

to	O
a	O
justice	O
of	O

in	O
a	O

stopped	O
at	O
our	O
inn	O
to	O
join	O
their	O
companions	O

take	O
refreshment	O

When	O
Rifle	O
was	O
dismounted	O

placed	O
in	O
the	O
yard	O
,	O
within	O
a	O
circle	O
of	O
peasants	O
,	O
armed	O
with	O
pitchforks	O

I	O
was	O
amazed	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
a	O
pitiful	O
dejected	O
fellow	O
he	O
now	O
appeared	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
but	O
a	O
few	O
hours	O
before	O
filled	O
me	O
with	O
such	O
terror	O
and	O
confusion	O

My	O
companion	O
was	O
so	O
much	O
encouraged	O
by	O
this	O
alteration	O
in	O
his	O
appearance	O
that	O
,	O
going	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
thief	O

he	O
presented	O
his	O
clenched	O

to	O
his	O
nose	O

and	O
declared	O
he	O
would	O
either	O
cudgel	O
or	O
box	O
with	O
the	O
prisoner	O
for	O
a	O
guinea	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
immediately	O
produced	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
strip	O

but	O
was	O
dissuaded	O
from	O
this	O
adventure	O
by	O
me	O
,	O
who	O
represented	O
to	O
him	O
the	O
folly	O
of	O
the	O
undertaking	O

as	O
Rifle	PNM
was	O
now	O
in	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O

which	O
would	O

no	O

give	O
us	O
all	O
satisfaction	O
enough	O

But	O
what	O
made	O
me	O
repent	O
of	O
our	O
impertinent	O
curiosity	O
was	O
our	O
being	O
detained	O
by	O
the	O
captors	O

as	O
evidence	O
against	O
him	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
just	O
going	O
to	O
set	O
forward	O

However	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
remedy	O
;	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
comply	O
,	O
and	O
accordingly	O
joined	O
in	O
the	O
cavalcade	O
,	O
which	O
luckily	O
took	O
the	O
same	O
road	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
proposed	O
to	O
follow	O
.	O

About	O
the	O
twilight	O
we	O
arrived	O
at	O
the	O
place	O
of	O
our	O
destination	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
the	O
justice	O
was	O
gone	O
to	O
visit	O
a	O
gentleman	O
in	O
the	O
country	O

with	O
whom	O
-LRB-	O
we	O

would	O
probably	O
stay	O
all	O

in	O
an	O
empty	O
garret	O

three	O

from	O
which	O
it	O
seemed	O
impossible	O
for	O
him	O
to	O
escape	O
;	O
this	O
,	O
nevertheless	O
,	O
was	O
the	O
case	O
;	O
for	O
next	O
morning	O
when	O
they	O
went	O
up	O
stairs	O
to	O
bring	O
him	O
before	O
the	O
justice	O
,	O
the	O
bird	O
was	O
flown	O
,	O
having	O
got	O
out	O
at	O
the	O
window	O
upon	O
the	O
roof	O
from	O
whence	O
he	O
continued	O
his	O
route	O
along	O
the	O
tops	O
of	O
the	O
adjoining	O
houses	O
,	O
and	O
entered	O
another	O
garret	O
where	O
he	O
skulked	O
until	O
the	O
family	O
were	O
asleep	O
;	O
at	O
which	O
time	O
he	O
ventured	O
down	O
stairs	O

and	O
let	O
himself	O
out	O
by	O
the	O
street-door	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
open	O

This	O
event	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
disappointment	O
to	O
those	O
that	O
apprehended	O
him	O

who	O
were	O
flushed	O
with	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
reward	O

gave	O

great	O
joy	O

to	O
make	O
up	O
for	O
the	O
small	O
progress	O
we	O
had	O
hitherto	O
made	O
,	O
we	O
this	O
day	O
travelled	O
with	O
great	O

reached	O
a	O

twenty	O

out	O

Here	O

I	O
found	O

,	O
after	O
having	O
made	O
a	O

supper	O
on	O

We	O

up	O

in	O

I	O

a	O
cessation	O

falling	O
on	O

for	O
the	O

Mrs.	O

that	O
she	O

soon	O
recovered	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
terrible	O

to	O
us	O

we	O
laid	O
our	O
heads	O
together	O

Miss	O

observed	O

being	O

in	O

the	O

that	O

he	O

with	O
honour	O
,	O
they	O
should	O
eat	O
his	O

sooner	O
than	O
his	O
provision	O

Upon	O
this	O
declaration	O
,	O
Miss	O
Jenny	O
,	O
snatching	O
his	O
weapon	O
,	O
drew	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
ran	O
immediately	O
into	O
the	O
kitchen	O
,	O
where	O
she	O
threatened	O
to	O
put	O
the	O

to	O

if	O

not	O

no	O

They	O
consented	O
to	O
this	O

with	O
a	O
great	O

we	O
were	O
on	O

meal	O

entered	O

in	O

would	O
be	O

death	O

should	O
pretend	O

seize	O

The	O
menace	O
had	O

the	O

offered	O

part	O
with	O
his	O

dinner	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
peace	O

which	O
was	O
accepted	O

down	O

because	O

His	O

In	O
the	O

my	O

proposed	O
to	O

at	O
his	O

which	O

we	O

in	O
the	O

whither	O
we	O

were	O
so	O
lucky	O

him	O
at	O

This	O
gentleman	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
come	O
from	O
Scotland	PNM
three	O
or	O
four	O
years	O
before	O

kept	O
a	O
school	O
in	O

where	O
he	O
taught	O
the	O
Latin	O
,	O
French	O
,	O
and	O
Italian	O
languages	O
;	O
but	O
what	O
he	O
chiefly	O
professed	O
was	O
the	O
pronunciation	O
of	O
the	O
English	O
tongue	O
,	O
after	O
a	O
method	O
more	O
speedy	O
and	O
uncommon	O
than	O
any	O
practised	O
heretofore	O

and	O

indeed	O

if	O
his	O

spoke	O
like	O
their	O

the	O
latter	O
part	O
of	O
his	O
undertaking	O
was	O
certainly	O
performed	O
to	O
a	O
tittle	O

for	O
although	O
I	O
could	O
easily	O
understand	O
every	O

since	O
I	O
entered	O
England	PNM

three	O
parts	O
in	O
four	O
of	O

to	O
me	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
spoken	O
in	O
Arabic	PNM
or	O
Irish	O

He	O
was	O
a	O
middle-sized	O
man	O
,	O
and	O
stooped	O
very	O
much	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
above	O
the	O
age	O
of	O
forty	O
;	O
his	O
face	O
was	O
frightfully	O
pitted	O
with	O
the	O
small-pox	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
mouth	O
extended	O
from	O
ear	O
to	O
ear	O

He	O
was	O
dressed	O
in	O
a	O
night-gown	O
of	O
plaid	O
,	O
fastened	O
about	O
his	O
middle	O
with	O
a	O

and	O
a	O
tie-periwig	O
with	O
a	O
foretop	O
three	O

the	O

him	O

very	O
courteously	O

he	O
inquired	O
of	O
him	O
who	O
I	O
was	O
;	O
and	O
being	O
informed	O
,	O
he	O
took	O
me	O
by	O
the	O
hand	O
,	O
telling	O
me	O

was	O
at	O
school	O
with	O
my	O

When	O
he	O
understood	O
my	O
situation	O
,	O
he	O
assured	O
me	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
do	O
me	O
all	O
the	O
service	O
in	O
his	O
power	O
,	O
both	O
by	O
his	O
advice	O
and	O
otherwise	O

and	O
while	O
he	O
spoke	O
these	O

me	O
with	O
great	O
attention	O

walking	O
round	O

several	O

I	O
pulled	O
out	O

told	O

good	O
fortune	O
attended	O
me	O
still	O

in	O
less	O

thirty	O

for	O
as	O

lost	O
they	O
grew	O
the	O
keener	O

doubled	O
stakes	O
every	O

At	O
last	O
the	O

began	O

we	O
were	O

all	O
our	O

about	O
forty	O
shillings	O
of	O
our	O
own	O

This	O
loss	O
mortified	O
me	O
extremely	O

and	O
had	O
a	O
visible	O
effect	O
on	O
the	O
muscles	O
of	O
Strap	O

face	O

which	O
lengthened	O
apace	O

our	O
antagonists	O
perceiving	O

kindly	O
permitted	O

console	O
ourselves	O
with	O

my	O
companion	O
wisely	O
suggested	O
it	O
was	O
time	O
to	O
be	O
gone	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
the	O
person	O
who	O
had	O
joined	O
us	O
in	O
the	O
house	O
began	O
to	O
curse	O
the	O
cards	O

muttered	O
that	O

fortune	O
only	O

what	O

got	O

nettled	O
me	O

a	O
game	O

some	O

In	O
the	O
morning	O
I	O
rose	O
and	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
of	O
rendezvous	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
waited	O
two	O
hours	O
in	O
vain	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
so	O
exasperated	O
against	O
him	O
for	O
breaking	O
his	O
appointment	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
set	O
out	O
for	O
the	O
city	O
by	O
myself	O
,	O
in	O
hope	O
of	O
finding	O
the	O
villain	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
revenged	O
on	O
him	O
for	O
his	O
breach	O
of	O
promise	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
I	O
found	O
myself	O
at	O
the	O
Navy	O
Office	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
entered	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
crowds	O
of	O
young	O
fellows	O
walking	O
below	O
,	O
many	O
of	O
whom	O
made	O
no	O
better	O
appearance	O
than	O
myself	O
.	O

I	O
consulted	O
the	O
physiognomy	O
of	O
each	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
made	O
up	O
to	O
one	O
whose	O
countenance	O
I	O
liked	O
,	O
and	O
asked	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
could	O
instruct	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
the	O
letter	O
which	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
sent	O
to	O
the	O
Board	O
to	O
obtain	O
an	O
order	O
for	O
examination	O
?	O

He	O
answered	O
me	O
in	O
broad	O
Scotch	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
show	O
me	O
the	O
copy	O
of	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
writ	O
for	O
himself	O
,	O
by	O
direction	O
of	O
another	O
who	O
know	O
the	O
form	O
,	O
and	O
accordingly	O
pulled	O
it	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
pocket	O
for	O
my	O
perusal	O
;	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
expeditious	O
,	O
I	O
might	O
send	O
it	O
into	O
the	O
Board	O
before	O
dinner	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
did	O
no	O
business	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
.	O

He	O
then	O
went	O
with	O
me	O
to	O
coffee-house	O
hard	O
by	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
wrote	O
the	O
letter	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
immediately	O
delivered	O
to	O
the	O
messenger	O
,	O
who	O
told	O
me	O
I	O
might	O
expect	O
an	O
order	O
to-morrow	O
about	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
.	O

Having	O
transacted	O
this	O
piece	O
of	O
business	O
,	O
my	O
mind	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
deal	O
composed	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
so	O
much	O
civility	O
from	O
the	O
stranger	O
,	O
I	O
desired	O
further	O
acquaintance	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
fully	O
resolved	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
deceived	O
by	O
him	O
so	O
much	O
to	O
my	O
prejudice	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
by	O
the	O
beau	O
.	O

He	O
agreed	O
to	O
dine	O
with	O
me	O
at	O
the	O
cook	O
's	O
shop	O
which	O
I	O
frequented	O
;	O
and	O
on	O
our	O
way	O
thither	O
carried	O
me	O
to	O
`	O
Change	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
hopes	O
of	O
finding	O
Mr.	O
Jackson	O
-LRB-	O
for	O
that	O
was	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
the	O
person	O
who	O
had	O
broke	O
his	O
appointment	O
-RRB-	O
,	O
I	O
sought	O
him	O
there	O
to	O
no	O
purpose	O
,	O
and	O
on	O
our	O
way	O
towards	O
the	O
other	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
town	O
imparted	O
to	O
my	O
companion	O
his	O
behaviour	O
towards	O
me	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
he	O
gave	O
me	O
to	O
understand	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
no	O
stranger	O
to	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
Bean	PNM
Jackson	PNM
-LRB-	O
so	O
he	O
was	O
called	O
at	O
the	O
Navy	PNM
Office	PNM
-RRB-	O
,	O
although	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
him	O
personally	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
the	O
character	O
of	O
a	O
good-natured	O
careless	O
fellow	O
,	O
who	O
made	O
no	O
scruple	O
of	O
borrowing	O
from	O
any	O
that	O
would	O
lend	O
;	O
that	O
most	O
people	O
who	O
knew	O
him	O
believed	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
good	O
principle	O
at	O
bottom	O
,	O
but	O
his	O
extravagance	O
was	O
such	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
probably	O
never	O
have	O
it	O
in	O
his	O
power	O
to	O
manifest	O
the	O
honesty	O
of	O
his	O
intention	O
.	O

This	O
made	O
me	O
sweat	O
for	O
my	O
five	O
shillings	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
nevertheless	O
did	O
not	O
altogether	O
despair	O
of	O
recovering	O
,	O
provided	O
I	O
could	O
find	O
out	O
the	O
debtor	O
.	O

This	O
young	O
man	O
likewise	O
added	O
another	O
circumstance	O
of	O
Squire	O
Jackson	O
's	O
history	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
being	O
destitute	O
of	O
all	O
means	O
to	O
equip	O
himself	O
for	O
sea	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
received	O
his	O
last	O
warrant	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
recommended	O
to	O
a	O
person	O
who	O
lent	O
him	O
a	O
little	O
money	O
,	O
after	O
he	O
had	O
signed	O
a	O
will	O
entitling	O
that	O
person	O
to	O
lift	O
his	O
wages	O
when	O
they	O
should	O
become	O
due	O
,	O
as	O
also	O
to	O
inherit	O
his	O
effects	O
in	O
case	O
of	O
his	O
death	O
.	O

That	O
he	O
was	O
still	O
under	O
the	O
tutorage	O
and	O
direction	O
of	O
that	O
gentleman	O
,	O
who	O
advanced	O
him	O
small	O
sums	O
from	O
time	O
to	O
time	O
upon	O
this	O
security	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
rate	O
of	O
fifty	O
per	O
cent	O
.	O

But	O
at	O
present	O
his	O
credit	O
was	O
very	O
low	O
,	O
because	O
his	O
funds	O
would	O
do	O
little	O
more	O
than	O
pay	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
already	O
received	O
,	O
this	O
moderate	O
interest	O
included	O
.	O

After	O
the	O
stranger	O
-LRB-	O
whose	O
name	O
was	O
Thompson	O
-RRB-	O
had	O
entertained	O
me	O
with	O
this	O
account	O
of	O
Jackson	O
,	O
he	O
informed	O
me	O
that	O
he	O
himself	O
had	O
passed	O
for	O
third	O
mate	O
of	O
a	O
third-rate	O
,	O
about	O
four	O
months	O
ago	O
;	O
since	O
which	O
time	O
he	O
had	O
constantly	O
attended	O
at	O
the	O
Navy	O
Office	O
,	O
in	O
hope	O
of	O
a	O
warrant	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
assured	O
from	O
the	O
beginning	O
,	O
both	O
by	O
a	O
Scotch	O
member	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
commissioners	O
to	O
whom	O
the	O
member	O
recommended	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
put	O
into	O
the	O
first	O
vacancy	O
;	O
notwithstanding	O
which	O
promise	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
the	O
mortification	O
to	O
see	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
appointed	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
station	O
almost	O
every	O
week	O
--	O
that	O
now	O
being	O
utterly	O
impoverished	O
,	O
his	O
sole	O
hope	O
consisted	O
in	O
the	O
promise	O
of	O
a	O
friend	O
lately	O
come	O
to	O
town	O
,	O
to	O
lend	O
him	O
a	O
small	O
matter	O

for	O
a	O
present	O
to	O
the	O
secretary	O
;	O
without	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
persuaded	O
he	O
might	O
wait	O
a	O
thousand	O
years	O
to	O
no	O
purpose	O
.	O

I	O
conceived	O
a	O
mighty	O
liking	O
for	O
this	O
young	O
fellow	O
,	O
which	O
-LRB-	O
I	O
believe	O
-RRB-	O
proceeded	O
from	O
the	O
similitude	O
of	O
our	O
fortunes	O
.	O

We	O
spent	O
the	O
whole	O
day	O
together	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
he	O
lived	O
at	O
Wapping	O
I	O
desired	O
him	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
share	O
of	O
my	O
bed	O
.	O

Next	O
day	O
we	O
returned	O
to	O
the	O
Navy	O
Office	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
after	O
being	O
called	O
before	O
the	O
Board	O
,	O
and	O
questioned	O
about	O
the	O
place	O
of	O
my	O
nativity	O
and	O
education	O
,	O
they	O
ordered	O
a	O
letter	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
out	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
upon	O
paying	O
half-a-crown	O
to	O
the	O
clerk	O
,	O
I	O
received	O
,	O
and	O
delivered	O
into	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
the	O
clerk	O
at	O
Surgeons	PNM
'	O
Hall	O
,	O
together	O
with	O
a	O
shilling	O
for	O
his	O
trouble	O
in	O
registering	O
my	O
name	O

By	O
this	O
time	O
my	O
whole	O
stock	O
was	O
diminished	O
to	O
two	O
shillings	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
saw	O
not	O
the	O
least	O
prospect	O
of	O
relief	O
,	O
even	O
for	O
present	O
subsistence	O
,	O
much	O
less	O
to	O
enable	O
me	O
to	O
pay	O
the	O
fees	O
at	O
Surgeons	O

Hall	O
for	O
my	O
examination	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
come	O
on	O
in	O
a	O
fortnight	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
state	O
of	O
perplexity	O
,	O
I	O
consulted	O
Strap	O
,	O
who	O
assured	O
me	O
he	O
would	O
pawn	O
everything	O
he	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
,	O
even	O
to	O
his	O
razors	O
,	O
before	O
I	O
should	O
want	O
:	O
but	O
this	O
expedient	O
I	O
absolutely	O
rejected	O
,	O
telling	O
him	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
a	O
thousand	O
times	O
rather	O
list	O
for	O
a	O
soldier	O
,	O
of	O

I	O
had	O
some	O

At	O
the	O
word	O

he	O
grew	O
pale	O
as	O

me	O
as	O
a	O
journeyman	O
I	O
would	O
most	O
willingly	O
have	O
gone	O
home	O
to	O
sleep	O

but	O
was	O
told	O
by	O
my	O

that	O
we	O

letters	O
of	O
qualification	O
at	O
the	O
Navy	O

before	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
thither	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
secretary	O
,	O
who	O
opened	O
and	O
read	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
mightily	O
pleased	O
to	O
find	O
myself	O
qualified	O
for	O
second	O
mate	O
of	O
a	O
third-rate	O

When	O
he	O
had	O
stuck	O
them	O
all	O
together	O
on	O
a	O
file	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
company	O
asked	O
if	O
there	O
were	O
any	O
vacancies	O
;	O
to	O
which	O
interrogation	O
he	O
answered	O
``	O
No	O
!	O
''	O

Then	O
I	O
ventured	O
to	O
inquire	O
if	O
many	O
ships	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
put	O
in	O
commission	O
soon	O
.	O

At	O
which	O
question	O
he	O
surveyed	O
me	O
with	O
a	O
look	O
of	O
ineffable	O
contempt	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
pushing	O
us	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
office	O
,	O
locked	O
the	O
door	O
without	O
deigning	O
us	O
another	O
word	O

We	O
went	O
down	O
stairs	O
,	O
and	O
conferred	O
together	O
on	O
our	O
expectations	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
understood	O
that	O
each	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
been	O
recommended	O
to	O
one	O
or	O
other	O
of	O
the	O
commissioners	O
,	O
and	O
each	O
of	O
them	O
promised	O
the	O
first	O
vacancy	O
that	O
should	O
fall	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
relied	O
solely	O
upon	O
that	O
interest	O
,	O
without	O
a	O
present	O
to	O
the	O
secretary	O
,	O
with	O
whom	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
commissioners	O
went	O
snacks	O
.	O

For	O
which	O
reason	O
,	O
each	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
provided	O
a	O
small	O
purse	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
asked	O
what	O
I	O
proposed	O
to	O
give	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
vexatious	O
question	O
to	O
me	O
who	O
-LRB-	O
far	O
from	O
being	O
in	O
a	O
capacity	O
to	O
gratify	O
a	O
ravenous	O
secretary	O
-RRB-	O
had	O
not	O
wherewithal	O
to	O
purchase	O
a	O
dinner	O

I	O
therefore	O
answered	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
yet	O
determined	O
what	O
to	O
give	O
;	O
and	O
sneaked	O
off	O
toward	O
my	O
own	O
lodging	O
,	O
lamenting	O
my	O
fate	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
inveighing	O
with	O
much	O
bitterness	O
against	O
the	O
barbarity	O
of	O
my	O
grandfather	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sordid	O
avarice	O
of	O
my	O
relations	O

who	O
left	O
me	O
a	O
prey	O
to	O
contempt	O
and	O
indigence	O

Full	O
of	O
these	O
disagreeable	O
reflections	O
,	O
I	O
arrived	O
at	O
the	O
house	O
where	O
I	O
lodged	O

and	O
relieved	O
my	O
landlord	O
from	O
great	O
anxiety	O
on	O
my	O
account	O
;	O
for	O
this	O
honest	O

had	O
met	O
with	O
some	O
dismal	O

and	O
that	O

never	O

been	O
abroad	O

and	O
after	O
having	O
obtained	O
leave	O
of	O
his	O

had	O
gone	O
in	O
quest	O
of	O
me	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
was	O
even	O
more	O
ignorant	O
of	O
the	O

I.	O
Not	O
being	O
willing	O
to	O
inform	O
the	O

an	O
acquaintance	O
at	O

with	O

therefore	O

who	O
entered	O
my	O
chamber	O
about	O
three	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O

and	O
presented	O
a	O

this	O

was	O
in	O

make	O
a	O
noise	O

which	O
only	O
yielded	O
mirth	O

to	O

off	O

accomplished	O
with	O

energy	O
an	O
observation	O

The	O

was	O

in	O
by	O

who	O
not	O

I	O
could	O
not	O

I	O
could	O

From	O
this	O

she	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
shop	O
fifty	O
times	O
,	O
every	O
day	O
upon	O
various	O
pretences	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
in	O

so	O
many	O
ridiculous	O
airs	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
easily	O
perceive	O
her	O
opinion	O
of	O
me	O
was	O
changed	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
she	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
me	O
altogether	O
an	O
unworthy	O
conquest	O
.	O

But	O
my	O
heart	O
was	O
so	O
steeled	O
against	O
her	O
charms	O
by	O
pride	O
and	O
resentment	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
two	O
chief	O
ingredients	O
in	O
my	O

that	O
I	O
remained	O
insensible	O
to	O
all	O

could	O

This	O
neglect	O
soon	O
banished	O
all	O
the	O
favourable	O
impressions	O
she	O
felt	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
rage	O
of	O
a	O
slighted	O
woman	O
took	O
place	O
in	O
her	O
heart	O
;	O
this	O
she	O
manifested	O
not	O
only	O
in	O
all	O
the	O

One	O
day	O
in	O

owed	O
not	O
to	O
any	O
esteem	O
or	O
consideration	O
she	O
had	O
for	O
me	O

solely	O
to	O
the	O
desire	O
of	O
mortifying	O
her	O

who	O
on	O
this	O

the	O

more	O

for	O
the	O

it	O
was	O

the	O

my	O
breast-bone	O

and	O
the	O
point	O
remained	O
sticking	O
in	O
the	O
skin	O

When	O
I	O
reflected	O
upon	O
this	O
event	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
persuade	O
myself	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
assaulted	O
by	O
a	O
common	O
footpad	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
usual	O
for	O
such	O
people	O
to	O
murder	O
though	O
they	O
rob	O
,	O
especially	O
when	O
they	O
meet	O
with	O
no	O
resistance	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
found	O
my	O
money	O
,	O
and	O
everything	O
else	O
about	O
me	O
but	O
my	O
carcase	O
,	O
safe	O
.	O

I	O
concluded	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
must	O
either	O
have	O
been	O
mistaken	O
for	O
another	O
,	O
or	O
obliged	O
to	O
the	O
private	O
resentment	O
of	O
some	O
secret	O
enemy	O
for	O
what	O
had	O
happened	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
remember	O
nobody	O
who	O
had	O
the	O
least	O
cause	O
of	O
complaint	O
against	O
me	O
,	O
except	O
Captain	O
O'Donnell	O
and	O
my	O
master	O
's	O
daughter	O
,	O
my	O
suspicion	O
settled	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
took	O
care	O
to	O
conceal	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
the	O
sooner	O
arrive	O
at	O
confirmation	O
.	O

With	O
this	O
view	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
home	O
in	O
the	O
chair	O
about	O
ten	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
the	O
chairman	O
supported	O
me	O
into	O
the	O
house	O
,	O
met	O
the	O
captain	O
in	O
the	O
passage	O
,	O
who	O
no	O
sooner	O
saw	O
me	O
than	O
he	O
started	O
back	O
and	O
gave	O
evident	O
signs	O
of	O
guilty	O
confusion	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
accounted	O
for	O
from	O
surprise	O
occasioned	O
by	O
the	O
seeing	O
me	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
condition	O
.	O

My	O
master	O
having	O
heard	O
my	O
story	O
,	O
condoled	O
me	O
with	O
a	O
good	O
deal	O
of	O
sympathy	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
he	O
understood	O
my	O
wounds	O
were	O
not	O
dangerous	O
,	O
ordered	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
carried	O
upstairs	O
to	O
bed	O
;	O
though	O
not	O
without	O
some	O
opposition	O
from	O
his	O
wife	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
of	O
opinion	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
better	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
an	O
hospital	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
more	O
carefully	O
attended	O
.	O

My	O
meditation	O
was	O
employed	O
in	O
concerting	O
with	O
myself	O
some	O
method	O
of	O
revenge	O
against	O
Squire	O
O'Donnell	O
and	O
his	O
inamorata	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
looked	O
upon	O
as	O
the	O
author	O
of	O
my	O
misfortune	O
;	O
when	O
miss	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
not	O
at	O
home	O
at	O
my	O
arrival	O
,	O
entered	O
my	O
chamber	O
,	O
and	O
saying	O
she	O
was	O
sorry	O
for	O
the	O
accident	O
that	O
had	O
befallen	O
me	O
,	O
asked	O
if	O
I	O
suspected	O
anybody	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
assassin	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
I	O
fixed	O
my	O
eyes	O
steadfastly	O
upon	O
her	O
and	O
answered	O
,	O
``	O
Yes	O
.	O
''	O

She	O
discovered	O
no	O
symptom	O
of	O
confusion	O
,	O
but	O
replied	O
hastily	O
,	O
``	O
If	O
that	O
be	O
the	O
case	O

This	O
frankness	O
not	O
only	O
cured	O
me	O
of	O
my	O
suspicion	O
with	O
respect	O
to	O
her	O
,	O
but	O
even	O
staggered	O
my	O
belief	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
of	O
whose	O
guilt	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
have	O
further	O
proof	O
before	O
I	O
should	O
enterprise	O
anything	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
revenge	O
.	O

I	O
thanked	O
her	O
kindly	O
for	O
her	O
generous	O
offer	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
occasion	O
to	O
accept	O
,	O
being	O
determined	O
to	O
do	O
nothing	O
rashly	O
:	O
for	O
though	O
I	O
could	O
plainly	O
perceive	O
the	O
person	O
who	O
attacked	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
soldier	O
,	O
whose	O
face	O
I	O
thought	O
was	O
familiar	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
swear	O
with	O
a	O
safe	O
conscience	O
to	O
any	O
particular	O
man	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
granting	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
my	O
prosecution	O
of	O
him	O
would	O
not	O
much	O
avail	O
.	O

This	O
uncertainty	O
I	O
pretended	O
,	O
lest	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
hearing	O
from	O
her	O
that	O
I	O
knew	O
the	O
person	O
who	O
wounded	O
me	O
,	O
might	O
think	O
proper	O
to	O
withdraw	O
before	O
I	O
could	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
condition	O
to	O
requite	O
him	O
.	O

In	O
two	O
days	O
I	O
was	O
up	O
and	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
a	O
little	O
business	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Lavement	O
made	O
shift	O
to	O
carry	O
on	O
his	O
practice	O
without	O
hiring	O
another	O
journeyman	O
in	O
my	O
room	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
thing	O
I	O
attempted	O
towards	O
a	O
certain	O
discovery	O
of	O
my	O
secret	O
enemy	O
,	O
was	O
to	O
get	O
into	O
O'Donnell	O
's	O
apartment	O
,	O
while	O
he	O
was	O
abroad	O
in	O
an	O
undress	O
,	O
and	O
examine	O
his	O
sword	O
,	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
which	O
being	O
broken	O
off	O
,	O
I	O
applied	O
the	O
fragment	O
that	O
was	O
found	O
sticking	O
in	O
my	O
body	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
it	O
answered	O
the	O
fractured	O
part	O
exactly	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
no	O
room	O
left	O
for	O
doubt	O
;	O
and	O
all	O
that	O
remained	O
was	O
to	O
fix	O
upon	O
a	O
scheme	O
of	O
revenge	O
,	O
which	O
almost	O
solely	O
engrossed	O
my	O
thoughts	O
during	O
the	O
space	O
of	O
eight	O
nights	O
and	O
days	O
.	O

Sometimes	O
I	O
was	O
tempted	O
to	O
fall	O
upon	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
manner	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
practised	O
upon	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
kill	O
him	O
outright	O
.	O

But	O
this	O
assault	O
my	O
honour	O
opposed	O
as	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
barbarous	O
cowardice	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
imitated	O
.	O

At	O
other	O
times	O
I	O
entertained	O
thoughts	O
of	O
demanding	O
satisfaction	O
in	O
an	O
honourable	O
way	O
;	O
but	O
was	O
diverted	O
from	O
this	O
undertaking	O
by	O
considering	O
the	O
uncertainty	O
of	O
the	O
event	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
injury	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
me	O
,	O
which	O
did	O
not	O
entitle	O
him	O
to	O
such	O
easy	O
terms	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
I	O
determined	O
to	O
pursue	O
a	O
middle	O
course	O
,	O
and	O
actually	O
put	O
my	O
design	O
in	O
execution	O
after	O
this	O
manner	O

secured	O
the	O
assistance	O

By	O
the	O

a	O

thought	O
it	O
high	O

for	O

his	O
retreat	O

performed	O
in	O
one	O
night	O

he	O
disappeared	O

Mr.	O
Lavement	O
,	O
for	O
his	O

took	O
into	O
his	O
custody	O
a	O
large	O
old	O
trunk	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
left	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
heavy	O
,	O
made	O
no	O

him	O
for	O
what	O

in	O

But	O
a	O
month	O
being	O
elapsed	O
without	O
hearing	O
any	O

of	O
this	O
adventurer	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
master	O
being	O
impatient	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
the	O
trunk	O
contained	O
,	O
he	O
ordered	O
me	O
to	O
break	O
it	O
open	O
in	O
his	O
presence	O
,	O
which	O
task	O
I	O
performed	O
with	O
the	O
pestle	O
of	O
our	O

and	O
discovered	O

to	O
his	O

a	O
heap	O
of	O
stones	O

About	O
this	O

my	O
friend	O

informed	O
me	O
of	O
an	O
offer	O
he	O
had	O
to	O
go	O
abroad	O
with	O
a	O
gentleman	O
in	O
quality	O
of	O
valet	O
de	O
chambre	O
and	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
assured	O
me	O
that	O
,	O
whatever	O
advantage	O
he	O
might	O
propose	O
to	O
himself	O
from	O

the	O
obligations	O
I	O
owed	O
to	O
this	O
poor	O

ingratitude	O
is	O
so	O
natural	O
to	O
the	O
heart	O
of	O
man	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
tired	O
of	O
his	O
acquaintance	O
:	O
and	O
now	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
contracted	O
other	O
friendships	O
which	O
appeared	O
more	O
creditable	O

was	O
even	O
ashamed	O
to	O

inquiring	O

me	O
with	O
the	O

I	O
therefore	O
,	O
on	O
pretence	O
of	O
consulting	O
his	O

insisted	O
upon	O
his	O
accepting	O
the	O
proposal	O

which	O
he	O
at	O

determined	O
to	O
embrace	O
,	O
with	O
great	O
reluctance	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
,	O
took	O
his	O
leave	O
of	O
me	O

shedding	O
a	O
flood	O
of	O
tears	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
behold	O
without	O
emotion	O

I	O
now	O
began	O
to	O
look	O
upon	O
me	O
as	O
of	O
a	O
gentleman	O
in	O
reality	O
;	O
learned	O
to	O
dance	O

frequented	O
plays	O
during	O

an	O
ale-house	O

where	O
every	O
dispute	O
was	O
referred	O
to	O
my	O
decision	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
length	O
contracted	O
an	O
acquaintance	O
with	O
a	O

who	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
make	O
a	O

upon	O

Squire	O

who	O
by	O

a	O

in	O
the	O
army	O

and	O
such	O
a	O
martial	O
ferocity	O
in	O
his	O
appearance	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
afraid	O
he	O
would	O
remember	O
what	O
happened	O
between	O

in	O
Scotland	O

and	O
atone	O
for	O
his	O

;	O

whether	O

willing	O
to	O
make	O

betrayed	O
not	O
the	O

symptom	O
of	O

at	O

and	O
I	O
remained	O

cured	O
of	O
my	O

though	O
I	O
had	O
occasion	O
not	O
long	O

to	O
be	O
convinced	O

that	O
howsoever	O
his	O

at	O

the	O

individual	O
Gawky	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
have	O
already	O
described	O

For	O
coming	O
home	O
late	O
one	O
night	O
from	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
a	O
patient	O
,	O
I	O
heard	O
a	O
noise	O
in	O
the	O
street	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
I	O
approached	O
,	O
perceived	O
two	O
gentlemen	O
in	O
custody	O
,	O
of	O
three	O
watchmen	O
.	O

The	O
prisoners	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
miserable	O
,	O
disfigured	O
with	O
dirt	O
,	O
complained	O
bitterly	O
of	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
their	O
hats	O
and	O
wigs	O
;	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
whom	O
by	O
his	O
tongue	O
I	O
know	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
Scotchman	O
,	O
lamented	O
most	O
piteously	O
,	O
offering	O
a	O
guinea	O
for	O
his	O
liberty	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
watchman	O
refused	O
,	O
alleging	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
companions	O
was	O
wounded	O
grievously	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
must	O
stand	O
to	O
the	O
consequence	O

My	O
prejudice	O
in	O
favour	O
of	O
my	O
native	O
country	O
was	O
so	O
strong	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
bear	O
to	O
see	O
anybody	O
belonging	O
to	O
it	O
in	O
distress	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
,	O
with	O
one	O
blow	O
of	O
my	O
faithful	O
cudgel	O
,	O
knocked	O
down	O
the	O
watchman	O
who	O
had	O
hold	O
of	O
the	O
person	O
for	O
whom	O
I	O
was	O
chiefly	O
concerned	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
no	O
sooner	O
disengaged	O
,	O
than	O
he	O
betook	O
himself	O
to	O
his	O
heels	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
me	O
to	O
maintain	O
the	O
dispute	O
as	O
I	O
should	O
think	O
proper	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
I	O
came	O
off	O
but	O
scurvily	O
,	O
for	O
,	O
before	O
I	O
could	O
avail	O
myself	O
of	O
my	O
speed	O
,	O
I	O
received	O
a	O
blow	O
on	O
the	O
eye	O
,	O
from	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
,	O
that	O
had	O
well	O
nigh	O
deprived	O
me	O
of	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
that	O
organ	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
shift	O
to	O
get	O
home	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
informed	O
of	O
Captain	O
Gawky	O
's	O
being	O
robbed	O
and	O
abused	O
by	O
a	O
company	O
of	O
footpads	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
ordered	O
by	O
my	O
master	O
to	O
prepare	O
an	O
emollient	O
glyster	O
and	O
paregoric	O
draught	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
allay	O
and	O
compose	O
the	O
ferment	O
of	O
his	O
spirits	O
,	O
occasioned	O
by	O
the	O
barbarous	O
treatment	O
he	O
had	O
undergone	O
,	O
while	O
he	O
took	O
twelve	O
ounces	O
of	O
blood	O
from	O
him	O
immediately	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
inquired	O
into	O
the	O
particulars	O
of	O
this	O
adventure	O
,	O
and	O
understood	O
by	O
the	O
servant	O
that	O
he	O
came	O
in	O
just	O
before	O
me	O
,	O
without	O
hat	O
and	O
wig	O
,	O
I	O
made	O
no	O
scruple	O
of	O
believing	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
person	O
I	O
had	O
released	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
confirmed	O
in	O
my	O
belief	O
upon	O
hearing	O
his	O
voice	O

to	O
which	O
-LRB-	O
before	O
that	O

I	O
had	O

My	O

being	O
considerably	O
swelled	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
reflect	O
upon	O
my	O
enterprise	O
without	O
cursing	O
my	O

folly	O

and	O
even	O
resolving	O
to	O
declare	O
the	O
truth	O
the	O
truth	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
story	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
be	O
revenged	O
on	O
the	O
cowardly	O
wretch	O
for	O
whom	O
I	O
had	O
suffered	O
:	O
accordingly	O

next	O
day	O
after	O
he	O
had	O

in	O

of	O
my	O
master	O

his	O
wife	O

who	O
came	O
to	O
him	O

a	O
thousand	O
lies	O
concerning	O
the	O
prowess	O
he	O
had	O
shown	O
in	O
making	O
his	O

I	O
ventured	O
to	O
explain	O
the	O

calling	O
in	O
the	O

of	O
my	O

upbraided	O
him	O
with	O
cowardice	O

ingratitude	O

Gawky	O
was	O
so	O
astonished	O
at	O
this	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
answer	O
one	O
word	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
company	O
stared	O
at	O
one	O
another	O

at	O
length	O
my	O
mistress	O
reprimanded	O
me	O
for	O
my	O
insolent	O
behaviour	O

threatened	O
to	O
turn	O
me	O

for	O

presumption	O

Upon	O
which	O
,	O
Gawky	O
-LRB-	O
having	O
recollected	O
himself	O

observed	O

as	O
the	O

with	O

drew	O

fired	O
it	O
at	O

In	O
this	O

But	O
to	O
return	O
to	O
my	O
unfortunate	O
story	O
.	O

After	O
some	O
months	O
,	O
the	O
visits	O
of	O
my	O
lover	O
became	O
less	O
frequent	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
behaviour	O
less	O
warm	O
:	O
I	O
perceived	O
his	O
coldness	O
,	O
my	O
heart	O
took	O
the	O
alarm	O
,	O
my	O
tears	O
reproached	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
insisted	O
upon	O
the	O
performance	O
of	O
his	O
promise	O
to	O
espouse	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
whatever	O
should	O
happen	O
,	O
my	O
reputation	O
might	O
be	O
safe	O
.	O

He	O
seemed	O
to	O
acquiesce	O
in	O
my	O
proposal	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
me	O
on	O
pretence	O
of	O
finding	O
a	O
proper	O
clergyman	O
to	O
unite	O
us	O
in	O
the	O
bands	O
of	O
wedlock	O
.	O

But	O
alas	O
!	O

the	O
inconstant	O
had	O
no	O
intention	O
to	O
return	O
.	O

I	O
waited	O
a	O
whole	O
week	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
impatience	O
;	O
sometimes	O
doubting	O
his	O
honour	O
,	O
at	O
other	O
times	O
inventing	O
excuses	O
for	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
condemning	O
myself	O
for	O
harbouring	O
suspicions	O
of	O
his	O
faith	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
I	O
understood	O
from	O
a	O
gentleman	O
who	O
dined	O
at	O
our	O
house	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
perfidious	O
wretch	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
setting	O
out	O
for	O
London	PNM
with	O
his	O
bride	O
,	O
to	O
buy	O
clothes	O
for	O
their	O
approaching	O
nuptials	O
.	O

This	O
information	O
distracted	O
me	O
!	O

Rage	O
took	O
possession	O
of	O
my	O
soul	O
;	O
I	O
denounced	O
a	O
thousand	O
imprecations	O
,	O
and	O
formed	O
as	O
many	O
schemes	O
of	O
revenge	O
against	O
the	O
traitor	O
who	O
had	O
undone	O
me	O
.	O

Then	O
my	O
resentment	O
would	O
subside	O
to	O
silent	O
sorrow	O
.	O

I	O
recalled	O
the	O
tranquillity	O
I	O
lost	O
,	O
I	O
wept	O
over	O
my	O
infatuation	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
a	O
ray	O
of	O
hope	O
would	O
intervene	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
a	O
moment	O
cheer	O
my	O
drooping	O
heart	O
;	O
I	O
would	O
revolve	O
all	O
the	O
favourable	O
circumstances	O
of	O
his	O
character	O
,	O
repeat	O
the	O
vows	O
he	O
made	O
,	O
ascribe	O
his	O
absence	O
to	O
the	O
vigilance	O
of	O
a	O
suspicious	O
father	O
who	O
compelled	O
him	O
to	O
a	O
match	O
his	O
soul	O
abhorred	O
,	O
and	O
comfort	O
myself	O
with	O
the	O
expectation	O
of	O
seeing	O
him	O
before	O
the	O
thing	O
should	O
be	O
brought	O
to	O
any	O
terms	O
of	O
agreement	O
.	O

But	O
how	O
vain	O
was	O
my	O
imagination	O
!	O

That	O
villain	O
left	O
me	O
without	O
remorse	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
the	O
news	O
of	O
his	O
marriage	O
were	O
spread	O
all	O
over	O
the	O

My	O
horror	O
was	O
then	O

;	O
and	O
had	O
not	O
the	O

should	O
infallibly	O

put	O
an	O
end	O
to	O
my	O

life	O

My	O

my	O
despair	O

I	O
saw	O
his	O

my	O

up	O
the	O

would	O

have	O
used	O
it	O
in	O

of	O
the	O

without	O
any	O

to	O
the	O

she	O
desired	O

we	O
adjourned	O
into	O
the	O

called	O
for	O
a	O
bottle	O

my	O

Drury	O

as	O

they	O
set	O
out	O
with	O
me	O
in	O
a	O
hackney-coach	O
without	O

after	O
I	O

flattered	O
then	O
with	O
hopes	O
of	O
seeing	O
a	O

for	O

an	O

Accordingly	O

the	O

As	O
we	O

the	O

our	O

to	O
a	O

with	O
whom	O
I	O
supped	O
in	O
a	O

In	O
the	O
morning	O

when	O
I	O
awoke	O

I	O
found	O
my	O

had	O
got	O
up	O

and	O
,	O
drawing	O
aside	O
the	O
curtain	O
,	O
could	O
not	O
perceive	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
room	O

I	O
waited	O
a	O
full	O
hour	O
for	O
his	O
return	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
in	O
the	O
greatest	O
perplexity	O
,	O
rose	O
up	O

rang	O
the	O
bell	O

When	O
the	O
waiter	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
door	O

he	O
found	O
it	O
locked	O

and	O
desired	O
admittance	O

which	O
I	O
granted	O
,	O
after	O
observing	O

with	O
great	O
surprise	O

that	O
the	O
key	O
remained	O
on	O

when	O
we	O
went	O
to	O

I	O
no	O

captain	O

the	O
fellow	O

staring	O
with	O
a	O

cried	O
,	O
``	O
How	O

madam	O

''	O

And	O
when	O
he	O
was	O
satisfied	O
as	O
to	O
that	O
particular	O
,	O
ran	O
into	O
a	O
closet	O
adjoining	O
to	O
the	O
chamber	O

the	O
window	O
of	O
which	O
he	O
found	O
open	O

Through	O
this	O
the	O
adventurer	O
had	O
got	O
upon	O
a	O
wall	O

whence	O
he	O
dropped	O
down	O
into	O
a	O
court	O
and	O
escaped	O
,	O
leaving	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
answerable	O
not	O
only	O
for	O
the	O
reckoning	O

but	O
also	O
for	O
a	O
large	O
silver	O
tankard	O

which	O
he	O
had	O
carried	O
off	O

`	O
It	O
is	O
impossible	O
to	O
describe	O
the	O
consternation	O
I	O
was	O
under	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
saw	O
myself	O
detained	O
as	O
a	O
thief	O
's	O
accomplice	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
looked	O
upon	O
in	O
that	O
light	O

and	O
carried	O
before	O
a	O
justice	O
,	O
who	O
mistaking	O
my	O
confusion	O
for	O
a	O
sign	O
of	O

committed	O
me	O

after	O
a	O
short	O
examination	O

to	O

admonished	O
me	O

my	O
life	O
,	O
to	O
turn	O

and	O
impeach	O
my	O

I	O
now	O
concluded	O
the	O
vengeance	O
of	O
Heaven	O
had	O
overtaken	O
me	O

and	O
that	O
I	O
must	O
soon	O
finish	O
my	O
career	O
by	O
an	O
ignominious	O
death	O

This	O
reflection	O
sank	O
so	O
deep	O
into	O
my	O
soul	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
for	O
some	O
days	O
deprived	O
of	O
my	O
reason	O
,	O
and	O
actually	O
believed	O
myself	O
in	O
hell	O
,	O
tormented	O
by	O
fiends	O

Indeed	O
,	O
there	O
needs	O
not	O
a	O
very	O
extravagant	O
imagination	O
to	O
form	O
that	O
idea	O
:	O
for	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
scenes	O
on	O
earth	O
that	O
of	O
Bridewell	PNM
approaches	O
nearest	O
the	O
notion	O
I	O
had	O
always	O
entertained	O
of	O
the	O
regions	O

Here	O
I	O
saw	O
nothing	O
but	O
rage	O
,	O
anguish	O
and	O
impiety	O
,	O
and	O
heard	O
nothing	O
but	O
groans	O
,	O
curses	O
,	O
and	O
blasphemy	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
midst	O
of	O
this	O
hellish	O
crew	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
subjected	O
to	O
the	O
tyranny	O
of	O
a	O
barbarian	O

who	O
imposed	O
upon	O
me	O
tasks	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
possibly	O
perform	O

and	O
then	O
punished	O
my	O
incapacity	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
rigour	O
and	O
inhumanity	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
often	O
whipped	O
into	O
a	O
swoon	O

and	O
lashed	O
out	O
of	O
it	O

during	O
which	O

I	O
was	O

my	O

I	O
was	O
not	O
only	O
destitute	O
of	O

but	O
even	O
of	O
food	O

so	O
that	O
my	O

extreme	O

Not	O

of	O
my	O

my	O

refused	O
to	O
part	O
with	O
some	O

`	O
Overwhelmed	O

got	O
up	O
in	O
the	O

of	O

that	O
supported	O
the	O

before	O

who	O
had	O
been	O
awake	O
all	O
the	O
while	O
and	O
suspected	O
my	O

In	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
my	O
attempt	O
was	O
published	O
among	O
the	O
prisoners	O
and	O
punished	O
with	O
thirty	O
stripes	O

the	O
pain	O
of	O
which	O

co-operating	O
with	O
my	O
disappointment	O
and	O
disgrace	O

bereft	O
me	O
of	O
my	O
senses	O

and	O
threw	O
me	O
into	O
an	O
ecstacy	O
of	O
madness	O
,	O
during	O
which	O
I	O
tore	O
the	O
flesh	O
from	O
my	O
bones	O
with	O
my	O
teeth	O
,	O
and	O
dashed	O
my	O
head	O
against	O
the	O
pavement	O

so	O
that	O
they	O
were	O

me	O
from	O

This	O
fit	O
of	O
frenzy	O
continued	O
three	O
days	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
grew	O
calm	O

sullen	O

but	O
as	O
the	O
desire	O
of	O
making	O
away	O
with	O

still	O
remained	O
,	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
determination	O

starving	O
myself	O
to	O
death	O

and	O
with	O
that	O
view	O
refused	O

on	O

having	O
made	O
an	O

my	O

Then	O

the	O

from	O

him	O
severely	O
for	O
the	O

took	O
among	O

of	O

and	O
threatened	O
to	O
smoke	O
him	O
like	O

if	O
ever	O

The	O
steward	O

conscious	O

some	O

This	O
repartee	O
introduced	O
a	O
smart	O
dialogue	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
Welshman	O
undertook	O
to	O
prove	O

that	O

though	O
the	O

he	O
complained	O

not	O
flow	O
from	O
the	O

he	O
was	O

from	O
the	O
use	O

which	O
only	O

he	O
affirmed	O
,	O
such	O
unsavoury	O
steams	O
could	O
arise	O

Then	O
he	O
launched	O
out	O
into	O
the	O
praise	O
of	O
good	O
cheese	O

of	O
which	O
he	O
gave	O
the	O

with	O
the	O

to	O

that	O
,	O
in	O
yielding	O
good	O
cheese	O

the	O
county	O
of	O

might	O

superior	O
to	O
it	O
in	O
the	O

of	O

I	O
gathered	O
from	O
this	O
conversation	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
entered	O
in	O
my	O
present	O
pickle	O

I	O
should	O
be	O
no	O

therefore	O
desired	O
Mr.	O

to	O
go	O

calamity	O

at	O
which	O
the	O
first	O

expressing	O
some	O

went	O
upon	O

immediately	O
,	O
taking	O
his	O
way	O
through	O
the	O
cable-tier	O
and	O
the	O
main	O
hatchway	O
,	O
to	O
avoid	O
encountering	O
me	O
;	O
desiring	O
me	O
to	O
clean	O
myself	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
possible	O
:	O
for	O
he	O
intended	O
to	O
regale	O
himself	O
with	O
a	O
dish	O
of	O
salmagundy	O
and	O
a	O
pipe	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
,	O
I	O
set	O
about	O
this	O
disagreeable	O
business	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
found	O
I	O
had	O
more	O
causes	O
of	O
complaint	O
than	O
I	O
at	O
first	O
imagined	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
perceived	O
some	O
guests	O
had	O
honoured	O
me	O
with	O
their	O
company	O
,	O
whose	O
visit	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
seasonable	O
:	O
neither	O
did	O
they	O
seem	O
inclined	O
to	O
leave	O
me	O
in	O
a	O
hurry	O
,	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
possession	O
of	O
my	O

The	O

In	O
the	O

I	O
could	O
learn	O
from	O
his	O

that	O

did	O
not	O

While	O

I	O
was	O

I	O
not	O

suffered	O
from	O

of	O
Morgan	O

who	O
,	O
though	O

in	O
the	O

was	O
often	O
very	O
troublesome	O
with	O
his	O

which	O
expected	O
a	O
good	O
deal	O
of	O
submission	O
from	O
me	O

delighted	O
in	O
recapitulating	O

About	O

the	O
surgeon	O

bidding	O
me	O

;	O
as	O

by	O
virtue	O
of	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
removed	O
into	O
a	O
second-rate	O

I	O
acknowledged	O
his	O
kindness	O
in	O
the	O
strongest	O
terms	O
my	O
gratitude	O
could	O
suggest	O

and	O
professed	O
my	O

the	O

his	O
generosity	O
rested	O
not	O
here	O
;	O
for	O
before	O
he	O
left	O
the	O
ship	O
he	O
made	O

a	O

thought	O
highly	O

This	O

down	O
to	O
his	O

to	O
inform	O
him	O
of	O
the	O
accident	O

as	O

to	O
bring	O
up	O

I	O
entered	O

,	O
by	O
the	O
glimmering	O
of	O

perceived	O
him	O
on	O
his	O
knees	O
before	O
something	O
that	O
very	O
much	O
resembled	O
a	O
crucifix	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
I	O
will	O
not	O
insist	O
upon	O

that	O
I	O
may	O
not	O
seem	O
too	O
much	O
a	O
slave	O
to	O

report	O

which	O
indeed	O
assisted	O

this	O

it	O

got	O
up	O
in	O
a	O

occasioned	O

I	O
suppose	O

by	O
his	O

in	O
a	O
trice	O
snatched	O
the	O

from	O

After	O
making	O
an	O
apology	O
for	O
my	O
intrusion	O
,	O
I	O
acquainted	O
him	O
with	O
the	O
situation	O
of	O

could	O
by	O
no	O

I	O
sent	O
for	O
Thompson	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
after	O
condoling	O
me	O
on	O
the	O
occasion	O
,	O
hinted	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
owed	O
this	O
misfortune	O
to	O
the	O
hatred	O
of	O
the	O
doctor	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
given	O
an	O
information	O
against	O
me	O
to	O
the	O
captain	O

in	O
consequence	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
arrested	O

and	O
all	O
my	O
papers	O
seized	O

While	O
I	O
was	O
cursing	O
my	O
capricious	O
fate	O
,	O
I	O
saw	O
Morgan	O
ascend	O
the	O
poop	O
,	O
guarded	O
by	O
two	O
corporals	O
,	O
who	O
made	O
him	O
sit	O
down	O
by	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
be	O
pinioned	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
machine	O

Notwithstanding	O
my	O
situation	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
scarce	O
refrain	O
from	O
laughing	O
at	O
the	O
countenance	O
of	O
my	O
fellow	O
prisoner	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
without	O
speaking	O
one	O
word	O
,	O
allowed	O
his	O
feet	O
to	O
be	O
inclosed	O
in	O
the	O
rings	O
provided	O
for	O
that	O
purpose	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
pretended	O
to	O
fasten	O
him	O
on	O
his	O
back	O
he	O
grew	O
outrageous	O
,	O
and	O
drawing	O
a	O
large	O
couteau	O
from	O
his	O
side-pocket	O
,	O
threatened	O
to	O
rip	O
up	O
the	O
belly	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
man	O
that	O
should	O
approach	O
him	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
treat	O
him	O
in	O
such	O
an	O
unworthy	O
manner	O

They	O
were	O
prepared	O
to	O
use	O
him	O
very	O
roughly	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
lieutenant	O
on	O
the	O
quarter-deck	O
called	O
up	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
let	O
him	O

crept	O
towards	O
me	O

,	O
taking	O
me	O
by	O
the	O

And	O
looking	O
at	O
Thompson	O
,	O
who	O
sat	O
by	O
us	O
trembling	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
pale	O

told	O
him	O
there	O
were	O
two	O
more	O
rings	O
for	O
his	O

and	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
glad	O
to	O
find	O
him	O
in	O
such	O
good	O
company	O

But	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
intention	O
of	O
our	O
adversary	O
to	O
include	O
the	O
second	O

in	O
our	O

him	O

him	O
afar	O

,	O
finding	O
his	O

him	O

out	O
of	O

in	O
a	O

this	O

hereupon	O
everything	O

It	O
was	O
almost	O
dark	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
up	O
with	O
the	O
sternmost	O
chase	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
hailed	O
,	O
and	O
inquired	O
who	O
they	O
were	O

They	O
gave	O
us	O
to	O
understand	O
they	O
were	O
French	O
men-of-war	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
Captain	O
Oakum	O
commanded	O
them	O
to	O
send	O
their	O

they	O
refused	O

telling	O
him	O

any	O
business	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
to	O
come	O
on	O

he	O

in	O
a	O
broadside	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
promised	O
to	O

Both	O
sides	O
were	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
their	O

and	O
the	O
engagement	O
began	O
with	O
great	O
fury	O

The	O
reader	O
may	O
guess	O
how	O
I	O
passed	O
my	O
time	O
,	O
lying	O
in	O
this	O
helpless	O
situation	O
,	O
amidst	O
the	O
terrors	O
of	O
a	O
sea-fight	O
;	O
expecting	O
every	O

to	O

cut	O
asunder	O
,	O
or	O
dashed	O
in	O
pieces	O
by	O
the	O
enemy	O
's	O
shot	O
!	O

I	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
compose	O
myself	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
possible	O
,	O
by	O
reflecting	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
a	O

more	O
exposed	O
than	O
those	O
who	O
were	O
stationed	O
about	O
me	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
beheld	O
them	O
employed	O
without	O
intermission	O
in	O
annoying	O
the	O
foe	O
,	O
and	O
encouraged	O
by	O
the	O
society	O
and	O
behaviour	O
of	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
easily	O
perceive	O
a	O
wide	O
difference	O
between	O
their	O
condition	O
and	O
mine	O
:	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
concealed	O
my	O
agitation	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
till	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
the	O
officer	O
of	O

who	O
stood	O
near	O
me	O

being	O
shot	O
off	O

from	O
the	O

athwart	O
my	O

leaving	O
me	O
well	O
nigh	O
blinded	O
with	O
brains	O

I	O
could	O
contain	O
myself	O
no	O
longer	O
,	O
but	O
began	O
to	O
bellow	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
strength	O
of	O
my	O
lungs	O
;	O
when	O
a	O
drummer	O
,	O
coming	O
towards	O
me	O
asked	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
wounded	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
before	O
I	O
could	O
answer	O
,	O
received	O
a	O
great	O
shot	O
in	O
his	O
belly	O
,	O
which	O
tore	O
out	O
his	O
entrails	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
fell	O
flat	O
on	O
my	O
breast	O

This	O
accident	O
entirely	O
bereft	O
me	O
of	O
all	O
discretion	O
;	O
I	O
redoubled	O
my	O
cries	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
drowned	O
in	O
the	O
noise	O
of	O
the	O
battle	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
finding	O
myself	O
disregarded	O
,	O
lost	O
all	O
patience	O
,	O
and	O
became	O
frantic	O
.	O

I	O
vented	O
my	O
rage	O
in	O
oaths	O
and	O
execrations	O
,	O
till	O
my	O
spirits	O
,	O
being	O
quite	O

I	O
remained	O
quiet	O
,	O
as	O
insensible	O
of	O
the	O
load	O
that	O
oppressed	O
me	O

The	O

also	O
allowed	O

to	O
recollect	O
themselves	O
from	O

the	O

at	O

But	O
if	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
allowed	O
to	O
give	O
my	O
opinion	O
of	O
the	O
matter	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
ascribe	O
this	O
delay	O
to	O
the	O
generosity	O
of	O
our	O
chiefs	O

who	O
scorned	O
to	O

This	O

of	O

in	O
choosing	O
a	O
camp	O
under	O
the	O

of	O
an	O

I	O

,	O
with	O
a	O
view	O
of	O
accustoming	O
the	O

for	O

not	O
relishing	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
complaisance	O
in	O
the	O
Spaniard	O
's	O
,	O
was	O
wise	O
enough	O
to	O
retreat	O
on	O

with	O
the	O

The	O
sick	O

wounded	O
were	O
squeezed	O
into	O
certain	O

thence	O
obtained	O
the	O
name	O
of	O

though	O
methinks	O
they	O
scarce	O
deserved	O
such	O
a	O

the	O

amidst	O
the	O

This	O
inhuman	O

was	O
imputed	O
to	O
the	O
scarcity	O
of	O
surgeons	O
;	O
though	O
it	O
is	O
well	O
known	O
that	O
every	O

would	O

more	O
than	O
sufficient	O
to	O

this	O

perhaps	O
our	O

was	O
too	O

at	O

the	O

when	O

at	O

washed	O
my	O

I	O
seemingly	O

that	O
I	O
might	O
not	O

I	O
could	O
not	O

smiling	O
at	O
the	O
chaplain	O
's	O
inquisitive	O
remonstrance	O

which	O
I	O
told	O
him	O

him	O
a	O

he	O
explained	O
away	O

proceeded	O
to	O
ask	O
what	O

I	O
professed	O

I	O
answered	O

that	O

that	O
I	O

this	O

the	O

expressed	O
great	O
astonishment	O

said	O

he	O
could	O
not	O

how	O
a	O

under	O

he	O
asked	O
if	O
I	O

ever	O
received	O
the	O

taken	O

enjoyed	O
his	O

the	O
doctor	O
watched	O
over	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
became	O
so	O
necessary	O

that	O
a	O
cabin	O
was	O
made	O
for	O

a	O
few	O
weeks	O

our	O
ship	O

orders	O

I	O
was	O
in	O

in	O
a	O
very	O
short	O
time	O

,	O
sending	O
for	O

to	O
the	O
quarter-deck	O

gave	O
us	O
to	O
understand	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
scarcity	O
of	O
surgeons	O
in	O
the	O
West	PNM
Indies	PNM
;	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
commanded	O
to	O
detain	O
one	O
mate	O
out	O
of	O
every	O
great	O
ship	O
that	O
was	O
bound	O
for	O
England	PNM
;	O
and	O
desired	O
us	O
to	O
agree	O
between	O
ourselves	O

before	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
at	O
that	O
hour	O
,	O

should	O
stay	O

We	O
were	O
thunderstruck	O
at	O
this	O
proposal	O

and	O
stared	O
at	O
one	O
another	O
some	O
time	O
without	O
speaking	O
;	O
at	O
length	O
the	O
Welshman	O
broke	O
silence	O
,	O
and	O
offered	O
to	O
remain	O
in	O
the	O
West	O
Indies	O
,	O
provided	O
the	O
admiral	O
would	O
give	O
him	O
a	O
surgeon	O
's	O
warrant	O
immediately	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
told	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
want	O
of	O
chief	O
surgeons	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
must	O
be	O
contented	O
with	O
the	O
station	O
of	O

till	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
further	O
provided	O

due	O
course	O

Whereupon	O
Morgan	O
flatly	O
refused	O
to	O
quit	O
the	O
ship	O
for	O
which	O
the	O
commissioners	O
of	O
the	O
navy	O
had	O
appointed	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
told	O
him	O
as	O
plainly	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
determine	O
the	O
affair	O
by	O
ourselves	O
before	O
to-morrow	O

he	O
must	O
cast	O

abide	O
by	O
his	O
chance	O

When	O
I	O
recalled	O
to	O
my	O
remembrance	O
the	O
miseries	O
I	O
had	O
undergone	O
in	O

had	O
not	O
one	O

promote	O
my	O

or	O
favour	O
my	O
advancement	O
in	O
the	O
navy	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
reflected	O
on	O
the	O
present	O
dearth	O
of	O
surgeons	O
in	O
the	O
West	PNM
Indies	PNM
,	O
and	O
the	O
unhealthiness	O
of	O
the	O
climate	O
,	O
which	O
every	O
day	O
almost	O
reduced	O
the	O
number	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
help	O
thinking	O
my	O
success	O
would	O
be	O
much	O
more	O
certain	O
and	O
expeditious	O
by	O
my	O
staying	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
,	O
than	O
by	O
returning	O
to	O
Europe	PNM
.	O

I	O
therefore	O
resolved	O
to	O
comply	O
with	O
a	O
good	O
grace	O
,	O
and	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
ordered	O
to	O
throw	O
dice	O
,	O
told	O
Morgan	O
he	O
needed	O
not	O
trouble	O
himself	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
would	O
voluntarily	O
submit	O
to	O
the	O
admiral	O
's	O
pleasure	O

This	O
frank	O
declaration	O
was	O
commended	O
by	O
the	O
gentleman	O
,	O
who	O
assured	O
me	O
,	O
it	O
should	O
not	O
fare	O
the	O
worse	O
with	O
me	O
for	O
my	O
resignation	O
.	O

Indeed	O
he	O
was	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
his	O
word	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
very	O
afternoon	O
procured	O
a	O
warrant	O
,	O
appointing	O
me	O
surgeon	O
's	O
mate	O
of	O
the	O
Lizard	O
sloop-of-war	O
,	O
which	O
put	O
me	O
on	O
a	O
footing	O
with	O
every	O
first	O
mate	O
in	O
the	O
service	O
.	O

My	O
ticket	O
being	O
made	O
out	O
,	O
I	O
put	O
my	O
chest	O
and	O
bedding	O
on	O
board	O
a	O
canoe	O
that	O
lay	O
alongside	O

the	O

honest	O
Jack	O
Rattlin	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
bound	O
for	O
Greenwich	PNM
Hospital	PNM
,	O
I	O
took	O
my	O
leave	O
of	O
Morgan	O
with	O
many	O
tears	O
,	O
after	O
we	O
had	O
exchanged	O
our	O

Having	O
presented	O
my	O
new	O
warrant	O
to	O
the	O
captain	O
of	O
the	O
Lizard	O
,	O
I	O
inquired	O
for	O
the	O
doctor	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
no	O
sooner	O
saw	O
than	O
I	O
recollected	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
young	O
fellows	O
with	O
whom	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
committed	O
to	O
the	O
round-house	O

during	O
our	O
frolic	O
with	O
Jackson	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
related	O
before	O

He	O
received	O
me	O
with	O
a	O
good	O
deal	O
of	O
courtesy	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
put	O
him	O
in	O
mind	O
of	O
our	O
former	O
acquaintance	O
,	O
expressed	O
great	O
joy	O
at	O
seeing	O
me	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
recommended	O
me	O
to	O
an	O
exceeding	O
good	O
mess	O
,	O
composed	O
of	O
the	O
gunner	O
and	O
master	O

As	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
one	O
sick	O
person	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
I	O
got	O
leave	O
to	O
go	O
ashore	O
next	O
day	O
with	O
the	O
gunner	O
,	O
who	O
recommended	O
me	O
to	O
a	O
Jew	O
,	O
that	O
bought	O
my	O
ticket	O
at	O
the	O
rate	O
of	O
forty	O
per	O

discount	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
furnished	O
myself	O
with	O
the	O

I	O
wanted	O

returned	O
on	O

in	O
the	O
evening	O

and	O
,	O
to	O
my	O
surprise	O
,	O
found	O
my	O
old	O
antagonist	O
Crampley	O
walking	O
upon	O
deck	O
.	O

Though	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
fear	O
his	O
enmity	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
shocked	O
at	O
his	O
appearance	O
,	O
and	O
communicated	O
my	O
sentiments	O
on	O
that	O
subject	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Tomlins	O
the	O
surgeon	O
,	O
who	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
Crampley	O
,	O
by	O
dint	O
of	O
some	O
friends	O
about	O
the	O
admiral	O
,	O
had	O
procured	O
a	O
commission	O
,	O
constituting	O
him	O
lieutenant	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
Lizard	O
;	O
and	O
advised	O
me	O
,	O
now	O
he	O
was	O
my	O
superior	O
officer	O
,	O
to	O
behave	O
with	O
some	O
respect	O
towards	O
him	O
,	O
or	O
else	O
he	O
would	O
find	O
a	O
thousand	O
opportunities	O
of	O
using	O
me	O
ill	O
.	O

This	O
advice	O
was	O
a	O
bitter	O
potion	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
whom	O
pride	O
and	O
resentment	O
had	O
rendered	O
utterly	O
incapable	O
of	O
the	O
least	O
submission	O
to	O
,	O
or	O
even	O
of	O
a	O
reconciliation	O
with	O
,	O
the	O
wretch	O
who	O
had	O
,	O
on	O
many	O
occasions	O
,	O
treated	O
me	O
so	O
inhumanly	O
:	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
resolved	O
to	O
have	O
as	O
little	O
connection	O
as	O
possible	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
ingratiate	O
myself	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
with	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
officers	O
,	O
whose	O
friendship	O
might	O
be	O
a	O
bulwark	O
to	O
defend	O
me	O
from	O
the	O
attempts	O
of	O
his	O
malice	O

In	O
less	O

a	O
week	O
we	O
sailed	O
on	O

cruise	O

and	O
having	O
weathered	O
the	O
east	O
end	O
of	O

fortune	O
to	O

my	O

with	O

in	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
walked	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
by	O

we	O
perceived	O
a	O

behind	O

coming	O
up	O
,	O
wished	O
us	O
good	O
even	O

asked	O
which	O
way	O
we	O
went	O
?	O

His	O
voice	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
quite	O
familiar	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
no	O
sooner	O
struck	O
my	O

in	O

of	O
all	O
my	O
resolution	O

my	O
hair	O
bristled	O
up	O

and	O
I	O
was	O
seized	O
with	O
a	O
violent	O
fit	O
of	O
trembling	O
,	O
which	O
Brayl	O
misinterpreting	O
,	O
bade	O
me	O
be	O
under	O
no	O
concern	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
he	O
was	O
mistaken	O
in	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
my	O
disorder	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
addressing	O
myself	O
to	O
the	O
person	O
on	O

said	O

``	O

To	O
this	O

,	O
after	O
some	O
pause	O

he	O
replied	O

``	O

of	O
Thompson	O

not	O
without	O
many	O

some	O

A	O
silence	O
ensued	O

which	O
lasted	O
some	O
minutes	O

and	O
then	O
the	O
conversation	O
turned	O
on	O
different	O
subjects	O
,	O
till	O
we	O
arrived	O
at	O
a	O
house	O
on	O
the	O
road	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
horseman	O
alighted	O
,	O
and	O
begged	O
with	O
so	O
much	O
earnestness	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
go	O
in	O
and	O
drink	O
a	O
bowl	O
of	O
punch	O
with	O
him	O

that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
resist	O

But	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
alarmed	O
at	O
his	O
voice	O
,	O
what	O
must	O
my	O
amazement	O
be	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
discovered	O
by	O
the	O
light	O
the	O
very	O
person	O
of	O
my	O
lamented	O
friend	O

Perceiving	O
my	O
confusion	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
extreme	O
,	O
he	O
clasped	O
me	O
in	O
his	O
arms	O

and	O
bedewed	O
my	O
face	O
with	O
tears	O

was	O
some	O

the	O

overpowered	O
with	O
this	O

longer	O

So	O
that	O
all	O
I	O
was	O
capable	O
of	O
was	O
to	O
return	O
his	O
embraces	O

with	O
his	O

At	O

Mr.	O

ordered	O

Never	O

for	O

I	O
related	O
to	O
him	O
the	O
particulars	O
of	O
our	O
attempt	O
upon	O
Carthagena	PNM
,	O
of	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
heard	O
but	O
an	O
imperfect	O
account	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
gratified	O
me	O
with	O
a	O
narration	O
of	O
every	O
little	O
incident	O
of	O
his	O
life	O
since	O
we	O
parted	O

He	O
assured	O
me	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
difficulty	O
he	O
could	O
resist	O
his	O
inclination	O
of	O
coming	O
down	O
to	O
Port	PNM
Royal	PNM
,	O
to	O
see	O
Morgan	O
and	O
me	O
,	O
of	O
whom	O
he	O
had	O
heard	O
no	O

since	O
the	O
day	O
of	O
our	O
separation	O
:	O
but	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
restrained	O
by	O
the	O
fear	O
of	O
being	O
detained	O
as	O
a	O
deserter	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
heard	O
my	O
voice	O
in	O
the	O
dark	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
almost	O
as	O
much	O
surprised	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
seeing	O
him	O
afterwards	O
:	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
confidence	O
of	O
friendship	O
,	O
disclosed	O
a	O
passion	O
he	O
entertained	O
for	O
the	O
only	O
daughter	O
of	O
the	O
gentleman	O
with	O
whom	O
he	O
lived	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
by	O
his	O
description	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
amiable	O
young	O
lady	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
disdain	O
his	O
addresses	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
very	O
much	O
favoured	O
by	O
her	O
parents	O
;	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
despair	O
of	O
obtaining	O
their	O
consent	O
to	O
the	O
match	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
at	O
once	O
render	O
him	O
independent	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

I	O
congratulated	O
him	O
on	O
his	O
good	O
fortune	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
protested	O
should	O
never	O
make	O
him	O
forget	O
his	O
friends	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
towards	O
morning	O
,	O
we	O
betook	O
ourselves	O
to	O
rest	O
.	O

Next	O
day	O
he	O
accompanied	O
me	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
where	O
Mr.	O
Brayl	O
entertained	O
him	O
at	O
dinner	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
having	O
spent	O
the	O
afternoon	O
together	O
,	O
he	O
took	O
his	O
leave	O
of	O
us	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
after	O
he	O
had	O
forced	O
upon	O
me	O
ten	O
pistoles	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
small	O
token	O
of	O
his	O
affection	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
while	O
he	O
stayed	O
here	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
one	O
another	O
every	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
generally	O
ate	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
table	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
plentifully	O
supplied	O
by	O
him	O

so	O
that	O
this	O
small	O
interval	O
of	O
ten	O
days	O
was	O
by	O
far	O
the	O
most	O
agreeable	O
period	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
the	O
Lizard	O
arrived	O
;	O
and	O
my	O
patients	O
being	O
all	O
fit	O
for	O
duty	O
,	O
they	O
and	O
I	O
were	O
ordered	O
on	O
board	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
understood	O
from	O
Mr.	O
Tomlins	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
shyness	O
between	O
the	O
lieutenant	O
and	O
him	O
on	O
my	O
account	O
;	O
the	O
rancorous	O
villain	O
having	O
taken	O
the	O
opportunity	O
of	O
my	O
absence	O
to	O
fill	O
the	O
captain	O
's	O
ears	O
with	O
a	O
thousand	O
scandalous	O
stories	O
to	O
my	O
prejudice	O
;	O
among	O
other	O
things	O
affirming	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
once	O
transported	O
for	O
theft	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
Thunder	O
man-of-war	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
whipped	O
for	O
the	O
same	O
crime	O
.	O

The	O
surgeon	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
having	O
heard	O
my	O
whole	O
story	O
from	O
my	O
own	O
mouth	O
,	O
defended	O
me	O
strenuously	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
that	O
good-natured	O
office	O
recounted	O
all	O
the	O
instances	O
of	O
Crampley	O
's	O
malice	O
against	O
me	O
while	O
I	O
remained	O
on	O
board	O
of	O
that	O
ship	O
;	O
which	O
declaration	O
,	O
while	O
it	O
satisfied	O
the	O
captain	O
of	O
my	O
innocence	O
,	O
made	O
the	O
lieutenant	O
as	O
much	O
my	O
defender	O
's	O
enemy	O
as	O
mine	O
.	O

The	O
infernal	O
behaviour	O
of	O
Crampley	O
,	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
added	O
such	O
fuel	O
to	O
his	O
former	O
resentment	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
at	O
certain	O
times	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
quite	O
beside	O
myself	O
with	O
the	O
desire	O
of	O
revenge	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
even	O
tempted	O
to	O
pistol	O
him	O
on	O
the	O
quarter-deck	O
,	O
though	O
an	O
infamous	O
death	O
must	O
inevitably	O
have	O
been	O
my	O
reward	O
.	O

But	O
the	O
surgeon	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
my	O
confidant	O
,	O
argued	O
against	O
such	O
a	O
desperate	O
action	O
so	O
effectually	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
stifled	O
the	O
flame	O
which	O
consumed	O
me	O
for	O
the	O
present	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
a	O
more	O
convenient	O
opportunity	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
meantime	O
,	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Tomlins	O
might	O
be	O
the	O
more	O
convinced	O
of	O
the	O
wrongs	O
I	O
suffered	O
by	O
this	O
fellow	O
's	O
slander	O
,	O
I	O
begged	O
he	O
would	O
go	O
and	O
visit	O
Mr.	O
Thompson	O
,	O
whose	O
wonderful	O
escape	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
him	O
acquainted	O
with	O
,	O
and	O
inquire	O
of	O
him	O
into	O
the	O
particulars	O
of	O
my	O
conduct	O
,	O
while	O
he	O
was	O
my	O
fellow-mate	O
.	O

This	O
request	O
the	O
surgeon	O
complied	O
with	O
,	O
more	O
through	O
curiosity	O
to	O
see	O
a	O
person	O
whose	O
fate	O
had	O
been	O
so	O
extraordinary	O
,	O
than	O
to	O
confirm	O
his	O
good	O
opinion	O
of	O
me	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
assured	O
me	O
was	O
already	O
firmly	O
established	O
.	O

He	O
therefore	O
set	O
out	O
for	O
the	O
dwelling-place	O
of	O
my	O
friend	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
letter	O
of	O
introduction	O
from	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
being	O
received	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
civility	O
and	O
kindness	O
I	O
expected	O
,	O
returned	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
not	O
only	O
satisfied	O
with	O
my	O
character	O
beyond	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
doubt	O
or	O
insinuation	O
,	O
but	O
also	O
charmed	O
with	O
the	O
affability	O
and	O
conversation	O
of	O
Thompson	O
,	O
who	O
loaded	O
him	O
and	O
me	O
with	O
presents	O
of	O
fresh	O
stock	O
,	O
liquors	O
,	O
and	O
fruit	O
.	O

As	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
venture	O
to	O
come	O
and	O
see	O
us	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
lest	O
Cramplay	O
should	O
know	O
and	O
detain	O
him	O
;	O
when	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
our	O
departure	O
approached	O
,	O
I	O
obtained	O
leave	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
bid	O
him	O
farewell	O
.	O

After	O
we	O
had	O
vowed	O
an	O
everlasting	O
friendship	O
,	O
he	O
pressed	O
upon	O
me	O
a	O
purse	O
,	O
with	O
four	O
doubloons	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
refused	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
without	O
giving	O
umbrage	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
cordially	O
embraced	O
each	O
other	O
,	O
I	O
returned	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
small	O
box	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
letter	O
directed	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
care	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Tomlins	O
.	O

Knowing	O
the	O
superscription	O
to	O
be	O
of	O
Thompson	O
's	O
handwriting	O
,	O
I	O
opened	O
it	O
with	O
some	O
surprise	O
,	O
and	O
learned	O
that	O
this	O
generous	O
friend	O
,	O
not	O
content	O
with	O
loading	O
me	O
with	O
the	O
presents	O
already	O
mentioned	O

had	O
sent	O

for	O
my	O
use	O
and	O
acceptance	O
,	O
half	O
a	O
dozen	O
fine	O
shirts	O

and	O
as	O

waistcoats	O
and	O
caps	O
,	O
with	O
twelve	O
pair	O
of	O
new	O

Being	O
thus	O
provided	O
with	O
money	O
and	O
all	O
necessaries	O
for	O
the	O
comfort	O
of	O
life	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
look	O
upon	O
myself	O
as	O
a	O
gentleman	O
of	O
some	O
consequence	O
,	O
and	O
felt	O
my	O
pride	O
dilate	O
a	O
pace	O

Next	O
day	O
we	O
sailed	O
for	O
Port	PNM
Royal	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
arrived	O
safely	O
with	O
our	O
prizes	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
there	O
was	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
ashore	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
purchased	O
a	O
laced	O
waistcoat	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
other	O
clothes	O
,	O
at	O
a	O
sale	O
,	O
made	O
a	O
swaggering	O
figure	O
for	O
some	O
days	O
among	O
the	O
taverns	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
ventured	O
to	O
play	O
a	O
little	O
at	O
hazard	O
,	O
and	O
came	O
off	O
with	O
fifty	O
pistoles	O
in	O
my	O
pocket	O
.	O

Meanwhile	O
our	O
captain	O
was	O
promoted	O
to	O
a	O
ship	O
of	O
twenty	O
guns	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
command	O
of	O
the	O

given	O
to	O
a	O

reign	O
of	O
King	PNM
William	PNM
,	O
and	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
his	O
long	O
service	O
,	O
would	O
have	O
probably	O
died	O
in	O
that	O
station	O

had	O
he	O
not	O
applied	O
some	O

he	O
had	O
lately	O
received	O

to	O
make	O
interest	O
with	O
his	O

My	O

of	O
Crampley	O

who	O
succeeded	O
to	O
the	O
command	O
of	O
the	O
vessel	O
.	O

For	O
that	O
very	O
reason	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Tomlins	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
cause	O
to	O
rejoice	O
at	O
this	O
event	O
,	O
fearing	O
that	O
the	O
tyranny	O
of	O
our	O
new	O
commander	O
would	O
now	O
be	O
as	O
unlimited	O
as	O
his	O
power	O
.	O

The	O
first	O
day	O
of	O
his	O
command	O
justified	O
our	O
apprehensions	O
:	O
for	O
,	O
on	O
pretence	O
that	O
the	O
decks	O
were	O
too	O
much	O
crowded	O
,	O
he	O
ordered	O
the	O
surgeon	O
's	O
hencoops	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
his	O
fowls	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
thrown	O
overboard	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
prohibited	O
him	O
and	O
me	O
from	O
walking	O
on	O
the	O
quarter-deck	O
.	O

Mr.	O
Tomlins	O
could	O
not	O
help	O
complaining	O
of	O
these	O
injuries	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
his	O
expostulation	O
dropped	O
some	O
hasty	O
words	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
Crampley	O
taking	O
hold	O
,	O
confined	O
him	O
to	O
his	O
cabin	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
,	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
air	O
he	O
was	O
attacked	O
by	O
a	O
fever	O
,	O
which	O
soon	O
put	O
an	O
end	O
to	O
his	O
life	O
,	O
after	O
he	O
had	O
made	O
his	O
will	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
he	O
bequeathed	O
all	O
his	O
estate	O
,	O
personal	O
and	O
real	O
,	O
to	O
his	O
sister	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
to	O
me	O
his	O
watch	O
and	O
instruments	O
as	O
memorials	O
of	O
his	O
friendship	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
penetrated	O
with	O
grief	O
on	O
this	O
melancholy	O
occasion	O
;	O
the	O
more	O
because	O
there	O
was	O
nobody	O
on	O
board	O
to	O
whom	O
I	O
could	O
communicate	O
my	O
sorrows	O
,	O
or	O
of	O
whom	O
I	O
could	O
receive	O
the	O
least	O
consolation	O
or	O
advice	O
.	O

Crampley	O
was	O
so	O
far	O
from	O
discovering	O
the	O
least	O
remorse	O
for	O
his	O
barbarity	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
news	O
of	O
the	O
surgeon	O
's	O
death	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
insulted	O
his	O
memory	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
abusive	O
manner	O
,	O
and	O
affirmed	O
he	O
had	O
poisoned	O
himself	O
out	O
of	O
pure	O
fear	O
,	O
dreading	O
to	O
be	O
brought	O
to	O
a	O
court-martial	O
for	O
mutiny	O
;	O
for	O
which	O
reason	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
suffer	O
the	O
service	O
of	O
the	O
dead	O
to	O
be	O
read	O
over	O
his	O
body	O
before	O
it	O
was	O
thrown	O
overboard	O
.	O

Nothing	O
but	O
a	O
speedy	O
deliverance	O
could	O
have	O
supported	O
me	O
under	O
the	O
brutal	O
sway	O
of	O
this	O
bashaw	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
to	O
render	O
my	O
life	O
more	O
irksome	O
,	O
signified	O
to	O
my	O
messmates	O
a	O
desire	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
expelled	O
from	O
their	O
society	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
no	O
sooner	O
hinted	O
,	O
than	O
they	O
granted	O
his	O
request	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
fain	O
to	O
eat	O
in	O
a	O
solitary	O
manner	O
by	O
myself	O
during	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
passage	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
soon	O
drew	O
to	O
a	O
period	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
been	O
seven	O
weeks	O
at	O
sea	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
gunner	O
told	O
the	O
captain	O
that	O
,	O
by	O
his	O
reckoning	O
,	O
we	O
must	O
be	O
in	O
soundings	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
he	O
would	O
order	O
the	O
lead	O
to	O
be	O
heaved	O
.	O

Crampley	O
swore	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
how	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
way	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
not	O
within	O
a	O
hundred	O
leagues	O
of	O
soundings	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
give	O
himself	O
the	O
trouble	O
to	O
cast	O
the	O
lead	O
.	O

Accordingly	O
we	O
continued	O
our	O
course	O
all	O
that	O
afternoon	O
and	O
night	O
,	O
without	O
shortening	O
sail	O
,	O
although	O
the	O
gunner	O
pretended	O
to	O
discover	O
Scilly	O
light	O
;	O
and	O
next	O
morning	O
protested	O
in	O
form	O
against	O
the	O
captain	O
's	O
conduct	O
,	O
for	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
put	O
in	O
confinement	O
,	O
We	O
discovered	O
no	O
land	O
all	O
that	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
Crampley	O
was	O
still	O
so	O
infatuated	O
as	O
to	O
neglect	O
sounding	O
;	O
but	O
at	O
three	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
the	O
ship	O
struck	O
,	O
and	O
remained	O
fast	O
on	O
a	O
sand-bank	O
.	O

This	O
accident	O
alarmed	O
the	O
whole	O
crew	O
;	O
the	O
boat	O
was	O
immediately	O
hoisted	O
out	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
discern	O
which	O
way	O
the	O
shore	O
lay	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
daylight	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
meantime	O
,	O
the	O
wind	O
increased	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
waves	O
beat	O
against	O
the	O
sloop	O
with	O
such	O
violence	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
expected	O
she	O
would	O
have	O
gone	O
to	O
pieces	O
.	O

The	O
gunner	O
was	O
released	O
and	O
consulted	O
:	O
he	O
advised	O
the	O
captain	O
to	O
cut	O
away	O
the	O
mast	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
lighten	O
her	O
;	O
this	O
expedient	O
was	O
performed	O
without	O
success	O
:	O
the	O
sailors	O
,	O
seeing	O
things	O
in	O
a	O
desperate	O
situation	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
custom	O
,	O
broke	O
up	O
the	O

belonging	O
to	O
the	O
officers	O

dressed	O
themselves	O
in	O
their	O

their	O
liquors	O
without	O
ceremony	O

and	O
drunkenness	O
,	O

and	O
confusion	O
ensued	O

In	O
the	O

of	O
this	O
uproar	O

I	O
went	O
below	O
to	O
secure	O
my	O

found	O
the	O

hewing	O
down	O

with	O

with	O
great	O
composure	O

When	O
I	O
asked	O
his	O

During	O
this	O
dialogue	O
I	O
clothed	O
myself	O
in	O
my	O
bed	O

girded	O
on	O

disposed	O
of	O
all	O
my	O
valuable	O

about	O
my	O

and	O
came	O
upon	O
deck	O
with	O
a	O
resolution	O
of	O
taking	O
the	O
first	O
opportunity	O
to	O
get	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
day	O
broke	O
,	O
appeared	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
three	O
miles	O
ahead	O

Crampley	O
,	O
finding	O
his	O
efforts	O
to	O
get	O
the	O
ship	O
off	O
ineffectual	O
,	O
determined	O
to	O
consult	O
his	O
own	O
safety	O
,	O
by	O
going	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
sooner	O
done	O
,	O
than	O
the	O
ship	O
's	O
company	O
followed	O
so	O
fast	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
would	O
have	O
sunk	O
alongside	O
,	O
had	O
not	O
some	O
one	O
wiser	O
than	O
the	O
rest	O
cut	O
the	O
rope	O
and	O
put	O
off	O
.	O

But	O
before	O
this	O
happened	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
several	O
attempts	O
to	O
get	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
always	O
balked	O
by	O
the	O
captain	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
so	O
eager	O
in	O
excluding	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
mind	O
the	O
endeavours	O
of	O
any	O
other	O
body	O

Enraged	O
at	O
this	O
inhuman	O
partiality	O
,	O
and	O
seeing	O
the	O
rope	O
cut	O
,	O
I	O
pulled	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
pistols	O
from	O
my	O
belt	O

and	O
cocking	O
it	O

I	O
would	O
shoot	O
any	O
man	O
who	O
would	O
presume	O
to	O
obstruct	O
my	O
entrance	O

So	O
saying	O
,	O
I	O
leaped	O
with	O
my	O
full	O
exertion	O
,	O
and	O
got	O
on	O
board	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
with	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
the	O
skin	O
of	O
my	O

I	O
chanced	O
in	O
my	O
descent	O
to	O
overturn	O
Crampley	O

who	O
no	O
sooner	O
got	O
up	O
than	O
he	O
struck	O
at	O
me	O
several	O
times	O
with	O
a	O
cutlass	O
,	O
and	O
ordered	O
the	O
men	O
to	O
throw	O
me	O
overboard	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
too	O
anxious	O
about	O
their	O
own	O
safety	O
to	O
mind	O
what	O
he	O
said	O
.	O

Though	O
the	O
boat	O
was	O
very	O
deeply	O
loaded	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
sea	O
terribly	O
high	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
shift	O
to	O
get	O
upon	O
dry	O
land	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
an	O
hour	O
after	O
we	O
parted	O
from	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
set	O
my	O
foot	O
on	O
terra	O

,	O
my	O
indignation	O

which	O
had	O
boiled	O
so	O
long	O
within	O
me	O
,	O
broke	O
out	O
against	O
Crampley	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
immediately	O
challenged	O
to	O
single	O
combat	O
,	O
presenting	O
my	O
pistols	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
take	O
his	O
choice	O
:	O
he	O
took	O
one	O
without	O
hesitation	O

and	O
,	O
before	O
I	O
could	O
cock	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
fired	O
in	O
my	O
face	O
,	O
throwing	O
the	O
pistol	O
after	O
the	O
shot	O

I	O
felt	O
myself	O
stunned	O
,	O
and	O
imagining	O
the	O
bullet	O
had	O
entered	O
my	O
brain	O
,	O
discharged	O
mine	O
as	O
quick	O
as	O
possible	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
not	O
die	O
unrevenged	O
:	O
then	O
flying	O
upon	O
my	O
antagonist	O
,	O
knocked	O
out	O
several	O
of	O
his	O
fore-teeth	O
with	O
the	O
butt-end	O
of	O
the	O
piece	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
certainly	O
have	O
made	O
an	O
end	O
of	O
him	O
with	O
that	O
instrument	O
,	O
had	O
he	O
not	O
disengaged	O
himself	O

and	O
seized	O
his	O
cutlass	O

which	O
he	O
had	O
given	O
to	O
his	O
servant	O
when	O
he	O
received	O
the	O
pistol	O

Seeing	O
him	O
armed	O
in	O
this	O
manner	O
,	O
I	O
drew	O
my	O
hanger	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
flung	O
my	O
pistol	O
at	O
his	O
head	O
,	O
closed	O
with	O
him	O
in	O
a	O
transport	O
of	O
fury	O

and	O
thrust	O
my	O
weapon	O
into	O
his	O
mouth	O

which	O
it	O
enlarged	O
on	O
one	O

Whether	O
the	O

of	O
this	O

disconcerted	O
him	O

the	O
unevenness	O
of	O

made	O
him	O
reel	O

I	O

he	O
staggered	O
some	O

I	O
followed	O
close	O

and	O
with	O
one	O
stroke	O
cut	O
the	O

the	O
back	O

his	O

Upon	O
which	O
his	O

a	O

whose	O

But	O
as	O
I	O
lay	O
ruminating	O
,	O
my	O
passion	O
insensibly	O
abated	O
;	O
I	O
considered	O
my	O
situation	O
in	O
quite	O
another	O
light	O
,	O
from	O
that	O
in	O
which	O
it	O
appeared	O
to	O
me	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
result	O
of	O
my	O
deliberation	O
was	O
to	O
rise	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
and	O
crawl	O
to	O
the	O
next	O
inhabited	O
place	O
for	O
assistance	O

With	O
some	O
difficulty	O
I	O
got	O
upon	O
my	O
legs	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
examined	O
my	O
body	O
,	O
found	O
I	O
had	O
received	O
no	O
other	O
injury	O
than	O
two	O
large	O
contused	O
wounds	O
,	O
one	O
on	O
the	O
fore	O
and	O
another	O
on	O
the	O
hinder	O
part	O
of	O
my	O
head	O
,	O
which	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
occasioned	O
by	O
the	O
same	O
weapon	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
the	O
butt-end	O
of	O
a	O
pistol	O

I	O
looked	O
towards	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
discern	O
no	O
remains	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
concluded	O
she	O
was	O
gone	O
to	O
pieces	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
those	O
who	O
remained	O
in	O
her	O
had	O
perished	O
:	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
afterwards	O
learned	O

the	O
gunner	O

who	O
had	O
more	O
sagacity	O
than	O
Crampley	O

observing	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
flood	O
when	O
he	O
left	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
she	O
would	O
probably	O
float	O
at	O
high	O
water	O
,	O
made	O
no	O
noise	O
about	O
getting	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
but	O
continued	O
on	O
deck	O
,	O
in	O
hopes	O
of	O
bringing	O
her	O
safe	O
into	O
some	O
harbour	O
,	O
after	O
her	O
commander	O
should	O
have	O
deserted	O
her	O
,	O
for	O
which	O
piece	O
of	O
service	O
he	O
expected	O
,	O
no	O

to	O
be	O
handsomely	O
rewarded	O

This	O
scheme	O
he	O
accordingly	O
executed	O

was	O
promised	O
great	O
things	O
by	O
the	O
Admiralty	O
for	O
saving	O
his	O
Majesty	O

I	O
never	O

the	O

of	O
his	O

As	O
for	O
my	O
own	O
part	O
,	O
I	O
directed	O
my	O
course	O
towards	O
a	O
small	O
cottage	O
I	O
perceived	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
road	O
picked	O
up	O
a	O

old	O

which	O
I	O
suppose	O
the	O
thief	O
who	O
dressed	O
himself	O
in	O
my	O

had	O
thrown	O
away	O

this	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
comfortable	O
acquisition	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
almost	O
stiff	O
with	O

:	O
I	O
therefore	O
put	O
it	O
on	O

as	O

was	O
about	O

down	O
in	O

within	O
a	O

yards	O

finding	O
the	O

went	O
in	O

however	O

I	O
threw	O
myself	O
upon	O

hoping	O
to	O
be	O
soon	O

I	O
had	O
not	O

many	O

when	O
I	O
saw	O
a	O

come	O
in	O
with	O
a	O

in	O
his	O

which	O
he	O
was	O
upon	O

the	O

me	O

in	O

would	O

by	O

She	O
being	O
in	O
a	O
reverie	O
when	O

entered	O

the	O

did	O
not	O
think	O
proper	O

her	O

so	O
that	O
we	O
waited	O
some	O

unobserved	O

during	O

time	O
she	O
bit	O
the	O

several	O

altered	O
her	O

at	O

On	O
this	O
information	O
she	O
stared	O
in	O

for	O
a	O
considerable	O
time	O

then	O
asked	O
my	O

which	O
I	O
thought	O

After	O

To	O
this	O
I	O
answered	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
swam	O
ashore	O
without	O
any	O

Then	O
she	O
demanded	O
to	O

I	O
had	O
ever	O

at	O
the	O
Hellespont	O

and	O
swam	O

I	O
replied	O
in	O
the	O
negative	O

upon	O

she	O

so	O
she	O

her	O

to	O
the	O

where	O
I	O
was	O
regaled	O
by	O
the	O
maids	O

who	O

to	O
vie	O
with	O

in	O
expressing	O
their	O

for	O

and	O
from	O
them	O
I	O
understood	O

that	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
good	O
suit	O
of	O

in	O
the	O
house	O

which	O
had	O
belonged	O
to	O
my	O

and	O
it	O
fitted	O
me	O

that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O

when	O
my	O

upon	O

I	O
ran	O
up	O

in	O
her	O

under	O
petticoat	O
only	O
;	O
I	O
would	O
immediately	O

she	O

me	O
come	O

I	O

put	O
it	O
on	O

I	O

believe	O

that	O
time	O

About	O
four	O

in	O
the	O

I	O
was	O

lay	O

So	O
much	O
sweetness	O
appeared	O
in	O
the	O
countenance	O

carriage	O
of	O
this	O

I	O
gazed	O

her	O

unexceptionable	O

down	O
upon	O

in	O

so	O

without	O

her	O
to	O

I	O
began	O
to	O
curse	O
the	O
servile	O
station	O
that	O
placed	O
me	O
so	O
far	O
beneath	O
the	O

of	O
this	O

I	O

When	O
she	O

I	O
listened	O
with	O
pleasure	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
she	O
spoke	O
to	O
me	O

my	O
soul	O
was	O
thrilled	O
with	O
an	O
extacy	O
of	O
tumultuous	O
joy	O

I	O
was	O
even	O
so	O
happy	O
as	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
their	O
conversation	O
;	O
for	O
Narcissa	PNM

having	O
observed	O

``	O

Then	O
addressing	O

asked	O

with	O
ineffable	O
complacency	O

if	O
I	O

the	O

When	O
I	O
had	O
satisfied	O

in	O
this	O

expressed	O

hereupon	O
-LRB-	O
as	O
Mrs.	O

had	O
counselled	O
me	O
-RRB-	O
I	O
told	O
her	O
that	O
I	O

of	O
a	O
ship	O

my	O

I	O
related	O

the	O

my	O

after	O
under	O

that	O
by	O

the	O

This	O
was	O
a	O

the	O

My	O

that	O

I	O
was	O

Here	O
I	O
found	O
a	O

as	O

without	O

,	O
what	O
was	O
very	O

in	O

From	O
whence	O
I	O
gathered	O

that	O
her	O
disposition	O
was	O
gloomy	O
,	O
and	O
her	O
imagination	O
delighted	O
with	O
objects	O

not	O

After	O

a	O
full	O

this	O

I	O
retired	O

and	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
was	O
preparing	O
to	O
lay	O

when	O
I	O

that	O
her	O

was	O
still	O
in	O

had	O

affected	O
with	O
the	O
notes	O
of	O
the	O

in	O
the	O

that	O
she	O

When	O
I	O
expressed	O
my	O

in	O
this	O

imagination	O
she	O
gave	O
me	O
to	O

a	O
piece	O
of	O

it	O
was	O
very	O

with	O

was	O

When	O
I	O

up	O

I	O

on	O

our	O

At	O
certain	O

my	O

would	O

for	O

Narcissa	O
went	O
one	O
day	O
to	O
visit	O
Miss	O
Thicket	O
,	O
who	O
lived	O
with	O
her	O
brother	O
within	O
less	O
than	O
a	O
mile	O
of	O
our	O
house	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
persuaded	O
to	O
walk	O
home	O
in	O
the	O
cool	O
of	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
accompanied	O
by	O
Sir	O
Timothy	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
having	O
a	O
good	O
deal	O
of	O
the	O
brute	O
in	O
him	O
,	O
was	O
instigated	O
to	O
use	O
some	O
unbecoming	O
familiarities	O
with	O
her	O
,	O
encouraged	O
by	O
the	O
solitariness	O
of	O
a	O
field	O
through	O
which	O
they	O
passed	O
.	O

The	O
lovely	O
creature	O
was	O
incensed	O
at	O
his	O
rude	O
behaviour	O
for	O
which	O
she	O
reproached	O
him	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
manner	O
that	O
he	O
lost	O
all	O
regard	O
to	O
decency	O
,	O
and	O
actually	O
offered	O
violence	O
to	O
this	O
pattern	O
of	O
innocence	O
and	O
beauty	O
.	O

But	O
Heaven	O
would	O
not	O
suffer	O
so	O
much	O
goodness	O
to	O
be	O
violated	O
,	O
and	O
sent	O
me	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
passing	O
by	O
accident	O
near	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
was	O
alarmed	O
with	O
her	O
cries	O
,	O
for	O
her	O
succour	O
.	O

What	O
were	O
the	O
emotions	O
of	O
my	O
soul	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
beheld	O
Narcissa	O
almost	O
sinking	O
beneath	O
the	O
brutal	O
force	O
of	O
this	O
satyr	O
!	O

I	O
flew	O
like	O
lightning	O
to	O
her	O
rescue	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
,	O
perceiving	O
me	O
,	O
quitted	O
his	O
prey	O
,	O
and	O
drew	O
his	O
hanger	O
to	O
chastise	O
my	O
presumption	O
.	O

My	O
indignation	O
was	O
too	O
high	O
to	O
admit	O
one	O
thought	O
of	O
fear	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
rushing	O
upon	O
him	O
,	O
I	O
struck	O
his	O
weapon	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
used	O
my	O
cudgel	O
so	O
successfully	O
that	O
he	O
fell	O
to	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
lay	O
,	O
to	O
all	O
appearance	O
,	O
without	O
sense	O
.	O

Then	O
I	O
turned	O
to	O
Narcissa	PNM
,	O
who	O
had	O
swooned	O
,	O
and	O
sitting	O
down	O
by	O
her	O
,	O
gently	O
raised	O
her	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
supported	O
it	O
on	O
my	O
bosom	O
,	O
while	O
,	O
with	O
my	O
hand	O
around	O
her	O
waist	O
,	O
I	O
kept	O
her	O
in	O
that	O
position	O
.	O

My	O
soul	O
was	O
thrilled	O
with	O
tumultuous	O
joy	O
,	O
at	O
feeling	O
the	O
object	O
of	O
my	O
dearest	O
wishes	O
within	O
my	O
arms	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
while	O
she	O
lay	O
insensible	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
refrain	O
from	O
applying	O
my	O
cheeks	O
to	O
hers	O
,	O
and	O
ravishing	O
a	O
kiss	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
little	O
time	O
the	O
blood	O
began	O
to	O
revisit	O
her	O
face	O
,	O
she	O
opened	O
her	O
enchanting	O
eyes	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
recollected	O
her	O
late	O
situation	O
,	O
said	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
look	O
full	O
of	O
tender	O
acknowledgment	O
,	O
``	O
Dear	O
John	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
eternally	O
obliged	O
to	O
you	O

''	O

So	O
saying	O
she	O
made	O
an	O
effort	O
to	O
rise	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
I	O
assisted	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
proceeded	O
to	O
the	O
house	O
,	O
leaning	O
upon	O
me	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
a	O
thousand	O
times	O
tempted	O
by	O
this	O
opportunity	O
to	O
declare	O
my	O
passion	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
dread	O
of	O
disobliging	O
her	O
restrained	O
my	O
tongue	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
not	O
moved	O
a	O
hundred	O
paces	O
from	O
the	O
scene	O
of	O
her	O
distress	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
perceived	O
Sir	O
Timothy	O
rise	O
and	O
walk	O
homeward	O
--	O
a	O
circumstance	O
which	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
gave	O
me	O
some	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
inasmuch	O
as	O
I	O
thereby	O
knew	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
killed	O
him	O
,	O
filled	O
me	O
with	O
just	O
apprehension	O
of	O
his	O
resentment	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
found	O
myself	O
in	O
no	O
condition	O
to	O
withstand	O
;	O
especially	O
when	O
I	O
considered	O
his	O
intimacy	O
with	O
our	O
squire	O
,	O
to	O
whom	O
I	O
knew	O
he	O
could	O
justify	O
himself	O
for	O
what	O
he	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
by	O
imputing	O
it	O
to	O
his	O
love	O
,	O
and	O
desiring	O
his	O
brother	O
Bruin	O
to	O
take	O
the	O

liberty	O
with	O
his	O
sister	O
,	O
without	O
any	O
fear	O
of	O
offence	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
arrived	O
at	O
the	O
house	O
,	O
Narcissa	PNM
assured	O
me	O
she	O
would	O
exert	O
all	O
her	O
influence	O
in	O
protecting	O
me	O
from	O
the	O
revenge	O
of	O
Thicket	PNM
,	O
and	O
likewise	O
engage	O
her	O

in	O
my	O
favour	O

At	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
pulling	O
out	O
her	O
purse	O
,	O
offered	O
it	O
as	O
a	O
small	O
consideration	O
for	O
the	O
service	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
her	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
stood	O
too	O
much	O
upon	O
the	O
punctilios	O
of	O
love	O
to	O
incur	O
the	O
least	O
suspicion	O
of	O
being	O
mercenary	O
,	O
and	O
refused	O
the	O
present	O
,	O
by	O
saying	O
I	O
had	O
merited	O
nothing	O
by	O
barely	O
doing	O
my	O
duty	O

She	O
seemed	O
astonished	O
at	O
my	O
disinterestedness	O

and	O
blushed	O
:	O
I	O
felt	O
the	O

suffusion	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
downcast	O
eye	O
and	O
broken	O
accent	O
,	O
told	O
her	O
I	O
had	O
one	O
request	O
to	O
make	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
if	O
her	O
generosity	O
would	O
grant	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
think	O
myself	O
fully	O
recompensed	O

for	O
an	O
age	O
of	O

She	O
changed	O
colour	O
at	O
this	O
preamble	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
with	O
great	O
confusion	O
,	O
replied	O
,	O
she	O
hoped	O
my	O
good	O
sense	O
would	O
hinder	O
me	O
from	O
asking	O
anything	O
she	O
was	O
bound	O
in	O
honour	O
to	O
refuse	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
bade	O
me	O
signify	O
my	O
desire	O

Upon	O
which	O
I	O
kneeled	O

and	O
engaged	O
to	O
kiss	O
her	O

She	O
immediately	O

with	O
an	O

look	O

stretched	O
it	O
out	O

I	O
imprinted	O

an	O
ardent	O

bathing	O
it	O
with	O
my	O

cried	O

``	O

I	O
soon	O
perceived	O
to	O

This	O
discovery	O
gave	O
me	O
some	O
satisfaction	O
at	O
first	O

because	O

It	O
was	O
in	O
vain	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
protest	O
my	O
innocence	O
:	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
persuade	O
them	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
taken	O
a	O
solitary	O
walk	O
to	O
their	O
haunt	O
,	O
at	O
such	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
merely	O
for	O
my	O

amusement	O

I	O
did	O
not	O

it	O
my	O
interest	O
to	O
disclose	O
the	O
true	O
cause	O
of	O
my	O
retreat	O

because	O
I	O
was	O

peace	O
with	O
justice	O
by	O
surrendering	O
me	O
to	O
the	O
penalty	O
of	O
the	O
law	O
.	O

What	O
confirmed	O
their	O
suspicion	O
was	O
,	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
a	O
custom-house	O
yacht	O
,	O
which	O
gave	O
them	O
chase	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
well	O
nigh	O
made	O
a	O
prize	O
of	O
their	O
vessel	O
;	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
delivered	O
from	O
their	O
fears	O
by	O
a	O
thick	O
fog	O
,	O
which	O
effectually	O
screened	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
favoured	O
their	O
arrival	O
at	O
Boulogne	PNM
.	O

But	O
,	O
before	O
they	O
got	O
out	O
of	O
sight	O
of	O
their	O
pursuer	O
,	O
they	O
held	O
a	O
council	O
of	O
war	O
about	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
ferocious	O
among	O
them	O
would	O
have	O
thrown	O
me	O
overboard	O
as	O
a	O
traitor	O

betrayed	O
them	O
to	O
their	O
enemies	O

others	O
,	O
more	O
considerate	O
,	O
alleged	O

that	O
if	O
they	O
put	O
me	O
to	O
death	O
,	O
and	O
should	O
afterwards	O
be	O
taken	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
expect	O
no	O
mercy	O
from	O
the	O
legislature	O

which	O
would	O
never	O
pardon	O
outlawry	O

It	O
was	O
therefore	O
determined	O
by	O
a	O
plurality	O
of	O
votes	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
set	O
on	O
shore	O
in	O
France	PNM
,	O
and	O
left	O
to	O
find	O
my	O
way	O
back	O
to	O
England	PNM
,	O
as	O
I	O
should	O
think	O
proper	O
,	O
this	O
being	O
punishment	O
sufficient	O
for	O
the	O
bare	O
suspicion	O
of	O
a	O
crime	O
in	O
itself	O
not	O
capital	O
.	O

Although	O
this	O
favourable	O
determination	O
gave	O
me	O
great	O
pleasure	O
,	O
the	O
apprehension	O
of	O
being	O
robbed	O
would	O
not	O
suffer	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
perfectly	O
at	O
ease	O

To	O
prevent	O
this	O
calamity	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
untied	O
,	O
in	O
consequence	O
of	O
the	O
aforesaid	O
decision	O
,	O
I	O
tore	O
a	O
small	O
hole	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
my	O
stockings	O
,	O
into	O
which	O
I	O
dropped	O
six	O
guineas	O
,	O
reserving	O
half	O
a	O
piece	O
and	O
some	O
silver	O
in	O
my	O
pocket	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
finding	O
something	O
,	O
they	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
tempted	O
to	O
make	O
any	O
further	O
inquiry	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
necessary	O
precaution	O
,	O
for	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
within	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
French	O
shore	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
smugglers	O
told	O
me	O

I	O
must	O
pay	O
for	O
my	O
passage	O

To	O
this	O
declaration	O
I	O
replied	O
,	O
that	O
my	O
passage	O
was	O
none	O
of	O
my	O
own	O
seeking	O
;	O
therefore	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
expect	O
a	O
reward	O
from	O
me	O
for	O
transporting	O
me	O
into	O
a	O
strange	O
country	O
by	O
force	O

``	O

a	O
little	O
while	O
after	O
we	O
went	O
all	O
on	O
shore	O
together	O

I	O
resolved	O
to	O
take	O
my	O
leave	O
of	O
those	O
desperadoes	O
without	O
much	O
ceremony	O
,	O
when	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
cautioned	O
me	O
against	O

if	O
ever	O
I	O
returned	O

England	PNM

I	O
promised	O
to	O
observe	O
his	O

and	O
departed	O
for	O
the	O
Upper	PNM
Town	PNM

where	O
I	O
inquired	O
for	O
a	O
cabaret	O

public-house	O

into	O
which	O
I	O
went	O
,	O
with	O
an	O
intention	O
of	O
taking	O
some	O
refreshment	O

In	O
the	O
kitchen	O

five	O

they	O

with	O
great	O
perseverance	O
and	O
satisfaction	O

At	O
some	O
distance	O
from	O

I	O
perceived	O
another	O

the	O

sitting	O
in	O

to	O
him	O
the	O
ungenerous	O
usage	O
I	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
from	O
Potion	O
;	O
at	O
which	O
relation	O
he	O
started	O
up	O
,	O
stalked	O
across	O
the	O
room	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
times	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
hurry	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
grasping	O
his	O

cried	O

I	O
then	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
detail	O

which	O
affected	O
him	O
more	O
than	O
I	O
could	O

imagined	O

concluded	O
with	O
telling	O
him	O
that	O
Captain	O

was	O
still	O
alive	O

that	O
he	O
might	O

was	O

this	O
piece	O

of	O

London	PNM

This	O
objection	O
I	O
soon	O
removed	O
,	O
by	O
putting	O
five	O
guineas	O
into	O
his	O
hand	O

and	O
telling	O
him	O
I	O
thought	O
myself	O
extremely	O
happy	O

having	O
an	O
opportunity	O
of	O
manifesting	O
my	O
gratitude	O
to	O
him	O
in	O
his	O
necessity	O

But	O
it	O
was	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
difficulty	O
I	O
could	O
prevail	O
upon	O
him	O
to	O
accept	O
of	O
two	O

which	O
he	O
affirmed	O
were	O
more	O
than	O
sufficient	O
to	O
defray	O
the	O

expense	O

I	O
embraced	O
his	O

with	O
great	O
eagerness	O

and	O
he	O
appointed	O
me	O
to	O
come	O
back	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O

when	O
he	O
would	O
not	O

likewise	O
introduce	O
me	O
to	O
a	O
capuchin	O
of	O
his	O
acquaintance	O

who	O
intended	O
to	O
set	O
out	O
for	O
Paris	PNM
next	O

without	O

This	O
piece	O
of	O

gave	O
me	O
infinite	O
pleasure	O

I	O
acknowledged	O
my	O

to	O
the	O
benevolent	O
father	O
in	O
the	O
most	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
long	O
before	O
I	O
discovered	O
my	O
fellow	O
traveller	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
merry	O
facetious	O
fellow	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
his	O
profession	O
and	O
appearance	O
of	O
mortification	O
,	O
loved	O
good	O
eating	O
and	O
drinking	O
better	O
than	O
his	O
rosary	O
,	O
and	O
paid	O
more	O
adoration	O
to	O
a	O
pretty	O
girl	O
than	O
to	O
the	O
Virgin	O
Mary	O
,	O
or	O
St.	PNM
Genevieve	PNM

He	O
was	O
a	O
thick	O
brawny	O
young	O
man	O
,	O
with	O
red	O
eyebrows	O
,	O
a	O
hook	O
nose	O
,	O
a	O
face	O
covered	O
with	O
freckles	O
;	O
and	O
his	O
name	O
was	O
Frere	O
Balthazar	O
.	O

His	O
order	O
did	O
not	O
permit	O
him	O
to	O
wear	O
linen	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
,	O
having	O
little	O
occasion	O
to	O
undress	O
himself	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
none	O
of	O
the	O
cleanliest	O
animals	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
;	O
and	O
his	O
constitution	O
was	O
naturally	O
so	O
strongly	O
scented	O
that	O
I	O
always	O
thought	O
it	O
convenient	O
to	O
keep	O
to	O
the	O
windward	O
of	O
him	O
in	O
our	O
march	O

As	O
he	O
was	O
perfectly	O
well	O
known	O
on	O
the	O
road	O
,	O
we	O
fared	O
sumptuously	O
without	O
any	O
cost	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
fatigue	O
of	O
our	O
journey	O
was	O
much	O
alleviated	O
by	O
the	O
good	O
humour	O
of	O
my	O
companion	O
,	O
who	O
sang	O
an	O
infinite	O
number	O
of	O
catches	O
on	O
the	O
subjects	O
of	O
love	O
and	O
wine	O

We	O
took	O
up	O
our	O
lodging	O
the	O
first	O
night	O
at	O
a	O
peasant	O
's	O
house	O
not	O

from	O
Abbeville	PNM
,	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
entertained	O
with	O
an	O
excellent	O
ragout	O

cooked	O
by	O
our	O
landlord	O
's	O
daughters	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
whom	O
was	O
very	O
handsome	O

After	O
having	O
eaten	O
heartily	O
and	O
drank	O
a	O
sufficient	O
quantity	O
of	O
small	O
wine	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
conducted	O
to	O
a	O
barn	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
carpets	O
spread	O
upon	O
clean	O
straw	O
for	O
our	O
reception	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
not	O
lain	O
in	O
this	O
situation	O
above	O
half-an-hour	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
heard	O
somebody	O
knock	O
softly	O
at	O
the	O
door	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
Balthazar	O
got	O
up	O

and	O
let	O
in	O
our	O

two	O
daughters	O

who	O
wanted	O
to	O
have	O
some	O
private	O

with	O
him	O
in	O
the	O

When	O
they	O
had	O
whispered	O
together	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
the	O
capuchin	O
came	O
to	O
me	O

and	O
asked	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
insensible	O
to	O
love	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
hard-hearted	O
as	O
to	O

to	O
a	O
pretty	O
maid	O
who	O
had	O
a	O

for	O
me	O

I	O
must	O
own	O
to	O
my	O
shame	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
suffered	O
myself	O
to	O
be	O
overcome	O
by	O
my	O
passion	O

and	O
with	O
great	O
eagerness	O
seized	O
the	O
occasion	O

I	O
understood	O
that	O
the	O
amiable	O
Nanette	O
was	O
to	O

In	O

did	O
my	O

suggest	O
the	O
respect	O
that	O
I	O
owed	O
to	O
my	O
dear	O
mistress	O
Narcissa	PNM
;	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
that	O
lovely	O
charmer	O
rather	O
increased	O
than	O
allayed	O
the	O
ferment	O
of	O
my	O
spirits	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
young	O
paysanne	O
had	O
no	O

of	O
my	O
remembrance	O

Early	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O

the	O

left	O
us	O
to	O
our	O
repose	O

lasted	O

He	O
had	O
no	O

I	O
moved	O
from	O

was	O

with	O
grief	O

that	O
a	O

In	O
this	O

I	O

I	O
revolved	O
all	O
the	O
crimes	O
I	O
had	O
been	O

found	O
them	O
too	O

a	O

at	O

A	O

I	O

As	O
I	O
lay	O
in	O
this	O
manner	O

groaning	O
over	O
my	O
hapless	O
fate	O

I	O
heard	O
the	O
sound	O
of	O
a	O

and	O
raising	O
my	O

perceived	O
a	O

on	O

at	O
some	O

I	O
looked	O
upon	O
this	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
favourable	O
season	O
for	O
distress	O

attract	O

the	O

with	O

I	O
got	O
up	O

approached	O
those	O

whom	O
I	O
soon	O
discovered	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
party	O
of	O

with	O
their	O

unbending	O

themselves	O
at	O
this	O
rate	O

after	O
the	O

of	O

I	O
had	O
never	O

such	O
a	O

neither	O

I	O
saluted	O

with	O

after	O
which	O
they	O
formed	O
a	O
ring	O

around	O
me	O

This	O

had	O
a	O

We	O
began	O
our	O

then	O
I	O
became	O
acquainted	O
with	O
that	O
part	O

life	O
to	O
which	O
I	O

It	O
is	O
impossible	O
to	O

the	O

I	O
sustained	O

the	O

in	O
a	O

so	O
many	O

in	O
a	O
very	O

the	O
inside	O

and	O
I	O
proceeded	O
in	O
the	O

torture	O

This	O
misfortune	O
I	O
owed	O
to	O
the	O
plumpness	O
of	O
my	O
constitution	O

I	O
cursed	O

The	O
continual	O
pain	O
I	O
felt	O
made	O
me	O
fretful	O

and	O
my	O
peevishness	O
was	O
increased	O
by	O
the	O

those	O

a	O

In	O

repeated	O
all	O

and	O
that	O
those	O

of	O
the	O
English	O

which	O
are	O
branded	O
with	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
rebellion	O
by	O
the	O
slaves	O
of	O

were	O
no	O

than	O
glorious	O
efforts	O

The	O
Frenchman	O
,	O
provoked	O
at	O
the	O
little	O
deference	O
I	O
paid	O
to	O
the	O
kingly	O
name	O
,	O
lost	O
all	O
patience	O
,	O
and	O
reproached	O
me	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
manner	O
that	O
my	O
temper	O
forsook	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
clenched	O
my	O
fist	O
,	O
with	O
an	O
intention	O
to	O
give	O
him	O
a	O
hearty	O
box	O
on	O
the	O
ear	O
.	O

Perceiving	O
my	O
design	O
,	O
he	O
started	O
back	O
and	O
demanded	O
a	O
parley	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
I	O
checked	O
my	O
indignation	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
gave	O
me	O
to	O
understand	O
that	O
a	O
Frenchman	O
never	O
forgave	O
a	O
blow	O
;	O
therefore	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
were	O
not	O
weary	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
do	O
well	O
to	O
spare	O
him	O
that	O
mortification	O
,	O
and	O
do	O
him	O
the	O
honour	O
of	O
measuring	O
his	O
sword	O
with	O
mine	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
gentleman	O
.	O

I	O
took	O
his	O
advice	O
and	O
followed	O
him	O
to	O
a	O
field	O
hard	O
by	O
,	O
where	O
indeed	O
I	O
was	O
ashamed	O
at	O
the	O
pitiful	O
figure	O
of	O
my	O
antagonist	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
a	O
poor	O
little	O
shivering	O
creature	O
,	O
decrepit	O
with	O
age	O
,	O
and	O
blind	O
of	O
one	O
eye	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
soon	O
found	O
the	O
folly	O
of	O
judging	O
from	O
appearances	O
;	O
being	O
at	O
the	O
second	O
pass	O
wounded	O
in	O
the	O
sword	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
disarmed	O
with	O
such	O
a	O
jerk	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
thought	O
the	O
joint	O
was	O
dislocated	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
no	O
less	O
confounded	O
than	O
enraged	O
at	O
this	O
event	O
,	O
especially	O
as	O
my	O
adversary	O
did	O
not	O
bear	O
his	O
success	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
moderation	O
that	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
expected	O
;	O
for	O
he	O
insisted	O
upon	O
my	O
asking	O
pardon	O
for	O
affronting	O
his	O
king	O
and	O
him	O
.	O

This	O
proposal	O
I	O
would	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
comply	O
with	O
,	O
but	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
mean	O
condescension	O
,	O
which	O
no	O
gentleman	O
in	O
his	O
circumstances	O
ought	O
to	O
propose	O
,	O
nor	O
any	O
in	O
my	O
situation	O
ought	O
to	O
perform	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
persisted	O
in	O
his	O
ungenerous	O
demand	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
in	O
my	O
turn	O
claim	O
satisfaction	O
with	O
my	O
musket	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
more	O
upon	O
a	O
par	O

with	O
the	O

The	O

on	O

to	O

that	O
he	O

would	O
in	O

instruct	O

thoroughly	O
in	O
that	O

chastise	O
the	O

for	O
his	O

at	O

This	O

proffered	O
on	O
pretence	O
of	O
the	O
regard	O
he	O
had	O
for	O
his	O
countrymen	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
afterwards	O
learned	O
the	O
true	O
motive	O
was	O
no	O
other	O
than	O
a	O
jealousy	O
he	O
entertained	O
of	O
a	O
correspondence	O
between	O
the	O

which	O
he	O
did	O

Be	O
this	O
as	O
it	O

I	O
accepted	O

at	O

the	O
correction	O
I	O
had	O
already	O

from	O
him	O
for	O
my	O
insolence	O
;	O
for	O
he	O
might	O
not	O

be	O
in	O
the	O
humour	O
of	O
sparing	O
a	O
wretch	O
who	O
abused	O
his	O
goodness	O
.	O

To	O
this	O
inuendo	O
I	O
made	O
no	O
reply	O
but	O
by	O
a	O
kick	O
on	O
the	O
breech	O
,	O
which	O
overturned	O
him	O
in	O
an	O
instant	O

He	O
started	O
up	O
with	O
wonderful	O
agility	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
drawing	O
his	O
sword	O
,	O
attacked	O
me	O
with	O
great	O
fury	O

Several	O
people	O
interposed	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
informed	O
them	O
of	O
its	O
being	O
an	O
affair	O
of	O
honour	O
,	O
they	O
retired	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
us	O
to	O
decide	O
the	O
battle	O
by	O
ourselves	O
.	O

I	O
sustained	O
his	O
onset	O
with	O
little	O
damage	O
,	O
having	O
only	O
received	O
a	O
small	O
scratch	O
on	O
my	O
right	O
shoulder	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
seeing	O
his	O
breath	O
and	O
vigour	O
almost	O
exhausted	O
,	O
assaulted	O
him	O
in	O
my	O
turn	O
,	O
closed	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
wrested	O
his	O
sword	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
hand	O
in	O
the	O
struggle	O
.	O

Having	O
thus	O
acquired	O
the	O
victory	O
,	O
I	O
desired	O
him	O
to	O
beg	O
his	O
life	O
;	O
to	O
which	O
demand	O
he	O
made	O
no	O
answer	O

but	O
shrugged	O
up	O
his	O
shoulders	O
to	O
his	O
ears	O
,	O
expanded	O
his	O
hands	O
,	O
elevated	O
the	O
skin	O
on	O
his	O
forehead	O
and	O
eyebrows	O

and	O
depressed	O
the	O
corners	O
of	O
his	O
mouth	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
manner	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
scarce	O
refrain	O
from	O
laughing	O
aloud	O
at	O
his	O
grotesque	O
appearance	O

That	O
I	O
might	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
mortify	O
his	O
vanity	O
,	O
which	O
triumphed	O
without	O
bounds	O
over	O
my	O
misfortune	O
,	O
I	O
thrust	O
his	O
sword	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
hilt	O
in	O
something	O

It	O
was	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

to	O
which	O

five	O

a	O

together	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
,	O
by	O
hunger	O

hard	O
duty	O
,	O
brought	O
down	O
to	O
the	O

my	O

my	O

In	O
this	O

of	O
my	O

I	O
wrote	O
to	O
my	O

in	O

though	O
my	O

for	O
the	O

I	O
have	O
already	O

in	O

had	O
recourse	O

my	O

consoling	O
myself	O
with	O
the	O
flattering	O

of	O
a	O
lively	O

that	O
never	O
abandoned	O
me	O
in	O
my	O

One	O
day	O

while	O
I	O
stood	O
sentinel	O
at	O
the	O
gate	O
of	O
a	O
general	O

a	O

a	O

in	O

to	O
whom	O
,	O
at	O

I	O
heard	O
him	O
say	O

``	O
You	O

depend	O
upon	O
my	O

This	O
assurance	O
was	O
answered	O
by	O
a	O
low	O
bow	O
of	O
the	O
person	O
in	O
black	O

who	O
,	O
turning	O
to	O

discovered	O
to	O
me	O
the	O

of	O
my	O
old	O
friend	O
and	O
adherent	O
Strap	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
so	O
much	O
astonished	O
at	O
the	O
sight	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
lost	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
utterance	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
before	O
I	O
could	O
recollect	O
myself	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
gone	O
without	O
taking	O
any	O
notice	O
of	O
me	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
had	O
he	O
stayed	O
,	O
I	O
scarcely	O
should	O
have	O
ventured	O
to	O
accost	O
him	O
;	O
because	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
was	O
perfectly	O
well	O
acquainted	O
with	O
the	O
features	O
of	O
his	O
face	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
positively	O
certain	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
his	O
person	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
very	O
much	O
altered	O
for	O
the	O
better	O
since	O
he	O
left	O
me	O
at	O
London	PNM
,	O
neither	O
could	O
I	O
conceive	O
by	O
which	O
means	O
he	O
was	O
enabled	O
to	O
appear	O
in	O
the	O
sphere	O
of	O
a	O
gentleman	O
,	O
to	O
which	O
,	O
while	O
I	O
knew	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
even	O
the	O
ambition	O
to	O
aspire	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
was	O
too	O
much	O
concerned	O
in	O
the	O
affair	O
to	O
neglect	O
further	O
information	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
took	O
the	O
first	O
opportunity	O
of	O
asking	O
the	O
porter	O
if	O
he	O
knew	O
the	O
gentleman	O
to	O
whom	O
the	O
marquis	O
spoke	O
.	O

The	O
Swiss	O
told	O
me	O
his	O
name	O
was	O
Monsieur	O
d'Estrapes	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
valet-de-chambre	O
to	O
an	O
English	O
gentleman	O
lately	O
deceased	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
very	O
much	O
regarded	O
by	O
the	O
marquis	O
for	O
his	O
fidelity	O
to	O
his	O
master	O
,	O
between	O
whom	O
and	O
that	O
nobleman	O
a	O
very	O
intimate	O
friendship	O
had	O
subsisted	O
.	O

Nothing	O
could	O
be	O
more	O
agreeable	O
to	O
me	O
than	O
this	O
piece	O
of	O
intelligence	O
,	O
which	O
banished	O
all	O
doubt	O
of	O
its	O
being	O
my	O
friend	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
frenchify	O
his	O
name	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
his	O
behaviour	O
since	O
we	O
parted	O

As	O
soon	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
relieved	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
his	O
lodging	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
a	O
direction	O
given	O
me	O
by	O
the	O
Swiss	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
the	O
good	O
fortune	O
to	O
find	O
him	O
at	O
home	O
.	O

That	O
I	O
might	O
surprise	O
him	O
the	O
more	O
,	O
I	O
concealed	O
my	O
name	O
and	O
business	O
,	O
and	O
only	O
desired	O
the	O
servant	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
to	O
tell	O
Monsieur	O
d'Estrapes	O
that	O
I	O
begged	O
the	O
honour	O
of	O
half-an-hour	O
's	O
conversation	O
with	O
him	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
confounded	O
and	O
dismayed	O
at	O
this	O
message	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
understood	O
it	O
was	O
sent	O
by	O
a	O
soldier	O
;	O
though	O
he	O
was	O
conscious	O
to	O
himself	O
of	O
no	O
crime	O
,	O
all	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
heard	O
of	O
the	O
Bastille	O
appeared	O
to	O
his	O
imagination	O
with	O
aggravated	O
horror	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
before	O
I	O
had	O
waited	O
a	O
considerable	O
time	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
resolution	O
enough	O
to	O
bid	O
the	O
servant	O
show	O
me	O
up-stairs	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
entered	O
his	O
chamber	O
,	O
he	O
returned	O
my	O
bow	O
with	O
great	O
civility	O
,	O
and	O
endeavoured	O
,	O
with	O
forced	O
complaisance	O
,	O
to	O
disguise	O
his	O
fear	O
,	O
which	O
appeared	O
in	O
the	O
paleness	O
of	O
his	O
face	O
,	O
the	O
wildness	O
of	O
his	O
looks	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
shaking	O
of	O
his	O
limbs	O

I	O
was	O
diverted	O
at	O
his	O
consternation	O
,	O
which	O
redoubled	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
in	O
French	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
business	O
for	O
his	O
private	O
ear	O
and	O
demanded	O
a	O
particular	O
audience	O
.	O

The	O
valet	O
being	O
withdrawn	O
,	O
I	O
asked	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
language	O
if	O
his	O
name	O
was	O
d'Estrapes	O
,	O
to	O
which	O
he	O
answered	O
with	O
a	O
faltering	O
tongue	O

``	O

``	O

``	O

I	O

desired	O

would	O
do	O
me	O
the	O

at	O
me	O

he	O
no	O

I	O

observed	O
,	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
unwelcome	O
to	O
a	O
person	O
who	O
had	O
not	O
eaten	O
a	O
comfortable	O
meal	O
these	O
seven	O
months	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
had	O
another	O
request	O
to	O
make	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
begged	O
he	O
would	O
grant	O
before	O
dinner	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
the	O
loan	O
of	O
a	O
shirt	O
;	O
for	O
although	O
my	O
back	O
had	O
been	O
many	O
weeks	O
a	O
stranger	O
to	O
any	O
comfort	O
of	O
that	O

my	O
skin	O
was	O
not	O

familiarised	O
to	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
it	O

He	O
stared	O
in	O
my	O
face	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
woful	O
countenance	O
,	O
at	O
this	O
declaration	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
could	O
scarce	O
believe	O
,	O
until	O
I	O
explained	O
it	O
by	O
unbuttoning	O
my	O
coat	O
and	O
disclosing	O
my	O
naked	O
body	O
--	O
a	O
circumstance	O
which	O
shocked	O
the	O
tender-hearted	O
Strap	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
with	O
tears	O
in	O
his	O
eyes	O
,	O
ran	O
to	O
a	O
chest	O
of	O
drawers	O
,	O
and	O
taking	O
out	O
some	O
linen	O
,	O
presented	O
to	O
me	O
a	O
very	O
fine	O
ruffled	O
Holland	O
shirt	O
and	O
cambric	O
neckcloth	O
,	O
assuring	O
me	O
he	O
had	O
three	O
dozen	O
of	O
the	O

kind	O
at	O
my	O
service	O

I	O
was	O
ravished	O
at	O
this	O
piece	O
of	O
good	O
news	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
accommodated	O
myself	O
in	O
a	O
moment	O
,	O
hugged	O
my	O
benefactor	O
for	O
his	O
generous	O
offer	O
,	O
saying	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
overjoyed	O
to	O
find	O
him	O
undebauched	O
by	O
prosperity	O
,	O
which	O
seldom	O
fails	O
to	O
corrupt	O
the	O
heart	O

He	O
bespoke	O
for	O
dinner	O
some	O
soup	O
and	O
bouilli	O
,	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
pullets	O
roasted	O

and	O
a	O
dish	O
of	O
asparagus	O

and	O
in	O
the	O
interim	O
entertained	O
me	O
with	O
biscuit	O
and	O
Burgundy	O
,	O
after	O
which	O
repast	O
he	O
entreated	O
me	O
to	O
gratify	O
his	O
longing	O
desire	O
of	O
knowing	O
every	O
circumstance	O
of	O
my	O
fortune	O
since	O
his	O
departure	O
from	O
London	PNM

This	O
request	O
I	O
complied	O
with	O

beginning	O
at	O
the	O

of	O
Gawky	O

from	O

During	O
the	O
recital	O
,	O
my	O
friend	O
was	O
strongly	O
affected	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
various	O
situations	O
described	O

He	O
stared	O
with	O
surprise	O

glowed	O
with	O
indignation	O

gaped	O
with	O
curiosity	O
,	O
smiled	O
with	O
pleasure	O

trembled	O
with	O
fear	O

and	O
wept	O
with	O
sorrow	O

as	O
the	O
vicissitudes	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
inspired	O
these	O
different	O
passions	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
when	O
my	O
story	O
was	O
ended	O

signified	O
his	O
amazement	O
on	O
the	O

by	O
lifting	O
up	O
his	O

a	O

suffered	O
more	O
than	O

After	O
dinner	O
,	O
I	O
desired	O
in	O
my	O
turn	O
to	O
know	O
the	O
particulars	O
of	O
his	O

he	O
satisfied	O
me	O
in	O
a	O

words	O

by	O
giving	O
me	O

that	O

during	O

his	O

on	O
their	O

in	O

he	O
committed	O
such	O

that	O
his	O

failed	O

and	O
he	O
fell	O
into	O
a	O
consumption	O

that	O
by	O
the	O

when	O
he	O
was	O
seized	O
with	O
a	O

him	O
off	O

ten	O

to	O
the	O

this	O
proposal	O
was	O

I	O
listened	O
to	O
it	O
with	O

it	O

Monsieur	O

Here	O
I	O
had	O
time	O
to	O
reflect	O

myself	O
upon	O
this	O
sudden	O
transition	O

fate	O

to	O
bear	O
with	O
moderation	O
required	O
some	O

in	O

appeared	O
in	O
a	O
front	O

at	O
the	O

where	O
I	O
saw	O
a	O
good	O
deal	O
of	O

and	O
was	O
vain	O
enough	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
observed	O
with	O
an	O
uncommon	O
degree	O
of	O
attention	O
and	O
applause	O

This	O
silly	O
conceit	O
intoxicated	O
me	O
so	O
much	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
guilty	O
of	O
a	O
thousand	O
ridiculous	O
coquetries	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
dare	O
say	O
,	O
how	O
favourable	O
soever	O
the	O
thoughts	O
of	O
the	O
company	O
might	O
be	O
at	O
my	O
first	O
appearance	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
soon	O
changed	O
by	O
my	O
absurd	O
behaviour	O
into	O
pity	O

I	O
rose	O
and	O
sat	O
down	O

covered	O
and	O
uncovered	O
my	O
head	O
twenty	O
times	O
between	O
the	O

pulled	O
out	O

that	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
all	O
opportunity	O
of	O

my	O

wiped	O
my	O
nose	O
with	O
perfumed	O

;	O
then	O
dangled	O
my	O
cane	O

and	O
adjusted	O
my	O
sword-knot	O
,	O
and	O
acted	O
many	O
more	O
fooleries	O
of	O
the	O

in	O
hopes	O
of	O
obtaining	O
the	O
character	O
of	O
a	O

in	O
the	O
acquiring	O

I	O
found	O
two	O
considerable	O
obstructions	O
in	O

disposition	O
--	O
namely	O
,	O
a	O
natural	O
reserve	O
and	O

sensibility	O

Fain	O
would	O
I	O
have	O
entered	O
into	O
conversation	O
with	O
the	O
people	O
around	O
me	O
:	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
restrained	O
by	O
the	O
fear	O
of	O
being	O
censured	O
for	O
my	O
assurance	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
by	O
reflecting	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
more	O
entitled	O
to	O
a	O
compliment	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
from	O
them	O
,	O
than	O
they	O
to	O
such	O
condescension	O
from	O
a	O
stranger	O
like	O
me	O

How	O
often	O
did	O
I	O
redden	O
at	O
the	O
frequent	O
whispers	O
and	O
loud	O
laughter	O
of	O
my	O
fellow	O
beaux	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
imagined	O
were	O
excited	O
by	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
how	O
often	O
did	O
I	O
envy	O
the	O
happy	O
indifference	O
of	O
those	O
choice	O
spirits	O
,	O
who	O
behold	O
the	O
distress	O
of	O
the	O
scene	O
without	O
discovering	O
the	O
least	O
symptom	O
of	O
approbation	O
or	O
concern	O
.	O

My	O
attention	O
was	O
engaged	O
in	O
spite	O
of	O
myself	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
help	O
weeping	O
with	O
the	O
heroine	O
of	O
the	O
stage	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
practised	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
shifs	O
to	O
conceal	O
this	O
piece	O
of	O
unpolite	O
weakness	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
play	O
was	O
ended	O
,	O
I	O
sat	O
waiting	O
for	O
an	O
opportunity	O
of	O
handing	O
some	O
lady	O
to	O
her	O
coach	O
;	O
but	O
everyone	O
was	O
attended	O
by	O
such	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
officious	O
gallants	O
,	O
that	O
for	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
I	O
was	O
balked	O
in	O
my	O
expectation	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
perceived	O
a	O
very	O
handsome	O
creature	O
,	O
genteelly	O
dressed	O
,	O
sitting	O
by	O
herself	O
in	O
a	O
box	O
,	O
at	O
some	O
distance	O
from	O
me	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
I	O
went	O
up	O
to	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
offered	O
my	O
service	O
.	O

She	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
some	O
confusion	O
,	O
thanked	O
me	O
for	O
my	O
complaisance	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
a	O
tender	O
look	O
declined	O
giving	O
me	O
the	O
trouble	O
:	O
looking	O
at	O
her	O
watch	O
,	O
and	O
testifying	O
her	O
surprise	O
at	O
the	O
negligence	O
of	O
her	O
footman	O
whom	O
she	O
had	O
ordered	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
chair	O
ready	O
for	O
her	O
at	O
that	O
hour	O
.	O

I	O
repeated	O
my	O
entreaty	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
eloquence	O
and	O
compliment	O
I	O
was	O
master	O
of	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
event	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
prevailed	O
upon	O
to	O
accept	O
of	O
a	O
proposal	O
I	O
made	O
,	O
to	O
send	O
my	O
servant	O
for	O
a	O
chair	O
or	O
coach	O
:	O
accordingly	O
,	O
Strap	O
was	O
detached	O
for	O
that	O
purpose	O
,	O
and	O
returned	O
without	O
success	O
.	O

By	O
this	O
time	O
the	O
playhouse	O
was	O
quite	O
empty	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
retire	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
led	O
her	O
through	O
the	O
passage	O
,	O
I	O
observed	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
young	O
fellows	O
of	O
fashion	O
standing	O
in	O
a	O
corner	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
whom	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
tipped	O
my	O
charmer	O
the	O
wink	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
passed	O
,	O
I	O
heard	O
a	O
loud	O
laugh	O
.	O

This	O
note	O
aroused	O
my	O
attention	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
resolved	O
to	O
be	O
fully	O
satisfied	O
of	O
this	O
lady	O
's	O
character	O
,	O
before	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
any	O
nearer	O
connection	O
with	O
her	O
.	O

As	O
no	O
convenience	O
appeared	O
,	O
I	O
proposed	O
to	O
conduct	O
her	O
to	O
a	O
tavern	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
might	O
stay	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
,	O
until	O
my	O
servant	O
could	O
fetch	O
a	O
coach	O
from	O
the	O
Strand	O
.	O

She	O
seemed	O
particularly	O
shy	O
of	O
trusting	O
herself	O
in	O
a	O
tavern	O
with	O
a	O
stranger	O
,	O
but	O
at	O
last	O
yielded	O
to	O
my	O
pathetic	O
remonstrances	O
,	O
rather	O
than	O
endanger	O
her	O
health	O
by	O
remaining	O
in	O
a	O
cold	O
,	O
damp	O
thoroughfare	O
.	O

Having	O
thus	O
far	O
succeeded	O
,	O
I	O
begged	O
to	O
know	O
what	O
wine	O
she	O
would	O
be	O
pleased	O
to	O
drink	O
a	O
glass	O
of	O
;	O
but	O
she	O
professed	O
the	O
greatest	O
aversion	O
to	O
all	O
sorts	O
of	O
strong	O
liquors	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
with	O
much	O
difficulty	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
persuade	O
her	O
to	O
eat	O
a	O
jelly	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
meantime	O
,	O
I	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
alleviate	O
the	O
uneasiness	O
she	O
discovered	O
,	O
by	O
saying	O
all	O
the	O
agreeable	O
things	O
I	O
could	O
think	O
of	O
;	O
at	O
which	O

to	O
my	O

as	O
my	O

Banter	O
in	O
a	O
whisper	O
,	O
gave	O
me	O
to	O
understand	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
an	O
incorrigible	O
coquette	O
,	O
who	O
would	O
grant	O
the	O

favour	O
to	O
any	O
young	O
fellow	O
in	O
England	O
of	O
a	O

merely	O
to	O
engage	O
him	O
among	O
the	O

she	O
might	O
have	O
the	O
pleasure	O
of	O
seeing	O
them	O
daily	O

that	O
she	O
was	O
of	O
a	O
cold	O

disposition	O

dead	O
to	O
every	O
passion	O

vanity	O

so	O

that	O

any	O

her	O
at	O

I	O
attributed	O
a	O
good	O
deal	O
of	O
this	O
intelligence	O
to	O
the	O
satirical	O
turn	O
of	O
my	O
friend	O
,	O
or	O
resentment	O
for	O
having	O
himself	O
suffered	O
a	O
rebuff	O
from	O
the	O
lady	O
in	O
question	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
at	O
any	O
rate	O
,	O
trusted	O
so	O
much	O
to	O
my	O
own	O
accomplishments	O
as	O
to	O
believe	O
no	O
woman	O
could	O
resist	O
the	O
ardour	O
of	O
my	O
addresses	O
.	O

Full	O
of	O
this	O
confidence	O
I	O
repaired	O
to	O
Hampstead	PNM
in	O
company	O
with	O
Billy	O
Chatter	O
,	O
my	O
Lord	O
Hobble	O
,	O
and	O
Doctor	O
Wagtail	O
.	O

There	O
I	O
saw	O
a	O
very	O
brilliant	O
assembly	O
,	O
before	O
whom	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
honour	O
to	O
walk	O
a	O
minuet	O
with	O
Melinda	O
,	O
who	O
charmed	O
me	O
with	O
her	O
frank	O
manner	O
and	O
easiness	O
of	O
behaviour	O
.	O

Before	O
the	O
country	O
dances	O
began	O
,	O
I	O
received	O
a	O
message	O
by	O
a	O
person	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
from	O
Bragwell	PNM
,	O
who	O
was	O
present	O
,	O
importing	O
that	O
nobody	O
who	O
knew	O
him	O
presumed	O
to	O
dance	O
with	O
Melinda	O
while	O
he	O
was	O
there	O
in	O
person	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
do	O
well	O
to	O
relinquish	O
her	O
without	O
noise	O
,	O
because	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
mind	O
to	O
lead	O
up	O
a	O
country	O
dance	O
with	O
her	O
.	O

This	O
extraordinary	O
intimation	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
delivered	O
in	O
the	O
lady	O
's	O
hearing	O
,	O
did	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
discompose	O
me	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
was	O
pretty	O
well	O
acquainted	O
with	O
the	O
character	O
of	O
my	O
rival	O
.	O

I	O
therefore	O
,	O
without	O
the	O
least	O
symptom	O
of	O
concern	O
bade	O
the	O
gentleman	O
tell	O
Mr.	O
Bragwell	O
,	O
that	O
since	O
I	O
was	O
so	O
happy	O
as	O
to	O
obtain	O
the	O
lady	O
's	O
consent	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
solicitous	O
about	O
his	O
;	O
and	O
desired	O
the	O
bearer	O
himself	O
to	O
bring	O
me	O
no	O
such	O
impertinent	O
messages	O
for	O
the	O
future	O
.	O

Melinda	O
,	O
affected	O
a	O
sort	O
of	O
confusion	O
,	O
and	O
pretended	O
to	O
wonder	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Bragwell	O
should	O
give	O
himself	O
such	O
liberties	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
her	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
no	O
manner	O
of	O
connection	O
with	O
the	O
fellow	O
.	O

I	O
laid	O
hold	O
of	O
this	O
opportunity	O
to	O
display	O
my	O
valour	O
,	O
and	O
offered	O
to	O
call	O
him	O
to	O
an	O
account	O
for	O
his	O
insolence	O
,	O
a	O
proposal	O
which	O
she	O
absolutely	O
refused	O
,	O
under	O
pretence	O
of	O
consulting	O
my	O
safety	O
;	O
though	O
I	O
could	O
perceive	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
sparkling	O
of	O
her	O
eyes	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
thought	O
herself	O
affronted	O
by	O
being	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
a	O
duel	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
pleased	O
with	O
this	O
discovery	O
of	O
her	O
thoughts	O
,	O
which	O
not	O
only	O
argued	O
the	O
most	O
unjustifiable	O
vanity	O
,	O
but	O
likewise	O
the	O
most	O
barbarous	O
indifference	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
allured	O
by	O
her	O
fortune	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O
to	O
gratify	O
her	O
pride	O
,	O
in	O
making	O
her	O
the	O
occasion	O
of	O
a	O
public	O
quarrel	O
between	O
me	O
and	O
Bragwell	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
pretty	O
certain	O
,	O
would	O
never	O
drive	O
matters	O
to	O
a	O
dangerous	O
extremity	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
danced	O
together	O
,	O
I	O
observed	O
this	O
formidable	O
rival	O
at	O
one	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
room	O
,	O
encircled	O
with	O
a	O
cluster	O
of	O
beaux	O
,	O
to	O
whom	O
he	O
talked	O
with	O
great	O
vehemence	O
,	O
casting	O
many	O
big	O
looks	O
at	O
me	O
from	O
time	O
to	O
time	O
.	O

I	O
guessed	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
his	O
discourse	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
handed	O
my	O
partner	O
to	O
her	O
seat	O
,	O
strutted	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
he	O
stood	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
cocking	O
my	O
hat	O
in	O
his	O
face	O
,	O
demanded	O
aloud	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
anything	O
to	O
say	O
to	O
me	O
.	O

He	O
answered	O
with	O
a	O
sullen	O
tone	O
,	O
``	O
Nothing	O
,	O
at	O
present	O
,	O
sir	O
;	O
''	O
and	O
turned	O
about	O
upon	O
his	O
heel	O
.	O

``	O
Well	O
,	O
''	O
said	O
I	O
,	O
``	O
you	O
where	O
I	O
am	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
at	O
any	O
time	O
.	O
''	O

His	O
companions	O
stared	O
at	O
one	O
another	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
returned	O
to	O
the	O
lady	O
,	O
whose	O
features	O
brightened	O
at	O
my	O
approach	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
a	O
whisper	O
ran	O
through	O
the	O
whole	O
room	O
;	O
after	O
which	O
so	O
many	O
eyes	O
were	O
turned	O
upon	O
me	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
ready	O
to	O
sink	O
with	O
confusion	O
.	O

When	O
the	O
ball	O
broke	O
up	O
,	O
I	O
led	O
her	O
to	O
her	O
coach	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
like	O
a	O
true	O
French	O
gallant	O
,	O
would	O
have	O
got	O
up	O
behind	O
it	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
protect	O
her	O
from	O
violence	O
on	O
the	O
road	O
,	O
but	O
she	O
absolutely	O
refused	O
my	O
offer	O
,	O
and	O
expressed	O
her	O
concern	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
an	O
empty	O
seat	O
for	O
me	O
within	O
the	O
vehicle	O
.	O

Next	O
day	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
I	O
waited	O
on	O
her	O
at	O
her	O
lodgings	O
,	O
by	O
permission	O
,	O
in	O
company	O
with	O
Chatter	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
very	O
civilly	O
received	O
by	O
her	O
mother	O
,	O
with	O
whom	O
she	O
lived	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
a	O
good	O
many	O
fashionable	O
people	O
present	O
,	O
chiefly	O
young	O
fellows	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
after	O
tea	O
,	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
card	O
tables	O
were	O
set	O
,	O
at	O
one	O
of	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
honour	O
to	O
play	O
with	O
Melinda	O
,	O
who	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
three	O
hours	O
,	O
made	O
shift	O
to	O
plunder	O
me	O
of	O
eight	O
guineas	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
well	O
enough	O
content	O
to	O
lose	O
a	O
little	O
money	O
with	O
a	O
good	O
grace	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
an	O
opportunity	O
in	O
the	O
meantime	O
to	O
say	O
soft	O
things	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
still	O
most	O
welcome	O
when	O
attended	O
with	O
good	O
luck	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
satisfied	O
of	O
her	O
fair	O
play	O
,	O
a	O
circumstance	O
that	O
shocked	O
me	O
not	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
and	O
greatly	O
impaired	O
my	O
opinion	O
of	O
her	O
disinterestedness	O
and	O
delicacy	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
resolved	O
to	O
profit	O
by	O
this	O
behaviour	O
,	O
and	O
treat	O
her	O
in	O
my	O
turn	O
with	O
less	O
ceremony	O
;	O
accordingly	O
,	O
I	O
laid	O
close	O
siege	O
to	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
finding	O
her	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
disgusted	O
with	O
the	O
gross	O
incense	O
I	O
offered	O
,	O
that	O
very	O
night	O
made	O
a	O
declaration	O
of	O
love	O
in	O
plain	O
terms	O
.	O

She	O
received	O
my	O
addresses	O
with	O
great	O
gaiety	O
,	O
and	O
pretended	O
to	O
laugh	O
them	O
off	O
,	O
but	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
treated	O
me	O
with	O
such	O
particular	O
complacency	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
persuaded	O
I	O
had	O
made	O
a	O
conquest	O
of	O
her	O
heart	O
,	O
and	O
concluded	O
myself	O
the	O
happiest	O
man	O
alive	O
.	O

Elevated	O
with	O
these	O
flattering	O
ideas	O
,	O
I	O
sat	O
down	O
again	O
to	O
cards	O
after	O
supper	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
great	O
cheerfulness	O
suffered	O
myself	O
to	O
be	O
cheated	O
of	O
ten	O
guineas	O
more	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
late	O
before	O
I	O
took	O
my	O
leave	O
,	O
after	O
being	O
favoured	O
with	O
a	O
general	O
invitation	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
got	O
into	O
bed	O
,	O
the	O
adventures	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
hindered	O
me	O
from	O
sleeping	O
.	O

Sometimes	O
I	O
pleased	O
myself	O
with	O
the	O
hopes	O
of	O
possessing	O
a	O
fine	O
woman	O
with	O
ten	O
thousand	O
pounds	O
;	O
then	O
I	O
would	O
ruminate	O
on	O
the	O
character	O
I	O
had	O
heard	O
of	O
her	O
from	O
Banter	PNM
,	O
and	O
compare	O
it	O
with	O
the	O
circumstances	O
of	O
her	O
conduct	O
towards	O
me	O
,	O
which	O
seemed	O
to	O
bear	O
too	O
great	O
a	O
resemblance	O
to	O
the	O
picture	O
he	O
had	O
drawn	O
.	O

This	O
introduced	O
a	O
melancholy	O
reflection	O
on	O
the	O
expense	O
I	O
had	O
undergone	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
smallness	O
of	O
my	O
funds	O
to	O
support	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
by-the-by	O
,	O
were	O
none	O
of	O
my	O
own	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
myself	O
involved	O
in	O
doubts	O
and	O
perplexities	O
,	O
that	O
kept	O
me	O
awake	O
the	O

I	O
guessed	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
style	O
and	O
superscription	O
of	O
this	O
billet	O
,	O
that	O
my	O
rival	O
was	O
a	O
true	O
Milesian	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
little	O
uneasy	O
at	O
the	O
contents	O
;	O
especially	O
that	O
part	O

in	O
which	O
he	O
asserted	O
his	O

my	O
mistress	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
not	O
know	O
how	O
to	O
reconcile	O
to	O
her	O
good	O
sense	O
and	O
penetration	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
this	O
was	O
no	O
time	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
decline	O
the	O
defiance	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
success	O
of	O
my	O
addresses	O
in	O
a	O
great	O
measure	O
depended	O
upon	O
my	O
behaviour	O
in	O
that	O
affair	O
.	O

I	O
therefore	O
immediately	O
loaded	O
my	O
pistols	O
,	O

betook	O
myself	O
in	O
a	O
hackney	O
coach	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
appointed	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
tall	O
raw-boned	O
man	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
hard-featured	O
countenance	O
and	O
black	O
bushy	O

walking	O
by	O

wrapped	O

He	O
had	O
no	O

without	O

Alarmed	O
at	O
this	O

I	O
made	O

began	O
to	O
hammer	O
his	O

with	O
great	O
deliberation	O

But	O
I	O
was	O
resolved	O
to	O

his	O

for	O
another	O

but	O
this	O

refused	O
to	O

complained	O
bitterly	O
of	O
my	O
having	O

let	O
him	O

a	O

it	O
was	O
my	O

prevent	O
him	O
from	O
enjoying	O
a	O
third	O
;	O

now	O
,	O
since	O
I	O
had	O
an	O
opportunity	O

I	O
demanded	O
a	O
parley	O

to	O
the	O

of	O
my	O
remembrance	O

far	O
from	O
having	O
done	O
him	O
any	O

hearing	O

had	O
got	O
ten	O

he	O
intended	O
to	O
make	O
himself	O
master	O
of	O
that	O
sum	O
by	O
espousing	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
was	O
determined	O

in	O
an	O
honourable	O
way	O
,	O
to	O
cut	O
the	O
throats	O
of	O
all	O
those	O
who	O
stood	O
between	O
him	O

hopes	O

I	O
then	O
demanded	O
to	O
know	O
the	O
foundation	O
of	O

hopes	O
;	O
and	O
now	O
that	O
I	O
had	O

him	O

being	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
astonished	O
at	O
the	O
circumstance	O
of	O
the	O
promise	O
,	O
desired	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
explain	O
that	O

He	O
gave	O
me	O
to	O
understand	O

that	O
he	O
trusted	O
entirely	O
to	O
his	O

merit	O

that	O
he	O

frequently	O

setting	O
forth	O
his	O
claim	O
and	O

but	O
she	O
was	O
never	O
kind	O
enough	O
to	O
send	O
an	O
answer	O
,	O
or	O
even	O
to	O
admit	O
him	O
into	O
her	O
presence	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
promise	O
he	O
mentioned	O
in	O
his	O
letter	O
was	O
made	O
by	O
his	O
friend	O
Mr.	O

assured	O
him	O
that	O
no	O

could	O
resist	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
his	O
appearance	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
forbear	O
laughing	O
to	O
excess	O
at	O
the	O
simplicity	O
of	O
my	O

who	O
did	O
not	O
seem	O
to	O
relish	O
my	O
mirth	O

began	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
serious	O

I	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
appease	O
him	O

by	O
giving	O
him	O
my	O
word	O

honour	O
that	O
,	O
far	O
from	O
prejudicing	O
his	O

I	O
would	O
represent	O
him	O

the	O
most	O
favourable	O

could	O
with	O
any	O

he	O
must	O
not	O
be	O
surprised	O
if	O
she	O
should	O
remain	O
blind	O
to	O
his	O
deserts	O
,	O
for	O
nothing	O

more	O

than	O
a	O

I	O
begged	O

I	O
found	O
so	O

for	O
him	O

would	O
certainly	O
have	O

in	O

lost	O
his	O

what	O
gave	O
me	O
a	O

to	O

seen	O
me	O
load	O
my	O

upon	O

he	O
ran	O
down	O

applied	O
to	O
the	O
officer	O
on	O
guard	O
for	O
a	O
party	O
to	O
put	O
me	O
in	O
arrest	O

but	O
before	O
he	O
returned	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
gone	O
in	O
a	O
coach	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
inquired	O
which	O
way	O
I	O
went	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
heard	O
that	O
duels	O
were	O
commonly	O
fought	O
at	O
the	O
back	O
of	O
Montague	PNM
House	PNM

he	O
conducted	O
the	O

to	O
this	O

where	O
he	O
thanked	O
God	O
for	O
having	O
found	O
me	O
safe	O
and	O
sound	O

I	O
gave	O
him	O
to	O
understand	O
that	O
I	O
forgave	O
his	O
officious	O
concern	O
for	O
once	O
,	O
but	O
cautioned	O
him	O
in	O
pretty	O
severe	O
terms	O
for	O
making	O
me	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
idle	O
conversation	O
for	O
the	O

;	O
then	O
turning	O
to	O
the	O
corporal	O
,	O
thanked	O
him	O
for	O
his	O
care	O

and	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
crown	O
to	O
drink	O
with	O
his	O
men	O

assuring	O
him	O
that	O
the	O
rencontre	O
was	O
over	O
long	O
before	O
he	O
came	O
up	O

and	O
everything	O
compromised	O

as	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
observed	O
by	O
our	O
behaviour	O
;	O
as	O
a	O
farther	O
proof	O
of	O
which	O

he	O
would	O
find	O
upon	O
examination	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
my	O

had	O
been	O
discharged	O
:	O

without	O
giving	O
himself	O

me	O
any	O

received	O
the	O

with	O
a	O
thousand	O
bows	O

acknowledgments	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
returning	O
the	O
pistols	O

released	O
me	O
immediately	O

He	O
was	O
not	O
gone	O
a	O
hundred	O
yards	O
,	O
when	O
my	O
friend	O
Oregan	O
came	O
up	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
rescue	O
me	O
,	O
with	O
two	O
tatterdemalions	O
,	O
whom	O
he	O
had	O
engaged	O
for	O
that	O
purpose	O
about	O
the	O
purlieus	O
of	O
St.	PNM
Giles	PNM
's	PNM
.	O

One	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
armed	O
with	O
a	O
musket	O
that	O
wanted	O
a	O
lock	O
,	O
and	O
another	O
with	O
a	O
rusty	O
broadsword	O
,	O
but	O
their	O
dress	O
surpassed	O
all	O
description	O
.	O

When	O
he	O
understood	O
I	O
was	O
already	O
free	O
he	O
made	O
an	O
apology	O
for	O
his	O
abrupt	O
departure	O
,	O
and	O
introduced	O
me	O
to	O
his	O
two	O
companions	O
:	O
First	O
,	O
to	O
Counsellor	O
Fitzclabber	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
he	O
told	O
me	O

was	O
then	O
employed	O
in	O
compiling	O
a	O
history	O
of	O
the	O
kings	O
of	O
Minster	O
,	O
from	O
Irish	PNM
manuscripts	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
to	O
his	O
friend	O
Mr.	O
Gahagan	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
a	O
profound	O
philosopher	O
and	O
politician	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
projected	O
many	O
excellent	O
schemes	O
for	O
the	O
good	O
of	O
his	O
country	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
seems	O
these	O
literati	O
had	O
been	O
very	O
ill	O
rewarded	O
for	O
their	O
ingenious	O
labours	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
between	O
them	O
both	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
but	O
one	O
shirt	O
,	O
and	O
half	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
breeches	O

I	O
thanked	O
them	O
very	O
kindly	O
for	O
their	O
readiness	O
to	O
assist	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
offered	O
my	O
service	O
in	O
my	O
turn	O
,	O
bade	O
them	O
good	O
morrow	O
,	O
desiring	O
Oregan	O
to	O
accompany	O
me	O
to	O
my	O
lodgings	O
,	O
where	O
he	O
was	O
fitted	O
with	O
decent	O
clothes	O
from	O
my	O
wardrobe	O
,	O
so	O
much	O
to	O
his	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
swore	O
eternal	O
gratitude	O
and	O
friendship	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
at	O
my	O
request	O
,	O
recounted	O
all	O
the	O
adventures	O
of	O
his	O
life	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
I	O
waited	O
on	O
Melinda	O
,	O
who	O
received	O
me	O
with	O
great	O
kindness	O
and	O
familiarity	O
,	O
and	O
laughed	O
excessively	O
at	O
my	O
adventure	O
with	O
the	O
Irishman	O
,	O
to	O
whose	O
wishes	O
she	O
was	O
no	O
stranger	O
,	O
having	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
dozen	O
letters	O
in	O
her	O
possession	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
written	O
to	O
her	O
on	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
love	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
,	O
for	O
my	O
entertainment	O
,	O
she	O
submitted	O
to	O
my	O
perusal	O
.	O

Having	O
made	O
ourselves	O
merry	O
at	O
the	O
expense	O
of	O
this	O
poor	O
admirer	O
,	O
I	O
seized	O
the	O
opportunity	O
of	O
her	O
mother	O
's	O
going	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
room	O
,	O
and	O
introduced	O
my	O
own	O
passion	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
recommended	O
to	O
her	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
ardour	O
and	O
eloquence	O
I	O
was	O
master	O
of	O
.	O

I	O
flattered	O
,	O
sighed	O
,	O
swore	O
,	O
entreated	O
,	O
and	O
acted	O
a	O
thousand	O
extravagancies	O
,	O
in	O
hopes	O
of	O
making	O
some	O
impression	O
on	O
her	O
heart	O
;	O
but	O
she	O
heard	O
everything	O
I	O
said	O
without	O
discovering	O
the	O
least	O
emotion	O
;	O
and	O
other	O
company	O
came	O
in	O
before	O
she	O
would	O
vouchsafe	O
one	O
serious	O
reply	O
.	O

After	O
tea	O
,	O
the	O
cards	O
were	O
brought	O
in	O
according	O
to	O
custom	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
my	O
good	O
fortune	O
to	O
have	O
Melinda	O
for	O
my	O
partner	O
;	O
by	O
which	O
means	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
losing	O
,	O
I	O
came	O
off	O
with	O
five	O
guineas	O
clear	O
gain	O
.	O

I	O
soon	O
became	O
acquainted	O
with	O
a	O
good	O
many	O
people	O
of	O
fashion	O
,	O
and	O
spent	O
my	O
time	O
in	O
the	O
modish	O
diversions	O
of	O
the	O
town	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
plays	O
,	O
operas	O
,	O
masquerades	O
,	O
drums	O
,	O
assemblies	O
,	O
and	O
muppet-shows	O
;	O
chiefly	O
in	O
company	O
with	O
Melinda	O
,	O
whom	O
I	O
cultivated	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
eagerness	O
and	O
address	O
that	O
my	O
prospect	O
could	O
inspire	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
education	O
afford	O
.	O

I	O
spared	O
neither	O
my	O
person	O
nor	O
my	O
purse	O
to	O
gratify	O
her	O
vanity	O
and	O
pride	O
;	O
my	O
rivals	O
were	O
intimidated	O
,	O
and	O
indeed	O
outshone	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
after	O
all	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
fear	O
that	O
the	O
dear	O
creature	O
had	O
not	O
a	O
heart	O
to	O
lose	O
.	O

At	O
last	O
,	O
finding	O
myself	O
unable	O
to	O
support	O
the	O
expense	O
of	O
this	O
amour	O
much	O
longer	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
determined	O
to	O
bring	O
the	O
matter	O
to	O
a	O
crisis	O
;	O
and	O
one	O
evening	O
,	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
together	O
by	O
ourselves	O
,	O
complained	O
of	O
her	O
indifference	O
,	O
described	O
the	O
tortures	O
of	O
suspense	O
to	O
a	O
love-sick	O
mind	O
,	O
and	O
pressed	O
her	O
to	O
disclose	O
her	O
sentiments	O
of	O
matrimony	O
and	O
me	O
with	O
such	O
earnestness	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
could	O
not	O
,	O
with	O
all	O
her	O
art	O
,	O
shift	O
the	O
subject	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
an	O
eclaircissement	O
.	O

She	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
careless	O
air	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
no	O
objection	O
to	O
my	O
person	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
satisfy	O
her	O
mother	O
in	O
other	O
particulars	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
not	O
find	O
her	O
averse	O
to	O
the	O
match	O
;	O
but	O
she	O
was	O
resolved	O
to	O
do	O
nothing	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
momentous	O
concern	O
without	O
the	O
advice	O
and	O
consent	O
of	O
her	O
parent	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
no	O
very	O
agreeable	O
declaration	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
whose	O
aim	O
had	O
been	O
to	O
win	O
her	O
inclination	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
secure	O
my	O
conquest	O
by	O
a	O
private	O
marriage	O
,	O
to	O
which	O
I	O
flattered	O
myself	O
she	O
would	O
express	O
no	O
reluctance	O
.	O

That	O
I	O
might	O
not	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
desert	O
my	O
cause	O
before	O
it	O
was	O
desperate	O
,	O
I	O
waited	O
on	O
her	O
mother	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
with	O
great	O
formality	O
,	O
demanded	O
the	O
daughter	O
in	O
marriage	O
.	O

The	O
good	O
lady	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
notable	O
woman	O
,	O
behaved	O
with	O
great	O
state	O
and	O
civility	O
;	O
thanked	O
me	O
for	O
the	O
honour	O
I	O
intended	O
her	O
family	O
;	O
and	O
said	O
,	O
she	O
did	O
not	O
doubt	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
all	O
respects	O
qualified	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
woman	O
happy	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
concerned	O
her	O
as	O
a	O
parent	O
anxious	O
about	O
the	O
welfare	O
of	O
her	O
child	O
,	O
to	O
inquire	O
into	O
the	O
particulars	O
of	O
my	O
fortune	O
,	O
and	O
know	O
what	O
settlement	O
I	O
proposed	O
to	O
make	O
.	O

To	O
this	O
intimation	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
have	O
utterly	O
disconcerted	O
me	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
expected	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
replied	O
,	O
without	O
hesitation	O
that	O
,	O
though	O
my	O
fortune	O
was	O
very	O
small	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
gentleman	O
by	O
birth	O
and	O
education	O
,	O
would	O
maintain	O
her	O
daughter	O
in	O
the	O
sphere	O
of	O
a	O
gentlewoman	O
,	O
and	O
settle	O
her	O
own	O
dowry	O
on	O
her	O
and	O
her	O
heirs	O
for	O
ever	O
.	O

This	O
careful	O
matron	O
did	O
not	O
seem	O
to	O
relish	O
my	O
proposal	O
,	O
but	O
observed	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
demure	O
countenance	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
necessity	O
for	O
settling	O
that	O
upon	O
her	O
child	O
which	O
was	O
her	O
own	O
already	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
pleased	O
,	O
her	O
lawyer	O
should	O
confer	O
with	O
mine	O
upon	O
the	O
matter	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
meantime	O
,	O
she	O
desired	O
I	O
would	O
favour	O
her	O
with	O
a	O
perusal	O
of	O
my	O
rent-roll	O
.	O

Notwithstanding	O
the	O
vexation	O
I	O
was	O
under	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
scarce	O
forbear	O
laughing	O
in	O
her	O
face	O
at	O
the	O
mention	O
of	O
my	O
rent-roll	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
indeed	O
a	O
severe	O
piece	O
of	O
satire	O
upon	O
my	O
pretensions	O
.	O

I	O
frankly	O
owned	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
landed	O
estate	O
;	O
and	O
told	O
her	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
exactly	O
specify	O
the	O
sum	O
I	O
was	O
master	O
of	O
,	O
until	O
I	O
had	O
regulated	O
my	O
affairs	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
at	O
present	O
in	O
some	O
disorder	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
take	O
an	O
opportunity	O
of	O
satisfying	O
her	O
on	O
that	O
head	O
very	O
soon	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
long	O
before	O
I	O
took	O
my	O
leave	O
,	O
and	O
returned	O
to	O
my	O
lodgings	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
melancholy	O
mood	O
,	O
persuaded	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
nothing	O
more	O
to	O
expect	O
from	O
that	O
quarter	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
confirmed	O
in	O
this	O
opinion	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
went	O
back	O
with	O
a	O
view	O
of	O
explaining	O
myself	O
more	O
fully	O
to	O
the	O
old	O
gentlewoman	O
;	O
and	O
was	O
told	O
by	O
the	O
footman	O
that	O
his	O
ladies	O
were	O
not	O
at	O
home	O
,	O
although	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
Melinda	O
through	O
the	O
blinds	O
at	O
a	O
parlour	O
window	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
went	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
door	O
.	O

Incensed	O
at	O
this	O
affront	O
,	O
I	O
quitted	O
the	O
door	O
without	O
saying	O
one	O
word	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
I	O
repassed	O
the	O
parlour	O
,	O
bowed	O
to	O
Miss	O
,	O
who	O
still	O
remained	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
situation	O
,	O
securely	O
screened	O
,	O
as	O
she	O
thought	O
,	O
from	O
my	O
view	O
.	O

This	O
disappointment	O
gave	O
me	O
more	O
uneasiness	O
on	O
Strap	O
's	O
account	O
than	O
my	O
own	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
no	O
danger	O
of	O
dying	O
for	O
love	O
of	O
Melinda	PNM
;	O
on	O
the	O
contrary	O
,	O
the	O
remembrance	O
of	O
my	O
charming	O
Narcissa	PNM
was	O
a	O
continual	O
check	O
upon	O
my	O
conscience	O
during	O
the	O
whole	O
course	O
of	O
my	O
addresses	O
;	O
and	O
perhaps	O
contributed	O
to	O
the	O
bad	O
success	O
of	O
my	O
scheme	O
,	O
by	O
controlling	O
my	O
raptures	O
and	O
condemning	O
my	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
necessity	O
for	O

my	O

Upon	O
further	O
inquiry	O

I	O
found	O
this	O

Miss	O
Biddy	O

;	O
that	O
her	O
father	O

died	O
intestate	O

by	O
which	O
means	O
all	O
his	O

descended	O
to	O
his	O
daughter	O

who	O
was	O
so	O
little	O
a	O
favourite	O
that	O
,	O
could	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
have	O
prevailed	O
with	O
his	O
own	O
rapacious	O
disposition	O
to	O
part	O
with	O
as	O
much	O
money	O
as	O
would	O
have	O
paid	O
the	O
expense	O
of	O
a	O

she	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
inherited	O
the	O
sixth	O
part	O
of	O
his	O
fortune	O
;	O
that	O
during	O
his	O
life	O
,	O
far	O
from	O
being	O
educated	O
in	O
a	O
way	O
suitable	O
to	O
such	O
great	O
expectations	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
live	O
like	O
a	O
servant	O
wench	O
,	O
and	O
do	O
the	O
most	O
menial	O
offices	O
in	O
the	O

But	O
his	O
funeral	O
was	O
no	O
sooner	O
performed	O
,	O
than	O
she	O
assumed	O
the	O
fine	O
lady	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
so	O
many	O
people	O
of	O
both	O
sexes	O
to	O
flatter	O
,	O
caress	O
,	O
and	O
instruct	O
her	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
discretion	O
and	O
experience	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
grown	O
insufferably	O
vain	O
and	O
arrogant	O
,	O
and	O
pretended	O
to	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
a	O
duke	O
or	O
earl	O
at	O
least	O
for	O
her	O
husband	O
;	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
the	O
misfortune	O
to	O
be	O
neglected	O
by	O
the	O
English	O
quality	O
,	O
but	O
a	O
certain	O
poor	O
Scottish	O
lord	O
was	O
then	O
making	O
interest	O
to	O
be	O
introduced	O
to	O
her	O
acquaintance	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
meantime	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
fallen	O
into	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
a	O
notable	O
lady	O

who	O
had	O
already	O
disposed	O

though	O
Miss	O

yet	O
knew	O
nothing	O

and	O
lastly	O
that	O
if	O
I	O
proposed	O
to	O
dance	O
with	O
her	O
,	O
I	O
must	O
give	O
him	O
leave	O
to	O
represent	O
me	O
as	O
a	O
knight	O
,	O
or	O
foreign	O
count	O
at	O

I	O
was	O
ravished	O
at	O
this	O
piece	O
of	O
information	O
,	O
and	O
consented	O
for	O
one	O
night	O
,	O
to	O
personate	O
a	O
French	O
marquis	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
the	O
easier	O
fulfil	O
my	O
revenge	O

Having	O
made	O
the	O
appointment	O
with	O
Chatter	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
Banter	O
's	O
lodgings	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
by	O
this	O
time	O
conceived	O
a	O
great	O
opinion	O
of	O
his	O
penetration	O
and	O
knowledge	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
after	O
I	O
had	O
enjoined	O
secrecy	O
,	O
told	O
him	O
every	O
circumstance	O
of	O
my	O
disgrace	O
with	O
Melinda	O
,	O
and	O
imparted	O
the	O
plan	O
I	O
had	O
projected	O
to	O
mortify	O
that	O
proud	O
coquette	O
,	O
desiring	O
his	O
advice	O
in	O
proving	O
,	O
and	O
assistance	O
in	O
executing	O
the	O
scheme	O
.	O

Nothing	O
could	O
be	O
more	O
agreeable	O
to	O
his	O
misanthropical	O
temper	O
than	O
an	O
account	O
of	O
her	O
behaviour	O
and	O
my	O
resentment	O
:	O
he	O
applauded	O
my	O
resolution	O
,	O
and	O
proposed	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
not	O
only	O
provide	O
myself	O
with	O
a	O
proper	O
partner	O
,	O
but	O
also	O
procure	O
such	O
a	O
one	O
for	O
Miss	O
Goosetrap	O
,	O
as	O
should	O
infallibly	O
entail	O
upon	O
her	O
the	O
ridicule	O
of	O
all	O
her	O
acquaintance	O
.	O

For	O
this	O
purpose	O
he	O
mentioned	O
his	O
barber	O
who	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
was	O
an	O
exceeding	O
coxcomb	O
lately	O
come	O
from	O
Paris	PNM
,	O
whose	O
absurd	O
affectation	O
and	O
grimace	O
,	O
would	O
easily	O
pass	O
upon	O
her	O
for	O
the	O
sprightly	O
politesse	O
of	O
a	O
gentleman	O
improved	O
by	O
travel	O
.	O

I	O
hugged	O
him	O
for	O
this	O
hint	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
assured	O
me	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
no	O
difficult	O
matter	O
to	O
make	O
him	O
believe	O
,	O
that	O
Melinda	O
,	O
having	O
seen	O
him	O
by	O
accident	O
,	O
was	O
captivated	O
by	O
his	O
appearance	O
,	O
and	O
begged	O
for	O
his	O
acquaintance	O
.	O

He	O
actually	O
engaged	O
him	O
on	O
this	O
pretence	O
,	O
and	O
painted	O
his	O
good	O
fortune	O
in	O
such	O
colours	O
that	O
the	O
poor	O
shaver	O
was	O
quite	O
beside	O
himself	O
with	O
joy	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
immediately	O
fitted	O
with	O
a	O
tawdry	O
suit	O
of	O
clothes	O
belonging	O
to	O
Banter	PNM

and	O
by	O
him	O
recommended	O
to	O

as	O
a	O
very	O
pretty	O
fellow	O

just	O
returned	O
from	O

great	O
many	O

at	O

in	O

everything	O
happened	O
according	O
to	O
my	O

At	O
the	O
time	O

I	O
appeared	O

to	O
the	O
best	O
advantage	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
character	O
of	O
a	O
Marquis	O

had	O
the	O
honour	O
of	O
opening	O
the	O
ball	O
with	O
the	O
rich	O
heiress	O

who	O
attracted	O
the	O
eyes	O

by	O
the	O
prodigious	O
number	O
of	O
jewels	O
with	O
which	O
she	O
was	O
adorned	O

Among	O
others	O
I	O
perceived	O
Melinda	O

who	O
could	O
not	O
more	O
conceal	O
her	O
envy	O
than	O
astonishment	O
at	O
my	O
success	O
;	O
her	O
curiosity	O
was	O
still	O
more	O
flagrant	O
and	O
tormenting	O
,	O
for	O
she	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
Miss	O
Gripewell	O
before	O
;	O
and	O
Chatter	O

who	O
alone	O

her	O
any	O

that	O

was	O
engaged	O
in	O
conversation	O
at	O
the	O
other	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
room	O

I	O
observed	O
her	O
impatience	O

and	O
exulted	O
in	O
her	O
chagrin	O
;	O
and	O
after	O
my	O
partner	O
was	O
set	O
,	O
took	O
the	O
opportunity	O
of	O
passing	O
by	O
her	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
slight	O
bow	O
without	O
stopping	O
,	O
which	O
completed	O
my	O
triumph	O
and	O
her	O
indignation	O
.	O

She	O
changed	O
colour	O
,	O
bridled	O
up	O
,	O
assumed	O
an	O
air	O
of	O
disdain	O
,	O
and	O
flirted	O
her	O
fan	O
with	O
such	O
a	O
fury	O

that	O
it	O
went	O
to	O
pieces	O
in	O
a	O

to	O
the	O
no	O

of	O
those	O
who	O

observed	O
her	O

At	O
length	O
the	O
metamorphosed	O
barber	O
took	O
her	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
acted	O
his	O
part	O
with	O
such	O
ridiculous	O
extravagance	O
that	O
the	O
mirth	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
company	O
was	O
excited	O
at	O
his	O
expense	O

and	O
his	O

was	O
so	O
much	O
ashamed	O
that	O
,	O
before	O
the	O
country	O

began	O

she	O
retired	O
in	O
great	O
confusion	O

under	O
pretence	O
of	O
being	O
taken	O
suddenly	O
ill	O

and	O
was	O
followed	O
by	O
her	O
gallant	O

who	O
no	O

imagined	O
her	O

nothing	O

an	O

ran	O
round	O

and	O

could	O
give	O

no	O

that	O

affected	O
ignorance	O
well	O

that	O

not	O
rest	O

with	O

Meanwhile	O

I	O
was	O

to	O
practise	O
upon	O
Miss	O

soon	O
found	O
it	O

indifference	O
to	O
yield	O
to	O
any	O

The	O

in	O

detected	O
himself	O

discovered	O
the	O

of	O

was	O

Finding	O

on	O
the	O

of	O
my	O

in	O

I	O
began	O
to	O

grew	O
melancholy	O
at	O

the	O
horrors	O
of	O
this	O

I	O
had	O
recourse	O
to	O
the	O

and	O
kept	O
more	O
company	O
than	O
ever	O

I	O
became	O

to	O
the	O
playhouse	O

with	O
the	O

behind	O

in	O

Indeed	O
,	O
I	O
may	O
say	O
,	O
without	O
vanity	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
much	O
better	O
qualified	O

By	O

of	O
these	O

I	O
got	O
the	O
better	O
of	O

and	O
learned	O
to	O

In	O

I	O
betook	O
myself	O

the	O

which	O
deprived	O

in	O

himself	O
under	O

his	O

,	O
and	O
actually	O
carried	O
me	O
to	O

where	O
he	O
left	O
me	O

in	O
a	O

I	O
thought	O

much	O
sweetness	O
of	O

candour	O
in	O
this	O

waited	O
on	O
him	O
next	O

with	O

This	O

which	O
did	O
not	O
a	O

flatter	O
my	O

I	O
took	O

went	O
to	O
his	O

at	O

my	O

I	O
asked	O
if	O
his	O

answered	O
with	O
a	O

``	O

the	O

I	O
recollected	O
myself	O

of	O
a	O
sudden	O

slipping	O
a	O

me	O
know	O
whether	O

The	O

relented	O
at	O
the	O
touch	O
of	O
my	O
money	O

which	O
he	O
took	O
with	O
all	O
the	O

of	O
a	O
taxgatherer	O

and	O
showed	O
me	O
into	O
a	O

I	O
might	O

myself	O

such	O

as	O
his	O

should	O

I	O
had	O

ten	O

when	O
a	O

entered	O

without	O

started	O
at	O

looked	O
at	O
me	O
again	O

his	O

,	O
tipping	O
him	O
with	O

He	O

explained	O
the	O

that	O
I	O
was	O
struck	O
with	O
horror	O

at	O
the	O

I	O
signified	O
my	O

to	O

in	O

that	O

animated	O

finding	O
me	O

to	O

went	O
away	O
in	O
a	O

Meanwhile	O
my	O

advanced	O
to	O
six	O
pieces	O

and	O
my	O
desire	O
of	O
more	O
increased	O
in	O

so	O
that	O
I	O
moved	O
to	O
the	O
higher	O

where	O
I	O
laid	O
half-a-guinea	O
on	O
every	O

and	O
fortune	O
still	O
favouring	O
me	O

I	O
became	O
a	O

in	O

I	O
remained	O
until	O
it	O

one	O

fifty	O

Thinking	O
it	O
now	O
high	O
time	O
to	O
retire	O
with	O
my	O
booty	O
,	O
I	O
asked	O
if	O
anybody	O
would	O
take	O
my	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
notion	O
to	O

upon	O

an	O

who	O

of	O

At	O

time	O
,	O
a	O

who	O
sat	O
near	O

that	O

more	O
beholden	O

for	O
what	O
I	O
had	O

that	O

that	O
some	O
of	O
the	O

This	O
intimation	O
produced	O
a	O

against	O
me	O

among	O

to	O

up	O
by	O

the	O

my	O

Though	O
I	O
was	O

under	O

seemed	O
to	O
chew	O
the	O
cud	O
of	O
her	O
resentment	O
with	O
the	O
crestfallen	O
captain	O
,	O
while	O
I	O
entered	O
into	O
discourse	O
with	O
my	O
charmer	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
the	O
more	O
pleased	O
with	O
my	O
conversation	O
,	O
as	O
she	O
had	O
conceived	O
a	O
very	O
indifferent	O
opinion	O
of	O
my	O
intellects	O
from	O
my	O
former	O
silence	O

I	O
should	O
have	O
had	O
cause	O
to	O
be	O
equally	O
satisfied	O
with	O
the	O
sprightliness	O
of	O
her	O
genius	O
,	O
could	O
she	O
have	O
curbed	O
her	O
imagination	O
with	O
judgment	O
;	O
but	O
she	O
laboured	O
under	O
such	O
a	O
profusion	O
of	O
talk	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
dreaded	O
her	O
unruly	O
tongue	O
,	O
and	O
felt	O
by	O
anticipation	O
the	O
horrors	O
of	O
an	O
eternal	O
clack	O
!	O

However	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
considered	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
the	O
joys	O
attending	O
the	O
possession	O
of	O
twenty	O
thousand	O
pounds	O
,	O
I	O
forgot	O
her	O
imperfections	O
,	O
seized	O
occasion	O
by	O
the	O
forelock	O
,	O
and	O
tried	O
to	O
insinuate	O
myself	O
into	O
her	O
affection	O
.	O

The	O
careful	O
mother	O
kept	O
a	O
strict	O
watch	O
over	O
her	O
and	O
though	O
she	O
could	O
not	O
help	O
behaving	O
civilly	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
took	O
frequent	O
opportunities	O
of	O
discouraging	O
our	O
communication	O
,	O
by	O
reprimanding	O
her	O
for	O
being	O
so	O
free	O
with	O
strangers	O
,	O
and	O
telling	O
her	O
she	O
must	O
learn	O
to	O

less	O
and	O
think	O
more	O
.	O

Abridged	O
of	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
speech	O
,	O
we	O
conversed	O
with	O
our	O
eyes	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
found	O
the	O
young	O
lady	O
very	O
eloquent	O
in	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
discourse	O
.	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
sick	O
of	O
the	O
old	O
gentlewoman	O
's	O
tuition	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
find	O
it	O
no	O
difficult	O
matter	O
to	O
supersede	O
her	O
authority	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
arrived	O
at	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
breakfast	O
,	O
I	O
alighted	O
,	O
and	O
helped	O
my	O
mistress	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
coach	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
her	O
mother	O
who	O
called	O
for	O
a	O
private	O
room	O
to	O
which	O
they	O
withdrew	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
eat	O
by	O
themselves	O
.	O

As	O
they	O
retired	O
together	O
,	O
I	O
perceived	O
that	O
Miss	O
had	O
got	O
more	O
twists	O
from	O
nature	O
than	O
I	O
had	O
before	O
observed	O
for	O
she	O
was	O
bent	O
sideways	O
into	O
the	O
figure	O
of	O
an	O
S	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
her	O
progression	O
very	O
much	O
resembled	O
that	O
of	O
a	O
crab	O
.	O

The	O
prude	O
also	O
chose	O
the	O
captain	O
for	O
her	O
messmate	O
,	O
and	O
ordered	O
breakfast	O
for	O
two	O
only	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
brought	O
into	O
another	O
separate	O
room	O
:	O

the	O
lawyer	O
and	O
I	O
,	O
deserted	O
by	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
company	O
,	O
were	O
fain	O
to	O
put	O
up	O
with	O
each	O
other	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
deal	O
chagrined	O
at	O
the	O
stately	O
reserve	O
of	O
Mrs.	O
Snapper	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
did	O
not	O
use	O
me	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
complaisance	O
I	O
deserved	O
;	O
and	O
my	O
companion	O
declared	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
traveller	O
for	O
twenty	O
years	O
,	O
and	O
never	O
knew	O
the	O
stage	O
coach	O
rules	O
so	O
much	O
infringed	O
before	O
.	O

As	O
for	O
the	O
honourable	O
gentlewoman	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
conceive	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
her	O
attachment	O
to	O
the	O
lieutenant	O
;	O
and	O
asked	O
the	O
lawyer	O
if	O
he	O
knew	O
for	O
which	O
of	O
the	O
soldier	O
's	O
virtues	O
she	O
admired	O
him	O
?	O

The	O
counsellor	O
facetiously	O
replied	O
,	O
``	O
I	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
help	O
laughing	O
at	O
the	O
archness	O
of	O
the	O
barrister	O

who	O
entertained	O
me	O
during	O
breakfast	O
with	O
a	O

of	O

at	O
the	O

of	O
our	O

among	O

said	O

was	O
sorry	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
young	O
lady	O
saddled	O
with	O
such	O
incumbrances	O

When	O
we	O
had	O
made	O
an	O
end	O
of	O
our	O
repast	O
,	O
and	O
paid	O
our	O
reckoning	O
,	O
we	O
went	O
into	O
the	O
coach	O
,	O
took	O
our	O
places	O

and	O
bribed	O
the	O
driver	O
with	O
sixpence	O
to	O
revenge	O
us	O
on	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
his	O
fare	O
,	O
by	O
hurrying	O
them	O
away	O
in	O
the	O
midst	O
of	O
their	O
meal	O
.	O

This	O
task	O
he	O
performed	O
to	O
our	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
after	O
he	O
had	O
disturbed	O
their	O
enjoyment	O
with	O
his	O
importunate	O
clamour	O

The	O
mother	O
and	O
daughter	O
obeyed	O
the	O
summons	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
coming	O
to	O
the	O
coach	O
door	O
,	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
desire	O
the	O
coachman	O
's	O
assistance	O
to	O
get	O
in	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
lawyer	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
agreed	O
to	O
show	O
our	O
resentment	O
by	O
our	O
neglect	O

They	O
were	O
no	O
sooner	O
seated	O

than	O
the	O
captain	O
appeared	O
,	O
as	O
much	O
heated	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
pursued	O
a	O
dozen	O
miles	O
by	O
an	O

the	O

not	O
without	O
some	O
marks	O
of	O
disorder	O

Having	O
helped	O
her	O
up	O
,	O
he	O
entered	O
himself	O
,	O
growling	O
a	O
few	O
oaths	O
against	O
the	O
coachman	O
for	O
his	O
impertinent	O
interruption	O
;	O
and	O
the	O

comforted	O
him	O
by	O
saying	O

that	O
if	O

had	O
suffered	O
a	O
nisi	O
prius	O
through	O
the	O
obstinacy	O
of	O
the	O

might	O

an	O
opportunity	O

This	O

expression	O
gave	O
offence	O
to	O
the	O
grave	O
gentlewoman	O

who	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
if	O
she	O

a	O
man	O

she	O
would	O
make	O
him	O

thanked	O
God	O

he	O
had	O
never	O

in	O
such	O
company	O

At	O
this	O
insinuation	O
the	O
captain	O
thought	O
himself	O
under	O
a	O
necessity	O
of	O
espousing	O
the	O
lady	O

as	O

not	O
fail	O
of	O

by	O
the	O

the	O

indeed	O

furnished	O
me	O
with	O
an	O
opportunity	O

obliging	O
her	O
so	O

that	O

me	O

that	O

she	O
still	O
behaved	O

that	O

and	O
,	O
being	O
invited	O
to	O
spend	O
the	O
evening	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
found	O
an	O
opportunity	O

in	O
spite	O
of	O
the	O
old	O
gentlewoman	O

vigilance	O
,	O
to	O
explain	O
the	O

professing	O
myself	O

She	O
blushed	O
at	O
my	O
declaration	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
favourable	O
manner	O
disapproved	O
of	O
the	O
liberty	O
I	O
had	O
taken	O

putting	O
me	O
in	O

of	O
our	O

My	O
ardour	O
was	O
effectually	O
checked	O
by	O
this	O
reprimand	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
delivered	O
in	O
a	O
gentle	O
manner	O

that	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
cause	O
to	O
be	O
disobliged	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
arrival	O
of	O
her	O
mother	O
relieved	O
me	O
from	O
a	O
dilemma	O
in	O
which	O
I	O
should	O
not	O
have	O
known	O
how	O
to	O

myself	O
a	O

Neither	O
could	O
I	O
resume	O
the	O
easiness	O
of	O
carriage	O
with	O
which	O
I	O
came	O
in	O
;	O
my	O

at	O

While	O
we	O
amused	O
ourselves	O
at	O
this	O
diversion	O

I	O
understood	O
from	O
the	O
gentlewoman	O

that	O
there	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
assembly	O
next	O
night	O
at	O
which	O
I	O
begged	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
honour	O
of	O
dancing	O
with	O
Miss.	O
.	O

She	O
thanked	O
me	O
for	O
the	O
favour	O
I	O
intended	O
her	O
,	O
assured	O
me	O
she	O
never	O
did	O
dance	O

but	O
signified	O
a	O
desire	O
of	O
seeing	O
the	O
company	O

when	O
I	O
offered	O
my	O
service	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
accepted	O

not	O
a	O
little	O
proud	O
of	O
being	O
exempted	O
from	O
appearing	O
with	O

in	O
a	O
situation	O

that	O

notwithstanding	O
my	O

to	O
the	O

at	O

continued	O
the	O

till	O
such	O
time	O
as	O
the	O
successive	O
yawns	O
of	O
the	O

warned	O
me	O

took	O
my	O

very	O
happy	O

Next	O

that	O

a	O

Miss	O

was	O

of	O
this	O

myself	O

I	O
waited	O

drew	O

At	O
last	O
Mr.	O

called	O
at	O
my	O
lodgings	O
in	O
his	O
way	O

I	O
accompanied	O
him	O
to	O
the	O
house	O
where	O
all	O
my	O

We	O
were	O
very	O
kindly	O
received	O
by	O
the	O
squire	O

who	O
sat	O
smoking	O
his	O
pipe	O
in	O
a	O
parlour	O

asked	O
if	O
we	O

accept	O
his	O
offer	O

which	O
was	O
also	O
refused	O
,	O
by	O
my	O
friend	O

We	O
sat	O
down	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
entered	O
into	O
conversation	O
,	O
which	O
lasted	O
half-an	O
hour	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
time	O
to	O
recollect	O
myself	O
;	O
and	O
-LRB-	O
so	O
capricious	O
were	O
my	O
thoughts	O
-RRB-	O
even	O
to	O
hope	O
that	O
Narcissa	O
would	O
not	O
appear	O

when	O
,	O
all	O
of	O
a	O
sudden	O
,	O
a	O
servant	O
coming	O
in	O
,	O
gave	O
us	O
notice	O
that	O
dinner	O
was	O
upon	O
the	O
table	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
perturbation	O
returned	O
with	O
such	O
violence	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
scarcely	O
conceal	O
it	O
from	O
the	O
company	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
ascended	O
the	O
staircase	O

When	O
I	O
entered	O
the	O
dining-room	O
,	O
the	O
first	O
object	O
that	O
saluted	O
my	O
ravished	O
eyes	O
was	O
the	O
divine	O
Narcissa	PNM
,	O
blushing	O
like	O
Aurora	PNM
,	O
adorned	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
graces	O
that	O
meekness	O
,	O
innocence	O

and	O
beauty	O
can	O
diffuse	O

I	O
was	O
seized	O
with	O
a	O
giddiness	O
,	O
my	O
knees	O
tottered	O
and	O
I	O
scarce	O
had	O
strength	O
enough	O
to	O
perform	O
the	O
ceremony	O
of	O
salutation	O
,	O
when	O
her	O
brother	O

slapping	O
me	O
on	O
the	O

cried	O

``	O

I	O
approached	O
her	O
with	O
eagerness	O
and	O
fear	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
moment	O
of	O
our	O
embrace	O
,	O
my	O
soul	O
was	O
agonized	O
with	O
rapture	O
!	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
lucky	O
circumstance	O
for	O
us	O
both	O
,	O
that	O
my	O
entertainer	O
was	O
not	O
endued	O
with	O
an	O
uncommon	O
stock	O
of	O
penetration	O
;	O
for	O
our	O
mutual	O
confusion	O
was	O
so	O
manifest	O
that	O
Mr.	O

perceived	O
it	O

as	O
we	O
went	O
home	O
together	O

congratulated	O
me	O
on	O
my	O
good	O

But	O
so	O
far	O
was	O
Bruin	O
from	O
entertaining	O
the	O
least	O
suspicion	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
encouraged	O
me	O
to	O
begin	O
a	O
conversation	O
with	O
my	O
mistress	O
in	O
a	O
language	O
unknown	O
to	O
him	O

telling	O
her	O

that	O
he	O

could	O
jabber	O
with	O
her	O
in	O

I	O
consulted	O
the	O

my	O

found	O
her	O
averse	O

indeed	O
she	O
declined	O
with	O
a	O
sweetness	O
of	O
denial	O
peculiar	O
to	O
herself	O

as	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O

I	O

feasted	O

the	O

such	O
obstinacy	O

we	O
were	O

For	O

I	O
not	O

afraid	O

by	O
entering	O
into	O

from	O

I	O
foresaw	O

happen	O

but	O
there	O
was	O
no	O

I	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
rely	O
upon	O
the	O
strength	O
of	O
my	O
constitution	O

which	O
I	O
hoped	O
would	O
resist	O
intoxication	O

immediately	O

we	O
absolutely	O
refused	O

;	O
and	O
prevailed	O
upon	O
him	O
to	O

away	O
an	O

two	O
at	O

in	O

The	O

I	O
happened	O
to	O

my	O

were	O

a	O

I	O
played	O
so	O
ill	O
that	O
he	O
lost	O

swore	O
bitterly	O

threatened	O

call	O

Narcissa	PNM

I	O
were	O
of	O

I	O
was	O
satisfied	O

my	O

the	O

until	O
we	O
were	O
told	O
that	O
supper	O

The	O
squire	O
was	O
enraged	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
evening	O
so	O
unprofitably	O
spent	O
,	O
and	O
wreaked	O
his	O
vengeance	O
on	O
the	O
cards	O

which	O
he	O
tore	O

committed	O
to	O

Freeman	O

a	O

that	O
the	O

some	O

that	O

would	O
make	O
no	O
precipitate	O
compliances	O
of	O
this	O

and	O
I	O
would	O
do	O
well	O
to	O
cultivate	O
her	O

in	O
the	O

In	O
the	O

had	O
endeavoured	O
by	O

should	O
know	O

sentiments	O

the	O

;	O
and	O
said	O

by	O
these	O

she	O
did	O
not	O
doubt	O
of	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
open	O
a	O
literary	O
communication	O
between	O
us	O

which	O
could	O
not	O
fail	O
of	O
introducing	O

I	O
approved	O
of	O
her	O

and	O
,	O
our	O
appointment	O
being	O
renewed	O
for	O
the	O
next	O

left	O
her	O
with	O

falling	O
upon	O
some	O
method	O
of	O

reconciled	O
to	O
the	O

I	O
supposed	O

with	O
the	O

put	O
upon	O
him	O

With	O
this	O

I	O
consulted	O

from	O
his	O

assured	O
me	O
there	O

that	O

I	O
was	O

I	O

gave	O
a	O

the	O

Miss	O

was	O
so	O

affected	O
with	O

committed	O

upon	O

my	O

valet	O

shaking	O
his	O

But	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
help	O
shedding	O
some	O
tears	O
at	O
my	O
unkindness	O
.	O

I	O
felt	O
unspeakable	O
remorse	O
for	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
,	O
cursed	O
my	O
own	O
ingratitude	O
,	O
and	O
considered	O
his	O
tears	O
as	O
a	O
reproach	O
that	O
my	O
soul	O
,	O
in	O
its	O
present	O
disturbance	O
,	O
could	O
not	O
bear	O

It	O
set	O
all	O
my	O
passions	O
into	O
a	O
ferment	O
:	O
I	O
swore	O
horrible	O
oaths	O
without	O
meaning	O
or	O
application	O
.	O

I	O
foamed	O
at	O
the	O
mouth	O
,	O
kicked	O
the	O
chairs	O
about	O
the	O
room	O
,	O
and	O
played	O
abundance	O
of	O
mad	O
pranks	O
that	O
frightened	O
my	O
friend	O
almost	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
senses	O
.	O

At	O
length	O
my	O
transport	O
subsided	O
,	O
I	O
became	O
melancholy	O
,	O
and	O
wept	O
insensibly	O
.	O

During	O
this	O
state	O
of	O
dejection	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
surprised	O
with	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
Miss	O
Williams	O
,	O
whom	O
Strap	O
,	O
blubbering	O
all	O
the	O

had	O
conducted	O
into	O
the	O
chamber	O
without	O
giving	O
me	O
previous	O
notice	O
of	O
her	O
approach	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
extremely	O
affected	O
with	O
my	O
condition	O
,	O
which	O
she	O
had	O
learned	O
from	O
him	O
,	O
begged	O
me	O
to	O
moderate	O
my	O
passion	O
,	O
suspend	O
my	O
conjectures	O
,	O
and	O
follow	O
her	O
to	O
Narcissa	PNM

who	O
desired	O
to	O
see	O
me	O
forthwith	O
.	O

That	O
dear	O
name	O
operated	O
upon	O
me	O
like	O
a	O
charm	O
!	O

I	O
started	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
without	O
opening	O
my	O
lips	O
,	O
was	O
conducted	O
into	O
her	O
apartment	O
through	O
the	O
garden	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
entered	O
by	O
a	O
private	O
door	O

I	O
found	O
the	O
adorable	O
creature	O
in	O
tears	O
;	O
I	O
was	O
melted	O
at	O
the	O
sight	O
--	O
we	O
continued	O
silent	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
--	O
my	O
heart	O
was	O
too	O
full	O
to	O
speak	O

her	O
snowy	O
bosom	O
heaved	O
with	O
fond	O
resentment	O
;	O
at	O

she	O
sobbing	O
cried	O
,	O
``	O
What	O

done	O
to	O

you	O

''	O

My	O
heart	O
was	O
pierced	O
with	O
the	O
tender	O
question	O
.	O

I	O
drew	O
near	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
reverence	O
of	O
affection	O
.	O

I	O
fell	O
upon	O
my	O
knees	O
before	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
kissing	O
her	O
hand	O
,	O
exclaimed	O

``	O

She	O
guessed	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
my	O
disquiet	O
,	O
upbraided	O
me	O
gently	O
for	O
my	O
suspicion	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
me	O
such	O
flattering	O
assurances	O
of	O
her	O
eternal	O
fidelity	O

that	O
all	O
my	O
doubts	O

forsook	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
peace	O
and	O
satisfaction	O
reigned	O
within	O
my	O
breast	O

At	O
midnight	O
I	O
left	O
the	O
fair	O
nymph	O
to	O
her	O
repose	O
,	O
and	O
,	O

let	O
out	O
by	O

at	O
the	O

by	O
which	O
I	O
entered	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
explore	O
my	O
way	O
homeward	O
in	O
the	O
dark	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
heard	O
at	O
my	O
back	O
a	O
noise	O
like	O
that	O
of	O
a	O
baboon	O
when	O
he	O
mews	O
and	O
chatters	O

I	O
turned	O
instantly	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
perceiving	O
something	O
black	O
,	O
concluded	O
I	O
was	O
discovered	O
by	O
some	O

employed	O
to	O
watch	O
for	O
that	O

at	O
this	O
conjecture	O

by	O
which	O
the	O
reputation	O
of	O
the	O

Narcissa	PNM
appeared	O
in	O
jeopardy	O
,	O
I	O
drew	O
my	O
sword	O

and	O
would	O
have	O
sacrificed	O
him	O
to	O
her	O
fame	O
,	O
had	O
not	O
the	O
voice	O
of	O

restrained	O
my	O

had	O
the	O

Pleased	O
to	O
be	O
thus	O
undeceived	O

I	O
laughed	O
at	O
his	O
consternation	O
,	O
and	O
asked	O
what	O
brought	O
him	O
thither	O
?	O

Upon	O
which	O
he	O
gave	O
me	O
to	O
understand	O
,	O
that	O
his	O
concern	O
for	O
me	O
had	O
induced	O
him	O
to	O
follow	O
me	O
to	O
that	O
place	O

where	O
the	O

reason	O
had	O
detained	O
him	O

he	O
frankly	O

that	O
,	O
in	O
spite	O
of	O
the	O
esteem	O
he	O
had	O
for	O
Miss	O
Williams	O
he	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
uneasy	O
about	O
me	O
,	O
considering	O
the	O
disposition	O
in	O
which	O
I	O
went	O
abroad	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
had	O

much	O
longer	O
,	O
would	O
certainly	O
have	O
alarmed	O
the	O
neighbourhood	O
in	O
my	O

The	O
knowledge	O
of	O
this	O
his	O
intention	O
confounded	O
me	O

I	O
represented	O
to	O
him	O
the	O
mischievous	O
consequences	O
that	O
would	O
have	O
attended	O
such	O
a	O

action	O

,	O
cautioning	O
him	O
severely	O
against	O
any	O

for	O
the	O

,	O
concluded	O
my	O
admonition	O
with	O
an	O
assurance	O
,	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
case	O
he	O
should	O
ever	O
act	O
so	O
madly	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
,	O
without	O
hesitation	O

put	O
him	O
to	O
death	O

``	O
Have	O
a	O
little	O

cried	O
he	O

in	O
a	O
lamentable	O
tone	O
;	O
``	O

I	O
was	O
touched	O
with	O
this	O
reproach	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
got	O
home	O

made	O
it	O
my	O
business	O
to	O

by	O
explaining	O
the	O

of	O
that	O

Next	O
day	O
when	O
I	O
went	O
into	O
the	O
Long	O
Room	O
,	O
I	O
observed	O
several	O
whispers	O
circulate	O
all	O
of	O
a	O
sudden	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
doubt	O
that	O
Melinda	PNM
had	O
been	O
busy	O
with	O
my	O
character	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
consoled	O
myself	O
with	O
the	O
love	O
of	O
Narcissa	PNM
,	O
upon	O
which	O
I	O
rested	O
with	O
the	O
most	O
perfect	O
confidence	O
;	O
and	O
going	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
rowly-powly	O
table	O
,	O
won	O
a	O
few	O
pieces	O
from	O
my	O
suspected	O
rival	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
with	O
an	O
easy	O
politeness	O
,	O
entered	O
into	O
conversation	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
desiring	O
my	O
company	O
to	O
the	O
coffee-house	O
,	O
treated	O
me	O
with	O
tea	O
and	O
chocolate	O
.	O

I	O
remembered	O
Strutwell	O
,	O
and	O
guarded	O
against	O
his	O
insinuating	O
behaviour	O
;	O
nor	O
was	O
my	O
suspicion	O
wrong	O
placed	O
;	O
he	O
artfully	O
turned	O
the	O
discourse	O
upon	O
Narcissa	PNM
,	O
and	O
endeavoured	O
by	O
hinting	O
at	O
an	O
intrigue	O

pretended	O
to	O
be	O
engaged	O
in	O
elsewhere	O
,	O
to	O
learn	O
what	O
connection	O
there	O
was	O
between	O
her	O
and	O
me	O

But	O
all	O
his	O
finesse	O
was	O
ineffectual	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
convinced	O
of	O
his	O
dissimulation	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
such	O
general	O
answers	O
to	O
his	O
inquiries	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
drop	O
the	O
subject	O
,	O
and	O
talk	O
of	O
something	O
else	O
.	O

While	O
we	O
conversed	O
in	O
this	O
manner	O
,	O
the	O
savage	O
came	O
in	O
with	O
another	O
gentleman	O
,	O
who	O
introduced	O
him	O
to	O
his	O
lordship	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
was	O
received	O
with	O
such	O
peculiar	O
marks	O
of	O
distinction	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
persuaded	O
the	O

intended	O
to	O
use	O
him	O
in	O
some	O
shape	O
or	O
other	O
;	O
and	O
from	O
thence	O
I	O
drew	O
an	O
unlucky	O
omen	O

But	O
I	O
had	O
more	O
cause	O
to	O
be	O
dismayed	O
the	O
following	O
day	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
saw	O
the	O
squire	O
in	O

with	O
Melinda	PNM

her	O
mother	O

who	O
honoured	O
me	O

glances	O

when	O
I	O
afterwards	O
threw	O
myself	O
in	O
his	O
way	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
the	O
cordial	O
shake	O
of	O
the	O
hand	O

he	O
returned	O
my	O
salute	O
with	O
a	O
cold	O
repetition	O
of	O
``	O

pronounced	O
with	O
such	O
indifference	O

contempt	O

that	O

the	O

all	O
my	O

tortured	O
my	O
soul	O
into	O

Miss	O

found	O
me	O

next	O
morning	O

full	O
of	O
anxious	O
tumult	O

did	O
not	O

my	O

of	O
consequence	O
that	O
the	O

was	O
mortal	O
;	O
therefore	O
,	O
determined	O
not	O
to	O
die	O
unrevenged	O

I	O
seized	O
his	O
shell	O

was	O

up	O

the	O

Disappointed	O
at	O
this	O
expectation	O

and	O
afraid	O
still	O
that	O

would	O
frustrate	O
my	O

I	O
grappled	O
with	O
him	O

being	O
much	O
the	O
stronger	O
,	O
threw	O
him	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O

where	O
I	O
wrested	O
his	O

out	O
of	O

so	O
great	O
was	O
my	O
confusion	O

that	O
instead	O
of	O

the	O
point	O
upon	O
him	O

struck	O
out	O
three	O

before	O

approach	O
I	O
was	O
upon	O

had	O
discovered	O
that	O
my	O

mortal	O
wound	O
was	O
only	O
a	O
slight	O
scratch	O

The	O
knowledge	O
of	O
my	O

safety	O
disarmed	O
me	O
of	O
a	O
good	O
deal	O
of	O
my	O

I	O
began	O
to	O
inquire	O
with	O
some	O
concern	O
into	O
the	O
situation	O
of	O
my	O
antagonist	O
,	O
who	O
remained	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
bleeding	O
plentifully	O
at	O
his	O
mouth	O

I	O
helped	O
his	O
footman	O
to	O
raise	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
bound	O
up	O
his	O
wound	O
with	O
my	O
handkerchief	O
,	O
assured	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
dangerous	O
;	O
I	O
likewise	O
restored	O
his	O
sword	O
,	O
and	O
offered	O
to	O
support	O
him	O
to	O
his	O
house	O

He	O
thanked	O
me	O
with	O
an	O
air	O
of	O
sullen	O
dignity	O
:	O
and	O
whispering	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
hear	O
from	O
him	O
soon	O
,	O
went	O
away	O
,	O
leaning	O
on	O
his	O
servant	O
's	O
shoulder	O

I	O
was	O
surprised	O
at	O
this	O
promise	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
construed	O
into	O
a	O
threat	O
,	O
and	O
resolved	O

if	O
ever	O
he	O
should	O
call	O
me	O
out	O
again	O

to	O
use	O
whatever	O
advantage	O

might	O
give	O
me	O
over	O
him	O
in	O

In	O
the	O

I	O
had	O
leisure	O
to	O
take	O
notice	O
of	O
Strap	O

who	O
seemed	O
quite	O
stupified	O
with	O
horror	O
:	O
I	O
comforted	O
him	O
with	O
an	O
assurance	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
received	O
no	O
damage	O
,	O
and	O
explained	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
this	O
affair	O
as	O
we	O
walked	O
homeward	O

By	O
the	O
time	O
I	O
had	O
got	O
into	O
my	O
apartment	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
the	O
wound	O
in	O
my	O
neck	O
stiff	O
and	O
uneasy	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
good	O
deal	O
of	O
clotted	O
blood	O
ran	O
down	O
upon	O
my	O
shirt	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
I	O
pulled	O
off	O
my	O
coat	O

and	O
unbuttoned	O
my	O
collar	O

that	O
I	O
might	O
dress	O
it	O
with	O
more	O

My	O

no	O

perceived	O
my	O
shirt	O
quite	O
dyed	O
with	O
blood	O
,	O
than	O
,	O
imagining	O
I	O
had	O
got	O
at	O

twenty	O
thousand	O
wounds	O
,	O
he	O
cried	O
,	O
``	O
O	O
Jesus	O

''	O

and	O
fell	O
flat	O
on	O
the	O
floor	O

I	O
stopped	O
the	O
bleeding	O
with	O
a	O
little	O
dry	O
lint	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
applying	O
a	O
plaster	O
over	O
it	O
,	O
cleaned	O
myself	O
from	O
the	O
gore	O
,	O
shifted	O
,	O
and	O
dressed	O
,	O
while	O
he	O
lay	O
senseless	O
at	O
my	O
feet	O

so	O
that	O
when	O
he	O
recovered	O

me	O
perfectly	O

Now	O
that	O
the	O

was	O

I	O
was	O
very	O

with	O

the	O

that	O

with	O

I	O
ran	O
to	O
my	O

snatched	O
my	O
pistols	O

ordered	O

to	O

with	O
such	O
incoherence	O
of	O

that	O
the	O
poor	O

suspicion	O
of	O
another	O

instead	O
of	O

forthwith	O
to	O
Freeman	O

who	O

being	O
informed	O
of	O
my	O
behaviour	O

came	O
straight	O
to	O
my	O
apartment	O

conjured	O
me	O
so	O
pathetically	O
to	O
make	O
him	O
acquainted	O
with	O
the	O

of	O
my	O

that	O

He	O
represented	O
the	O
madness	O
of	O

at	O

both	O

knocked	O
at	O
my	O
door	O

I	O
no	O

opened	O

a	O
young	O

entered	O
in	O

marvellous	O

After	O
a	O
low	O
bow	O

he	O
called	O
me	O
by	O
name	O

and	O
asked	O
if	O
I	O

forgotten	O
him	O

His	O
voice	O
assisted	O
me	O
in	O
recollecting	O
his	O
person	O

whom	O
I	O
soon	O
recognised	O
to	O
be	O
my	O

Jackson	O

of	O
whom	O
mention	O
is	O
made	O
in	O
the	O

I	O
saluted	O
him	O
cordially	O
,	O
expressed	O
my	O
satisfaction	O
at	O
finding	O
him	O
alive	O
,	O
and	O
condoled	O
him	O
on	O
his	O
present	O
situation	O

which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
did	O
not	O
seem	O
to	O
affect	O
him	O
much	O

laughed	O
very	O
heartily	O
at	O
the	O
occasion	O
of	O
our	O
meeting	O
so	O
unexpectedly	O
in	O
this	O

Our	O

I	O
inquired	O
about	O
his	O
amour	O
with	O
the	O

fortune	O

seemed	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
near	O
a	O
happy	O
conclusion	O
when	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
pleasure	O
of	O
seeing	O
him	O
last	O

and	O
,	O
after	O
an	O
immoderate	O
fit	O
of	O
laughter	O
,	O
he	O
gave	O
me	O
to	O
understand	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
egregiously	O
bit	O
in	O
that	O
affair	O

I	O
congratulated	O
him	O
on	O
his	O
philosophy	O

and	O
,	O
remembering	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
in	O

the	O
money	O

was	O

adapted	O

When	O
we	O
were	O
left	O
by	O
ourselves	O

I	O
communicated	O
to	O
him	O
my	O
disaster	O

endeavoured	O
to	O
console	O
him	O
with	O
the	O

me	O

his	O
grief	O
was	O
unutterable	O

seemed	O

give	O
attention	O

wrung	O

hands	O
in	O

in	O

recovered	O
the	O

began	O

a	O

lasted	O
a	O

not	O

-LRB-	O

This	O

together	O

for	O

up	O

deciding	O

amongst	O
the	O

understood	O
also	O

that	O
he	O
was	O
an	O
excellent	O
poet	O

and	O
had	O
composed	O
a	O
tragedy	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
allowed	O
by	O
everybody	O
who	O
had	O
seen	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
performance	O
of	O
great	O
merit	O
:	O
that	O
his	O
learning	O
was	O
infinite	O
,	O
his	O
morals	O
unexceptionable	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
modesty	O
invincible	O

Such	O
a	O
character	O
could	O
not	O
fail	O
of	O
attracting	O
my	O
regard	O
;	O
I	O
longed	O
impatiently	O
to	O
be	O

desired	O

engage	O
him	O

spend	O
the	O

in	O
my	O

My	O
request	O
was	O
granted	O

he	O
favoured	O
us	O
with	O
his	O
company	O

,	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
our	O
conversation	O
perceiving	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
strong	O
passion	O
for	O
the	O
Belles	O
Lettres	O
,	O
acquitted	O
himself	O
so	O
well	O
on	O
that	O
subject	O

that	O
I	O
expressed	O
a	O
fervent	O
desire	O
of	O
seeing	O
his	O
productions	O

In	O
this	O
point	O
too	O
he	O
gratified	O
my	O
inclination	O

My	O

at	O
the	O

down	O

I	O

In	O

,	O
I	O
judged	O
it	O
by	O
the	O

of	O
Aristotle	PNM

and	O
could	O
find	O
nothing	O

a	O
little	O
too	O
much	O
embellishment	O
in	O
some	O

places	O
,	O
which	O
objection	O
he	O
removed	O
to	O
my	O
satisfaction	O

by	O
a	O
quotation	O
of	O
Aristotle	O

poetics	O
,	O
importing	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
least	O
interesting	O
parts	O
of	O
a	O

ought	O
to	O
be	O
raised	O

dignified	O
by	O
the	O
charms	O

energy	O
of	O

I	O
revered	O
his	O
genius	O

was	O
seized	O
with	O
an	O
eager	O
curiosity	O
to	O
know	O
the	O

accepted	O
my	O
present	O

in	O
less	O

made	O
his	O

which	O
altered	O
his	O

very	O
much	O
to	O

perceived	O
by	O
his	O

endeavoured	O
to	O
prevent	O

by	O
asking	O
pardon	O
for	O
the	O
liberty	O
I	O

taken	O

with	O
an	O
aspect	O
full	O
of	O

I	O
am	O
willing	O

obtained	O
an	O

for	O
Jackson	O

his	O
misfortune	O
made	O
so	O
little	O
impression	O
on	O
himself	O

he	O
was	O
altogether	O
so	O
loose	O

indifferent	O

indiscreet	O

that	O
I	O
could	O
scarce	O

I	O
had	O
conceived	O
a	O
veneration	O

was	O

retired	O

with	O
an	O
intention	O

went	O
thither	O
myself	O

pressed	O
it	O
upon	O

with	O
five	O
guineas	O

which	O
,	O
with	O
much	O

him	O

when	O
my	O

in	O
the	O

that	O
the	O

in	O

The	O

ordered	O
to	O

to	O
Mr.	O

lodgings	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
arrived	O

he	O
entered	O
into	O
a	O
serious	O
discourse	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
my	O
situation	O

proposed	O
that	O

him	O
in	O

of	O
his	O
surgeon	O
;	O
in	O
which	O

would	O
put	O
me	O
in	O
a	O
method	O

getting	O
a	O
fortune	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
years	O
by	O
my	O

assured	O
me	O

that	O
I	O
might	O
expect	O
to	O

all	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
die	O

Though	O
I	O
was	O
penetrated	O
with	O
a	O
sense	O
of	O
his	O
generosity	O
,	O
l	O
was	O
startled	O
at	O
a	O
proposal	O
that	O
offered	O
violence	O
to	O
my	O

signified	O
my	O

on	O
that	O
head	O

which	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
seem	O
to	O
relish	O
;	O
but	O
observed	O
that	O
love	O
was	O
the	O
fruit	O
of	O
idleness	O

that	O
when	O
once	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
employed	O
in	O
business	O

and	O
my	O
mind	O
engaged	O
in	O
making	O
money	O

I	O
should	O
be	O
no	O

none	O

your	O

nothing	O

their	O
pleasure	O

I	O
was	O
piqued	O
at	O
this	O
insinuation	O

which	O
I	O
looked	O
upon	O
as	O
a	O
reproach	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
without	O
giving	O
myself	O
time	O
to	O
deliberate	O
,	O
accepted	O
his	O
offer	O

He	O
was	O
overjoyed	O
at	O
my	O
compliance	O
,	O
carried	O
me	O
immediately	O
to	O
his	O
chief	O
owner	O

with	O
whom	O
a	O
bargain	O
was	O
struck	O
;	O

had	O
I	O
been	O
ever	O

the	O
agreement	O

That	O
I	O
might	O
not	O
have	O
time	O
to	O
cool	O
,	O
he	O
bade	O
me	O
draw	O
out	O
a	O
list	O
of	O
medicines	O
for	O
a	O
complement	O
of	O
five	O
hundred	O

adapted	O
to	O

sufficient	O
for	O
a	O
voyage	O
of	O
eighteen	O

;	O
and	O
carry	O
it	O
to	O
a	O
certain	O

who	O
would	O
also	O
provide	O
me	O
in	O
two	O

While	O
I	O
was	O
thus	O

came	O
in	O

looked	O
very	O
blank	O

my	O
resolution	O
:	O
however	O
,	O
after	O
a	O
pause	O
of	O
some	O

he	O
insisted	O
upon	O

along	O
with	O
me	O

at	O
my	O
desire	O
was	O
made	O
ship	O

bespoke	O
a	O

my	O

had	O
cleared	O
almost	O
three	O

he	O
would	O
immediately	O

put	O
into	O
my	O

that	O
he	O
would	O
procure	O
for	O

that	O

although	O
he	O
looked	O
upon	O
my	O

he	O
would	O
keep	O
the	O

this	O

had	O
upon	O

the	O

that	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
should	O
set	O
out	O
next	O
day	O
upon	O
my	O
travels	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
come	O
to	O
take	O
my	O
leave	O
of	O
my	O
friends	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
receive	O
of	O
him	O
the	O
money	O
he	O
had	O
borrowed	O
from	O
me	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
now	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
going	O
abroad	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
certainly	O
have	O
occasion	O
for	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
disconcerted	O
at	O
this	O
demand	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
recollecting	O
himself	O
in	O
a	O
moment	O
,	O
swore	O
in	O
an	O
affected	O
passion	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
used	O
him	O
extremely	O
ill	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
would	O
never	O
forgive	O
me	O
for	O
having	O
,	O
by	O
this	O
short	O
warning	O
,	O
put	O
it	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
power	O
to	O
free	O
himself	O
of	O
an	O
obligation	O
he	O
could	O
no	O
longer	O
bear	O
.	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
help	O
smiling	O
at	O
this	O
pretended	O
delicacy	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
commended	O
highly	O
,	O
telling	O
him	O
he	O
needed	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
uneasy	O
on	O
that	O
score	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
would	O
give	O
him	O
a	O
direction	O
to	O
a	O
merchant	O
in	O
the	O
city	O
,	O
with	O
whom	O
I	O
would	O
leave	O
a	O
discharge	O
on	O
the	O
sum	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
delivered	O
upon	O
payment	O
.	O

He	O
professed	O
much	O
joy	O
at	O
this	O
expedient	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
great	O
eagerness	O
asked	O
the	O
person	O
's	O
name	O
and	O
place	O
of	O
abode	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
forthwith	O
wrote	O
in	O
his	O
pocket-book	O
,	O
assuring	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
long	O
in	O
my	O
debt	O
.	O

This	O
affair	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
knew	O
he	O
should	O
never	O
after	O
think	O
of	O
,	O
being	O
settled	O
to	O
his	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
I	O
sent	O
cards	O
to	O
all	O
my	O
friends	O
,	O
desiring	O
the	O
favour	O
of	O
their	O
company	O
at	O
a	O
tavern	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
honoured	O
my	O
invitation	O

and	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
pleasure	O
of	O
treating	O
them	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
elegant	O
manner	O
,	O
at	O
which	O
they	O
expressed	O
equal	O
admiration	O
as	O
applause	O

Having	O
enjoyed	O
ourselves	O
till	O
midnight	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
my	O
leave	O
of	O
them	O

and	O
was	O
well	O
nigh	O
stifled	O
with	O
caresses	O

next	O

for	O
that	O

Sussex	PNM
where	O
my	O

As	O

I	O
halted	O
within	O

where	O
we	O
remained	O
till	O
the	O

a	O

about	O
half-a-mile	O
from	O
the	O

where	O
Mrs.	O

lived	O

Here	O
we	O
left	O
our	O
horses	O
tied	O
to	O
a	O

and	O
went	O
directly	O
to	O

Her	O
habitation	O

we	O
arrived	O
at	O
the	O

He	O
rapped	O
at	O
the	O
door	O

to	O
which	O
the	O
good	O
old	O
matron	O
coming	O

told	O
him	O
that	O
,	O
being	O
a	O

he	O
must	O
excuse	O
her	O

open	O
it	O
,	O
until	O
he	O
had	O
declared	O
his	O
name	O

He	O
answered	O

that	O
his	O
name	O
was	O
unknown	O
to	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
his	O
business	O
was	O
to	O

which	O
-LRB-	O
to	O

This	O

the	O

my	O

no	O

before	O

when	O
I	O
had	O
thus	O

Mrs.	O

that	O
Narcissa	O

upon	O

Bath	O

had	O

one	O

afterwards	O

by	O
one	O
of	O

who	O
discovered	O

the	O

that	O

as	O

than	O
to	O
attempt	O
my	O

destruction	O
in	O
such	O
a	O

manner	O

I	O
was	O

the	O

ordering	O
him	O
to	O

with	O

set	O
out	O

at	O

peremptorily	O

I	O
persuaded	O

at	O

by	O
my	O

heart	O

I	O
soon	O
recognised	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
adorable	O
Narcissa	PNM
and	O
Miss	O
Williams	O
.	O

I	O
felt	O
the	O
strongest	O
agitation	O
of	O
soul	O
at	O
the	O
sight	O
;	O
and	O
guessing	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
repose	O
themselves	O
in	O
the	O
alcove	O
,	O
stopped	O
into	O
it	O
unperceived	O
,	O
and	O
hid	O
upon	O
the	O
stone	O
table	O
a	O
picture	O
of	O
myself	O
in	O
miniature	O
,	O
for	O
which	O
I	O
had	O
sat	O
in	O
London	PNM
,	O
purposing	O
to	O
leave	O
it	O
with	O
Narcissa	O
before	O
I	O
should	O
go	O
abroad	O
.	O

I	O
exposed	O
it	O
in	O
this	O
manner	O
,	O
as	O
an	O
introduction	O
to	O
my	O
own	O
appearance	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
without	O
some	O
previous	O
intimation	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
afraid	O
might	O
have	O
an	O
unlucky	O
effect	O
upon	O
the	O
delicate	O
nerves	O
of	O
my	O
fair	O
enslaver	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
withdrew	O
into	O
the	O
thicket	O
,	O
where	O
I	O
could	O
hear	O
their	O
discourse	O
,	O
and	O
suit	O
myself	O
to	O
the	O
circumstance	O
of	O
the	O
occasion	O
.	O

As	O
they	O
advanced	O
,	O
I	O
observed	O
an	O
air	O
of	O
melancholy	O
in	O
the	O
countenance	O
of	O
Narcissa	PNM
,	O
blended	O
with	O
such	O
unspeakable	O
sweetness	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
scarce	O
refrain	O
from	O
flying	O
into	O
her	O
arms	O
,	O
and	O
kissing	O
away	O
the	O
pearly	O
drop	O
that	O
stood	O
collected	O
in	O
each	O
bewitching	O
eye	O
.	O

According	O
to	O
my	O
expectation	O
,	O
she	O
entered	O
the	O
alcove	O
,	O
and	O
perceiving	O
something	O
on	O
the	O
table	O
,	O
took	O
it	O
up	O

No	O

did	O
she	O
cast	O
her	O
eye	O
upon	O
the	O
features	O

,	O
startled	O
at	O
the	O
resemblance	O

she	O
cried	O
,	O
``	O
Good	O
God	O

''	O

and	O
the	O
roses	O
instantly	O
vanished	O
from	O
her	O
cheeks	O
.	O

Her	O
confidante	O
,	O
alarmed	O
at	O
this	O
exclamation	O
,	O
looked	O
at	O
the	O
picture	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
struck	O
with	O
the	O
likeness	O

exclaimed	O

``	O

Narcissa	O

having	O
recollected	O
herself	O
a	O

the	O
satisfaction	O

have	O
felt	O
at	O
those	O

he	O
affected	O
a	O
shyness	O
of	O
quitting	O
the	O

no	O

I	O
was	O

at	O
this	O
affectation	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O

to	O
punish	O
his	O

Alarmed	O
at	O

By	O
this	O

we	O

two	O

pursued	O
us	O

which	O

This	O
discovery	O
had	O
an	O
evident	O
effect	O
upon	O
the	O

who	O
did	O
not	O

I	O
calculated	O
the	O

My	O

Having	O

that	O

desire	O
to	O
revisit	O
his	O

country	O

in	O

of	O
which	O
he	O

My	O

that	O
for	O

he	O
should	O
be	O
glad	O
of	O

The	O

I	O
was	O

to	O
hear	O
his	O

he	O
eyed	O
me	O
with	O
uncommon	O

I	O
felt	O
a	O

attraction	O
towards	O
him	O
;	O
when	O
he	O
spoke	O

I	O
listened	O
with	O
attention	O

reverence	O
;	O
the	O
dignity	O
of	O
his	O

filled	O
me	O

and	O

in	O

the	O

Having	O

the	O

He	O

I	O

about	O
him	O
of	O
Don	O

who	O
could	O
give	O
me	O
no	O

satisfaction	O
than	O
that	O
his	O

that	O
he	O

fifteen	O

sixteen	O

in	O

was	O
reputed	O

and	O
supposed	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
unfortunate	O
in	O
his	O
younger	O
years	O
,	O
because	O
he	O
was	O
observed	O
to	O
nourish	O
a	O
pensive	O
melancholy	O
,	O
even	O
from	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
his	O
first	O
settlement	O
among	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
nobody	O
had	O
ventured	O
to	O
inquire	O
into	O
the	O

of	O

which	O
might	O
suffer	O
in	O
the	O

I	O
was	O
seized	O
with	O
an	O
irresistible	O
desire	O
of	O
knowing	O
the	O
particulars	O
of	O
his	O
fate	O

and	O
enjoyed	O
not	O
an	O
hour	O
of	O

during	O
the	O

by	O

of	O

I	O
was	O

this	O

in	O

of	O
which	O
we	O
mounted	O
the	O

alighted	O

Here	O
we	O
were	O
splendidly	O
entertained	O

with	O
a	O

made	O
my	O

about	O
my	O

Mr.	O

and	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
hours	O
reached	O
the	O
place	O
of	O
his	O
habitation	O

I	O
should	O
much	O
wrong	O
the	O
delicacy	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Thompson	O
's	O
sentiments	O
to	O
say	O
barely	O
he	O
was	O
glad	O
to	O
see	O
me	O
:	O
he	O
felt	O
all	O
that	O
the	O
most	O
sensible	O
and	O
disinterested	O
friendship	O
could	O
feel	O
on	O
this	O
occasion	O
,	O
introduced	O
me	O
to	O
his	O
wife	O
,	O
a	O
very	O
amiable	O
young	O
lady	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
already	O
blessed	O
him	O
with	O
two	O
fine	O
children	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
as	O
yet	O
ignorant	O
of	O
my	O
circumstances	O
,	O
frankly	O
offered	O
me	O
the	O
assistance	O
of	O
his	O
purse	O
and	O
interest	O
.	O

I	O
thanked	O
him	O
for	O
his	O
generous	O
intention	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
him	O
acquainted	O
with	O
my	O
situation	O

on	O
which	O
he	O
congratulated	O
me	O
with	O
great	O
joy	O

after	O
I	O
had	O
stayed	O
with	O
him	O

to	O

upon	O
my	O
father	O
,	O
whom	O

invited	O
to	O
his	O

Don	O
Rodrigo	O
complied	O
with	O
his	O
request	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
handsomely	O
entertained	O
during	O
the	O
space	O
of	O
a	O
week	O
,	O
returned	O
extremely	O
well	O
satisfied	O
with	O
the	O
behaviour	O
of	O
my	O
friend	O
and	O
his	O
lady	O
,	O
to	O
whom	O
,	O
at	O

,	O
he	O
presented	O
a	O
very	O
valuable	O
diamond	O
ring	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
token	O
of	O
his	O
esteem	O

During	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
my	O
conversation	O
with	O
Mr.	O
Thompson	O
,	O
he	O
gave	O
me	O
to	O
understand	O
,	O
that	O
his	O
old	O
commander	O
Captain	O
Oakum	O
was	O
dead	O
some	O
months	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
immediately	O
after	O
his	O
death	O
,	O
a	O
discovery	O
had	O
been	O
made	O
of	O
some	O
valuable	O
effects	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
feloniously	O
secreted	O
out	O
of	O
a	O
prize	O
by	O
the	O
assistance	O
of	O
Dr.	O
Mackshane	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
now	O
actually	O
in	O
prison	O
on	O
that	O
account	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
being	O
destitute	O
of	O
friends	O
,	O
subsisted	O
solely	O
on	O
the	O
charity	O
of	O
my	O
friend	O
,	O
whose	O
bounty	O
he	O
had	O
implored	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
abject	O
manner	O
,	O
after	O
having	O
been	O
the	O
barbarous	O
occasion	O
of	O
driving	O
him	O
to	O
that	O
terrible	O
extremity	O
on	O
board	O
of	O
The	O
Thunder	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
have	O
formerly	O
related	O

Whatsoever	O
this	O
wretch	O
had	O
been	O
guilty	O
of	O
,	O
I	O
applauded	O
Mr.	O
Thompson	O
's	O
generosity	O
towards	O
him	O
in	O
his	O
distress	O
,	O
which	O
wrought	O
so	O
much	O
upon	O
me	O
also	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
sent	O
him	O
ten	O
pistoles	O
,	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
private	O
manner	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
never	O
know	O
his	O
benefactor	O
.	O

While	O
my	O

and	O
I	O
were	O
caressed	O
among	O
the	O
gentlemen	O
on	O

Captain	O
Bowling	O
had	O
written	O
to	O
his	O

by	O
the	O
packet	O
,	O
which	O
sailed	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
after	O
our	O
arrival	O

signifying	O
his	O
prosperous	O
voyage	O
hitherto	O

and	O
desiring	O
them	O
to	O
insure	O
his	O
ship	O
and	O
cargo	O
homeward	O
bound	O
:	O
after	O
which	O
precaution	O
he	O
applied	O
himself	O
so	O
heartily	O
to	O
the	O
task	O
of	O
loading	O
his	O
ship	O
that	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
assistance	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Thompson	O

was	O
full	O
in	O

six	O

This	O

gentleman	O
likewise	O
procured	O
for	O
Don	O
Rodrigo	O

upon	O
London	PNM
for	O
the	O
greatest	O
part	O
of	O
his	O
gold	O
and	O
silver	O
,	O
by	O
which	O
means	O
it	O
was	O
secured	O
against	O
the	O
risk	O
of	O
the	O
seas	O
and	O
the	O
enemy	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
before	O
we	O
sailed	O

supplied	O
us	O
with	O
such	O
large	O
quantities	O
of	O
all	O

that	O
not	O

we	O

but	O
the	O
ship	O

fared	O
sumptuously	O
during	O
the	O
voyage	O

Everything	O
being	O
ready	O

we	O
took	O
our	O

the	O

We	O

About	O
two	O

the	O

My	O

I	O
went	O
ashore	O
immediately	O
at	O
Portsmouth	PNM
,	O
leaving	O
Strap	O
with	O
the	O

with	O
the	O
ship	O
and	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
our	O
effects	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
discovered	O
so	O
much	O
impatience	O
to	O
see	O
my	O
charming	O
Narcissa	O
,	O
that	O
my	O
father	O
permitted	O
me	O
to	O
ride	O
across	O
the	O
country	O
to	O
her	O
brother	O
's	O
house	O
;	O
while	O
he	O
should	O
hire	O
a	O

for	O
London	PNM

where	O
he	O
would	O
wait	O
for	O
me	O
at	O
a	O
place	O
to	O
which	O
I	O
directed	O
him	O
.	O

Fired	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
eagerness	O
of	O
passion	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
post	O
that	O
very	O
night	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
reached	O
an	O
inn	O
about	O
three	O
miles	O
from	O
the	O
squire	O
's	O
habitation	O
;	O
here	O
I	O
remained	O
till	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
allaying	O
the	O
torture	O
of	O
my	O
impatience	O
with	O
the	O
rapturous	O
hope	O
of	O
seeing	O
that	O
divine	O
creature	O
after	O
an	O
absence	O
of	O
eighteen	O
months	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
far	O
from	O
impairing	O
,	O
had	O
raised	O
my	O
love	O
to	O
the	O
most	O
exalted	O
pitch	O
!	O

Neither	O
were	O
my	O
reflections	O
free	O
from	O
apprehensions	O
:	O
that	O
something	O
intervened	O
in	O
spite	O
of	O
all	O
my	O
hope	O
,	O
and	O
represented	O
her	O
as	O
having	O
yielded	O
to	O
the	O
importunity	O
of	O
her	O
brother	O
and	O
blessed	O
the	O
arms	O
of	O
a	O
happy	O
rival	O

My	O
thoughts	O
were	O
even	O
maddened	O
with	O
the	O
fear	O
of	O
her	O
death	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
arrived	O
in	O
the	O
dark	O
at	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
Mrs.	O
Sagely	O

I	O
had	O
not	O

desire	O
admittance	O

my	O
soul	O
should	O
be	O
shocked	O
with	O
dismal	O

At	O

I	O
knocked	O

no	O

This	O

affected	O
with	O
my	O
words	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
tears	O
ran	O
down	O
her	O

it	O

in	O
the	O
most	O
elegant	O

pathetic	O
expressions	O

but	O
declined	O
my	O

Finding	O
her	O
immovable	O
on	O
this	O

I	O
insisted	O
on	O
her	O
accepting	O
a	O

took	O
my	O

alighted	O

as	O
I	O

into	O

I	O

thinking	O
that	O
my	O

upon	O

that	O

father	O
's	O
resentment	O
glowed	O
in	O
his	O
visage	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
ordered	O
her	O
to	O
be	O
gone	O
,	O
with	O
such	O
a	O
commanding	O
aspect	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
retired	O
in	O
a	O
fright	O
,	O
muttering	O
curses	O
as	O
she	O
went	O
downstairs	O
.	O

We	O
afterwards	O
learned	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
married	O
to	O
an	O
ensign	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
already	O
spent	O
all	O
her	O
fortune	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
her	O
sister	O
had	O
borne	O
a	O
child	O
to	O
her	O
mother	O
's	O
footman	O
,	O
who	O
is	O
now	O
her	O
husband	O

and	O

a	O

in	O

The	O
fame	O
of	O
our	O
flourishing	O
condition	O
having	O
arrived	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
before	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
got	O
notice	O
that	O
the	O
magistrates	O
intended	O
next	O
day	O
to	O
compliment	O
us	O
with	O
the	O
freedom	O
of	O
their	O
town	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
my	O
father	O
,	O
considering	O
their	O
complaisance	O
in	O
the	O
right	O
point	O
of	O
view	O
,	O
ordered	O
the	O
horses	O
to	O
the	O
coach	O
early	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
.	O

We	O
proceeded	O
to	O
our	O
estate	O
,	O
which	O
lay	O
about	O
twenty	O
miles	O
from	O
this	O
place	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
within	O
half-a-league	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
,	O
were	O
met	O
by	O
a	O
prodigious	O
number	O
of	O
poor	O
tenants	O
,	O
men	O
,	O
women	O
,	O
and	O
children	O
,	O
who	O
testified	O
their	O
joy	O
by	O
loud	O
acclamations	O
,	O
and	O
accompanied	O
our	O
coach	O
to	O
the	O
gate	O
.	O

As	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
peasants	O
are	O
more	O
attached	O
to	O
their	O
lords	O
than	O
in	O
Scotland	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
almost	O
devoured	O
by	O
their	O
affections	O
.	O

My	O
father	O
had	O
always	O
been	O
their	O
favourite	O
,	O
and	O
now	O
that	O
he	O
appeared	O
their	O
master	O
,	O
after	O
having	O
been	O
thought	O
dead	O
so	O
long	O
,	O
their	O
joy	O
broke	O
out	O
into	O
a	O
thousand	O
extravagances	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
entered	O
the	O
court	O
yard	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
surrounded	O
by	O
a	O
vast	O
number	O
,	O
who	O
crowded	O
together	O
so	O
closely	O
to	O
see	O
us	O
that	O
several	O
were	O
in	O
danger	O
of	O
being	O
squeezed	O
to	O
death	O
;	O
those	O
who	O
were	O
near	O
Don	O
Rodrigo	O
fell	O
upon	O
their	O
knees	O
,	O
and	O
kissed	O
his	O
hand	O
,	O
or	O
the	O
hem	O
of	O
his	O
garment	O
,	O
praying	O
aloud	O
for	O
long	O
life	O
and	O
prosperity	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
others	O
approached	O
Narcissa	O
and	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
manner	O
;	O
while	O
the	O
rest	O
clapped	O
their	O
hands	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
invoked	O
heaven	O
to	O
shower	O
its	O
choicest	O
blessings	O
on	O
our	O
heads	O
!	O

In	O
short	O
,	O
the	O
whole	O
scene	O
,	O
though	O
rude	O
,	O
was	O
so	O
affecting	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
gentle	O
partner	O
of	O
my	O
heart	O
wept	O
over	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
father	O
himself	O
could	O
not	O
refrain	O
from	O
dropping	O
a	O
tear	O
.	O

Having	O
welcomed	O
his	O
daughter	O
and	O
me	O
to	O
his	O
house	O
,	O
he	O
ordered	O
some	O
bullocks	O
to	O
be	O
killed	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
hogsheads	O
of	O
ale	O
to	O
be	O
brought	O
from	O
the	O
neighbouring	O
village	O
,	O
to	O
regale	O
these	O
honest	O
people	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
not	O
enjoyed	O
such	O
a	O
holiday	O
for	O
many	O
years	O
before	O
.	O

Next	O
day	O
we	O
were	O
visited	O
by	O
the	O
gentlemen	O
in	O
the	O
neighbourhood	O
,	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
our	O
relations	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
whom	O
brought	O
along	O
my	O
cousin	O
,	O
the	O
foxhunter	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
stayed	O
at	O
his	O
house	O
since	O
he	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
leave	O
his	O
own	O
!	O

My	O
father	O
was	O
generous	O
enough	O
to	O
receive	O
him	O
kindly	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
promised	O
to	O
purchase	O
for	O
him	O
a	O
commission	O
in	O
the	O
army	O
,	O
for	O
which	O
he	O
expressed	O
great	O
thankfulness	O
and	O
joy	O

My	O
charming	O
Narcissa	PNM
was	O
universally	O
admired	O
and	O
loved	O
for	O
her	O
beauty	O
,	O
affability	O
,	O
and	O
good	O
sense	O
;	O
and	O
so	O
well	O
pleased	O
with	O
the	O
situation	O
of	O
the	O
place	O

and	O
the	O
company	O
round	O
,	O
that	O
she	O
has	O
not	O
as	O
yet	O
discovered	O
the	O
least	O
desire	O
of	O
changing	O
her	O
habitation	O

We	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
many	O
days	O
settled	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
prevailed	O
upon	O
my	O
father	O
to	O
pay	O
a	O
visit	O
to	O
the	O
village	O
where	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
at	O
school	O

Here	O
we	O
were	O
received	O
by	O
the	O
principal	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
who	O
entertained	O
us	O
in	O
the	O
church	O
,	O
where	O
Mr.	O
Syntax	O
the	O
schoolmaster	O
-LRB-	O
my	O
tyrant	O
being	O
dead	O
-RRB-	O
pronounced	O
a	O
Latin	O
oration	O
in	O
honour	O
of	O
our	O
family	O
.	O

And	O
none	O
exerted	O
themselves	O
more	O
than	O
Strap	O
's	O
father	O
and	O
relations	O
,	O
who	O
looked	O
upon	O
the	O
honest	O
valet	O
as	O
the	O
first	O
gentleman	O
of	O
their	O
race	O
,	O
and	O
honoured	O
his	O
benefactors	O
accordingly	O

Having	O
received	O
the	O
homage	O
of	O
this	O
place	O

we	O
retired	O
,	O
leaving	O
forty	O
pounds	O
for	O
the	O
benefit	O
of	O
the	O
poor	O
of	O
the	O

;	O
and	O

been	O
shown	O
to	O
him	O

and	O
to	O
me	O
on	O

Surprised	O
at	O

the	O
