THE

PREFACE

To the Fourth Edition.

I S in Compliance with Sir JR^r
3j >T K VEftrangfs Maxim, « That a
k^S^jalf " Man had as good go to Court
without a Cravat, as appear in Print
without a Preface that I give the gentle
Reader any Interruption of this Kind for
to be plain with him, the Book itself, as.
full of Misfortunes as it is, is but a Preface
to the Misfortunes I have met with since
its first Publication, which I mud freely
confess are wholly owing to the Bent of
my own head-strong Inclination, in not
taking my Father's Advice at my first setting
out into the World,

This



m PREFACE.

This forth Appearance indeed, is, I
canst help owning,, a Fleaikre to me, tho'
it is much more owing to the Candour of
the Public, than the Merit of the Performance.


The Age of Gallantry I observe, seems
to roll round again, for certainly Plays*
Novels and Romances, were never more
in Vogue that at this Juncture. And as
to those who have a more refined Taste
for Masquerades, Operas, and Grotesque
Entertainments, this good Town is fully
convinced, that Dr. Faustus from Germany
now vies with our Countryman Mrs.
Robinson at the Haymarket j that Mr. beveridge,
as a Devil, has more Admirers
than Signora Curzon * and that Heydegger
has a much greater Number of Rollers,
than the laudable Society established for
Reformation of Manners. These latter
Gentlemen are, if Dr. South may be credited,
arrant Hypocrites ; for that learned
Divine honestly tells us, That instead of
making Godliness a Gain, they make a
Gain of Godliness : So much for politeness.





The PREFACE.

nefs. But at the same Time it must be confessed,
that it is very rueful to behold the
Quill-drivers of the present Age, so egregiously
triumphant over those of the last.;
for now Shakespeare and Ben Johnson y must
give way to Robinson Crusoe and Colonel
Jack \ as well as Dry den and Otway to
Moll Flanders and Sally Salijbtciy : And I
myself am terribly afraid, that the Voyages
and Adventures of Captain Richard Falconer
must in a short Period of Time, strike
to Sir John Mandeville lying Travels, and *
Mademoiselle B tie its unheard of Intrigues.
Tho' I have still some Consolation
in my Hopes, that this fourth Edition,
wherein many Errors of the Press that escaped
in the former, are corrected, will
come to a fifth, and so on.

To conclude, if Mr. Dennis ^ or any
other Critick of Renown, shall think fit
to fall foul on me, to such I shall only reply,
in the Words of the same Gentleman
with whom I began this Preface : " Those
that don't like my Book may let it

alone, and there's no Harm done. 99

my Mother died when I was very

and frequently repeating his Adventures abroad,

to Sea with some Captain of his Acquaintance ; but
he would reply, Dick, stay where you are, you
know not the Hazards and Dangers that attend a maritime
Life : You shall have a good Trade in your
Belly, and that will keep you from a Desire of rambling
; therefore tell me what Calling you like bell,
that I may immediately put you out in Order to your
living hereafter: You know, continued he, that my
Fortune is but small, and I living to the Extent of
it, it will not be possible for me to leave you wherewithal
to support you without some Employment,
Therefore, (replied I,) as you have a Daughter, you
may leave your Substance to her, she must be provided
for; as for our Sex, we can best take Care
for ourselves ; and if you please but to fit me out
to Sea, even in what Station you think convenient,
it shall be all I will desire. Son, (said my
Father) think no more of going to Sea, for Til not
have it so ; I know it is only a Desire of Youth
prone to change : If I Should give you Leave, I am
assured one Week's Voyage would make you wish to
be at Home again. I used all the Arguments my
young Sense prompted me with, but all to no purpose,
my Father was not to be moved ; and thus I
lived two Years longer with him in Expectation of
his Mind altering. At hall an Accident happened
that furthered my Desires, and tho* it was the Ruin
of our Family,. I must confess, I was not much
concerned.

My Father was Supervisor of a Tax laid upon the
Burning of Pipes, and he having gathered a Sum of

Money,

Motley, amounting to 3800/. in Order to pay in to
the Government for the King's Use, was, by an
under Excise-man robbed of die whole Sam, who
made his Escape. My Father used all possible
Means to apprehend him without Noise, but all his
Endeavours were fruitless : So finding his Affairs
in a desperate Condition, resolved to retire to some
Part of the World where he might be safe from the
griping Hands of the Law. One Morning, just before
his voluntary Exile, he called me to him : Dick,
(laid he) you have been often desirous of going to
Sea, and I have always used Arguments to dissuade
you from it ; but now, since what has happened,
it being impossible for me to continue upon the Place
of my Birth, the Patrimony of my Ancestors, I must
even recommend that Way of Life to you which f
should never have chose, but that the Exigency of
my Affairs will not permit me to provide any other
Way for you. Here (continued he) take this 100/.

since it is all I can do for you, take it, and may

of a Father always live with you, whose Prayers
shall ever be sent to our Almighty Creator for thy
Welfare. Here (added he) is a Letter of Recommendation
for you to Captain Pulley of Bristol f
whose Friendship I am sure. will be of Service to you.
With that, he embraced me with Tears in his Eyes,
gave me his Blessing, kissed me, and took his Leave
for ever, for never have my Eyes beheld him since*

B 2 This

This Parting, I think, was the greatest Grief my
Thoughts had ever known till then; (for nothing
could be fonder, or shew more paternal Affection,
than my dear Father at his Hast Farewell) but the Joy
of my being at Liberty to follow my own Desires,
soon drowned my Sorrow for parting with so good a
Parent.

I had now nothing more to do, but to provide my
little Equ page in order to go to Bristol, to my Father's
Friend ; 1 packed up my Things in a Portmanteau,
and gave them to an old Servant of my Father's,
who would see me as far as Bristol for his Sake We
set out in the Morning, and reached it by Noon :
1 enquired for Captain Pultncy, and soon found him
out. I acquainted him who I was, and gave him
my Father's Letter. He read it, and received me
very kindly. It was to this Effect:

Dear Pulley,
T Hope you'll forgive this Trouble of your
** JL Friend. I have Tent my Son to you, in order
** to get him some Post by Sea, I know it is in
^ your Power to do it : Something has happened that
£ hinders my providing for him as I ought, I
tC would have waited on you in Person, but a Gap
4< has happened in my Affairs that I ill all never
close again. Dick will tell you all. Let me
ti conjure you by our old Friendship to take all
•< the Care you can df him ; and whenever he
comes to England, let him come to you, for as'
yes I know not where to* lead my wretched Life;

by a Letter, or Messenger, *s soon as possible,

Your we/I faithful

Friend and Servant.

R. Falcon fr.



Falconer, (said the Captain) I am' heartily
sorry for your Father's Misfortunes, which he tells
me in his Letter you will inform me of. After I
had related to him every Circumstance, he told me
he would provide for me as soon as possible, and till
then I should be as welcome to him as his own
Son : In the mean Time, said he, I would have you
verse yourself in the Mathematicks, which may be
of Use to you : I'll take Care to provide you a
Mailer, and instruments, which accordingly he
did , and as I had a great Desire to be abroad, and
had some small Knowledge of it which Learned at
School, apart from my other Studies, I soon attained
to the Theory of it.

After I had run through the whole Course, and
the Captain was informed I was capable, he got me
to be Mate (or rather Assistant) on Board the Awn
Frigate, Captain Wise Commander : and on the second

of May, 1699, we *" et ^ a *'» (bound fovjamaka)
with a fair Wind, As soon as we lost Sight of Land,
I began to be extremely seasick, and bore the Jests

an excellent Matter's Mate, he'll hit Jamaica to a
Hair, if the Illancl were no bigger than the Bunghole
of a Calk. I must confess, I believe myself to
be the only Person who ever set out on his first
Voyage as Mailer's Mate, without having seen a
River that vas navigable. But in a Day or two I
was perfectly well, and was never troubled with
any Sickness afterwards.

We had nothing material happened to us till we
entered the Bay of JSfcaj, where we were encountered
with a dreadful Storm ; the Billows ran Mountains
high, and our Vessel seemed to be the Sport
of the Waves ; A Flip that overtook us the Day before,
and accompany'd us, tho' it were not at half
a Furlong Pittance, was sometimes lost, by Reason
pf the Height of the Waves. The Storm continued
with this Violence three Days, and at last abated
something of its Fierceness, but still blew very hard.
The other Vessel, by firing a Gun, and making a
Signal, made it appear (he was in Distress, but the
Sea ran so high it was impossible to give them any
Assistance, yet we bore down to them (being to
Windward) as nigh as we could without Danger to
ourselves; we enquired into the Matter, and found
she had sprung a Leak ; they had all Hands to
pump by Turns, but yet the Water gain'd on them.
They begum of us to hoist out our Boat (their own
being shaved) to give them Succour upon Occasion :
Accordingly we put out our Long-Boat, with two
of our Men in it, but the Rope that held her to the
Ship, broke by the Violence of the Waves, and

drove



Capt. Richard Falconer. 7

drove away with the two unfortunate Men in her,
and what became of them we could never learn ;
but undoubtedly they perished by the Sea, or Hunger,
we being twenty Leagues from any Shore. The
Ship, after prodigious Labour of the Sailors, andin

Jess than ten Minutes, sunk to the Bottom ; out of
fifty-seven !Len, but four were saved, and they, by
good Fortune, laid hold on Ropes we threw out for
that Purpose; but it had not been possible to save
any, if we had not bore down to Leeward when
we saw them in the last Extremity. And here we
ought to admire at Providence ; for this very Vessel
was a Pyrate, one Captain Jones, Commander, who
in an open large Boat set out from Dover, and, nea r
OJIenJ J stole upon a French Vessel in the Night, murdered
the Captain and some others, and set a)] the
Sailors ashore that would not embrace their designs,
and had resolv'd to attack us as soon as the
Storm was over. The four Men that were saved,
were three Englishmen and one Fretxlmany who
said they were foret, with several others, by the
above-mention'd Captain Jews, to take to that
Course of Life; but whether true or false, I caii't
tell ; indeed they behav'd themselves very well
with us all the Voyage, and were entered into our
Books as four of the Flip's Crew, instead of two we
left on Shore, who were not to be found when we
set sail, and the two poor Wretches that were lost in
the Boat. The Storm full continued, but the Wind
fair, so we ran it away with a rivet Foresail all
Night, and the next Morning we had a violent

May the 28th, tve discovered the Canaries, and
the Peak of Tcmrijf] and passed this Island, or rather
Rock, of a prodigious Height, At Night the
Wind rose again, and continued to blow very hard
for two Days. As I was walking on the Deck one
Morning, my Chops were saluted with a Fish which
dropped down ; I took it up, panting at the Gills
for Life ; it proved to be a flying Fish, pursued (as
J supper) by some Dolphin, or Albacore; the Manner
of thefeFiihes avoiding their Enemies, is jumping
out of the Water, and flying till their Wings are
djy, then fall down again into the Sea. The Dolphin
that chases them, is one of the smell coloured
Fifties that swims, I have observed our Painters
draw them bending like a Bow, but I think it is
as strait a Fish as any in the Sea. We caught one of
them with a Fizgig, an Instrument made of several
Rous of Iron Spikes, bearded like Hooks, and
a Staff four or five Feet long to it; to this they tie a
Cord of a great Length, and dart it with all their
Strength; the wounded Fish immediately flounces
downward many Fathoms, and up again, which the
Darter observes, giving him Rope and Play till his
Weakness makes him more tame: then they draw
him up the Flip's Side, and cut him in Pieces. The
fill. we caught in this Manner was about six Feet
long, which we dressed, and Part of it served the
whole Ship's Company for Dinner; as soon as it

was



Capt. Richard Falconer, 9

was caught, it lost that beautiful Colour it had in
the Water; as for my own Part, notwithstanding
their praising it, I had rather eat a Herring or a
Mackerel than this rare Fish. I don't know whether
these Fish can hear, or love Musick, but this 1 am
sure of, we had an excellent Trumpet on Board,
which diverted us in good Weather, and I have observed,
that at the Sound of it, the Number of these
Dolphins seemed to increase, and swim within two
Feet of our Vessel, but that may be pure Accident;
yet I fancy there's something in it, that occasioned
the Fable of Amphion and the Dolphin. Sharks are
taken as we take common Fiih, only the Hook is
about two Feet long, and an Iron Chain above that
about four Feet long, and a long Rope to that;
they generally bait the Hook with a Piece of Beef of
three or four Pounds, which the voracious Fish swallows
immediately, Hook and all ; then they give
him Play a while, and when he is pretty well spent,
they draw him in with a Tackle : There's always
one (lands ready with an Axe to make a Divorce
between his Tail and his Body, otherwise he would
give such large Thumps with it that might do the
Ship Damage; I myself vas thrown dov.& buc
with a Touch of it. This that we took, had in it*

watry Element again.

We patted the Tropickkkk, attended by the Tropickkkk*

but one would think, as it flies, it had an unlighted
Candle fix'd in its TaiL I> cannot let go the Ceremony
of passing this Tropickk: When you are in the
Latitude, the old Sailors ask the re 11 of the Flip's
Crew, Whether they were ever that Way before ? If
not they must either pay a Bottle and Pound, (as
they call it) or be ducked : They that don't pay,
are fix'd to a Rope at the Main-Yard-Arm, and
ducked three Times in the Sea; at which the rest of the
Crew Huzza ! and fire a Volley of small Shot.

When Admiral Bembo went with his Squadron
of Men of War, the whole Fleet ducked, but the
Admiral gave them Notice, by first firing a Gun,
which was immediately follow'd with a Volley of
Mullets, and Puzzling, by every Flip in the Fleet.
A Day or two before our Account is out, we send
a Man to the Topmast-head, in order to discover
Land, where he stays an Hour, and looks about
him: He that discovers it first, is rewarded with
a Bottle and Pound: that is, a Bottle of Rum and
a Pound of Sugar, which is demanded as soon as
the Anchor is cast in a Place where such Commodities
are to be had. Now the Bottles and 'Pounds

that accrue from the People that are not willing to
be ducked, in palling the Tropickk , are reserved by
the old Sailors for a merry Bout, when safe in Harbour,

July the third, our Man at the Topmast-Head,
instead of crying Land, (as we expected) called out
a Sail ! a Sail ! which, in a Quarter of an Hour,
we discovered plainly upon Deck. We did not
know what to think of it, we knew we were near
Land, and consequently in Fear of those Pyrates,
or Buccaneers, that infeft those Coast : Our Captain
called all Hands aloft, and told us, Gentlemen,
'Tis One to one, but this Vessel we see maybe
a Pyrate, if so, how must we behave ourselves ?
If you are resolved to (land, it, I'll stand it to the
last ; if not, we'll surrender without firing a Gun,
which may induce them to be civil to us. The Sailors
cried, Let's sight 'em, let's sight 'em. With
that we put our Chests into the Hold, and brought
up our Hammocks, to place them in the Netting on
the Quarter Deck ; we cleared our Guns, which
were twelve, and mustered our Men, which amounted
to Thirty Eight, Passengers and all, who were
as willing to fight as any of us, they having something
Board that was valuable ; and some of them
perhaps all their Fortune. We kept our Way, and
the Flip bore up to us with all the Sail Ihe could
make. Night coming upon us, our Man at the Top-masthead
discovered Land, and another Flip to
the Windward of us. With that, we called another
Council, and persisted in our first Opinion of fighting
; but yet to use all Means possible of making to
Shore, (which was Barbadoes) : But for all our

devours, the first: Ship got' up with us, and about
Twelve o'Clock at Night hailed us, and commanded
us to hoist out our Boat, and to come on Board him,
with our Captain. We answered, We had never a
Boat, (as indeed we had not) but we told him, if
he would stay 'till Morning, something might be
done. At I aft he threatened to fink u9* if we would
Dot &hd our Captain on Board immediately ,• and
thereupon fir'd a Gun, which struck our Vessel on
her Quarter. With that we fir'd our Broad side
upon him, accompany'd with some small Arms ;
which, they little explain, I believe, did some
Damage, and put them in Confufion. Whereupon
we tack'd about, and with our six Guns rak'd her
foieandafts but was immediately seconded with
a Broad-fide from them, which kill us two Men,
and wounded a third. Upon' which, with loud
Xluzza's and Firing, they immediately boarded us on
our Starboard-Quarter, and poured into us at least
fourscore Men : We refilled them with all the Force
we had, but all to no purpose ; they drove us into
rhe Fore-castle, where, by good Chance, we made
shift to barricade ojirfelvcs y but they threatened to
turn our own Guns upon us, if we did not fur-render
immediately : But our Captain being resolute,
order'd us to fire upon' them with our small
Arms. Now we had under the Gratings, close to
our Steerage, a large Cittern, lin'd with Tin,
where we had unwittingly plac'd several Carriages
of Powder, but happily for us, whether it was our
-firing, or in the Battledore Match dropt in, I

know not, but the Powder took Fire, blew up the
Gratings, with some Part of the Quarter-Deck,
and Thirty of the Enemy, at least, into the Air,
Upon that we sally's out, and drove the rest,
with our Cutlasses, into their own Vessel again r
with the Loss of several. But this signified little,
for with the Fall and Breach of our Quarter-Deck y
the Powder-room was intirely dropped up nor
could we, without great Difficulty,, clear it from
the Lumber, so that we had not any Powder, but
what was in the Mens Cartouches for their Muskets
: However, desired briskly with them ; yet nevertheless
they prepared to board us again, with all
the Menaces imaginable. - This Fight continued at
least four Hours, and the Dawn began to break
upon us, which discovered to us the other Ship we
saw over Night, and we distinguished English Colours
; with that we gave a great Shout, and nVd
our small Arms again. The Enemy no sooner saw
the Flip with English Colours, but they cut off
their Grappling-irons, and did their Endeavour to
make off, but their Rigging was so shattered, that
their Sails could not be hoisted. In the mean Time
the other Ship came up to us, and, without hailing,
pour'd a Broad-fide into the Pyrate, and there foU
low'd a desperate Fight between them. As for our
Ship, it was of little Use so we steered off, and
feared our Gun-room,, and in half an. Hour (the
Fight continuing all. that while) we had charg'd
our great Guns, and returned to . the sight * bus
upon the Instant we saw the Pyrate finking; the



14 The Adventures of

English Flip had tore a Hole between Wind and
Water, that the sunk in a Moment, and but eight
Men saved, who told us their Captain was a Pyrate
from Guadalupe ; that when they were finking, they
had not above twenty Men left, out of an hundred
and sixty; and molt of them wounded. The Flip
that gave us this Reasonable rescue, was the Guernsey
Frigate, whose Station was Barbadoes. We lay by
for an Hour or two, to repair our Rigging,
andhail'd her, desiring them to send a Boat on Board
for our Captain, because we were without one,
which accordingly they did. Captain Wise and 1
went immediately on Board, to pay our Respects
to their Commander, who receiv'd us with all imaginable
Civility. We had on Board our Flip seven
Sailors and two Passengers kill'd : the one Joseph
Ridge of Barbadoes, and the other Daniel Thomson of
Mc<vh 9 Merchant; and four wounded. The Guernsey
had sixteen Men kilPd, and three wounded ;
among which was the Lieutenant, who died the
same Day of a Wound he receiv'd in his Thigh,
with a Musket Ballchew'd, which made the Wound
mortal. The Captain invited us to dine with him,
which we did ; where we were treated with a new
Dish, (at Least to me) a Polls that is, Fowls boil'd
with Rice and fait Pork ; which was very palatable.
We took our Leave of the Captain, and went on
Board of our own Vessel, and at five o'clock in
the Evening [July the 4th), after saluting the Town,
cast Anchor in Carlisle Bay.

Barbados,



Capt. Richard Falconer. rlf

Barbadoes, for its Bigness, is the richest and best
peopled Island in all America ; it is seated in thirteen
Degrees, twenty Minutes ; in Length, twenty-four
measured Miles, and in the broadest Part
about sixteen : It resembles a Leg of Mutton, with
the Knuckle off. The North and East Sides are
fortify 3 d by Nature, from any Harm from Ships of
War, by Reason there is no Anchoring Place. On
the South-east and Westerly Part, are four excellent,
commodious, well fortify'd Harbours. The
chief is that where we now ride, which will contain
a thousand Sail of Ships, free from the Danger
of any Winds. At the Bottom of this Harbour
Hands the Capital of the Island, calPd St. Michael's ;
with a Fort at each End, and a Platform in the
Middle; which makes it of Strength sufficient to
oppose a royal Navy : 'Tis a neat large Town,
with two Churches, one with a handsome Organ :
For Largeness, I think this Town may compare
with our City of Salisbury, but better inhabited.
As for the other three, which are, l , Charles Town*
2. James's Town. 3. Little Bristol in Sprigs Bay,
I can give no Manner of Account of: But for my
Reader's Satisfaction, if he will consult Leon's
H'Jiory of Barbadoes, he may come to the bell Knowledge
of the whole Island. They are govern'd by
the same Laws as we in England. A Native of Barbadoes
told me, the whole Island contain'd at Least
12000 Inhabitants, Slaves included.

July the 20th, (after our Captain had left hisPaf-
fingers, and Part of his Cargo) we set Sail for Jamaica

make : Here you must Note, that from Barbadoes to
Jamaica, you always have the Wind in your Stern*
We passed Mariimco, Dominica, Guadalupe, and
Antigua, and the first of August anchor'd at Nevis,
where we had immediately the Friends of Mr. ,
Merchant, on Board us, to unlade the
Goods ; for they had heard of his Death, by a Vessel
from Barbadoes a Week before.

Mavis, or AV<wV, lies in seven Degrees, nineteen
Minutes ; it is six Leagues in Circumference:
There is but one Harbour in the whole island*
which some call Mavis Harbour, or Bath Bay, where
lies the Town, under the former Denomination*
It is pretty well secured with a Sort and Platform
of great Guns. I was inform'd by one of the Inhabitants,
that there is a Mineral Water, very good
to bathe in, which cures the same Distempers with
our Bail in Somerfetfoire.

The English fettled here Anno Dem* 1628, and
have increased from one hundred and forty, to five
thousand and upward. They send abroad as much
Sugar, Ginger, Cotton, and Tobacco, as any leland
of its Bigness in the Caribbees. They are very regular
in their Government here ; they neither allow
Drunkenness, nor Whoring, (I mean in common,
as in Barbadoes, Jamaica, &c.) Here 1 was first
saluted with a little Fly, calPd a Mujteto; and
tho' it is small, yet it has a devilish sharp Sting
with it. They get into our , Stockings, and are so
very troublesome to new Comers, that there's
Thirdly any Bearing of them. If you scratch the

Places .



Capt. Richard Falcons 17

Places stung by them till the Blood comes, it may
prove dangerous; I myself kept a sore Leg three
Months upon that Account. I was also in.forrn'd
there waa a Flea they call .Ckigos, which breed in
Muir, or Ashes ; and of all the Insects in the
Caribbees* this is the moll dangerous : they get
into the Nails of the Toes imperceptibly, and from
thence run over all the Body ; tho' they chiefly six
themselves in the Bottom of the Feet: Which occasions
an Itching, followed with Holes in the
Skin. They make Blisters as big as Peas in the
Flesh, where their young ones breeding, cause Ulcers

but to eat away the Parts affected with Aqua-forte
and burnt Alum. While we lay here, there was a
Sword-fish ran himself ashore, (which was supposed
to be done in eagerly chasing some other Fiih :) It
had no Scales, but a dusky Skin, and a white
Belly, rough like a Smith's File, a flat head, two
Sins on each Side, two on the Back, and one instead
of a Tail. It is a Fish of prodigious swiftness
: The Sword (which is fix'd in the Head) is
six, seven, and sometimes eight Feet long : Near
his Eyes are two Nostrils out of which he throws
the Water a great Height into the Air. This Fiih
often encounters with the Whale, and proves too
hard for him ; for with his Sword he rips up the
Whale. I bought one of these Swords of a poor
Inhabitant, for four Bottles of English Beer, (which
is a great Rarity with them) that he got in a Piece

getting out, was broke three Inches.

Next to Mesh 9 lies St. Cbripphtr'i (or, as we
generally call it St. Kit's) in seventeen Degrees,
and twenty-live Minutes, Northward of the equinoctial.
ft is twenty five Leagues in Circumference,
the Soil light and sandy, and produces Fruit
common with us in England. In the Middle of this
Island rises a high Mountain, from which run
Streams of fresh Water, that sometimes swell so
high with sudden Rains, that they drown all the
Country near them. This Island is inhabited by
both Englijb and French, who even in the Time of
War Jive very friendly together. There was formerly
discovered a Silver Mine here, which the
Englijb and French claim an equal Title to ; but neither
make any Use of it, by Reason of the Want of
Mi news. The Englijb Liberties are better peopled
than the French, but the French have more Conveniences,
and better fortify'd Places than the Evg/ijb. An
Englijb Fry ar belonging to the French Jesuits, (who
gave me this Description) told me that the French,
had built a Town, calPd Base Terre, (in a Harbour
of the same Name, and Chief in the Island) full as
big as Gravesend, with very handsome Houses, for
the Merchants, and Trades People, which are many ;
where there Jsalfo an Hospital to maintain their indigent
Sick, togetherwithahandfomeFree School, with
large Endowments, for the Children of the Island.
Bat what they mostly brag of is, their Cattle, which

high mountain, shadowed with great Trees. IntheWay
thither, stand the Houses of the Governor, and other



Officers, for more Security ; seated in a Walk of Orange
and Lemon Trees, from the Brow of the Sea
up to the Cattle; which is three Story high, built
with Freestone and Brick : The Halls and Chambers
are very lightsome and high, and the Walls are adorn'd
with Cedar; On the Top is a flat Terrace, which
yields a delightful Prospect all over the Country. The
Winds which blow from the Hills, so temper the
Heat, that it makes it more pleasant than any other
Island of the Caribbees. As to the Englijb Plantations,
they are not much inferior to the French, they
have six Churches, and two Chapels, for Divine Service.
This Island was planted jointly by Englijb and
French, in 1625. Captain Thomas Warner, for the English,
and one De/nambuc for the French. The Natives
made a vigorous Resistance, but to little Purpose. With
this Success they return'd back to their several Countries,
and went again and fettled there ; but the English
having more Supplies from London, daily increased
when on the contrary, the Merchants at Paris grew
weary, seeing no Return for all the Charges they
had been at. But whilst this Business seemed to goo



on with Success, an Accident happen'd, which ruin'd
all at o'rfce. The King of Spain set out a Fleet the
same Year, of thirty one Galloons, three Galleries,
and four Pinnaces, with four Thousand Men, tinder
the Command and Direction of Frederick de Toledo,
from Cadiz, Antonio, Nunncs, Patrick, and Francisco de
Almeida, Commander of twenty Galleys, from Port*

Resolution to drive the E?igliJ}y, French, and Dutch*
entirely out of the Amcri can] stands. Coming before
Mevis> they took nine English Vessels: After that they
fail'd to St. Christopher's, where Captain Dejnamhuc
(altho' not prepared for Defence, because their Fortifications
were not finished) drew all his Forces near
the Shore, to hinder their landing: Sut Captain
RoJJey, who commanded another Port, suffered them
to land without the least Resistance. Whereupon
young Dejnamhuc, Lieutenant of a Company under
RoJJey, sally's out, and fell valiantly on the first Company
of Spaniards, killing many of 'em, and put them
to the Rout ; but the Spaniards being seconded by another
Battalion, he was slain, after having made a
flout Refinance, and forsaken by all his Men. Rose,
upon this, abandons his Entrenchments, and flies to
the Hills, and high Grounds : Whereupon the Spaniards
became Mailers of the Forts, but durst not
follow RoJJey, for Fear of an Ambuscade; which Fear
prov'dtrue: For DcJnamLuc, undermining the Fort,
retir'd on board some Vessel prepar'd for that Purpose,
and made off. In the mean Time, the Powder taking
Fire, blew up the Fort, and six hundred Spaniards,
into the Air. The English relying upon the League
between Spain and England, made no Refinance, but
sent Agents to Toledo, scar. to put him in Mind of
the League between their Matters : To which he ,
That St. Christopher' } s , being Part of the Western
World, was given by the Pope to his Matter Philip.

Nevertheless



Capt. Richard Falconer. 21

Nevertheless he gave them six of the nine Vessels they
took at Bevis, to imbark themselves, on Condition
they would sail immediately for England; which
they agreed to; but the six Vessels not holding all, the
rest were left on the Island, for another Opportunity:
No sooner was Toledo out of Sight, but the remaining
Part of the English Inhabitants took fresh Courage,
and rebuilt several Sorts, and made every thing ready
for Defence, occasion should be. In the mean
Time Dejnambuc suffered a great Deal of Hardship,
through ill Weather, and Want of Provision ; having
been at several Islands, intending to settle, with
his little Company, but not liking any of them, and
hearing that the Enemy were gone to the Havana*
and the English were busy tilling their Ground, he
return'd to his former Stations, where they suffered
many Hardships ; till some Vessels from the Netherlands
arrived, and furnished them with Pro villous,
Ammunition, and Cloaths, upon Credit : But in a
few Years they paid all, and grew rich, from their
plentiful Stock of Tobacco, Sugars, Going-er, and
Indico, till they brought it to the rich and flourishing
State it now remains in.

Having ended our Affairs, west Sail for Jamaica*
the 2 1 ft of JuguJ? 9 1699 ; and, on the 7 th of September,
anchor'd safe in Port Royal Harbour, in the
great and flourishing Island of Jamaica, without any

were to unlade the remaining Part of our Goods,
and take in its Return, Rum, Sugar, and Spice.

This Island of Jamaica is the only Mart of all
America for the Englijb, who drive a large Trade
here ; but Wickedness is in its full Perfection ; I remember
Captain Was alk'd one of our Men, that
had fpentfome Money ashore, what was his Opinion
of the Honesty of the Women of Port Royal? Why
truly, says Tar % very bluntly, if there's one honest
Woman Should happen to tumble down, I believe
there's never another to take her up* Provision is
prodigious dear here ; two or three of us went on
Shore to Dinner, one Day, at Port Royal, where we
had only a roasted Turkey, wretchedly lean, and nothing
nigh powell tailed as our Englijb Turkeys, and
our Eating came to thirty Shillings; but thereto-make
amends, Money, is plenty enough: We had a
Sailor on Board, that had been a Taylor by Trade;
this Fellow got Leave of the Captain to go on
Shore for a Month, where he clear'd, by working
Journey-Work, twelve Pounds for that Month ;
But then he had the Flip's Provision carry 'd on
Shore to him two or three times a Week ; had he
been to have paid for his Diet, he had saved but a
small Matter. I was mightily surprized to see a
Market for Turtle, in the same Manner as our
Butchers. This is a Meat, or rather Fish, of an
odd Nature, but of an excellent Taste ; the
Lean looks like the Flem of Pork, but something
of a deeper red ; the Fat is a Sort of a
light green, but very luscious ; this is the common
Diet of the Slaves, or meaner Sort of People!
but if Strangers eat too much of it, it is

apt to give them the Bloody-flux, This is a very
reigning Distemper here, and carries off Abundance

of new Comers. The Island of Jamaica lies — -

Leagues North from the Southern Continent of America*
in the Sea calPd Mare del Nor; and South from
the Isle of Cuba, about twelve Leagues ; and
twenty West from Hispaniola* in eighteen Degrees
Northern Latitude ; and beareth from Rio de Hack,
North West* an hundred and fifty Leagues ; from
Santa Martha* N. N. W. an hundred and thirty five;
from Cartagena* N. an hundred and fourteen ;
from Portohcllo* N. E. and by jV. an hundred and
ninety ; from the Isthmus of Darien* N and by E* an
hundred and seventy ; and from the Bay of Mexico,
an hundred and fifty. Its Form is almost oval; being
in Length, from East to West* about fifty four
Leagues ; from North to South* in the broadest Part,
twenty three Leagues, growing narrower toward each
End, like a Rowling. Pin, (a good Comparison.) In
Circumference, one hundred and fifty Leagues. The
Air of this Island is more temperate, and the Heat
more tolerable, than any of the other Islands, reason
of the cool Breezes which constantly blow from
the East* with frequent Showers of Rain, and Dews
that fall in the Night. These Dews are very pernicious
to careless drunken People, that lie expos'd all
Night to them. This is also the only Isle of the Bar-loveth*
which is not subject to violent Storms, and
Hurricanes, as the other Islands are. And the Diseases
that are predominant here, are only bred by Intemperance
; as Surfeits, Bloody-flux, Fevers, and

Agues ;

Agues ; or occasioned by ill Diet, or Slothfulnefe.
This Island is well water'd with Springs and Rivulets
of fresh Water, (with many handsome Rivers stored
with several Sorts of Fish ;) and is all over (especially
in the Wester Parts) full of high Mountains
and Hills : It is also well wooded ; for the North and
south Parts chiefly abound with large and tall
Woods. Neither are there wanting Savant's, or
Plains. The Commodities of this Island are very
many ; and first, for Vegetables ; the Sugars are so
good, that they now out fell those of Barbadoes 5/.
per Cent. Tobacco is so excellent, that it is bought
up faster than the Planters can cure it: The Indigo
is also here very good : The Cotton is much
the best of all the neighbouring Islands. Tortoiseshell
is very plenty here. Here are also great
Variety of Dyewood, as Fifties, Red-wood, a kind
of Log-nvood, Cedar, Mahogany, Lignum vi/sir, Ebony,
Canaille, and many others. Nay, there are many
Mines, both of Silver, Copper, and Gold; but that
the Inhabitants think it would be dangerous to break
them up, for fear of drawing the Spanish and French
Buccaneers upon 'em. There are several Fishermen
who have found Pieces of Ambergrease upon the Surface
of the Water, near the Shore Ginger grows
better here than in any other Part of America, and
Cod-pepper very plentifully: And also, a certain Kind
of Spice call'd, Piece, in Form of Earl-India Pepper,
of a very aromatical and curious Taste, partaking,
as it were, of several Spices together: It
grows wild among the Mountains, and is highly

The ingenious Sir Hans Sloan has wrote an
elaborate Book of the Plants of this Island* Cochineal
is product by a Plant that grows in. this
Country, but not brought to Perfection, without
much Care and Industry. This Island is also very
well stocked with Cattle, as Horses, Cows, and Asses
; there have been many Mules, but the Inhabitants
made so little Use of 'cm, that now there are
but few. Sheep are large and tall, and their Meat
indifferently good, but their Fleece worth nothing.
Goats (or Captivates) are without Number, being a
Beast. peculiar to the Country. Hogs, both wild
and tame in Abundance. I have been hunting the
wild fog in Porto Movant Bay, and it gives good
Diversion, tho' sometimes dangerous : You go Auth.
some Ten or a Dozen in Company, arm'd with a
Musket and a Cutlass; as soon as ever (with your
Dogs) you have found 'em out, you all take Aim,
and fire as quick as you can, but if you don't kill
them immediately with your Shot, they set upon
you open-mouth'd, so that you must either hew
'em down with your Cutlasses, 6r club your Muskets.
Generally as soon as you have 'em, you slay
'em, as you do Mutton, and J Bariicue' f em, even in
the very Place where you kill 'em ; that is, you dig
a square Hole in the Earth, then clap four Stakes at

each Corner and on 'em put your Meat, so make a
Fire under it, and when one Side is done enough,
you turn the other. For tame Fowls, they have of
all the Kinds that we have in England; besides Guinea
Hens, Parrot h Paraclete, Machmvs, and Boobies,
(which are Boobies* indeed, for they will sit upon a
Tree, or Post, till you come and take 'em.) They
have three Crops a Year, in this Island, and the
Trees are always green. They have three Sorts of
Bread, one of EngUJh Corn, another of Guinea
Wheat, and the third of a Root they call Cafa<vi>
which is rank Poison, till pressed and bak'd in an
Oven; 'tis very white, hut tasteless, and the Bread
made of it, the Size of our thin Oat-cakes. But
of all the Fruit this Island produces, the Pine Apple
is the best, which grows very low, with Leaves
something like the Indices Fiats that I have seen in
hardens here in England ; the Table is so excellent,
that I know not what to compare it to, it having
the Relish of all fine-favoured Fruits. There's a
Fruit that grows upon a low Bull, call'd the
Prickle-pear, the Inside of which is red, and on
the Top is a little thorny Thing like a Star, which
if you do not take away before you eat it, may
prove pernicious. If you eat but two of this
Fruit, it will make your Urine as red as Blood.
Plantains are very good Fruit, which is, when
bak'd in the Ames, used by the Slaves instead of
Bread: 'Tis a Fruit with a Skin on it, like our
Beans, which is taken, off, and then the Fruit appears,
about the Size of a Bologna Sausage. banana*

manus is another Fruit something of the same Kind,
but (porter, and more luscious : Both these Fruits
are ripe all the Year, for when same are lit to
gather, others are green, and some in Bud, The
Oranges and Lemons, are neither of 'em good, in
my Opinion : But their Limes arc wonderful ; they
grow upon a Tree full of Thorns, where you must
be sure to prick your Fingers, if you'll gather 'em,
These, with Spring Water and Sugar, was the chief
of my Liquor, while we staid there. The Potatoes
are very fine here, exceeding, in my Opinion, even
those of Ireland. Then there's another Root call'd
Yams, something like a Jerusalem Artichoke, butlers
and stringy. The Onions of Jamaica are much
milder and better tasted that our Englijb Onions, and
very wholesome : they used to make a great Addition
to our Crick Brewis ; that is, Bifket soaked in
fair Water, for some Time, then the Water thrown
away, and the Bifket strewed over with Salt, Oil,
and Lime-juice, together with Onions ; and so eaten
as a dainty Dii. There is a sensitive Plant in this
Island; the Stalk, surrounded with Leaves full of dark
red Spots, bears a sweet smelling violet colour'd
Flower ; the Leaves, as soon as touch'd, close up together,
and die ; and accordingly as they are held ia
the Hand a shorter or longer Time, this Alteration
continues. Ginger grows plentiful here ; the Male
Plant(for there are Sexes)hath generallybiggerLeaves
than the Female : The Stalks, which are without
Knots, have more Leaves upwards than downwards,
and spreads along the Earth, still taking Root anew.

When the Leaves wither, then the Ginger is commonly
ripe, butithas not that Poignancy whilst green,
as when dry'd. The Cotton of this Place (of which
the Cloaths and Hammocks are made, and vended in
mod Parts of the Western World) grows on a Tree
about the Height of a Peach-Tree, with a strait Stem,
or Body, out of which shoot Boughs of an equal
Length, and at equal Distances: Between the Leaves,
which are narrow and long, grow red Flowers, and
from 'em, oval Cods, which, when ripe, inclofethe
Cotton, and a Seed like Pepper. Of hurtful Creatures,
there is the Crocodile, or Alligator •, which infests
many Rivers and Ponds ; this is a Creature of a
monstrous Size; I have seen one twenty-fix Feet long;
it moves swiftly and strongly forward, but turns
slow - r they are impenetrable every where but in the
Eye, or Belly ; they have four Feet, or Sins, with
which they go, or swim ; their usual Course of getting
their Food is to lie on their Backs as dead, then
with a sudden Onset they spring upon their Prey,
whether Man or Beast : But 'tis easily avoided by a
Man, by Reason of an aromatic Smell that comes
from the Body, which may be smelt five hundred
Yards ; but if a Man has got a Cold, and can't smell,
if he has Eyes they are easily avoided ; for if they
run right forward, it is but shipping on one Side, for
they are as long in turning as a Coach. The Oil that's
made from these Creatures, is good for several Distempers.
They Jay their Eggs (about the Size of a
Turkey's) and cover 'em with Sand, which heated
by the Beams of the Sun, hatches the young ones,

who naturally creep into the Water. One of these
Creatures swam after us fifty Yards in Porto Movant
Bay, and rais'd his Head upon the Edge of our
Long-Boat, which was deeply laden with Calks of
Water; our Carpenter, who had been selling of
Timber to wood the Flip, struck him a very great
Blow on the Nose with his Hatchet, that I am sure

hurt him, for he gave a Sort of Shriek, which nos
. „ fl .,«.u-oi^Jwoici were

ooierv'd him to run his Head into the Mud, as if
it pain'd him, which makes me think that their
Heads are not invulnerable, as is reported* The
Guiana is another Creature amphibious as the Alligator,
but nothing nigh so large: There's an Island
near Jamaica, call'd Guiana Island, inhabited by nothing
elfe; our Seamen eat these latter, but much
Good may it do 'em, for their £leah look* like a
Piece of a Black a- moor' % Arm ; but how it tastes I
can't tell, neither do I ever design to try. The Cocoa
Nut is a Fruit that is both Meat, Drink and
Cloathing to the Natives (1 mean the Blacks): the
Rind serves for weaving of Cloaths, nay and rigging
their Canoes, before they knew the Europeans ; and
when you have taken off the Bark, you mull be beholden
to a Saw to cut off the Monkey's Face, which
is the Top, with three Marks that make it something
resemble that Animal; then the Seaside contains,
fir ft a liquid Substance, like Whey, but very

the Nut is a Substance a Quarter of an Inch thick,
which you cut out, and that's the Meat, which is

Thing that's very remarkable, and that is the Ph?~

one or two of 'em will do your Business, upwards or

Now finding our Affairs would detain us half a
Year longer, J got Leave of the Captain to go in a
Sloop, with some of my Acquaintance, to get Logwood,
and on September the 25th we set Sail for the
Bay of Campecbe, with a fair Wind. The old Manner
of getting this Wood is as follows ; a . Company
of desperate Fellows get together in a Sloop,
well armed, and land by Stealth, but in Case of
any Refinance, the whole Crew attends on the
Cutters, ready armed to defend them ; indeed there's
a Colony of Englijb that fell this Logwood, but
many chuse the other Way ; all this was strange tome,
for I knew nothing of the Matter, till we
were out at Sea. There was one Fellow there that
told me, that about ten Years before he went with
a Vessel, and they took the same Method as usual,
in getting it, and landed all their Men but six,
that icy left on Board to look after the Vessel ; in
the mean Time the Spaniards having Intelligence of
their Descent, sent a hundred Men in several Canoes,
to seize their Vessel ; which accordingly
they did, without any Resistance from the six Menon
Board. After they had clapped these Men
under Hatches, they searched and ransacked the
Vessel, sending every Thing on Shore that was of
any Value ; then they prepared to trepan the Crew,,
as they came on Board, which happened the very
next Night, when some of the Men coming oti
Board with a Load of Logwood, the Spaniards

C 5 caused



34 ¥be Adventures cf

caused the six Men to stand upon Deck, and on
Pain of Death, not to discover the Truth of the
Matter, which happened as they desired, for the
Men coming on Board carelessly without their Arms,
were all seized immediately and clapped in Irons.
The rest that were on Shore, wondering at the Stay
of the Boat, sent a Canoe with six Men, to know
the Reason of their Delay, which were likewise
taken in the same Trap with the former. The
Man that told me this Story, was one of these hall
six, who found Means secretly in the Middle of the
Night to flip into the Water, and swim ashore,
tho* half a League off, where he happily inform'd
the rest of the Crew (which were forty three) of
the Misfortune that had happened to the rest of
their Companions : Whereupon they consulted what
they had best to do ; when it was unanimously
agreed, to seize upon three large Canoes, that lay
at the Bottom of the Bay, that belonged to som e
French Hunters that were on Shore ; which was done
accordingly : On Board they immediately got, well
armed, and steered away for their Sloop : But as
they designed to trick them the same Way as the
others had done their Companions, they consulted
what to do if they should be discovered before they
could get on Board, which was probable enough.
At length it was agreed to carry on the Plot in
order to deceive them, and as soon as ever they
could get over the Flip's Side, to assault the Enemy
with all the Vigour imaginable, appointing
two or three to release their Companions, and put

Arms



Capt. Richard Falconer. 35
Arms into their Hands, to be assistant in recovering
their Liberties. Every Thing happened as was
suggested, for when they came within half a
Furlong of the Vessel, .they were hail'd by some of
their own Men, as it is usual in such Cases ; which
was answered by them in the Canoes, with swearing
and cursing at 'em., for not coming ashore with
their Long-boat, as ordered, buttoforce 'em to bring
their Wood aboard in Canoes. They asked from on
Board, how many were come with them ? All (an
swerved they in the Boat) but three, that we left A-
shore to look after our Arms, and a small Remainder
of Logwood, which you must go and fetch
immediately with the Long-boat, (which they pretended
could not go to them before, by Reason Ihe
had a Hole broke in her Bow, against a Piece of
Rock, that gave them a great deal of Trouble in
getting her to the Vessel.) Our People smiled to
themselves to hear they had got their Lesson so
ready. In asking and answering these Questions
they had reached the Vessel, and getting nimbly up
the Side, they drew from under their Watch* Coats,
their Pistols and Cutlasses, and first fired upon the
Spaniards, who were running to seize them, 'half

whose Office it was to release tie. Prisoners under
Hatches, did it immediately, by killing the two
Sentinels that watched over them ; and then coming
up with this fresh* Recruit soon overcame the
Spaniards* and make them call for Quarter : Which
was not granted till they had thrown down their

Arms. When they had surrendered, they chained
them ^11 under Hatches; and To the Conquerors
became Prisoners and the Prisoners Conquerors.
After the Action \v*as over, they looked after the
Dead, which was faun d to-be'nifce Spaniards and
fine Englishman, who was supposed to be killed by
otfr own Men, in the first Fire.

r Vp(5n this good Success, they having Ncrcice that
there lay a rich Flip in theOBarbfcur before the Town
of Cdmpeche, they resolved to try rheirgoodi Fortune
farther, which they contrived as follows : They hoisted
tyanijh Colours, and sailed away immediately for
the Port of Campeehe*, where they arrived by next
Morning, saluted-the'Caftle and Town with seven
Guns, as Friends, and were paid back the Complement.
The Shore was filled with Numbers of People,
to see the Englishmen brought ashore Prisoners ; but
they were mistaken. The Flip which they had aden
layabout a 'League from the Town, as having
arrived but two Days before, but was to put
farther in that very Evening, before the Sea-breeze
failed ; our Men boarded her on the Starboard Side,
which lay from the Town, and took her, without
firing a Gun, cut hercules, and made out to Sea,
before the Town knew what was the Matter: But
-as soon as ever theyfmelt the Trick, Q>>$p&n*/h Man
of War of thirty Guns (being all that was in the
Harbour) flipped hrenCables, arid crouiisd all the Sail
me could, to come up with 4s ; we finding Ore gained
upon us, called* a .Council, and at lait resolved
to bring up moftx&four Spanish Prisoners* bound, and
expose them to the whole v Fire of the Enemy.

Which succeeded accordingly, for the Flip coming
close pro us without any firing on either Side, commanded
us to strike. Upon that we ordered the
Spatula Captain to lay before them the Condition;
which profited little at first, but after many Intreaties
from them, and Threatnings from us, the
others were prevailed upon to steer off, and make
towards the Town) while we made rhe.beft of our
Way. But the Spaniards making up to the Town
again, was met by several armed Boats, with the
Governor himself in one of them, who gave a strict
Command not to regard any Thing, but use a 14
possible Means to retake the Flip, and the Pyrates
(as they termed us.) When we perceived the Boats
making up to the Flip, and observed her tack about
to give us Ch-ace, we guessed at the Matter, and
finding (he gained upon us, we put ourselves into a
Posture of Defence, and proposed to engage her in
the Prize we took last, which carried 20 Guns; We
mustered our Men, and found we had 71, but then
we had 200 Spanijb Prisoners, who, we feared, if by
any Accident theyfhould get loose, might prove our
Ruin; whereupon a ; Confutation-was immediately
held to put molt of them to Death. Upon which
the Captain of the first Prize stood up, and said (in
-pretty good EngliJbJ Gentlemen, you have taken us
fairly, and done no more than we ourselves did to
you; now seeing that Flip which pursues ys, and
gains upon us every .Moment, is coming in order to
£git you, we shall run a more certain Danger by

Jure of their - Cannon, as you did before; and if they

do really Fire, I may as well take them for an Ene .
my, as you, since we are sure to receive the mod
Damage. But to make the Matter short, being the
Time is so, I propose to you that if the Vessel fires
at you, we may reasonably conclude, they have no
Manner of Regard for us, so we shall not have any for
them, and, if you'll give us that Liberty, we will
freely fight under your Command, and endeavour,
as far as in us lies, to defend your Vessel, as much
as if it was our own. This Speech of the Captain's
was approved of by the rest of the Prisoners ;
so that at last we agreed to set sixty of them at
Liberty, and the rest fast bound under Hatches,
where we put two Sentinels, with two Pater-heroes
fixed, charged with small Shot, with Orders
that if there seemed to be any Thing like Disturbance,
to lire in upon them. The sixty we chose
out to be assistant to us, were ordered to the great
Guns, so that we still had the Command over them,
because they had no Arms. After we had fettled
every Thing, we lay by, (seeing it impossible to escape
without fighting) in order for their coming upto
us, which they did in a short Time, and coming
within Hail, they ordered us to strike immediately,
and make no Resistance, or elfe they would. have
no Regard to their Friends on Board our Flip, but
fink or take us, and put every Man of us to Death.
Upon which the Spanifh Captain that was our Prisoner,
made Answer, That if they offered to rire a
Gun, every Spaniard on Board resolved to fight against
them as Enemies : Which was answered, They must
obey the Governor's Orders, who had just left them,

and was returned on Shore. Upon this they fired a
Broadside upon us, but we returned it immediately
with our small Arms, and great Guns, which were
well plyed by our Spanish Prisoners. The Fight continued
half an Hour with all the Fierceness imaginable;
at last the Spaniard prepared to board us with
his Boats at the same Time, but were received so
briskly, and so damaged by our Hand-grandees,
that they were obliged to make to the Flip with
great Loss. The Hand-grandees, flood us in great
Stead, for we dispatched three or four of cur Men
into the Main-Top, who from thence discharged
several Grandees, that by their own Report killed
and wounded above thirty Men. They attempted
to board us once again, and came on briskly with
firing and loud Shouts, to terrify us ; but we returned
them their Shouts and Firing with Interest, for
with a lucky Shot we drove away their Main-Mart,
which put them into strange Confufion : This Accident
(if we could have laid hold on't) might have
given us an Opportunity of out-failing them; but
that was not once thought of, for Desire of Revenge
made us fight like Furies. The next Broadside we
gave them, Struck away their Rudder, which rendered
them incapable of steering their Vessel, or
tacking about : Upon which we perceiving what had
happened, tacked about, and with a Broadside that
raking her fore and aft, killed them, by their own
Confession, sixteen Men, for it split two of their
Guns, whose Splinters aid mod of the Execution.

Stern, and fire into them, so that every Shot goes
from one End of the Flip to the other, instead of
going across, so that of Consequence one Shot that
Way will do more Damage than ten directly Side
to Side. The Heat of the Spaniard now began to
abate, but yet Ire honored as much as ever; at last
a lucky Shot entered her Powder Room, and blew
up her Main-deck, with several Spaniards, into the
Air; upon which were heard such Groans and Yelling,
from wounded and dying Men, that were
enough to frighten Men less inured to such Encounters
: With this Success we prepared, in the Confusion,
to board them in our Turn, but was prevented,
by seeing their Vessel finking ; whereupon they
liruck down their Colours, and asked for Quarter
and Help ; understanding their Distress, we immediately
gave them Assistance, by putting out our
Boats, and saved all the Men they had left, which
were ninety-five, out of four hundred and odd.

This Success flushed us mightily with Hopes of
succeeding in any Enterprize, We lost out of our
Spaniards twenty-fix, and os Eriglijb nine killed, and
two wounded, who died the next Day. The Spaniards
were of signal Service to us, and fought bravely, even
to Desperation ; well knowing, if they should betaken
(after fighting on our Side) they must all inevitably
suffer Death : which proved happy for us ;
for it had been impossible to have escaped them, even
if all the Spaniards on Board us had Hood neuter.



After



Capt. Richard Falconer, 41

After we'had cleared our Vessel of the Blood and
dead Men and refreshed ourselves, we called up oar
Spanish Prisoners, that they might re r re(h themselves
likewise, and returned the others (who had fought
so bravely in Our Defence) our hearty Thanks ; and
the Spanish Captain expressed himself so handsomely,
that our Matter freely offered hist our Sloop, victualled
and ready fitted Up, to do what he thought fit
"with. Upon this kind Offer the Captain smiled,
and told him he would not take it without buying:
And as for Money, I have not a single Dollar, ()
but if you'll listen to a Stratagem 'of mine,
I'll engage to farnjfh you with Money for your Vessel,
and something over and above. With that he
proposed to take six of the Spaniards that had fought
for-us, and in our Long-Boat to go on Shore to the
Governor, and demand a Ransom for the Prisoner
we had taken; which was agreed to: Accordingly
they vent ashore, and told the Governor, If he did
not immediately send fifty Dollars a Man for two
hundred and twenty, they would be every Soul tied
Back to Back, and thrown into the Sea. Upon
which there was a Gathering made through the
Town, and the Money raised immediately, and in
twelve Hours the Captain returned with irooo
Dollars, gave our Captain 5000, distributed 3000
among the Sailors, • and kept the rest for himself.
The next Day we set the Spaniards that were saved.
from the Man of War on Shore, and as many more
that were willing, out of the other Flip, and of our
own Sloop ; so that Captain Fernando, our friendly

took his Leave of us, with eighty of his Countrymen,
with Intention for the South Sea ; and we leered our
Course, in our rich Prize, for Jamaica, where we
shared it : Every common Sailor had to his Share
£00/. Moreover the Captain ordered me in particular
200/. more, for the Service I did in swimming
ashore unperceived, to give them Notice.

After ending his Story, I asked him how he had
improved his Money from that Time ? Pshaw (said
he) that, and fwe Times as much, is gone since
then. And this is no Wonder, for Sailors are' such -
Fools, that (what they get with the utmost Danger,

or, (if you'll grant me to make a Simile) like a
poor Debtor that deals out of his Lurking-place,
when the blustering Bailiffs are gone out of Sight.
About six in the Evening, we saw a Water-Spout :
this is an aerial Engine, or Limber, that draws
up the fait Water of the Sea, and distills it into
fresh Showers of Rain : This Cloud comes down in
Form of a Pipe of Lead of a vast Thickness, and by
the Force of the Sun sucks up a great Quantity of
Water. I stood an Hour to observe it ; after it had
continued about half an Hour in the Water, it Are**
up insensibly, by Degrees, till ~" ll in the
Clouds; but in tH* ^«ng of the same, it (hut out
some ^ ene Water, which fell into the Sea-again,
with a Noise like that of Thunder, and occasioned
a Smoke in the Water that lasted for a confiderable
Time The Sailors informed me, that these waterspouts
sometimes did great Damage to Ships that by
Calms were too near them when' they fell. One
Fellow told .me, tHat he saw a Bark of sixty Tons
sucked out of the Sea by one of them, which caused
the Breaking of the Spout, and sunk the Vessel
with the Fall of the Waters, In the Straights when
Ships approach these airy Engines, they fire off a
Gun, and that breaks them before they come too
near. The Person told me that at the Fall of the
Water, the Sea was curled as much as if you had
thrown a large Stone into a (landing Pond of Water.
We have sometimes at a Distance seen fourteen ox
fifteen at a Time at Work, but I never saw one so
large as this.

In the Evening we caught a small Shark, with
two sucking Fillies that stuck close to her till laid
on the Deck, and then dropped down of their own
Accord. This is allowed the Remora of the Ancients.
It is about the Bigness of a Mackerel, with
a flat Head, and is of a grisly Substance. These
slick to the Sides of Vessels very frequently, and
sometimes swim upon the Surface of the Water, and
are even caught with a naked Hook. I have sometimes
seen these Fifties Ticking to a Log cf Wood,
in the Vater. When we hogged our Flip, (a Hog

is an Instrument of six Feet square, something like
a Harrow, and Stumps of old Brooms fixed close in
the middle Part ; this is put to the Bottom of the
Flip, with a Rope before and another aft, fixed
to the Capitan, which cleans the Vessel from all
Sorts of Filth) 1 have seen many of them in the Hog
together, with Barnacles and Oysters, and several
other Shell fi fh.

Oclokr the 6th, we anchored at Trial Island, in
the Bay of Campcachy y and sent our Men on Shore at
Logwood-creek, to seek for the Logwood-cutters,
who immediately came on Board. The Bargain was
soon struck, and in Exchange for our Rum and Sugar,
and a little Money, we got in our Lading in
eight Days, and set Sail for Jamaica the 15th Day
of October.

Coast being infected with Sharks, which often assault
People and bite off a Limb : But being there had not
been any seen that Day, I would venture, yet tied a
Rope about me, for Fear of any Accident that might
happen, or the Wind striking up of sudden. But I
had not been long in the Water, before they cried
from the Gunnel, A Shark ! But I thinking they
only bantered, as sometimes they do, when anyone
is in the Water, did not mind them, til! at
last they pulled me by main Force, up the Side of
the Flip ; when looking into the Water, I saw a
swinging large Shark, with his white Belly turned
up in order to bite at me. Upon which I
thanked God and good Friends that had prevented
him, by swiftly pulling me up ; though the
Rope had rubbed off the Skin, and some Part of
my Flefli, with the Force. Now a Shark cannot
get his Prey, without first turning himself upon his
Back, because their upper Jaw is much larger and
longer than their under: Which often prevents Accidents.


I one Day went down into the Hold, to bottle
off a small Parcel of Wine that I had there, for Fear
it would four, and not being a very cleanly Place,
I was soon in a filthy Pickle : Coming upon Deck
again, I wanted to clean myself, but did not care
to go into the Water, as before, so went into the
Boat astern, that we hoisted overboard in the
Morning to look after a Wreck that we discovered
upon the Water : Being in the Boat, I began to
wash myself, and when I had dressed myself
again, I pulled a Book out of my Pocket, and

sate reading in the Boat ; when, before I was
aware, a Storm began to rise, so that 1 could not
get up the Flip's Side as usual, but called for
the Ladder of Ropes, that hangs over the Flip's
Quarter, in order to get up that Way ; but whether
it was not fattened above, or whether it broke thro*
Rottenness, as being seldom used, I cannot tell,
but down I fell into the Sea ; and though the Flip
(as they told me afterwards) tacked about to take
me up, if it was possible, yet I lost Sight of them,
through the Du/kinefsof the Evening, and the Storm
together. Now I had the most dismal Fears that
could ever possess any one in my Condition : I was
forced to drive with the Wind, which fate (by good
Fortune) with the Current, and having kept myklf
above Water, as near as J could guess in this
Fright, four Hours, 1 felt my Feet every now and
then touch Ground ; and at last, by a great Wave,
was thrown and left upon the Sand ; yet it being
dark, ' I knew not what to do; but 1 got up and
walked, as well as my tired Limbs would let me;
and every now and then was overtaken by the
Waves, but not high enough to warn me away.

When I had got far enough, as I thought, to be
out of Danger, 1 could not discover any Thing of
Land, and I immediately conjectured that it was
but some Bank of Sand, that the Sea would overflow
at high Tide : Whereupon I sate down to rest
my weary Limbs, and' sit myfe'lFfor Death, for that
was all I could expect, in my own Opinion. Then
all my Sins Came flying in my Face, which' I repented





48 The Adventures of

penned of with all the Sincerity imaginable : I offered
up my fervent Prayers to our Almighty Creator,
not for my Safety (because I did not expect any
such Thing) but for all my part Offences ; and I
may really say, I expected my Dissolution with a
Calmness that made me think I had made my Peace
with Heaven. At last I fellafleep, (tho' I tried all
I could against it, by rising up and walking, till I
was obliged thro' Weariness to lie down again.)
In the Morning when I awaked, 1 was amazed to
find myself among four or five very low sandy
Islands, but all separated half a Mile or more (as I
guessed) by the Sea. With that I began to be a
little chearful, and walked about to see if I could
find any thing that was eatable, but to my great
Grief I found nothing but a few Eggs, that I was
obliged to eat raw ; this laid my Condition before
my Eyes in a most horrid Manner, and the Fear of
starving seemed to me to be worse than that of
drowning; and oft did I with that the Sea had
swallowed me, rather than thrown me on this desolate
island ; for I could perceive by the Evenness
of them, that they were not inhabited either by
Man or Beast, or any Thing elfe but Rats, and
several Sorts of Fowl, ,

Upon this Island there were some few Bullies of a
Wood they called Barton Wood, which used to be
my Shelter at Night; but to compleat my Misery,
there was not to be found one^Drop of fresh Water on
the Island ; so that I was forced to drink my own
Urine for two or ths ee Days together 5 which made

my



Capt. Richard Falcon £R. 49

Hiy Skin come off like the Peel of a boiled Codlin.
At last my Misery so increased, that I was often in
the Mind to put an End to my wretched Life, but
desisted, on the Opinion that I had of some Alligator,
or other voracious Creature, coming to do it
for me. Strange Circumstances indeed ! to wish to
be devoured alive as the lesser Misfortune.

I had lived a Week here upon Eggs only, when,
by good Fortune, upon a Bum I discovered a Book?
sitting. I ran immediately, as fast as I could, and
with a Stick knocked him down : I never con filtered
whether it was proper to eat or no, but I sucked
the Blood,. and eac the Flesh, with-such a Pleasure
as none can express, but them that have felt the
Pain of Hunger to the same Degree as myself
After 1 had devoured this Banquet, I walked about,
and discovered many more of these Birds, which I
flew.

Now my Stomach being pretty well appeased, I
began to consider whether I could not, with two
Sticks, make a Fire, as I had seen Blacks in Jamaica :
1 tried with all the Wood I could get, and at laflr
happily did it. This done, I gathered some more
Sticks, and made a Fire, picked several of my
Boobies, and broiled them as well as I could ; and
now I resolved £0 come to an Allowance. This
Bird is a Water Fowl, about the Bigness of a large
Crow, of a grey Colour ; it has a long firing Bill,
and Feet like a Duck, and its Flesh seemed to me
to taste something like a Duck's, but stronger, and

a little fifty : And it is such a Booby, that it will
not get out of your Way without beating.

At Night I and the rest of my Fellow-Inhabitants
had a great Storm of Rain and Thunder, with the
reddens Lightning I had ever seen, which well washed
us all, 1 belief 5; as for myself, my Cloaths (which
were only a Pair of thin Shoes and Thread Stockings,
and a Cotton Waistcoat and Breeches) were
soundly Wet; but I had this Happiness, to find in
the Morning several Cavities of Rain Water, which
£ut in my Head a Thought of making a deep Well,
or hollow Place, that Might have Water continually
by she, Which ! brought to Perfection in this
Manner : I took a Piece of Wood I found on the
Island, and pitched upon a Place under a Burton
Tree, where with my Hands and the Stick together,
I dug a Hole, or Well, big enough to contain a
Hogshead of v\ ater, then put in Stones and paved
it, and got in and stamped them down hard all
round, and with my Sticks beat the Sides close, ib
that I made it capable of holding Water for a Song
Time.

But now the Difficulty was, how to get the Water
there, which at last I contrived very well, for with
my Shirt I effected it, by soaking it in Water for
some Time, and then afterwards it would bear it
very well ; so with this Holland Bucket I could
carry two Gallons of Water at Time, which would
not leak out above a Pint, in two hundred Wards ;
so in two Days Time I had filled my Weil.

Now



Capt. Richard Falcon £ r. 51

Now I began to think of Life again for a while,
for I had ready broiled forty of these Boobies > deigning
to allow myself half a one a Day. J also
made myself a Cupboard of Earth, by mixing Water
with it, which was four Feet in Length, three in
Height, and two in Breadth, though it lasted but
four Days, the Sun drying it so fast, that it cracked,
and afterwards fell in Pieces. What most amazed
me, and pleased me together, was, that my Boobies
continued sweet without the leal Taint. I had a
small Ovid printed by Elzevir, which I had by
good Fortune put in my Breeches Pocket, when I
was going up the Ladder of Ropes, and by being
pressed close was not quite spoiled, but only the
Cover off, and stained a little with the Wet. This
was a great Mitigation of my Misfortunes, for I
could entertain myself in this Book, under a Burton
Bush, till I fell asleep. I remained always in good
Health, only a little troubled with the Head-each,
for want of a Hat, which 1 lost in the Water, in
falling down from the Ladder of Ropes. But I remedied
this as well as I could, by gathering a Parcel
of Chicken Weed (which grows there in Plenty)
and strewing it over the Burton Bushes, under which
I sate. Nay, at last, finding my Time might be
longer there than I expected, I tore off one of the
Sleeves of my Shirt, and lined a Wooden Cap that
I had made of green Sprigs, and twisted with the
green Bark that I peeled off, so that if I had been
seen in this Figure, I should have appeared like

T>z a Mad.



S 2 The Adventures of

a Madman, with the Basket of a Cudgel upon his
Head.

One Day coming from warning myself (which
I used often to do to cool me) I heard a flouncing in
the Water, and turning my Head, to see from
whence the Noise came, I saw the oddest Fish, I
believe, that ever was known. It had (as I suppose)
chased some other Fish very eagerly, and run
itself too far on the Sand, and the Tide being almost
at the lowed, it had left it there. It was (as
near as I could guess) about fifteen Feet long; it
had a Head like a House, and out of the Mouth
came two Horns curled like a Ram's Horn, only
twice as large ; it had but one Eye, and that was at
the Extremity of the Nose ; it seemed, as it
Flounced, to be some thing of a changeable Discolour,
with a Tail that tapered to the End in a
sharp Point: It looked so terrible to me, that I was
afraid to approach it; as it laboured it seemed to
groan ; it lay in this Hole of Water half an Hour,
with its Body in, and its Tail out ; and as soon as
the Tide came up to it, it naked its Tail to and
fro, as a Dog does when he seems pleased, all the
while it felt the Water ; it struggled but now and
then, and at last, when the Water was pretty high,
it turned its Head, and made a Noise something like
the Clucking of a Hen with Chickens, but louder;
and when, it had Water enough to swim away, it
Jay moving up and down a Quarter of an Hour, being
as I suppose hurt with its struggling. But when

it



Capt. Richard Falconer. 53
it had recovered kfe!f> (as I imagined) it gave a
Spring into deep Water, and I saw it no more. ^

I had been here now a Month by my Reckoning,
and in that Time my Skin looked as if it had been
rubbed over with Walnut-shells. I had a Mind
several Times to have swam to one of the other
Islands ; but as they looked only like Heaps of
Sand, I thought I had got the best Birth, so contented
myself with my own Station, Boobies I
could get enough (who built on the Ground) and
another Bird that lays the Eggs which I used to eat,
but I nev wwwed uj taste vhcm t though as their
x,ggs were good, we may suppose their Flesh was
so to : But however, I was so well satisfied with my
Boobies, that I did not care to try Experiments. t

This Island, which I was upon, seemed to me to
be about two Miles in Circumference, and was almost
round, and on the West Side there is a good
anchoring Place, for the Water is very deep, within
two Fathoms of the Shore. God forgive me, but I
often wished to have had Companions in my Misfortune,
and hoped every Day either to have seen
some Vessel come that Way, or a Wreck, where perhaps
I might have found some Necessaries which I
wanted: But I would often check myself in:thefe
Cogitations, as not becoming a Chnftiao, yet they
would as often awake in my Mind,* in spite of
all my Devotion and other good Thoughts ; it
being natural to desire Company. I used' to fancy,
that if 1 should be forced to Hay there long, I should
forget my Speech ; so I used* to talk aloud, ask

self Questions, and answer them ; but if any
Body had been by to have heard me, they would
-certainly have thought me bewitched, I used to ask
anyfelf such odd Questions. All this while I could
not inform myself where I was, or how near any inhabited
Place.

One Morning (which I took to be the 8 th of )
a violent Storm arose, which continued till
Noon ; when in the mean Time I observed a Bark labouring
with the Waves for several Hours, and at
lait with the Violence of the Tempest, was perfectly
thrown out of the Water upuu iK* CVcw. within
a quarter of a Mile from the Place where I observed
them. I rats to see if there was any Body I could be
assisting to, where I found four Men (being all that
were in theVeffel) busy about saving what they could
out of her: When I came up with them, and hailed
them in EngUJh, they seemed mightily surprized;
they asked me how I came there, and how long I
had been there ? When I told them my Story, they
were all mightily concerned for themselves, as well
as for me, for they found there was no Possibility of
getting their Bark off the Sands, being the Wind had
forced her so far ; With that we began to bemoan one
another's Misfortunes; but 1 mud confess to you,
without lying, I was never more rejoiced in my
whole wise ; for they had on Board Plenty of everything
for a Twelvemonth, and not any thing spoiled.

in their Lading they would have bulged in the Sands
half a quarter of a Mile from the Place where they
did, and the Sea flying over them, would not only
have spoiled their Provisions, but perhaps been the
Death of them all By these Men I understood
where we were, viz. upon one of the Isles of Mcraties^
which are live Islands, or rather large Banks of Sand - T
(for there is not a Tree, nor Bush upon any but that
where we were) they lie in the Latitude of Twenty-two
Degrees North, Twenty-five Leagues from Yucatan,
and about Sixty from Qampechy Town. We
worked as fall as we could, and got out every Thing
that would be useful to us before Night. We had
six Barrels of fait Beef, three of Pork, twoofPeafe,
and two of Flour, and eleven Barrels of Billet ; a
small Copper, and Iron Pot ; several wearing Cloaths,
and a spare Hat, which I wanted mightily; We
had besides several Kegs of Rum, and one of Brandy,
and a Chest of Sugar, with many other Things of
Use'; some Gun-Powder, and one Fowling Piece.
We took off the Sails from the Yards, and with some
Pieces of Timber erected a Tent big enough to hold
twenty Men, under which we put their Beds,
that we got from the Bark. It is true, we had no
Shelter from the Weather, for the Trees were so low
they were of no Use to us. I now 1 thought myself in a
Palace, and was as merry as if I had been at Jatnai-
ca or even at home in my own Country : I could joke
now and then, and tell a merry Tale. In short
when we had been there some Time, we began to be
very easy, and to wait contentedly, till Providence
Should fetch us out of this Island. The Bark lay

reason there were no more Beds ashore, than were for
ray four Companions, *vfe. Thomas Randal* of Cork
in Ireland, (whose Bed f was larger! , which he did me
the Favour to spare a Part of now and then, when
the Wind was high, and I did not care to lie on
Board) Richard. White* of Port Royal William Margrave,
of Kino-eton in Jamaica, and Ralph Middklon,
of Coqjoes in the Isle of Wight* These Men, with
Eight Others, set out of Port-royal about a Month
after us, bound for the same Place : But those others
lying ashore, and wandering coo far up in the Country,
were met, as it is supposed, by come Spaniards
and Indians, who set upon them : Yet by all Appearance
they fought desperately, for when Mr. Randal
and Mr. Middleton went to seek for them, he found
all the Eight dead, with fifteen Indians, and two
Spaniards', all the Englijhmen had several Cuts in
their Heads, Arms, Breasts, (Jc. that made it very
plainly appear they had sold their Lives dearly.
They were too far up in the Country, to bring down
their Dead ; so they were obliged to dig a Hole in
the Earth, and put them in as they lay in their
Cloaths. As for the Indians and Spaniards, they
stripped them, and left them above Ground as they
found them, and made all the Haste they could to
embark, for fear of any other unlucky Accident that
might happen. They set sail as soon as ever they
came on Board, and made the best of their Way for
Jamaica, till they were overtaken by the Storm that

ship wrecked them on Make Shift Island (as I had
named it.) When I told them of the strange Fish I
had seen, there was not any of them, but Mr. Margrave,
that had ever seen the like, and he told me
when he was a Prisoner in Mexico, he had seen one
there, and they called it the Ram Fib ; but he told
me, I was mistaken concerning the Eyes, for they
were on the Top of the Head, but very full, not
bigger than a Musket-Ball; and that which I took for
an Eye, was a Hole that they sometimes spouted
Water through. This that he saw at Mexico was
can led about for a Shew in a Cart, but it was but
eight Feet and a half in Length, and was by Order
of the Viceroy sent two Leagues into the Bay, to be
buried, for it slunk so intolerably they were afraid
it would breed an Infection.

Now we had all manner of Fishing-Tackle with
us, but we wanted a Boat to go a little Way from .
Shore to catch Fish, therefore we set our Wits to
work, in order to make some Manner of Engine,
and at last we pitched upon this odd Project. We
took six Calks, and tarred them all over, then
Hopped up the Bungs with Cork, and nailed them
close down with a Piece of tarred Canvas ; these
six Casks we tied together with some of the Cords of
the Vessel, and upon them we placed the Skittles
of the Deck, and fixed them, and made it so
strong, that two Men might easily set upon them ;
but for fear a Storm should happen, we tied to one
End of her a Coil or two of small Rope, of five
hundred Fathoms long, which. we fixed to a Stake

on the Shore ; then two of them went out, (as for
my Part, I was no Fisherman) in order to see what
Success they should have, but returned with only
one Nurse, a Fish so called, about two Feet long,
something like a Shark, only its Skin is very rough,
and, when dry, will do the same Office as a Seal-skin.
The same boiled in Lemon Juice, is the
only Remedy in the World for the Scurvy, by applying
some of the Skin to the Calves of your Legs,
and rubbing your Body with some of the Liquor,
once or twice. We sent out our Fishermen the
next Day again, and they returned with two old Wives
and a young Shark, about two Feet long; which we
dressed for Dinner, and they proved excellent
Eating. In the Morning following we killed a
young Seale, with our Fowling-piece, but first the
was so kind as to give me a Blow on the Forehead,
that cut the Skin, and bled very much, which was
done with her Sins, for as they run towards the
Water, they throw backwards the Gravel, as Horses
do when they gallop hard ; this we faired, and it
eat very well, after lying two or three Days in the
Brine.

We past our Time in this Makeshift Sand, (for we
had given it that Name) as well as we could ; we invented
several Games to divert ourselves ; OneJDay,
when we had been merry, Sorrow (as after Gaiety
often happens) stole insensibly on us all, I, as
being the youngest, began to reflect on my sad
Condition, in spending my Youth on a barren
Land, without Hopes of being ever redeemed.

Whereupon,



Capt. Richard Falconer, 59

Whereupon, Mr. Randal, being the eldest, rose up
and made the following Speech, as nigh as I can
remember.

Mr. Falconer, and my Fellow Sufferers; but it i$
to you, (pointing at me) that I chiefly address my
Speech, being you seem todefpairof a Redemption
from this Place, more than any other. Is not the
Providence of a Power Supreme shewn in every
Accident in the Life of Man ; even you yourself,
how much better is your Condition now, than you
could have imagined it would have been a Month
ago? There is a Virtue in manly Suffering, and to
repine seems to doubt of the All seeing Power,
which regulates our Onions. If you seem conscious
of your deferring (as a Punishment for any Crime
you have committed) what has happened to you,
why do you not with a contrite Heart lift up your
Voice to Heaven, and sincerely aft: Forgiveness of
all your past Offences, and that Way free yourself
of those gross Errors that are crept into your weak
Faith. Think you that the Divine Providence that
caff Jonas from the Bowels of the Whale, has not
the same Power still left, to aid and fefceh us from
this Place.

Here (pursued he) we have every thing that can
be required to satisfy Nature 5 we have Beds to lie
on, and a Covering from the Weather; we have
Provisions for a Twelvemonth, and if we Should
continue here a longer Time, we need not fear
starving, the very Island producing wherewithal to
support Nature, as Eggs and Fowls ; and tho' there,

is no Rivulet of fresh Water, yet it rains so frequently,
we need not fear even that, being we
have Vessels enough to save it in: You have the
least Reason to spurn at Providence of any one here,
that had only a Hole in the Earth to save your Water,
which had not !acted two Days longer, before
we (very happily for you) were thrown on Shore.
Is there not a Providence in being thrown on Land,
when you expected drowning before the Morning
dawned, which happened otherwise? Is there net
a Providence in getting Food, when you expected
to starve ? Is there not a Providence in getting Fire
by rubbing two Sticks, which you know you could
not effect since, though we have all endeavoured at
it? Was it not a Providence, that your Booths remained
sweeten till the Day that we came
here? * And was it not a Providence that we were
thrown here,' which brought sou all Sorts of provisions,
(I mean all that is necessary) with Flint
and Steel-i and other Utensils ? And can you then
doubt of a farther Providence, that have had all
these? Brutes, even Company is some Allay to
Sorrow J' yod' were alone before, and had only
yourself to talk to. Our Bark is strong and firm,
and by Degrees, I do not doubt but with Time
and much Labour to get her into the Water again.
I have been on Board her this Morning when you
were all asleep, and examined her carefully inside
and out, and fancy our Liberty may soon be effected;
I only wonder we have never thought before
of clearing the Sand from our Vcfiel, which

once done, 1 believe we may launch her out into
deep Water; we have all our Tackling, Sails, and
Mast?, entire, without Damage; I do not despair of
the Mercy of God in working our Deliverance,
whose Ways are past the Knowledge of us poor insignificant
Mortals, I myself have more than once
been in the same, or worse Condition.

In a Voyage I made twelve Years ago, I suffered
Shipwreck, and not one Person faved'but
myself : I sat out from the City of Cork in Ireland*
on Board a Bark bound for the Baltick ; we passed
the Straights of Eljenore and Hcljinburgh without
meeting any Thing material ; when one Evening it
began to thunder, lighten, and rain prodigiously ;
the Storm was so violent that we expected every
Moment when we should be drove on Shore on the
Coal of Sweddand or Norway, and be darned to
Pieces. The Storm continued so long, that all^our
Malls came by the Board, our Vessel sprung Leak,
and the Water gained upon us every Moment; at
last it overpowered us so much, that we left Pumping,
as believing it impossible to save ourselves,
and recommended our Souls to the Mercy of the
Lord. At last our Ship sunk downright, and moil
of our Men with it; but I and two more had the
good Fortune to lay hold of the Main-mast, (that
had been cut above Deck, being it was sprung
below, and thrown over board to prevent any Danger)
which was tangled in some of the Cordage ;
but the Flip finking downright, with the Rope that
was turned to the Main-mast, gave it such a Tug,
that pulled it under Water ; but afterwards looting

or shipping off by good Fortune, it rose with two
of us again, but the third was never seen after.
The other that saved himself upon the Mail, was
the Matter, a Man about sixty Years old, who held
pretty well for about an Hour, but at last through
Weakness and Age (recommending his Soul to God)
- fell off, but yet culled for Help, and I being willing
to give him what A Alliance I could, laid hold
of him, which I had no sooner done, but he grasped
at me, and laying fast hold of the Skirt of my
Waistcoat, (having never a Coat on) pulled me off
the Malt ; but with his Weight, and some Struggling
I made to save myself, my Skirt ripped off,
and the Matter sunk to the Bottom, and I by good
Fortune laid hold of the Rigging that hung to the
Mall ; so once more got on stride it, but with little
Hopes of Life; yet doing my Endeavour to save
myself, bat with a Resignation to the Will of Heaven,
At lad, after being tossed about for two or
three Hours more, the End of the Mast rustled with
fitch Violence against a Rock (as I supposed) that
with the Shock I was thrown off ; but laid hold of
some of the Cordage again, and held fall till it
fixed itself in some of the craggy Cliffs of the
Rock.

By this Time the Tempest was very much abated,
and the Waves not dashing so often, nor so fierce,
I found that the Mast hung on the craggy Cliffs of
the Rock, which I climbed up as fast I could, left
another Wave (hould dawn me against it, and beat
my Brains out. After I had got as high as 1 could,
and out of Danger of the Waves, I kneeled down

and



Capt. Richard Falconer. 63

and returned Thanks to the Almighty for my wonderful
Deliverance ; which was wonderful indeed !
For tho* the Mart beat so often against the Rock,
yet I escaped without being so much as bruised.
When I had poured out the Fulness of my Soul to
the All-feeing Power, that had protected me from
such an imminent Danger, I composed my self to
Sleep, but with a Calmness wonderful, (even to
myself) wonderful in every Circumstance, that the
Almighty Providence should chuse me out of thirty
poor Souls that perished in the stormy Deep, for a
Monument of his Mercy. 1 slept, but yet my
Dreams were troubled ; I thought in my Sleep, I
was cast on Shore upon a barren Rock, where there
was not a Creature but myself, no Food, nor any
Thing to sustain Nature; which proved too true.
I was awaked by something that licked my Face,
which in my Fright 1 laid hold on, but soon let it
go again upon finding it hairy, which startled roe
very much ; and tho* it was still dark, I could not
get to Sleep again for the Concern I was in, for
fear some devouring Creature should come and seize
me. I listened, and observed the Storm was laid,
and the Dawn approaching, I began to compose my
Mind, and put my Trust in him, that had hitherto
preserved me.

When it came to be light enough to perceive any
Object, I rose up and began to view the Place;
when, to my great Surprize, I found it to be only
a large Rock, about half a Mile in Circumference,
as near as I could guess ; but the north Part so inaccessible





64 The Adventures of

accessible, these was no getting to the Top of it:
Looking about me, I saw coming fawning towards
me a iar^e Bitch, which was the Creature that
awaked me by licking my Face. I mull confess I
was surprised and pleased, and made much of my
new Companion. I hoped from it I mould find
some human Creatures; but searching about, and
not meeting with any, I was more grieved than before
; yet still I resigned myself to the Will of him
that sees als Things, and knew it was in his Poli-er
to fetch me out of Darkness and the Shadow of
Death. In walking up and down, in a little Cavity
of the Rock, I met with seven young sucking Puppies,
that I found belonged to the Bitch my Companion,
for (he gave them suck, which I (layed a
little while to observe. Then a Thought came into
my Head, that this might be some Resort for Fishermen,
and I mould very (shortly see some that would
take me from this desolate Place.

I began to search about for something to sustain
Nature, but could find nothing but some Ptny-
*winkle, and other little Sheli-filh, which I ventured
to feed upon, for I now began to be very hungry.
I wondered mightily at my poor Bitch, how fhegoc
Food to support herself, and her seven young ones.
I observed she used to leave me two or three Times
a Day, but returned in a Quarter of an Hour. One
Day I had the Curiosity to watch her, but (he went
so fast, that I could not come up to her, but full
I followed, and at last came to the Point of a Rock
where Ihe went down, and looking below, saw her

feeding



Capt. Richard Falconer. 65

feeding upon a dead Seal \ but haw it came there I
could not suppose, neither could I go down the
Rock to see farther, it being so dangerous a Place :
When she had eat her fill, she came up again, and
went to give her young ones suck. I was mightily-put
to it for Water, though there were good Quantities
in several Cavities of the Rock, but so hard to
come at, that sometimes I ventured breaking my
Neck to get it; besides, I could not expect that
would always last, for the Sun was pretty warm,
though not intolerable. I had in my Pocket a Knife
and Fork and a Case of Lancets, but they were
rested by being wet, and of no Use to me, fori
could get nothing to exercise them on ; indeed my
Fork served me to twill out my Pen-twinkles*

1 had been here now fifteen Days, and nothing
to feed on but these Sort of Shell-fin ; yet still my
Strength and Health continued to a Miracle : I slept

well, though my Bed waa something hard ; it was

composed of Part of the Rigging that came on Shore '
with the Mast, which I had untwisted, and pulled
into Ovum, and laid it under a hollow Part of the
Rock, where no Rain or Wind could hurt me, unless
it blew hard South, which when it did, would
force a little into my Bed-chamber.

Looking out one Day, I saw a Boat coming towards
my rocky Island; the Sight raised my Spirits
wonderfully; but observing her narrowly, I found
she was only driven by the Wind and Tide, without
any one in her : However, I got down my Rock,
and waited for her coming on Shore, which she did

within



66 The Adventures of

within twenty Yards of me; I immediately got in
her to rummage her, and, surprising Providence!
found twenty dried Fish, a Salt-box filled with Bifket,
and about half a Pint of Brandy in a Bottle.
After giving God Thanks with great Sincerity of
Soul, I fell to, and eat heartily. There were two
Oars in the ?oat, a Boat-hook, a small Filling-net,
and a Tinder-box, with a Grappling-iron and Rope
for a Cable : Upon this I began to be exceeding
easy, and thought myself to be in a happy Condition
: I brought my Fifla on Shore, and flowed it in
my Bed-chamber, and over it (for fear of my Bitch)
put several Pieces of Ropes. I had a Tinder-Box,
and could strike a Light, but had no Candle to
burn, or any Provision to dress.

After I had fettled every thing aa I would have
it, I resolved to take my Boat and go round the
Rock, to see if I could discover any Thing on the
other Side of the inaccessible Part. Whereupon I
took two of my dried Fish, and half a dozen baskets,
and put myself on board : But my poor Bitch
came to the Shore Side, and took on so mightily*
that I went and took her in. I rowed half round
(as near I could guess) the first Day ; but what
made me so long was, that in some Places 1 was
obliged to row half a League from the Shore, to
avoid some Shallows which Jay out towards the
north-east Side. I ventured to lie in my Boat all
Night, and the next Morning went onwards with
my Voyage, and at last came to that Part of the
Rock that I could not get over when I was amor.

Here



Capt. Richard Falconer. 67
Here I found upon the Ground a Ned of Eggs,
about the Bigness of a Duck-egg ; yet I could not
discover what Fowl owned them ; but I took them
all away, and ventured to suck one of them, which
I found as pleasant as a new laid Hen-egg. Her
the Bitch grew very uneasy, and by her whining and
fruitless Endeavours to pass the Rock, (which was
perpendicular) let me understand (be wanted to be
with her Puppies. Finding nothing here for my
Benefit, but my Eggs, I got on Board, and endeavoured
to go round, which I did, till Came to the
Place where the Seal lay that my Bitch found, but
it slunk abominably ; yet she fell too, and after
^vin^ eat, ran up the Rock, and so (as I suppose,)
to her Puppies. 1 wnt on g 0 ard again ; but there
arose such a Fog on a sudden, that T could hardly
see the Length of the Boat, so rather chore to go
back again than venture farther out of my Knowledge,
which I did in a little Time, the Sea being
higher oyer the Sand, and arrived at my own Habitation.


I pulled up my Boat as high as I could, and went
on Shore, and coming to visit my young Companions
found the weakest dead for want of the Dam,
which I immediately took, cut open and flayed off
the Skin, when after being dried, I made me a
Cap of, by cutting it in Form, and sewing it together
with some fine Rope Yarn that I twilled on
Purpose, and my Fork I used instead of a Needle.
The Fat served me to make Candles in this Manner,
by pulling to Pieces fine Rope Yarn and willing it

hard; then I struck a Light, and with an Eggshell
heated my Fat, and drew the Rope Yarn
through it, so I provided myself with a new
Sort of Candle. But then I had but a frnall
Piece of Match, and when that should be gone, I
should be at a strangeness how to light my Candle.
Finding my Provision decrease, I came to an Allowance
of a Quarter of a Sits a Day, and Half a
Bllket, and not to touch that if I could get any
Shell-fish, which began to be scarce too, for some
Days I could not find above ten or twelve, and
when I came sir ft there, I-sed to take them up
by Handfuls. Upon this I began to reflect, that
Winter was approaching, and consequently very
cold Weather ; and then pedlar' J ^*«ujd not get
any Food ; I r<» roJvC<J within myself to venture in
my Eo4t, and sail which Way the the Wind should
direct me ; but then I was put to it for a Sail, (for
we had cut off the Yards and Sails of the rVIain-
Mast, before we threw it over Board) but at lait I
thought of a White Dimity Waistcoat that I wore,
which was lined with Linnen •> this 1 unripped and
sowed together again, so pieced the Lining to the
Outsides, and made me a tolerable Fail. But in
the mean Time the Wind blew so high, that I durst
not venture out ; and continued so long, that my
Provision was diminished to two Fiih, which almost
put me to my Wit's End. Shell-fish were not to
be had. So at last I resolved to kill one of my
Bitch's Whelps ; which I did, made a Fire with
some Boards I found at the Bottom of my Boar, end

boasted



Capt. Richard Falconer. 69

roasted it ; it was palatable, and eat wonderfully
well, they being not two Months old.

I don't question but you'll laugh at me, when I
shall tell you that it went very much against me to
kill this harmless Creature ; but my Necessity had
no Law; besides, I had observed but two Days before,
that the Seal, which was the Dam's Food,
was gnawed to the Bones. n short, after some
Smuggling with myself, I killed five of the six,
and faked two of them ; for after eating my Billets
out of the Salt Box, I found a Handful or two of
Salt at the Bottom, which I made Use of in that
Manner. The Entrails I boiled and gave to the
Dam and t'other Puppy, who eat of it heartily,
making no Scruple though their own Flefli and
Blood. The sixth and last Puppy I resolved not to
kill at all if I could help it, it being so like the
Dam, and would always be with me if it could,
when the others would only play about the Hole
where they lay.

In thbrt, I began to find the Weather cold, and
so resolved to set Sail in my Boat, with my two
Companions, my Bitch and Puppy; and on the gift
of September, after being on the Rock from May the
30th, I set Sail with the Wind about N. E. a middling
Gale, and Steering with my other Oar; for
you must know my Boat-Hook was my Mall, and a
Piece of slit Wood that I saved from the Fire was my
Yard ; so that I could make Shift to ply it to-windward
upon Occasion, but was resolved to sail
before the Wind till I discovered Land ; for my

Boat



yo TJje Adventures tf

Boat being pretty large, and my Sail but small, I
could not make my Way as I might have done with
a Sail fitted to the Boat ; so that I could notdifcover
Land that Night, but failed on till about Midnight ;
then I was so fatigued that in Spite of myself, I
was obliged to lie along in the Boat, and fell asleep,
and slept till I was awakened by a Fisherman in a
Boat, whom I understood not, but found by his

■

Dialect to be a Dane. I gave him to understand
my Condition, by (peaking and Sighs together,
which he seemed to be sorry for by beating his
Breast, and shaking his Head.

He carried me ashore to a Village, where they
made very much of me, and gave me Cloaths ; but
I would not stir without my Dogs. My Boat was
sold, and the Money given me for my own Use. After
I had staid at the Village three Days, I was carried
to Copenhagen, to Mr. Bridgewater, the Pastor for
several English Merchants, who made a Gathering
for me, which amounted to twenty-seven Pounds in
E?iglijb Money. The King of Denmark, sent a Pierson
to me, who understood English very well, and
took down the Particulars of my Voyage in the danish?
Language, that I saw afterwards printed there;
but no one could ever fix upon the Rock that I lived
on. One said it was such a One, another such a
One; and some conjectured it to be a Part of the
Main Land of Sweden, which I should have found if
I had ventured when hindered by the Fog.

But I forgot to tell you, that by printing this
Account, a Man came to demand his boat, that he

said



Capt. Richard Falconer. 71

said he had lost by the Carelessness of a Boy, to whom
he had given it in Charge, who ncjle&ing to fatten
it on Shore, it drove oat to Sea, and came where I
had the good Fortune to meet with it, or rather
guided by the Eye of Providence, to be the Means
or Instrument of saving my Life; which, but for
that, I gustave inevitably perished. The Fisherman
that owned the Boat, had a new one given him
in the Room of it, and to the Value of five Pounds
for the Things it contained.

The Gentleman that was ordered to take the
Notes mentioned above, brought me a hundred Eng-
Guineas, collected from Merchants and Gentlemen
of the City. The King likewise ordered mea
hundred more from his Privy Purse; so that on
November the 18th, I went on Board an Englzjb Ship,
called the Happy, Captain John Gibson, Commander.
We immediately set sail for London, and arrived at
Hertford, December the 25 th, being Christmas-Day,
1688 ; but finding Things out of Order in England,
I thought it was no Place to settle in. So January
the first I took Horse for Bristol, and from thence
embarked for Cork, where I had some stall Effects,
and happily arrived there January the 14th; where
I was welcomed from Death, by all my Friends.

But 1 forgot one Thing which happened to me at
Copenhagen. Dining with the Gentleman that spoke
Englifoxery well, and several other Danes ; I happened
to drink to him in English, with, Sir, my bumble
Service to you, and afkedliftn if he 'would Pledge
me: Upon which, he tell me, Must never mention

Pledging



7 2 The Adventures of

Pledging among Danes ; for, added he, it is the
greatest Affront you can put upon them. How so,
Sir, said I ? Why, laid he, I know it is your Lufton
in England, but if you all knew the Meaning of
it, you would surely abolish it. Whereupon, I
pressed him to tell me the Foundation of that Custom
according to his Notion. Why, said he, when the
Danes invaded England, and got the better of the
Natives, they used often to eat and drink together;
but still allowing the Danes to be their Matters : And
very often, upon some Pique or interest, they used
even to stab them when they were lifting the Cup
to their Mouths. Upon the English being frequently
murdered in this Manner, they contrived at last w hen
they were at Meals, or drinking with the Danes, to
say to to their next Neighbour, Here's to you \ Upon
which, the other cryed, Vll sledge you: Which was
as much as to say, he would be a Surety or Pledge,
while the other drank; and accordingly the other
would guard him while he drank. When done, the
other would drink; and then he that drank before,
was to stand his Pledge likewise. Nay, it came to
be such a Custom at last, that when one Englishman
came into the Company of several Danes, he would
say in taking up his Cup, to his next Neighbour,

Will you pledge me, with an Emphasis? upon the
other's answering he would, he might drink without
Fear*

the 23d, 1689, for B eft on in New England, and so
for Virginia \ we arrived at Boston June the 3d, having
a qnaick Passage. After having done our Business
there, we set sail for Virginia. We doubled Cope-cod
without any Danger: But one Night a Storm
rose, that flung us on Shore upon the Main, within .
six Leagues of Cafe Charles, where our Men were all
saved, but in a poor Condition. Our Flip lying
upon the Sands a Furlong from Shore, fourteen out
of twenty of our Men that could swim, went into
the Long-Boat, and went on Board the Flip to get
some Necessaries ; as soon as they had got what"
they wanted, they came towards the Shore again ;
but the Boat being deeply laden, could not come
nigh enough to Shore to unload, so that they resolved
to go father to seek for deeper Water, and bid
us follow along the Shore, which we did ; but rJhcv
doubling a Point of Land we 1 oil 'sight of them:
However we followed on still, when going over a
little Swamp, we perceived several Indians in a Wood
on our Right Hand. Whereupon we began to be
in a desperate Fright, but Hi II we marched on ; when
coming to the Skirt of the Wood, they let fly
their Arrows at us, which killed one of our Companions,
and wounded two more, one in the Arm,
and the other in the Side of his Neck; as for rv
Part, I still remained unhurt, but had an Arrow
slicking in the Sleeve of my Waistcoat. After the
Indians had fired, they ran to us with incredible
Swiftness, whereupon (having no Weapons) wo
kneeled down to them, and implored their Mercy

Night at lead twenty the Miles up in Country, and
next Morning brought us to their Village, where
was their Wcronxance, sick in his Cabin ; but hearing
of our coming, he rose up, and with several of his
Officers (who are called Cockoroojh) came towards us.
After he had examined the Indians (as we suppose)
how we were taken, he ordered a great Fire to be
made, and had us all tyed to one Stake fixed in the
Earth; but we were no sooner tyed, and the Signal
giving for firing the Wood about us, but we were
untied and brought back to the Tent, to stay, as we
were informed, till the next Day, till more Indians
could come to be Spectators of our Tragedy. They
had Gripped us naked, and in my Breeches-pocket
had found my Box of Instruments, which they examined
very narrowly, and asked which of us it belonged
to? When they were informed it was mine,
I was immediately fen t, for before the Perchance :
who asked me, by his Interpreter, the Name and
Uses every Instrument, Which I informed him:
When he came to my Lancets, and being informed
they were to bleed, he asked in a great Passion, If I
was the Murderer of the Indians that were taken by
the Englijb? But when I let him know it was to let
Blood in many Distempers, for Ease for the Body,
and that we were Strangers to those EngiiJ}? that killed




Capt. Richard Falconer. 7;
led their Indians, he abated of his Anger, and asked
nie if I could shew how I let Blood ? which I
told him I could, if any one wanted it, and was not
well. Whereupon the IVerowance said he was not
very well ; but he would have me try upon one of
my. Companions, before he would let me bleed him.
1 told his Interpreter that he mould tell him I would
feel his Pulse, that I might know whether it was
proper to let him Blood or no 5 Feel his Pulse!
What's that? said the Interpreter, who thought I
meant something elfe ; whereupon I took him by the
Hand, and showed him what I meant When the
Interpreter had satisfyed him with what I said, he
beckoned me to him, and held out his Hand, which
I felt, and found he was in a high Fever. I told
the Interpreter that he mud be let Blood, for his indisposition
was a Fever, and explained hisDiftemper,
which he finding to agree with his Condition, seemed
co be mightily pleased ; but he would have me
bleed some other of my Companions before him. I
pitched upon one that it would not injure, and bled
him upon the Ground till he had bled enough, and
then tyed up his Arm. The Wtrowance and the rest
of the Indians were amazed to see him bleed such a

f

Quantity, and > allied me if he mull bleeds
much? I told them, yes, or rather more; but that
I would have something to save the Blood, because
I could make a better Judgment of the Cause of his
Distemper. Whereupon they brought me aC^///'.

upon this I tyed up his Arm, and let him bleed

so tyed up his Arm again. When I had done, he
wanted to go into his Hammock to Sleep; but 1
told him he must not go to Rest till Night, which
he com ply ed with. The next Day he was much better,
and sent for me again, from the Place where they
had kept us walking all Night, by singing and
dancing round us ; and if any of us offered to sleep,
they would jog us and hinder us. When I came to
him I unbound his Arm, and he looked at the Orifice,
and finding it closed, was more amazed than
before; then he made his Interpreter ask me concerning
his Blood, which was corrupted ; and when
I told him if I had not bled him, he would soon
lave died, he got up, and made mc sit down upon
a Mat which lay in his Cabin, and told me by his
Interpreter, if I would (lay with him, he would save
both me and my Companions, if we would fight
against the Whites, and marry Indian Women, that
should be allotted us. I told him I would ask my
Companions, who rejoiced at the Proposals ; and
though all marry ed before, yet they made no Scruple
of having another Wife. As formyfelf, (though
uot marryed) I did not much care for such a tawny
Rib, therefore told the IFcrowance, none of our profusion
ever marryed : he being well satisfyed with
this Answer, spared all our Lives. For my Part I
had a House allotted mc to myself, that is a Place
about the Height of one Story with us, and covered
with the Barks of Trees ; the Fire-Place is in the
Middle of the House, and all the Chimney is the
Door. The Country is generally pretty even, and
agrees very well with an English Constitution; I

need not describe the Climate, for I suppose you al!
know the Nature of it as well as I. All the Indians
that ever I saw, were well limbed, and near
six Feet high.

The Marriages were made the next Day without
much Ceremony, they were only joined by their
Priests, without any Question on either Side, and
so carryed Home to their several Tents, All the
while I was here, they were making Preparations

to go against the Englijb. One Day I was sent for
and neri— a ^ *£ el the Pile ot the King; after I
had done, he aflted me if I could tell any Thing of
the Affairs of the Englijb by feeling the Pulse; but
I told him, that was impossible, without I was with
them in Person, Whereupon the King aflced me
if 1 would go to (he Englijb, and come to him again,
and give him a true Account of them ; but said he,
you must leave your Sagamore (meaning your Box of
Instruments) behind you. I told him I would make
it my Business to inform rnyfelf in every Particular,
but that I did not know the Way; he told me I
mould have a Canoe and four Indians that mould carry
me within a League of the Englijb. I must confess
I went with Joy and Sorrow ; with Joy to leave
such a cursed Place, where Death threatened me
every Day ; with Sorrow to go without my Companions.
We went into our Canoe, which lay about
six Miles from the Place where the King lived, but
took no Provisions with us, because my Indians were
to provide for me by catching of Fifth, in which they
arc very dexterous. We went down the River that
the Indians called Kusiarra River, till we came to

R 5 Cl>r/tfr<Kx-



7 8 The Advfntuus of

Chests tack-Bay ; then we rowed in our Canoe pais
Rii/fePs Islands, and made toward Cape, or Point-comfort
; but coming about a League or thereabouts
near the Island, a Boat came down the River, and
upon what Account 1 cannot tell, but they fired a
Mufquet, which being heard by the Indians, they
immediately jumped over-board, and swam back again
to Shore. I was not much concerned I mull
own, for there was no Dangerous their being drowned,
for mo ft Indians swim like Fifties. I took the
Paddles and made rnc vtuxtr my ^v- T ^ Paint-come
Jlrt, which I passed, and entered Manhattan River,
(being directed by my Indians so to do) and directed
my Way to Lamcfiown, where I arrived very late,
and was mightily rejoiced to find my Companions
all well in Health, and ready to embark the next
Day for Boston, in a Vessel bound for that Place.
After refreshing mvfclf, and selling my Canoe, I
with the rest of the Company set sail the next Day,
and after various Adventures am arrived where you
see me.

Now think with yourself, Mr. Falconer, whether we
need doubt the. Providence of God in helping us
from this Island? There is nothing here like the
Hardships I have undergone, and yet hare been
happily freed from; and therefore you need not
despair. Despair is the Frenzy of the Mind, and
ought to be avoided, by having a true Notion of the
Power we serve. Upon this I happened to smile,
but was mightily checked by Mr. Randal, who asked
me with a clouded Countenance, what I smiled ? I

replied



Capt. Richard Falconer* 79

replied his Story might have had the same Effect
upon some old Women, (if ic were in Print) that
the Sufferings of our Saviour had upon a Person in
Years. What mean you by that, said Mr. Randal?
Why, Pis tell you, but I would not have you angry
at it, for I really believe every thing you have said
to me : But a Reverend Divine once at Stanford in
Lincolnshire, was preaching a Sermon upon Christ's
Passions, where he expatiated on the many Sufferings,
arid what our Saviour underwent to redeem us Mortals
from the Curse that was laid upon us : An old
Woman (one of the Auditors) took the Parson by
the Sleeve as he went out of the Church, and said to
him, Indeed, Sir, you have made a very feeling
Sermon, which has moved me very much,' and more
especially to aft you a Question or two. Say on,
good Woman, said the Parson. Pray then, Sir,
(said flie) how long is it ago since this Matter happened
? Almost seventeen Hundred Years ago. And
how far off? (added the old Gentlewoman) A great
Way off, some three or four thousand Miles from
hence. Alack-day! cried the old Woman, I'm
glad on it ; Why so, said the Parson ? Because (added
the) 'tis so long ago, and so far off, I hope in
God it is not true. As to your own Belief, (Mr.
Falconer, said he,) I leave it to yourself, but I don't
like jesting with sacred Things ; The old Woman's
Ignorance was Compassion ; yoiy Knowledge seems
to be prophane.

I have known a great many airy young Fellows
that have talked idly on such Things, to make

E 4 People



R o Tic Adventures of

People have an Opinion of their Wit ; but yet, I
believe, even in the very Time of their Utterance,
their Conscience told themes they were doing what
was not pleating to God or Man. I really took
Mr. RiUiJiiPs Way of expressing himself very kindly,
and as I outfit \ for there appeared so much Sincerity
and Candour in all that he sat, that it would
move any one that had a Sense of Heaven or human '
Nature. Therefore I begged his Pardon, and was
he earthly sorry if I had said ought that might any
Ways offend him; which he freely forgave. After
we had spent the Night in Reflection of what had
palled, the next Morning we (after imploring the
Assistance of the Almighty) went to work to clear
the Sand from our Vessel, which we continued
working cn for sixteen Days together, resting only
on Sundays, which at last we effected. We had
thrown up the Sand on each Side, down from the
Vessel, quite, to the Surface of the Water, when it
was lowed. Now tip next Thing we had to do,
was to get Poles to put under our Vessel to launch
her out; which we got from the Burton Wood, but
with much Difficulty, for we were forced to cut a
great many before we could get them that were fit
for our Purpose. L After we had done this, we returned
God Thanks for our Success hitherto, and
on the Day following resolved (God willing) to
thrust off our Vessel into the Water, but were prevented
by Mr, Randal's being taken ill of a Fever,
occasioned (as we suppose) by his great Fatigue in
working to free our Flip from the Sand, wherein

he



Capt. Richard Falconer. 8i
he spared no Pains for to encourage us as much by
his Onions as his Words, even beyond his Strength*
The Concern we were all in upon this, occasioned
our Delay in not getting our Vessel out, besides one
Hand out of five was weakening our Strength.
Mr. Randal never thought of his Instruments till
now, which he wanted to let him self Blood, but not
feeling them about his Cloaths, we supposed they
might have been overlooked in the Vessel, so I ran
immediately to see if! could find them ; and getting
up the Side, my very Weight pulled her down to
the Sand, which had certainly bruised me to Death,
if 1 had not by the Appointment of divine Providence
sunk • into the Hollow that we had made by
throwing the Sand from the Flip. I crept out in a
great Fright, and ran to my Companions, who with
much ado got her upright, and afterwards we fixed
some spare Oars on each Side, to keep her up from
falling again: For the Pieces of Wood that were
.placed under her, were greased to facilitate worshipping
into the Water, and we had digged the Sand so entirely
from her,, that she relied only on them, which
occasioned her leaning to one Side with my Weight
only, which hadn't happened, I believe, if I had
endeavoured to have got on Board on the other Side,
which was ■highefly but chasing the lowest for my
more easy Entrance was the Cause of the Accident
that happened to me. When we were entered into
the Vessel, and found our Endeavours to find the
Box of Instruments fruitless, we were all mio-htiiv
concerned, for we verily believed that bleeding

would have cured him; nay, even he himself said,
that if he could be Jet Blood, he was certain his Fever
would abate, and he should be easier ; yet to
Tee with what a perfect Resignation he submitted t<!>
the Will of Heaven, it would have inspired one
With a true Knowledge of the Being good Men enjoy
after a Dissolution from this painful Life. He
was still worse and worse ; but yet so patient in 'his
Sufferings, that perfectly amazed us all. He continued
in this Manner a whole Week, ; without tailing
any Thing but Water-gruel ill made, for what
little Oatmeal we had, was four. When we saw by
the Course of Nature, it was impossible he should
last long, we all were very much grieved X as for envy
own Part, I could not forbear shedding Tears, for I
had taken such an Affection to him, that aloft
equalled a Child's Love to a Parent. He seeing me
weep, called me with a faint Voice towards him ;
and when I was near hrm, he made me lit down by
him. T> After several kind 1 Expressions, which made
my Tears flow more plentifully," he said to me, Mr.
Falconer* If you grieve for me, dry your Tears I de
fire nothing but your Prayers. I am going to pay a
Debt incumbent on me by Nature, and a Debt that
mull be paid, which was contracted at my Birth, and
Death will n6t admit of any Evasion ; all Mortals
owe the same Acknowledgement, but some squander
away that Substance which should be freely paid
when called for. How happy are they that provide
against such a Creditor, that may come at any Hour
of Day or Night, and lawfully demand his Due

Here is no Shuffling as in worldly Matters, no putting
off the important Visitor; therefore as we are
sure he will call upon us, Tis'gobd to be always
provided against the Time. How happy are honest
Mind's', when they have provided to fa sissy their
worldly 'Creditors ; they then live in a Contentment
tffMind, peculiar to ah honest Heart: But what
mull be said for theft Debt, upon which depends
the Welfare of the Soul, bur doing well or ill hereafter,
is it not of the utmost Importance ? Therefore
as I am endeavouring to pay that Debt, whose
utmost Limit will soon expire, help me by your
Prayers to irish what I hope I have well begun,
and, as a Friend's Advice, prepare to make up
your Accounts to Heaven, for you know not how
soon they may be called for ; besides you will have
one less to eat of the Provision that is left. After
this, being tired with speaking so much together,
he turned to rest himself, but his Fever was so violent,
he could take no Ease in Body, though tranquil
in Mind. Sp finding we could not expect his
Life, we prayed for a speedy and" painless Release
from it". After this we gave him ferric Water (which
he often begged for in vain) to cool h\s Mouth.
When he had drank it, he said he 'found himself a
little easier, and the Pain and Burning something*
abated, which we took as a Lightning before
Death, or as the Spirits collected together to make
their last fruitless Efforts.

When he found himself just upon the Point of
expiring, he made this short Prayer, which was so

it : O Almighty Creator of Heaven and Earth,
whose. all-feeing Eye looks into the inmost Corner

repent of, ^hd.rejy upon the infinite Grace of thy
wonted Mercy to absolve me of all my part Crimes*
through the Merits of my Lord and Saviour Jesu*
Christ. Then, lifting up his Hands and Eyes to
Heaven, expired, with the Happiness of continuing
in his right Senses in such a Fever, which is almost

Memory of Thomas Randal, and endeavour to make
1 as good an End as he did, who died a natural

Death, on Friday December the 21ft, 1699, in his
perfect Mind, and a true Notion of the Power of

God to pardon all his Faults, whose Failings were
corrected by a fin-cere Penitence, dying every Day

he lived.'

This took me up a whole Tree. Mr. Randal
made no Will ; yet I claimed his Dogs being the
Whelp of the Bitch he found upon the Rock which
he was thrown upon in the Baltick the Bitch being
dead some Years before. We were forced to tie
him up after we had buried Mr. Rxnda! y for with
his Feet he would scrape Holes in the Grave two
Feet deep, and howl prodigiously.

After this we prepared once more to launch our
Veiled ; but first we put on board what Provision we
had left, and all the Things that we took from
thence. Mr. Randall Death gave me (with the
others Permission) a Title to a Bed, which I wanted
before. So that I took up the Cabin which was
allotted me, and laid on board every Night. And
now we bent our Thoughts entirely on our Vessel,
and on Monday the 31 ft of December launched her out
into the Sea, and designed tossed sail the next Day.
After we had fixed her fast ruth two Anchors and a
Halter on Shore, we went on board to dine and
make ourselves merry, which we did very heartily,
and to add to our Mirth, we made a large Can of
Punch, which we never attempted to do before, being
we had but one Bottle of Lime-juice in all, and

what

what (indeed) we designed for this Occasion ; in
short, the Punch ran down so merrily, that we were
all in a drunken Condition ; but when it was all
gone, we resolved to go to rest : But all I could do,
could not persuade them to lie on board that Night
in their Cabins, (yet without a Bed ;) but they
would venture, though they were obliged to swim
a hundred Yards before they could wade to Shore;
but however they got safe, which I knew by their
hallooing and rejoicing.

Having brought my Bed on board, I went to rest:
very contentedly, which I did till next Morning ;
But oh ! Horror ! when I had dressed myself, and
going on Deck, to call my Companions to come
on board to dine, which was intended over Night,
and afterwards to go on Shore, and bring our Sails
and Yards on board, and make to Sea as waft as we
could, I could not see any Land, which so overcame
me on the sudden, that I sunk down on the Deck,
without Sense or Motion : How long I continued
so I can't tell, but I awaked full of the Sense of my
lamentable Condition, and ten thousand Times
(slights my Resolution to forbear) cursed my unhappy
Stars, that had brought me to that deplorable
State. O Wretch that I am ! what will my. unhappy
Fate do with me ; is any one's Condition
equal to mine? (1 would cry.) But 'tis a just punishment,
in not rendering to God the Tribute due
for his Mercies, that? we had hitherto known. Instead
of coming on board to be. frolicksome and
merry, we Should have given Thanks to him, that

gave

gave us the Blessings thinking we were no longer
subject to fuel! Hardships, that we might probably
have undergone, if we had been detained longer on
that Island. If poor Mr, Randal had remained
among us, this Misfortune had not-happened-Me
by his wife and prudent Care and Conduct,' would
have prevented this unlucky Accident. What mull
my poor Companions think-that are left in a more
miserable Condition than myself, if it be possible*
I have no Compass, neither am I of myself capable
of ruling the Vessel in a Calm, much less jf there
should a Storm happen, which are too frequent in
this Climate* .

After I had vented my Grief in a Torrent of
Words and Tears, I began to think how the Vessel
should have gone to Sa without my Knowledge;
and by Remembrance of the Matter the Night before,
found by our Eagerness and fatal Carelessness*
we had forgot to' fatten our Cables to the Peers;
and pulling up the Halter that we had fattened to
one of the Burton Trees on Shore, perceived that
the Force of the Vessel had pulled the Tree out ot
the Earth* Then I too late found that a Hurricane
had rose when 1 was found asleep; and stupefied by
too much Liquor, and carried off the Vessel. This
Reflection wounded me deeper than before, which
I followed with Curses on that Liquor that steals
away our Senses, and makes worse than Bears of
human Creatures*

Now I began to call upon him that hears us in
the Time of Trouble ; even when the Wind blows

lauded, whose Nod can shake the Frame of Earth
from oft' its Basis ; and with-a Heart sincere, and
vicious Thoughts corrected, 1 sent my Soul in penitential
Words and Tears before his Throne of
Mercy,, imploring a speedy Ending of my Life or
Troubles; when I began to be something better
contented in my Mind, and thought of sustaining
Nature,, almost fpent.wjuh the JEatigqe and Grieving.
One great Comfort 1 had of my Side, which
my poor (former) wretched Companions wanted,
that was Provision in Plenty, and fresh Water ; so
chat when 1 began to consider coolly, J found 1 had
not that Cause to complain which they had, who
were left on a barren Island, without any other
Provision than that very same Diet which I was
forced to take up with, when first thrown ashore;
that is,, the Coolies, whose Numbers were mightily
diminished before we designed to leave the J Hand.

What made me mod uneasy, was to think what
mv Companions could judge of me, whether they
should take it for Design or Chance; but then 1
(tilled that Thought, by knowing they must needs
see that the Tree was forced away with Violence
beyond the Strength of Man Beside, I had . another
small Comfort, that was the Company of my
Dog, which lay on Board with me, which I used to
talk to as if he were a rational Creature ; and the
poor Beast would stand and share me in the Face, as
if he were sensible of what I said to him. It was a
very, handsome Creature of the Dcjiijh Kind, hut
very good natured, and would often go to the C:w

and whine mightily.

1 remained tossed upon the Sea for a Fortnight
without discovering Land \ for the Weather continued
very calm, but yet so hazy that I could not
perceive the Sun for several Days. One Day searching
for some Linnen that I had dropped under the
Sacking of my Bed, (for I did not lie in a Hammock)
I found an old Glove with 75 Pieces of
Eight in it, which I took and sewed in the Waistband
of my Breeches, for Fear I mould want it
some Time or other I made no Scruple of taking
it, for I was well assured it did belong to poor
Mr. Randal Beside I had heard the other People
say, that they were sure he had Money somewheres
and after his Death we searched for it, but could
not find any,

January the 20th I discovered a Sail to Leeward
of me, but she bore away so fast, that there was not
any Hope of Succour from her, and I had not any
Thing to distinguish me; and I supposed though I
could see them, yet they could not see me by Reason
of my Want of Sail, which would have made me
the more conspicuous. The next Day I discovered
Land, about six Leagues to the S. W. of me, which
I observed my Vessel did not come nigh, butcoafted
along Shore ; but I was well assured it was the Province
of Jucatan belonging to the Spaniards and
was the Place we came from. Now all my Fear
was that I mould fall into their Hands, who would
make me do the Work of a Slave ; but even that I

thought was better than to live in continual Fear
of Storms and Tempests, or Shipwreck.

I coasted along in this Manner for two or three
Days, and at last discovered Land right a-hcad,
which I was very glad of ; but yet mixed with
some Fear, in hot knowing what Treatment I should
have. 1 began now to think of some Evasion, and
not to tell .them the Truth, of belonging to the£/g-
<uwft/ Vessel, unresolved to tell them that we were
taken by a French Privateer, and after being 'rummaged,
were turned off as useless.

January the 30th, I made the Bay and Town of
Francisco di Campechy y ass it proved afterwards, and
was aloft upon it before I was met by any thing
of a* Flip, or a Boat j but at last two Canoes came
on Board with one Spaniard and six Indians* who
were much surprized when they understood my
k Condition by speaking broken French, which the
Spaniard underwood. They immediately carried me
non Shore, and from thence to the Governor, who
was at Dinner ; they would have had me staid till
he Jiad dined ; but he hearing of me, commanded
me to come in, where he was at Dinner with several
Gentlemen, and two Ladies ; and though 'tis very
rare any one sees the Women, yet they did not
offer to veil themselves. I was ordered to sit down
by myself at a little Table placed for that Purpose,
where I had sent me of what composed their Dinner,
which was some Fish and Fowls, and excellent Wine
of several Sorts. - •

The chief Town of the Province of Jucatan, lies
twelve Leagues from the Sea on either Side, which
is a Bishop's See, and the Residence of the Governor
of this Province. Valladolid the second City ;
and Campcchy the third ; yet though but the third
reckoned, it far exceeds the red for Riches and
Magnificence. It is a well sit dated neat-birilt
Town, and by Computation, contains near two
thousand Houses. It is well fortified both by Art
and Nature : By the former in a strong, well built

to be the Seed or Groundwork of all good and suit,
r Things; and after being initiated, they were certain
it was not in the Power of the evil Spirit to
hurt them in Body or Goods : Neither were they
.permitted to marry, without first taking that Order
upon them, which, they used to distinguish by an
OJlricWs Feather, larger and longer than any
other they used to wear for Ornaments upon their
Heads,

They have another Tradition, that this Province
of Jucatan was first inhabited and cultivated by a
white bearded People, that came from the East ;

after



Capt. Richard Falconer. 93
after being tossed many Moons upon the Sea, and
buffering many Hardships for Want of Food and
fresh Water, and other Necessaries ; yet relieved
from Want and their Enemies, through the Power
of the Deity they worshipped, who even commanded
the Sun to mine, or not to Shine ; who made it rain,
or dry Weather; who could heal Sickness, or send
Distempers; in short, a God that kept all the other
petty Deities in Awe.

This Story, if true, seems to confirm an old Tradition
of our Welch Chronicles, that tells us of one
Madoc ap Owen, Son to Guhictb, a Prince of that
Country, who was drove, by some Disgust, from
his own Country, with several Companions ; who,
after various Adventures at Sea, were driven on an
unknown Land to the West many hundred Leagues,
where they had Communication in a friendly Manner
with the Indians, and made a Settlement.
Whereupon Madoc ap Owen returned for Britain
again, and got to the Number of two thousand
Men 2nd Women, besides Children, which mixed
with the Natives, and left among them several of
their Opinions and Manners ; which they retained
till the last, when Cortex, subdued them; but now,
by the Cruelty of the Spaniards , the Natives are almost
extinguished .

After they had feasted mc for two or three Days
they sent me about with several Officers appointed
by the Governor, to make a Gathering, which wc
did withSuccefs; for in three Days we had got
seven hundred and odd Pieces of Eight : And two

Merchants



94 The Adventures of

Merchants there were at the Charge of sitting up
my Bark, in order to send it for my poor Companions.
When it was finished, they gave me several
Necessaries for myself and Companions, to hearten
us up; as some Bottles of fine Wines; two Bottles
of Citron-water, for a Cordial ; Chocolate, and
several other useful Things : But the Difficulty was
to get Seamen to go with me : At last they remembered
they had five LugUJhmen that were Prisoners
there, and taken in the Bay of Campechy, upon Suspicion
of Piracy, but nothing could be proved
againftthem; which they freed withstand Ransom :
This did not look like Barbarity or Ill-nature ; for
I received as much Humanity among them, as could
be expected from any of the mod civilized Nations :
But they have a greater Kindness for the English >
than they have for their Neighbours the French, for
the English are more open and generous (they say),
and don't use Stratagems to deceive them, as the
French do frequently ; though they only pay them
in their own Coin, for there ia no Nation under the
Sun more fruitful than the Spaniard in Plotting
and Ambuscades, (as they call them) to deceive
their Enemies ; which yet they think lawful.

On February the 15th, 1700, Ave fct Sail from
Campechy Bay, after paying my acknowledgment to
the generous Governor, tiff, but having nothing to
present him worth Acceptance, but my OW, I
gave him that, which he took very kindly, and said
he would prize it mightily, not only in the Efteern

"he had for that Author, but in Remembrance of
me and my Misfortunes.

We plyed it to Windward very briefly, and in
fifteen Days discovered the Isles of the Cranes ;
but we durst not go within the Shoals, because we
were all ignorant of the Channel. So we cast Anchor,
and hoisted out our Boat, with two Meu and
myself, and made to Shore, where we found my
three Companions, but in a miserable Condition,
and Mr. Mufgra<ve so faint and weak, that they expected
he could not live long.

When they awaked the next Day, after I was
drove o-ffin the Dark, they were all in Despair, to
find the Vcilel gone, which they perceived was occasioned
by a Hurricane, that they were assured was
violent, because it had blown down their Tent,
though without awaking them. But when they began
to consider they had no Food, nor but very little
fresh Water, which was left in a Barrel without
a Head in the Tent, their Despair increased ; bur,
as no Passion can last long that is violent, it wore o£*
with their Care for Sustenance, which they diligently
searched for ; but not finding any Quantity
of Eggs, or Booties, the dreadful Fear of Starving
came into their Minds, with all its horrid Attendants.
Now they imagined that all that had happened
to them was, as I had thought, a Judgment of Divine
Providence for the vile Sin of Drunkenness,
when they should have rather implored Heaven's
Assistance, in furthering them in their Delivery from
the Place where they were.

They



96 The Adventures of

They had now been five Days without eating o
drinking, not for Want of Stomachs, but Food,
which they endeavoured to get, but all to no purpose
; for the Boobies were retired, either out of
Fear, or Custom, to some other Place. Neither
could they find one Egg more, and Weakness came
so fast upon them, with Hunger and Drought, that
they were hardly able to crawl, so they thought of
nothing but dying ; when at hall they remembered
the Body of good Mr. Randal, that had been buried
a Week, which they dug up, without being petrified
; and that poor Wretch that helped to support
our Misfortunes when alive with his sage Advice,
now was a Means cf preserving their Lives,
though dead. They had by good Fortune left them
a Tinder-box in the Tent, (we having two) with
which they struck a Light, and made a Fire, then
cent off several Pieces of Flesh of the Brawn of his
Arms and Thighs, broiled them on the Coals,
though with a great Deal of Reluctance ; which was
the Means of keeping Life and Soul together, till
we came to relieve them from that deplorable Condition.
Mr. Mufgra<ve we brought to a little Life
and Strength, by giving him some Citron-water in
small Quantities, When I saw the Carcase of my
poor good Monitor lie for Food for human Creatures,
my Horror at the Sight overcame my Reason,
and I believe I said Things shocking enough ; however,
when I had calmly considered their Condition,
I was very sorry for what I had said, and begged
their Pardon. After we had refreshed ourselves,

we

we once more laid him in the Earth, having sewed
his poor Bones in one of the Hammocks.

I must confess, I never think of that good Man,
but Tears come into my Eyes, and Melancholy
clouds all my Thoughts : For he was one whose
Character came up to all we could desire in frail
Man. Honest, without In terest ; friendly, without
Deign ; religious, attended with Reason ; and not
Avaddlcd up so tight as to make it deformed : pleasant
in Conversation, courteous to all, hating nothing
but Vice ; gentle ia reproving ; bold in all
Dangers, in being armed with an Innocence that
inspired him with Success : In short, he was a Miracle
of a Man, when we consider his Life had been
al ways at Sea, among a Crew prone to all Manner
of Vices, and where it was not possible to find a
Pattern to follow of any Goodness.

He was a single Man, or rather indeed a Bachelor
; for he had often told me, he could not bear ta
marry a Woman, to put her into Frights and Fears
when the Wind blew hard, as every good Wife
must certainly be concerned for the Danger of her
Husband. Besides, as it was his Fortune to lead 3
Seafaring Life, he could not think of marrying, to
be absent from his other Self so long (as he termed
it) ; not but if he had had a sufficient Competency,
he said, he believed he mould have entered into the
Marriage State in the latter Part of Life, that he
might have fettled his Mind, and, free from the
Hazard and Turmoils of the Sea, slipped into hi*

He was an excellent Sailor, and knew most Parts

in the Latin Tongue. His Journals were
rno.tly taken in Short-Hand : But he had one small
Manuscript, containing about twenty-Leaves,
on the one Side, and Englijhon the other, all in
Lis own Hand ; which I suppose he had translated
for his Diversion, and to pass away his leisure

with other Rarities, to be found in the IVrjl-lndies \
On the Flat of his Book, he had writ in a larrre

Stone, IV. Kcatcr, Francis Heal, W. Warren, and Joseph
Meadows, (all of England) the five Men 'given
me by Don Ar.torJo , who, as I said before, were
taken on Suspicion of Piracy ; whereupon a Thought
came into my Send, that had escaped me before: I
considered if these were really Pi rate? , being five to
four, they might be too powerful for us, and : perhaps
murder us. Frank Hood we had made our
Cook, to dress our Provision, which he understood
a little One Day we all dined together upon Deck,
under our Awning, it being very calm Weather;
an Awning is only a Sail fixed at the Quarter Deck,
a-nd carried over the Booms (that is, spare Mais that
Ire along from Quarter to Fore cattle) to the forecastle,
to keep the Sun from our Meads : In Men of
War, and great Ships, they have one mid of
several Kinds of handsome Stars, for the Officers on
the Quarter-Deck ; besides another on the Main
Deck, for the common Sailers. One Daw, as I
said before, being at Dinner, for we aH eat together,
I aficed the five Men, what was the Reason
they were taken by the Spaniard: for Pirates ? Upon r
this they seemed nonplus, but Warren soon recovered
himself, as well as the rest, and spake for the
others, in this Manner : Wc embarked on Board
the Flip Bonaventure, in the TKv?:cs* bound for
Jamaica, where wc made a pro fpe reus Voyage ; but
after taking m our Lading, in our Way Home, we
were overtaken by a Storm, in which our Flip was
lost, and all the Men p perished, but myself and four

F 2 Companions,



i co The Adventures of

Companions, who were saved in the Long-Boat :
But the Reason we were taken for Pirates was, that
making to Shore to save ourselves, we saw a Bark
riding at Anchor, without the Port of Campecly,
which we made to, in order to enquire whereabouts
we were, and to beg some Provisions, our own being
gone; and entering the Vessel, found but tvvo
People in it ; the third, jumping into the Water,
swam on Shore, and brought three Boats filled
with Spanijb Soldiers, which entered the Vessel
before we could make off. Make off! said X.
What did you design to run away with the Vessel ?
No; answered Warren, with some Confufion, but
we did design to weigh Anchor, and go farther on
Shore, that we might land in the Morning (it being
late at Night) : But we were prevented by their
coming on Board us, where we were found, being
.armed, which we had taken Care of, when we
were in our Boat, to defend ourselves, if we were
obliged to land among the Savages : And indeed
they had their Arms restored them, when they
were freed and sent on Board with me.

I nuit confess, I did not like the Fellow being
nonplus now and then, in not knowing what to
say; but upon Con fi deration, thought it might befor
Want of Words to express himself better, which
is the Occasion very often of People of common
Understanding, Stammering, and Humming, and
Hawing, to put their Words in better Order; so
for that Time 1 took no more Notice, not weighing

it in my Mind : But in the Evening Mr. Middkton
came to me, with a Face of Concern, and told me
he did not like these Fellows Tale. W hy so ? laid
I ; because I observe they herd together, answered
he, and are always whispering and speaking low to
one another. Oh! said I, there cannot be any
Danger in them ; for if they had any Inclination to
run away with our Vessel, they might have done it
when they were five to one, before we took you in.

(said I) for, as I said before, they would have done
it when they had more Power, before 1 landed on
Despair Island, (as I called it) if they had any such
Intentions. There is a Providence that rules overall
our Actions, answered Middkton y that we can no
more see into, than the Book of Fate, but if a
foreboding Heart may speak, I am lure something
we shall suffer from these Fellows, that will be of
Danger to us. If so, replied I, there's no refilling
the Will of Providence ; for what will come, will
come, and there's no sending against it : But,
added he, this" seems something like Foreknowledge
; and to refill against that, seems like struggling
against; the Will of Heaven, that warns us by
these Forebodings to prevent these Accidents of
Life. 1 believe God, pursued he, has fixed a

and from that, forming our own Happiness, or
Ivfifcry, it cannot be said but that the Actions of
Life may be regulated by that Free Will. Our
Maker never formed a Villain : Neither do their
external Parts, differ from a virtuous Man's ^ if they
did, they were to be easily avoided : But as an old
Poet says, There'' s uo Art to find the Mind's Conjlruftim

TTpnn this Discourse, I began to stagger in my
Opinion of their Honesty, and therefore werefuUcd
to Hand upon our Guard. We took no Notice of
cur Conference than to our two other Companions,
but resolved to slay till Night, we having a better
Opportunity, as we lay together in the Cabbin
Aft; (which is as much to say in the Stern, or
behind) when we were to go to Supper, we called
one another to come, but five of the Sailors excused
themselves, by saying they had dined so lately,
that they had no Stomach as yet ; whereupon we had
an Opportunity sooner to converse together than we
designed. For being at Supper, we opened the
Matter to our other two Companions, and they
agreed immediately that we were in some Danger;
so we resolved in the middle Watch of the Night,
to seize them in their Sleep. We were to have the
fir ft: Watch, which we set at eight of the Clock;
then they were to watch till Twelve; and then in
their Watch, between One an Two, we had
concluded to seize upon them as they slept ; that is,

four



Capt. Richard Falconer 105
four of them, for one of them watched with ur,
which was Frank Hoed, the Cook ; whom we agreed
to seize and bind fait, towards the latter End of the
Watch, and to threaten him with Death, if he offered
to make the least Noise.

As soon as ever our first Watch was ses, we sent
Mr. Mujgra<ve to prepare our Arms; in about half
an Hour, or thereabouts, Warn called to //coupon
Deck, (they lying below) to get him a little Water,
for he was bloody dry, he said ; whereupon
the other went down immediately with some Water
in a Can to him. As soon as he was gone down, I
had the Curiosity to draw as near the Scuttle as I
could to hear the Discourse. Now you must know
Hot J* our Cook, had been employed that Day about
searching our Provisions, our Beef Calks, and Perk,
to see what Quantity we had, that we might know
how long it would la ft ; so that the others had not
an Opportunity to disclose the Design to him. As
soon as he was got down, I could hear JVllL Warren
say to him, G — d d — n ye, Trunk, we had like to
have been smoaked to-Day and though we had
contrived the Story that I told them, yet I was a
little surprized at their asking me, because then I
did not expect it ; but we deign to be even with
them in a very little Time; For, hark ye, said he,
and spoke so low that I could not hear him ; upon
which, the other said, there's no Difficulty in the
Matter 5 but we need not be in such Haste, for you
know, as we ply it to Windward, a Day or two

can break no Squares, and we can soon (after the
effecting our Design) bear down to Leeward to
our Comrades that we left on Shore ; for I fancy,
added he, that they have some small Suspicion of
you now, (which in Time will sheep) and may be
on their Guard ; therefore 'tis better to wait a Day
or two : No, G— d Z ds, we'll do it Tonight,
when they are asleep, replied Warren \
whereupon there were many Arguments, Pro and
Con ; (as 1 fancied) but they spoke so low, that I
could only hear a G — d D — n ye, now and then,
and something that Kind.

A little while after, Heed came up again, and
after walking up and down, and fixing his Eyes
often upon me, who in the mean Time was provided
with a Couple of Pistols under my Watch ■
Coat, and indeed were their own, that we hung up
ready charged in our Cabin ; which was one Reason
of their Design to attack us in our Sleep, being
they had no Arms till they could seize on them
where they hung ; or elfe they were such desperate
Fellows, they would have done it in the open
Day. Hood, as I said before, seemed to fix his
Eyes frequently upon me, for till now I never
watched in the Night ; at last, said he very softly,
if you please Mr. Falconer, 1 have a Word or two to
say to you, that much concerns you all. What is
it ? said I. Why, answered he, I would have the
xeit of your Companions Ear Witnesses too ; with
that I called them together \ but, said he, let's

mire;



Capt. Richard Falconer. 105
retire as far from the Scuttle as we can, that we
may not be heard by any below Deck ; so we went
into the Cabin, and opened the Scuttle above, that
Mr. Mufgrave, who steered, might hear what was
- said. When we were sat down upon the Floor,
Mr. Hood began as follows. My four Companions
below have a wicked Design upon you ; that is, to
seize you, and put you into the Boat, and runaway
with your Vessel : But I thinking it an inhuman
Action, not only to any one, but to you in
particular, that have been the Means of their
Freedom, therefore, I hope appointed by Providence,
I come to let you know it, that we may
think of some Means to prevent it. Upon this,
(finding his Sincerity,) T told him that we were provided
against it already ; and with the Consent of
my Companions, told him our Design of seizing
them in the third Watch ; but, said he, they intend
to put their Project in Practice, their next
Watch, therefore I think it will be more proper
for us to Counter plot them, and seize them this ;
but as they have no Arms, said I, and we have,
we need not fear them.

We had several Debates about this, which took
up too much Time to our Sorrow ; for Warren mistrusting
Hood, it seems, got up and listened, and
when he found that we retired all of us to the Cabbin,
he got upon Deck, and stealing softly, came
so close. that he overheard every thing we said,
which as soon as he understood, he went immediate

S ly



io The Adventures of

Iy to his Companions, who waited impatiently, (as
they told us afterwards) and let them know all our
Discourse; whereupon, without pausing, they resolved
to attack us immediately, in the Mid ft of our
Consultation ; which was no sooner resolved upon,
but done: For we were immediately surprized with
their seizing us, which they did with that quickness,
and so perceivable, that we were all confounded
and amazed ; they had wiped off two pistols
in our Confirmation, which they clapped to our
Breasts. Jn this Confufion, I had forgot mine that
were at my Girdle, (or elfe we might have been
hard enough for them;) neither did 1 remember
them till they found them about me. They had'
shut the Cabbin Door on the Inside, rill they had'
bound us, and never minded Mr. Mufgra*ve knocking
and making a Noise, till they had secured
us. Which done, they opened the I>oor, and
seized him, who came to know what the Matter
was, for we had no Candle in the Cabbin, and he
hearing a Noise, amongst u?, thought we were
seizing Hood, and called to us to forbear, (as he said
afterwards) and make haste, for he was going to
rack about, though we did not hear him ; on which
he clapped the Helm a Lee, and came down to fetch
us out, to haul off the Sheets, £sV. and was seized, .
and bound with us ; for they left us immediately,
for the Sails fluttered in the Wind, by Reason tic
was veering round, when the Helm was a Lee.

After they had fixed the Vessel, and it was broad
Pay, they came and unbound our Legs, and gave
us Leave to walk upon Deck; whereupon \ began

to expostulate with them, particularly Mr, Warren;
being he seemed to have a- Sort of Commar>d^oveP

have you seized upon us, and bound us in; this
Manner? Have we done you any Injury? ^'hfi
said he, Self-preservation ; I found you were going
to do the . like by us, therefore you are but served
in your Kind. And what do you design to do with

1 08 The ADVENTURES of

our Vessel was stranded not to be gotten off. Oar
fir ft Design when we were taken in our Boat was to
get us a Vessel to go a Buccaneering, which we had
done at Camfecby, if it had not been for the Indian
that swam on Shore unknown to us, and brought
Succours too soon ; which we could not avoid, the
Sea Breeze blowing very strong all Night; so we
seeing our Danger, were forced to form the Lie we
told the Governor, which had some Appearance of
Truth, for we did not use any Violence to the two
old Spaniards* because by good Words we thought
to make them assisting to work our Bark back again
to our Men. Now, pursued he, if you will all resolve
to go a Buccaneering with us, we'll venture to
carry you to our Captain and Men ; if not, we'll do
as we have proposed. We looking one upon another,
as if we were to know each other's Resolutions;
he cryed, nay, if you pause, you manner have
that Grace, if you desire it: Therefore prepare
every Thing, period he, to one of his Companions,
that they may be going, they won't be long before
they come to their journey's End-when
they had got every Thing ready, that is to
say, a Barrel of Bifket, another of Water, about
half a Dozen Pieces of Beef, and as much Pork, a
small Kettle, and a Tinder-Box ; we were better
provided than we expected, by much. Besides, they
granted us four Cutlasses, and a fowling-piece
with about four Pounds of Powder, and a sufficient
Quantity of Shot; together with all poor Mr. Ran-days
Journals, after their perusing them, and finding

ing them of no Use to them : When this was done,
he ordered them to tie Hood to the Mall of the Vessel,
and was charging a Pistol to (hoot him through
the Head, not considering it was charged before,
for it was one of them I had at my Girdle,
and which they took from me; bat in his Eagerness
and H eat of Passion did not mind it. We ail intreated
for the poor Fellow, and he himself fell upon
his Knees, and begged with all the Eloquence
he had, to spare him, and let him go with us; bur
Ivan swore bitterly, nothing should save him.
Said I, Mr. Warren, if you believe there is a Power,
that formed this Globe, and sees every Action of
Mankind, think what a Crime you commit by
wounding of him, by murdering his Image : But if
you are an Atheist, and believe in no Power supernatural,
yet consider what a Conquests will have
gained over yourself by overcoming this headstrong
Passion. It may be your own Case another Time;
and Murder you know is punished with Death*
What the Devil have we got here, a preaching Puppy
? Why, dost think that I mind thy ridiculous
Cant ? prythee mind thy own Business, and get thee
gone, or perhaps I may begin with you, and send
you to the Devil before your Time. With that, he
c locked his Pistol, and levelled it at Hood; but firing,
it split into several Pieces, and one struck Warren
into the Skull so deep, that he was breathing his
lad upon Deck; one of the Bullets grazed upon the
Side of my Temple, and did but just break the
Skin; as for Hood he was not hurt ; but with the
Fright and Noise of the Pistol, (as we supposed)

laboured with such an Agony of Spirit, that he
brake the Cords chat tied him by the Arms, though
as thick as a middle t Finger, and fell down; but
role immediately, and. not finding himself hurt,
ran to us, and unbound our Arfinfiu unperceived by
the other two, who were busy about unfortunate
Warren ; and' though they were called to him by them
that steered, (w'10 ran immediately to prevent it)- yet
they did not mind it, they were so concerned about
Warren. And before he that steered came, HoodAi&i
unbound me, and flopped the Pet low (Meadows) by,*
giving him a Blow with his Fist that knocked him
down. In the mean Time, I had unbound Wbihl
Mufgra<ue, and Middleton and we-went and'Teized
upon the other two Pyrates? for now we called them ,
nothing elfe. After we had behind in our Turn,
went to see what Assistance could be given to Warren,

after bur first tacking about* in the Morning, when
the Buftle;happened, they bore away with Tack at
Cat-head's as being for their Purpose. The three
Men that were. left, desired us to Jet them Shave the
Boat, and go seek their Companions; which we
refused, as not having Hands enough to any our
Vessel to Jamaica-but we promised them* if they
would freely work in the Voyage, they Ihouldhsve
their intire Liberty to go where: they thought v fit

every Moment, and therefore seeing it was not possible
to escape, we backed our Sails and laid by
for them, chat they might be more civil if they
were Enemies. As soon as ever they came up
with us, they hailed us, and ordered us to come
on Board, which we durst not deny ; when Mr.
Mufgra<ve and I, with Hood and White for Rowers,
event on board them. We found by Hood's knowing
them, that they were his Captain and Comrades.
Now, as Hood said, we did not know how
we (hould-behave ourselves, or what we should say
about Warren ; but we only told the Captain how
we met with his Men, and that they were redeemed
upon my Account. He never asked particularly for
Jf r warrens but how they all did ; but when they fenton
board to search our Vessel, they soon came to
the Truth on't; for the other three told them the
Story, though not with aggravating Circumstances :
Upon which poor Hood was tied to the Main mall,
lashed with a Cat of Nine-tails most abominably,
and after that pickled in Brine, which was more
Pain than the Whipping ; but it kept his Back
from festering, which it might otherwise have done ;
because they slay the Skin off at every Stroke, and,
to prevent it, they wash it with Brine ; which is
called Whiffing and Pickling. After this they would
not keep him among them ; but sent for the other
three Men from our Vessel, and ordered us all on
boni, with another of their Men that was ill of a
dangerous Fever, which they feared might prove
infectious. They did not take any Thing from ns,

as



Capt. Richard Falconer. 113

as we expected at first, only gave us this sick Mart
to look after, which we were very well contented
with. So we parted with them very well satisfied,
but much better when we were out of Sight, fearing
they had forgot themselves, and would send for
us back, and take our Provision from us, or one
Mischief or another ; for Pyrates do not often use
to be so courteous.

Our sick Man mended apace, for we took great
Care of him, and by keeping him low, only with
Water-gruel, his Fever left him ; when I began to
keep up his Spirits with my Cordialsthat I had by
me, and in a Week's Time he was pretty toddy,
(as we call it at Sea). Now we began to converse
with him, and he seemed to be a sensible good-natured
Fellow.

Among other Discourse, we asked him how Captain
M // and his Crew got a Flip ? Said he,

I can only tell the Story as I have heard it (for I was
sick on Shore) ; which is as follows :

Sixteen of our Men got a Paraguay from the
Jians, who hate the Spaniards, being under their
Subjection, and love the French and Englijb very
well ; these set out to seize port the first Ship that
they thought they could compass ; when after being
five trays cruising along Shore, they spied a
1 are Ship weathering Cape Catocb ; but believing it
to be too strong for them, theyrefolved to work by
Stratagem, thus : Twelve Men laid down in the
Boat, as if very faint and weak, and made a Signal
to the Flip, as if in Distress, who very charitably

brought



J 14 The A D V E K T V R E S tf

brought to ; now they had no Arms with them, for
when they resolved to use this Stratagem, they left
them ashore, as making the Pretence more feasible;
so that when they arrived at the Flip, they all
went feebly up, as if not able to Hand ; nay, feme
were obliged to be led, forsooth, to colour the Matter
the better. They then told them that their
Flip was cast away upon Loggerheads Key, about:
three Leagues from Cape Ca/ocb, and saving themselves
in their Beats, they got safe into the Cape;
but that wandering up in the Country, they were
met by the Indians* housed them barbarously,
killing eleven of their Number; and would have
served the rest so, if they had not made their Escape
in that Paraguay that they were so harried for
Want of Food, having been without eating two
Bays, that they feared some of their Companions
would never recover.

The poor Spaniards (wallowed the Bait, and their
Captain, being a very good Man, reiblvcd to relieve
them, and asked him what they would have
him to do for lb cm ? They begged him to land
them on the first Englijb Colony or Island in their
Way. He answered, he was bound for St. Domingo
in Hispaniola ; but that he would put in at Jamaica,
though something out of his Way ; yet, said he, [
don't care for going to any of the noted Ports, be*
cause there is a War talked of between England and
Spain, and though it was not proclaimed, they
might meet with some Trouble. They were mightily
obliged to him, they said, but they did i.ot

know.

know how to return the Obligation, but by praying
or for him and his.

They foiled very lovingly with them for three or
four Days, till at la ft Fortune gave them an Opportunity
to put their Enterprize in Execution. r I hey
had Notice that the Flip leaked mightily* and that
the Water came into the Bread-room ; upon wien,
the Spaniards went down to remote the Bread to
get at the Leak, and did not leave more than five
Men and the Captain above, whom they instantly
seized, and clapped down the Hatches upon the rest.
When they had secured them, they armed themselves
wUU p;&a?< and Lances, which were placed
in the Steerage of the Flip, and so capitulated v>i»h
them ; but sir it, they steered their Course back
again ; that they might not lose any Time. As they
came up, one by one, they bound them, till they
were ais so, but the Captain and the Pilot : The
Captain they confined to his Cabin, with a Centre
to guard him ; but they let the Pilot go loose, that he
might leer the Flip. O inhuman ! cried I ; thus
the Snake in the friendly Bofoni warmed turns and
stings his kind Protector : Thus was their generous
-Heft (if I may call him so) betrayed by his too
much good Nature.

After they had brought the Flip fast to us, we
embarked, and put the Spaniards ashore without
a Morsel to help themselves ; nay, if the Indians
could conveniently meet with them, they would not
leave one alive. I must confess, pursued the Man,
that the barbarous Story Shocked my very Nature,

and

and made me hate their Society; and I really believe
the Abhorrence of this curled Action brought
my Distemper upon me.

How much are some Beasts Acknowledgment of

o

Kindness more than Man ? A poor Cur, fed buta
Crust a Day, will follow the bounteous Hind that
gives it. Ingratitude is the Fountain of all other
Crimes, for from thence flow all the rest* But all
the Knowledge some Men are endowed with, is but
to find the belt Way to deceive. How happy it
would be if such Creatures could (hake off their
Humanity, and become Beads in Form as well as
Mind ; then we mould have a Mark to inn them
by. Our Creator lias formed all Kind of Bewails in
Shapes that tell us what they are : But Men difRr
in their Natures more than Beasts, or are indeed,
under their human Form, the very Natures of the
Brute Creation. How many Villains, under a
smooth Face and Tongue, betray their Brothers ?
The Father cheats the Son, the Son the Father;
Mothers squander the Dowry of their Daughters,
and then prostitute them to gain them Bread , whkh
is not Gain but Punishment : But Ingratitude, like
Murder, meets with its Punishment on Earth, a&
well as in the other World ; and an ungrateful Man
should have a Mark, that all human Society may
fhunhim. I think the Lacedaemonian used to puniib
Ingratitude with Death, as a Crime equal to Sacrilege
or Parricide.

After having taken all their Men on Board, (and
leaving Directions on the Bark of a Tree, for the five

Men that were gone upon the same Design another
Way) we set Sail, and had not been out two Days
before we met with you. Pray r said I, how came-you
among them, if you liked not their Design ?*
Why, Sir, answered he, by Accident; embarking
from Bermudas, bound for St. Catharine, or the Isle
of Providence, we were met with by this Pirate, in a
Flip of twenty Guns, and a hundred and twenty
Men, who took us, and rummaging us, threatened
to turn us adrift without Provision, if we would not
embrace his Designs, winch was Piracy. We, rather
than undergo what he threatened us withal,
consented with our Tongues ; but our Inclinations
were far from it. And from our first being with him,
we were plotting to make our Escape the next Opportunity.
But the other four (being but five in
all our Vessel) were unfortunately killed in that
Engagement, where they lost their Flip, What
Flip was it they fought with ? Why, Firs a Man of
War of twenty-fix Guns, sent out on Purpose to
take her ; for the Captain had committed such Disorders
wherever he came, that he obliged the Governor
of Jamaica to send out the Flip called the
Experiment, to cruise till Ibe met with him : which
(he did about five Weeks ago. Our Captain, as
soon as he saw her, guessed at her Design, and resolved
to fight her to the lad ; well knowing if he
could take or fink her, he might be pretty secure to
range where he pleased, there being never another
Flip of War nearer than Barbadoes ; who. never came
£0 far West. After he had made a Speech to his

Men



1 i 8 The Adventures of

-Men to encourage them to fight it out, and told
them their Advantage, they consented to hoi ft the
bloody Flag, and neither to give or take Quarter,
As soon as ever the Man of War saw our bloody
Flag out, they hoisted theirs, and there ensued a
dreadful Sight. We began about Two o'Clock,
and fought till dark Night, without perceiving any
Advantage on either Side ; and then by Consent lay
by till Morning without fighting: which we did so
nigh, it being calm, that we could talk to one
another; but we did it only in threatening Language.
As soon as the Morning dawned, we went
to it again, with move Fury than before, for our
People fought like desperate Madmen, well knowing
if they mould be taken, they mull all die. The
other Ship fought with a Bravery uncommon ; but
I believe the Advantage was on our Side, though
we had killed on Board us thirty-fix Men.

We fought on till Noon, when we discovered a
Ship about three Leagues to Windward of us,
which bore down upon us with all the Sail they
could. We soon conjectured, they could be no
Friends to us, so without much Confutation, we
resolved to run it before the Wind, with all the
Sail we could make ; as for the Experiment we
fought with, we had put it out of their Power to
follow us, for we had shot their Main Mail by the
Board, so that if the other overtook us, we should
have but one to deal with* We by good Fortune
lad all our Malls firm, and we out-failed the other

Vessel ; bat as soon as she came up with the Experiment
(who never offered to follow us) she said by,
as we suppose to assist her, and we observed through
our Telescopes that (he had Spanijb Colours out.

We soon loll Sight of them, and then we designed
to change our Course, but" were prevented by' the
-Men discovering two Feet Water hi the Hold; who
could not find out 'the Leak, though they searched
with all the DHjgerfce they could : So wee were obliged
to pump, but all that we could do, the Water
still gained upon us j we resolved to bear away to
Jucatan, a Province belonging to the Spaniards, and
feekkout some convenient Place, unfrequented by
them, where we might find out our Leak, and flop

it. * »

J

Notwithstanding our Labour in pumping, the
Water gained upon us ; so we put but our Longboat,
and our Pinnace, in order to put in our provision
; which by Morning we effected, and very
happily for us ; for it was agreed upon all Hands,
that the Flip could not swim about eight Hours;
and though we discovered Land, and were riot above
six Leagues off Shore, yet we were afraid we could i
not reach it, "as the Flip was so heavy with Water. •
So all that could not swim, were ordered in to the
two Boats, with their Arms ; which held in them
thirty^feven Men with-officers. They thai! were
left on Board had Orders to pump as long as they
could-arid run directly in Shore to the Leeward of -

the Ship sunk, and the Men betook themselves to
swimming, whom we met with our Pinnace, and
took up.

I cannot omit one barbarous Action of the Captain's.
There were five Men wounded, who begged
to be taken into the Boat, but the Captain refused
them ; and this was his Reason, as he gave to us in
the Boat : Said he, those five that are wounded,
will take up too much Room, for they cannot sit
as we do, but mud lie along; and another Thing is,
they will take more Time in looking after, than we
can well spare. Besides, as I believe they will not
recover, they will be sooner out of their Pain ;
and if they should recover, added he, they would
help us to devour our Provision, which we must take
particular Care of, for we know not when we (hall
get more. I must confess, this Usage struck me to
the Heart almost, especially as to one of them, who
seemed to have a Sense of his Condition, and repented
of all his pall Crimes.

After we came on Shore, we found that we had
killed on Board us forty-three Men, besides the five
that our Captain barbarously murdered, by leaving
them in the Flip when she sunk. Two of their
Bodies were drove on Shore the next Day, but were
ordered by the Captain to have Stones tied to their
Feet, and carried off Shore and sunk. As soon as
we had made us two Tents with Sails that were put
in the Boat for that Purpose, they began to con fu It
ia what Manner they should get a Flip ; when one

Warren



Capt. Richard Falconer* 121

Warren proposed to take the Boat, and four Men
beside himself, with Arms, and a Week's Provisions,
for he would not have any more, and go to the Bay
of Campechy or Campecby Town, where he did not fear
getting a Vessel for their Purpose; for he said, he
had done so upon the like Occasion before. Whereupon
the Boat and four Men were ordered for
him : but he flaying longer than the appointed
Time, they thought sortie Mischance had happened
to him, so took off their Thoughts of having any
Vessel from him. One Day they 'spied a large Pa
ragusa coming towards Shore with nine Indians and
two Spaniards in it, and finding it come so near,
that they must of Course see them, they immediately
resolved either to take or kill them all, for
Fear they would discover them to the Spaniards
before they had got a Vessel to go off again.

Though 1 must confess there was some
Reason, yet I thought it barbarous to see how
they murdered the two Spaniards and nine Indians.
They put out their Pinnace and ten Men well
armed, to go and take this Paraguay as soon as
ever they were discovered by the Indians, they
jumped over-board, and made towards Shore; but
were shot by our Men, or knocked on the Head
with the Butt-end of their Mufquets. The two
Spaniards had a new Kind of Death ; they tied them
Breast to Breast, and their Hands behind them, and
threw them over board ; where they struggled foi
some Time, and at lait were drowned. I thought

G this

this was a Cruelty exceeding all the Tyrants in the
World, and if I had had a Boat, and our People
fever a one, I would have run any Hazard to have
saved them. Their Paraguay was laden with Flower,
and dried Fish, with several Sides of dried Pork, or
Bacon ; which was too good for the People that
had it. As for my own Part, but little of it came to
my Share, fori was taken ill the second Day after
we came there, arid so weak and feeble, that I did
not expect to overcome it; and if it had not been
for a Black, that was Trumpeter to the Captain, I
should have perished for Want of Sustenance; but
the poor Fcliow frequently would bring me something
or other to nourish me ; and it is to him, under
God, that lowe my Life. He would often tell me that
he did not love that Sort of Life, anguished he could
get rid of his Matter; but said he, if he did but
know I had so much as a Thought that Way, he
would be the Death of me. I believe this was the
only poor Fellow that prayed in the whole Crew.
Ke was christened at Plymouth in England, (and had
very good Notions of Religion) where he was given
to his present Mailer, who had made several V voyages
into the West Indies, for a Plymouth Merchant ;
but at last finding Matters on Shore go but indifferently,
and having killed a French Officer there,
seized upon the Flip he used to command, and with
a Crew of desperate Fellows made off to Sea, and
steered his om Course for tiiC West Indies, and there

than what has been related to you.

Said I, this Fellow's too wicked to have Success
in any Thing, especially when Success mull be an
Addition to his Crimes : If it were possible to know
his Fate, we mould find that he would have some
desperate End : For Men when abandoned by Providence
Divine, though perhaps they may meet with
Tome Success at first, at last find an End that's fitted
for such Wretches who deny a superior Being; and
even Atheists, notwithstanding their human Form,
are no better than Brutes ; nay, I take ari Aibeifi to
have far less Right to Salvation, than those Indian
that pray to the Devil; for they do it through Ignorance,
and worship him with a mere sincere Devotion,
because they know 'tis in his Porter to do
them Harm. With what a fervent Zeal would they
serve the true God, if they knew (as all who profess
Christianity do) that it is in his Power to bellow
Blessings, even after this Life r With what Devotion
they worship the Sun, who they take to be the superior
Deity, because it makes the Earth green, and
is the second Cause of all the Good they enjoy r
Then, with how much more Reverence ought we to
give Praise to that Power that lends Light and genial
Heat to that Planet? If an Atheist \\oxA<& consider the
Works of Nature justly, he would find it an Impossibility
to be so any longer; and to fancy this World

John Rouse was the Name of this Sailor we took
on Board, born at Bermudas. He offered us fine
Proposals, if we would go along with him thither,
but I declined it, as wanting to be with my old
Ship's Crew, and thought of seeing my own Country
again, as I believe all Travellers do, who bring
nothing Home but Misfortunes, or the Vices of the
Places they have travelled through. From this Man
the said Rouse y I had the following short Description
of Bermudas, or the Summer Islands.

Bermudas (the Place of my Birth) or the Summer
Islands, is supposed by some, to take its Name of
Bermudas from certain black Hogs that came out of
a Spanish Ship that was call away on those Shores.
And by others from one John Bermudas , a Spaniard,
the first Discoverer of the Islands. The Name Summer
Stands, is derived from George Summers, an £//-
glffiman, who suffered Shipwreck there. They are
situated in thirty two Degrees, and twenty five Minutes
of Northern Latitude ; sixteen hundred Leagues
from England ; twelve hundred from Madeira;
four hundred from Hispaniola and about three hundred
from B oft on in Newfoundland The Spaniards
s had it first, and after them the French; but the Supplies
that were sent them from France miscarrying by
Shipwreck, they were obliged to abandon the Islands.
After this, one Whitfield, a Merchant in London,
sent in two Ships, Captains Gospel and Smith, with
People to settle there j but there was not much done

by Letters Patent, given by King James the first,
who immediately sent Captain Moor with six ty- five
Men, where he was two Years in fortifying the If-lands
against the Attempts of any Invasion from either
French, Spaniards, or indians* In the mean
Time a Sort of Rats so increased, that they devoured
every Thing that was green in the whole Island,
and had like to have starved the Inhabitants, if Providence
had not timely sent disease among them
that consumed them all. In about three Years after
the first Plantation by Captain Moor, there was sent
them another Supply of Men and Provision, by Captain
Bart let, who returned with a hundred Weight
of Ambergrease. The next Year, there arrived five
hundred Men and Women, with Tradesmen of all
Forts. In 16 j 6, one Tankard succeeded in the Government,
and was very serviceable to the Plantation,
in bringing and planting several Trees, and Tobacco.
He also divided the Country into Acres, and
parcelled it out to the Tenants. It encreased daily
in Culture and Inhabitants. The Form of the If-lands,
as they lie, resembles something of a Lobster
with its Claws off. The chief of the Islands is called
George Island, and is divided into eight Parts,
besides the general Land. 1. Hamilton Tribe, 2.
Smith's Tribe, 3. Devonshire Tribe, 4. Pembroke
Tribe, 5. Paget* s Tribe; 6. Warwick Tribe ; 7.
Southampton Tribe, 8. S unify 9 s Tribe. The Islands
are all surrounded by Rocks, that at high Water are
dangerous to Strangers. The chief Harbours are

St, George's Island, they have built several large and

Ports. The Soil in same Places is Sandy or clayed >
and in other Places A discoloured, White and Black ;
about two Feet deep under the Ash, is found great
Slates, which the Inhabitants make Lie of several
^\Vay$; and under the Black is found a stony substance,
something like a Spunge, or Pumice-stone.
The Wells and Pits, ebb and flow with the Sea,
yet produce excellent fresh Water. The Sky is generally
serene; but when 'tis over-cast they have
dreadful Thunder and Lightning. The Air is much,
the same as with you in, England. They have two
Harvest in the Year : They sow in March, and reap
in junc\ then they sow in August, and gather in January:
And from that Month till May, the Whales
frequently swim by them. They often find great
Quantities of Ambcrgreafc, and feme times Pearl
Oysters. No venomous Creature will live in any
of the said Islands. The yellow large Spiders have
not thereat Venom in them. There's Plenty of all
Sorts of Cattle, both wild and tame, especially
Hogs, who-have mightily encreased since their first
landing; but they are not altogether so fat as we
could wish, feeding only on Berries that fall from
the Palmetto-Trees, which are very sweet. There's
Plenty of Mulberries, both white and red, which
produce prodigious Numbers of Silk Worms ; who
spin Silk of the Colour of the Berry. The Trees
are here of different Kinds ; the Cedar is reckoned

the



Capt. Richard Falconer. 127
the largest in the Universe. The Leaves are downy,
and prickly at the End : The Berries that it produced
are of a pale Red which inclose four white
Kernels ; the outermost Skin is sweet ; the innermost
that contains the Kernel, is sharp ; and the Pulp is
partim. The Tree is always flourishing, being at
the same Time full of Blossoms, green and ripe
Fruit. The Berries when ripe begin to gape, and
fall off in rainy Weather;' leaving a round ;Stalk on
the Boughs, which loses not its Rind till that Time
Two Years after. The Berry requires one Year before
it comes, to its full Ripeness, which happens
about December, The Boughs moot upwards, and ina
little Time are so heavy, that t Key weigh down
the Body of the Tree. There are many Plants,, "as
the Pickle Peat Poison Weed) Red Weed; Purging Bean,
Red Pepper, and the Costive Tree, and the Sea Feather v
which grows on the Brink of the Sea. . There is another
Plant called Luckily, which grows in-the Niches
of the Rocks, washed by the Waves of the Sea,
and produces a Fruit like a Pear, which they' Gill
the Speckled Pear, from its Spots. For.Towls, we
have all Sorts that England produces besides a great
Number of Cranes, larger than any I have teen
elsewhere ; with a Sort of Fowl that lives in Holes
in the Rocks like Rabbits. As for Tortoises, they
are as good there as any where. 'They catch them
in this Manner; they watch for them at Night,
when they come on Shore to dig Holes to bury their
Eggs in ; while they are doing of it, they turn them

Sand, are nourished by the Sun, and never minded
by the Tortoise that lays them ; and as soon as ever
they have broke the Shell, they all run into the Sea.
Some say they are full six Years a hatching. They
are excellent Meat, (for I can't call them Fill) and
very nourishing, and we use the Oil instead of Butter,
which will keep longer, and is reckoned much
wholesome for many Uses. Besides, it is good to

landed at Kindle in Ireland. The French and Spaniards
have made several Attempts upon those Islands ;
lout always were drove away with considerable Loss.

About



Capt. Richard Falconer, 131
About a Month before I embarked for this unfortunate
Voyage, we took a French Pirate, who was
fb insolent as to come into Harrington's Sounds even
at Noon-day, and cut the Cables of a Merchantman,
richly laden, bound for England; but by good
Fortune ran upon the Flats in the Mouth of the
Found, in going out again : So we had Time toman
some Boats with some of the Soldiers of the
Garrison, and send to their Relief, where there happened
a desperate Fight for some Time; but more
Forces going to the Assistance of the others, they
took them after an obstinate Resistance, killing
twenty seven of their Men, and losing eleven of
our own. The Captain made his Escape in his
Boat, in the latter End of the Engagement, when
he perceived his Danger ; but was obliged to go on
Shore on Ireland Island for some Provision, where he
and four Men that were with him, were secured,.
and sent to Tucker's Town; where they were to be
tried the Day I came away.

Two Nights after we had parted with the Pirate,
we were encountered with a dreadful Storm, that
lasted two Days without abating ; and our poor
Bark, which was none of the bell, was tumbled and
tolled like a Tennis-ball, yet we received no Damage,
but that Ihe would not answer the Hei ;
so that we were obliged to let her go before the
Temper, and trull to the Mercy of Heaven for Relief.
This Storm, and the Danger we had escaped
from the Pirate, put me in mind of these four Lines
of the aforementioned Poet, the celebrated Waller :

G 6 JBoJd



132 *The Adventures of

Bold were the Men, which on the Ocean first
Spread their new Sails, when Shipwreck was the worst*
More Danger now from Man alone we find,
Than from the Roc fa, the Billows, or the Wind,

We, in the middle of the Storm discovered Landright
a-Head, which put us all into our Panics;
we endeavoured to bring our Vessel to bear up to
the Wind; but all to no Purpose ; for the Hill drove
nearer to Shore, where we discovered several Tokens
of a Shipwreck, as Pieces of broken Marts,
and Barrels swimming on the Water, and a little
farther Men's Hats; then we began to think we
mould certainly run the same Fate, when, as soon
as thought, our Bark was drove on Shore in a smooth
sandy Bay, but where we had Opportunity to quit
her, which was happy for us ; for the Sea warned
over her with such Violence, we had not any Hopes
of her escaping the Storm, but thought of course
would be torn to Pieces.

When we were ashore, we all concluded it could
bee no other Part but the South of Cuba island, belonging
to the Spaniards. We were then in a terrible
Fright, lest we were near any Part that belonged
to the Indians ; for Mr. Mufgra>ve assured me, that
there were some Parts of the South Side of Cuba, that
Indians dwelt in, in Spite of the Spaniards, and
massacred them wherever they met them, or any
other Whites. We lay all Night in terrible Fear,
and though we found the Storm abated, or rather a

Calm



Capt. Richard Falconer. 133

Calm succeeded, yet we durst not Mir till the Moon
rose, and then we all walked towards our YelTel,
which we found all on one Side ; but by good Fortune
most of our Provisions were dry, which mightily
rejoiced us ; but all the Vessels Rigging and Malls
were fluttered and torn in Pieces, and some Part of
her Quarter wrung off, that she could not be of any
Use to us if we could have got her upright. But
we took out all our Provision, and our Arms, with
two Barrels of Gun powder that was dry, the rest
being damaged with Water and Sand that had got
in. We had Arms enough, as having them that
belonged to the three Sailors that were taken in the
Pirate, which we supposed they had forgot; so we
were six Men well armed, with each a Musket, a
Case of Pistols, and a Bayonet ; besides two cutlasses,
if Need were.

By that Time we had taken every Thing out,
Day approached, and then we designed altogether,
well armed, to go and view the Country. John
Roi'fe was very well recovered of his Fever, but a
little weak, yet his Heart was as good as the best
of us. So we resolved, if we were set upon by Indians,
to defend ourselves to the last Drop of Blood,
choosing rather to die by their Hands in Fig fit, than
to be tortured after the Manner as they inflict: upon
all the Whites they get into their Hands. But tfiil
we had some Hopes that we were too far towards
the Northward for them.

When we had placed our Provision and other
Necessaries safe behind a Tuft of Trees that grew

close



134 So Adventures of

close by the Water side, we fixed our Arms, and
ventured to walk up in the Country, which we
did almost every Way that Day, four or five Miles ;
but could not discover any living Creature, nor
any Sign of Inhabitants, only in one Place the
Grass seemed to be lately trodden, but whether by
Man or Beast we could not discover, so being
pretty well tired, we went back again to our
Station, where we ate heartily, and at Night we
laid ourselves upon the Grass, and fell asleep ; for
we durst not lie upon the Sails we had got for that
Purpose, because they wfcre not dry, though spread
all Day long.

I was awakened the next Morning by a Company
of Lizards creeping over me, which is an Animal
frightful enough to look at, but very harmless,
and great Lovers of Mankind ; they say, that these
Creatures, if any Person lies asleep, and any voracious
Bail, or the Alligator y which comes on Shore
often, is approaching the Place where you lie, will
crawl to you as fall as they can, and with their
forked Tongues tickle you till you awake, that
you may avoid by their timely Notice the coming
Danger. I got up, being roused by these Animals,
and looked about me, but saw nothing but an odd
Kind of a Snake about two Feet long, having a
Head something like a Weasel, and Eyes fiery like
a Cat's ; as soon as it spied me it ran away, and
my Dog after it ; but I believe put it in a terrible
Fright, for it made a Noise something like a

Weasel,



Capt. Richard Falconer, jjj

Weasel, but louder, which awakened my Companions.
When I told Mr* Mufgra<ve what I had seen,
he said it was a small Serpent, but not very hurtful
called the Guabimquinaze Serpent, from eating a little
Creature of that Name, something resembling a
small Mole; and the Indians and Spaniards eat of
them, and reckon them dainty Food.

We now resolved for another Walk, to discover
what Inhabitants were our Neighbours, whether Indians
or Spaniard's ; if Indians we designed to patch
up our Boat, which had several Holes in it, and
make off as fast as we could, and row Northward,
till we came to some Place inhabited by Spaniards*
But if we found the latter, to beg Protection, and
some Means to get to Jamaica; whereupon we ventured
out with these Resolutions, We met with
several fine large Cedar Trees, and one particularly:
so large,, that Mr. Mufgra*ve and I could butjuft
fathom it with our Hands joined.

We had not gone far before my Dog began to
bark* when turning my Head on one Side, I
beheld a Black approaching towards us, and being
startled at the Sight, I cocked my Piece, and resolved
to fire at him ; but he called to me in Errglijb y
and told me he did not come to do me any Harm,
but was a poor distressed Englishman that wanted
Food, and was almost starved, having eat nothing
but wild Fruit for four Days. Upon that I let him
come near, where he was con known by Mr. Roujg
to be William Plymouth, the Black that was
Trumpeter co the Captain that commanded the



1 36 7 he Adventures of

Pirate Ship. Upon his knowing him, we sat down
and gave him some Provision, which we had
brought with us, because we deigned to be out all
Day.

After he had refreshed himself a little, we asked
him how he came into this Island ? Why, answered
he, we were cruising about Cuba, in Hopes of some
Spanish Prize, when a Storm arose and drove us
upon a Rock, where our Flip was beat to Pieces,
and not above eighteen Men saved besides the Captain.
And did that wicked Wretch escape the
Shipwreck, said I ? Yes, answered Plymouth, but to
undergo a more violent Death. For, said he, as
soon as ever we landed wc wandered up in the
Country to see for some Food, without any Weapons
but a few Cutlasses, having lost our first Arms ;
but however we ail got something or other to
defend ourselves on Shore, as long Clubs, which
v/e got from the Trees we found in our Walks;
our Captain resolved if he met with any Indians or
Spaniards Huts, that he would murder all that he
found in them, for Fear they mould make their
Escape, and bring more upon us. Thus he encouraged
his Men to follow him with their Clubs ; said
he, we will walk till we find some beaten Path,
and there lie hid till Night, when we may go on to
some Iioufcs, and come upon them undiscovered .
by which Means we may get Provision and other
Arms : For the Indians of Cuba use Fire Arms as
well as the Spaniards, and are full as dextrous in
using them as an Europeans, Sec. After travelling

about



Capt. Richard Falconer. nj

about ten Miles to the N. W. we discovered a Path,
upon which a Halt was commanded, and to retire
into the Woods again till Night; which we did,
and dined upon what Fruits we could get upon the
Trees.

About two Hours before Night a Dog smelled us
out, and running away from us, barked moil furiously
; upon that we were afraid of being discovered,
which Fear proved true ; for in half an Hour, or
thereabouts, after the Dog left us, we were saluted
with several Ajiows and Mufquet-Shot, that killed
us three Men, and wounded me in the Foot, but it
proved the Means of saving my Life : For as icon
as our Men perceived what had happened, they ran
as hard as they could to meet the Danger, as knowing
they could do no good till they came to
Handy-blows ; I, in endeavouring to follow
them, found my Hurt, which prevented my
keeping up with the rest ; but I could hear
and see them at it: There were about two
hundred Indians set upon our Men, and in about
half an Hour killed them every one. I saw the
Captain lay about him desperately, but at last fell,
being run through the Throat with a wooden Stake.
As soon as ever they had conquered them, or rather
murdered them, they fell to Gripping of them as
fast as they could, and canted them off, together
with their own Dead, which were many, for the
Engtifo sold their Lives very daily.

After they were gone, which I found by their
Screaming and Noilc at a Distance, I ventured to

Ideal



The Adventures of
steal out from behind a Row of Bushes, where I had
placed myself to see what had happened ; I went to
the Place of Battle, where I found two of our Men
that they had left, with all their Arras, and feme
of their own ; so I took up one of their be ft \'uf-
quits, and a Cutlass, and made farther into Wood,
for Fear of being caught ; which I had certainly
been, if 1 had staid a Quarter of an Hour longer,
for 1 soon heard them come whooping, screaming,
and hallooing back, to fetch the other two Bodies,
and their Arms, as I conjectured,

J walked as far as my hurt Foot would let me
that Night, and out of the Danger of the Indians,
as I thought, and then laid me down to sleep as
well as I could, being very angry, and sad ly tired,
and slept pretty well till Morning, when I proceeded
forward in my painful Journey, and directed my
Course N. E. thinking that was the best Way to
avoid the Indians, and probably to meet with some
Spaniards, whom I knew inhabited towards the
North, the Havana, the capital City of the whole
Island, being seated there. I wandered for four
Days, eating nothing but Fruit in the Woods ; but
laying myself down about an Hour ago, to rest
myself a little, I thought I heard the Tongues of
Englijhmen, which to my great Joy proved true. I
left my Mufquet behind the Bushes, for Fear of
alarming you ; but now, after returning God and
you Thanks for this timely Nourishment, 1*11 go
and fetch it, which he did ; and we might easily
know it to be an Indian Piece, for they had rudely

carved



Capt. Richard Falconer. 759

carved it all over with several Figures of Birds and
Beasts.

Now, said I to my Companions, you see the
Reward of Wickedness. He was not furthered by
Providence to go on long in his Crimes ; though
some that are inured tolls, yet they are overtaken ac
last, when their Crimes are full blown; for though
Justice has leaden Feet, yet thffrlwzys find the
has iron Hands ; and we too often see tha^he who
kills his Adversary in a Duel, though he escapes
the Law, one Time or other meets the same Fate
himself.

After poor Plymouth had refreshed himself, we
set forward, and walked along till we came to a
Road that seemed to be the main Road of the
leland, by the Largeness. Here we consulted
what we mould do, whether we Should go on, or
return for more Provision ; but we resolved to go a
little Distance from the Road, for Fear we should
meet with more of the Indians, and run the same
Fate with the Other Englijhmen* But Plymouth told
us, we were a great Way from that Place where
his Countrymen were killed ; (for Plymouth* though
born in Guinea* would always call himself an En
gUjhmatt) as being brought over very young,) so
we resolved one and all to venture.

We sent up oar Prayers to the Almighty for our
Safety, and went on with a Faith that we Should
come off with Success ; but we had not gone far
when we heard the Reports of several Mufquets,
and shouting in a barbarous manner, behind us.

Looking



140 The Advent v r c s of

Looking that Way, we saw a Mulatto riding as fall
as ever his Mule could carry him ; when he came
up to us, he Hopped, and cried in Spanish, Make
hale, run, for the huh am are coming upon you,
they have killed several Spaniards already, and they
are righting with them. Mr. Mufcrave, who under
ft 00 d Spamjb very well, interpreted what he laid
to us; he afkq&feim how far they were off? He
answered, just by ; and hearing another Shout,
put Spurs to his Mule, and left us in an Instant.
We found by the Shouting and the Firing, that they
wcuid be immediately upon us, so we retired out
of the Road to let them pass, and laid down upon
our Bellies that they might not discover us. Immediately
came by about twenty Spaniards on Horseback,
pursued by near a hundred Indians. • Just as
they came by us one Spaniard dropped, and crept into a
Bush on the other Side of the Road; and presently
the Indians followed, shouting in a horrid Manner,
and overtook the Spaniards again, who being very
swift of Foot, out-run an ordinary Horse ; and
they had thrown away their Fire-Arms, to make
them the lighter to run, as we supposed. The
Spaniards knew they would soon overtake them,
so only can to charge their Pistols, and stand till
they came up; then discharged them, to put them
in Confufion, and run again, to prolong the Time,
in Hopes of some Aid. All this we understood by
the Spaniard, that crept into the Bush undiscovered
by the Indians, by Reason of the Horses Feet, and
the Dust together, he being the foremost in Flight.

He



Capt. Richard Falconer. 141

He told us moreover that about three Leagues
farther, there was a Sort belonging to the Spaniards
to flop the Indians, they ufmg to make Inroads
before that Sort was built, even to the Gates
of the City Savanna* Upon this we consulted and
resolved to follow upon the Edge of the F^oad, to
see how we could be aiijilin? ; we soon came even
with them, for they were in a narrow Place, and
the Spaniards kept them at Bay pretty well ; by-good
Fortune there was a high Hedge made by-trees
all along as we went, which hindered us
from being discovered. Here we resolved to fire
upon them all together, and then run further up,
and if possible get out into the Road and face them.
Accordingly we agreed to fire four and three, and
the sir 11: four to charge again immediately. Mr. Margrave,
Mr. Middleton, hlxAFhite, and myself, agreed
to fire first ; then Hood, Vase, and Plymouth ; which
as soon as we had taken good Aim, we did,
and, firing at their Backs, killed four downright,
and wounded several, for I had ordered them to
put two Bullets into each Piece, As soon as ever
we had fired our Mufquets, we let fly one Pistol
each, and then the other three fired their Guns.
As soon as Plymouth had fired, he ran and charged
our four Guns, (he having never a Pistol) and then
we let fly our other Pistols. With these Discharges
we had killed at least fifteen Indians, and put the
rest into such Frights that they began to run ; (for
with the Dull and Battle they made, they could
hardly distinguish from whence the Fire came)

neither



14* The Adventures of

neither did they flop till they met with the poor
wounded Spaniard, who had crept out, hearing the
Discharges our Pieces, (as we supposed) ; they fell
upon the poor Fellow with Shouts and Outcries, and
tore him to Pieces, never minding the Spaniards pur faint
them ; who cried Miranda! Miracula! a Miracle!
a Miracle ! By this Time we got within twenty
Yards of the End of the Hedge, where we seven
fired our Mufquets, and left them to Plymouth to
charge ; then we ran in upon them with our Pistols,
and discharged them close upon them. With this
last Fire we dropped them twelve Men, and they
screamed out, and ran away as sad as they could.
We did not think fit to follow them, for it was not
to any Purpose, for they were soon out of Sight,
We charged our Guns and Pistols again, and the
twelve Spaniards did the like, they having Nine in
the la/l Conflict killed, and two desperately
wounded. They gave us Thanks for our Rescue,
and said we were surely sent from Heaven to their
Relief ; they let us know they were Tax-gatherers
for the King of Spain, and were obliged to go in
Numbers, and well armed, for Fear of these
desperate Indians; who, about nine Years ago,
set upon them, and killed eighteen of them,
and but two escaped, but never met with any
Molestation from that Time till now; so that
this Time (thinking the Danger over) we lessened
our Number from fifty to thirty, which I suppose
the Indians having Notice of, was the Occasion of

their



Capt. Richard Falconer. 143

their setting upon us. They said it was to no purpose
for to go back, for the rest of their Companions
that were killed, which being a Mile off,
they had taken with them.

We had not gone above half a League onward,
but we heard dreadful Shouting as before, and
looking behind us, it being a strait Road, we could
perceive a Cloud of Dull, and the Indians running
full Speed toward us. Upon which we put down
our two wounded men that were on Horseback,
and mounted upon the Spaniards spare Horses.
Now we being nineteen Horsemen, resolved to
island it : We divided into Ranks, four in a Rank,
which made five Ranks; only there were but three
in the last Rank. So we resolved to keep directly
one behind the other, and when the first File had
fired, to fall in the Rear, and charge again The
Spaniards would make up the three fir ft Ranks, as
they said they could not in Honour expose us to the
first Onset, because we ventured our Lives in coming
to their Assistance. We had no Time to dispute, for
now they were just upon us, and to our Surprize had
several Fire-Aj ms among them. As soon as they got
within a hundred Paces of us they fired, but not
above two of their Pieces went off, the rest were
clogged with Dull in running, that very happily for
us hindered their Discharging. The Shot missed
us providentially, and we would not give them
Time to charge again, but we moved forward and
fired in upon them, and did great Execution ; when
it came to our Turn to fire, we in the Heat forgot

our:



144 The Adventures of

our Orders, but after we had discharged our Guns
and Pistols, we fell in with them with our Cutlasses,
and being raised above them by being on Horseback,
did great Execution ; and that with the Spaniards
charging and firing again, put them to the
Rout ; but now we followed them being on Horseback,
and dispersed them, so that it was impossible
for them to rally any more that Night. However
we took four of them Prisoners, and tying their
Hands behind them, fattened them to two of our
foremost Horses, the rest following after, that they
might not get loose.

We were met in the Road by twenty Spanish
Horse, with each a Foot Soldier behind them, .who
were upon the full Gallop to our Assistance, being
alarmed by the Mulatto that rode by ; but I believe
some were glad they came too late. The Officer
and the rest saluted us very courteously, when they
heard how luckily we came to their Assistance ; but
fell a whipping the poor naked Indians so barbarously,
that though they deserved it, I could not
bear to see it done in cool Blood, and though the
Blood followed every Lam, yet they never cried out*
This is the chief Cause of the Hatred of the Indians f
when ever the Spaniards get any of them in their
Power, they put them to all Manner of Torture;
but if, on the contrary, they would use them civilly,
and discharge them now and then, I am sure
they might live in perfect Friendship with them :
For the Indians are good natured, loving, and affable,
till they are incensed, and then they are implacable,


We



Capt. Richard Falconer. 145
We arrived at the Fort about Evening, and were
very well entertained. The Officer did not doubt
but to procure us a Flip to transport us to Jamaica,
though he had Orders from Savannah to secure aU
English Vessels, there being a War talked of between
the Spanish and French, and English and Dutch. The
next Day the Officer mightily bragged of being an
old Spaniard, that is, born in Spain, and of an ancient
Family ; and Mr. Mufgrave made us very
merry upon the Road, in interpreting the Don's
Speeches. We found, all along from the Fort, a
great many Gentlemen Houses pleasantly situated,
and the Country all along yielded delightful prospects.


We were well entertained at a Gentleman's House
at Dinner, with Provisions defied after the English
Way, and all Manner of Sweetmeats and cool
Wines. The Gentleman had a Vault or Cellar
thirty Feet deep under Ground. He spoke pretty
good English, and had , been a Factor several Years
in London, and knew our Customs and Manners very
well, and preferred our Way of dressing Victuals
before their own. He had an English Cook from a
Tavern behind the Royal Exchange, that he brought
with him into Spain, and from thence to Cuba,
where he had a. vast Estate left him. His Cook's
Name was Hodges, a good understanding Fellow,
and made very much of us, and would fain have
had us to slay with his Matter longer. But as
soon as we had dined, we were obliged to get on
Horseback, act away for the Ha-vanna, which we
reached about six o'Clock in the Evening. We had

H Rooms



1 46 The Adventures of

Rooms allotted us, and several English? and Irish Men
came to see us that lived there.

Havana is the capital City of the whole Island of
Cuba, and has as great a Trade as any Place belonging
to the Spaniards in the Weft-Indies. It has one of
the finest Harbours in the Universe, not for its
Greatness, but its Security, yet able to contain five
Hundred Ships of the greatest Burthen. The Mouth
of the Harbour is comma ded by a Platform ; and a
square Fort, fastened together by a strong Boom, or
Iron Chain; that no Ship can enter. The most shallow
Part of the whole Harbour, is eight Fathom
Wester, and all its Banks paved round with f at
Stone, so that a Vessel of a Thousand Tun may lay
her Side to it and unlade. Just between the two
Forts there Hands a round Watch Tower, where
they discover to the Town how many Vessels are
coming towards the Harbour, by putting out a Flag
for every Ship. This Place is the best fortified and
garrisoned in all the Indies, to secure the Plate Fleet,
and all other Ships that meet here, to set sail together
for Spain, This City is very large, near as big
as Bristol in England, and the Houses are handsomely
built; but after the Spanish Fashion. There
are two handsome Churches, fine, and well
built, with Spires, and an Organ in each, besides
several Chapels ; and a Foundation laid for a third
Church while we were there. This City, almost as
soon as it was built, was sacked by a Trench Pirate
in the Year r 5 36, who was driven thither by a
Tempest, and landing his Men well armed, took
the City in Spite of all their Refinance, and burnt

many



Capt. Richard Falconer. 147

many of the Houses, they being mod part Wood ;
and had consumed them all, had not the Spaniards
redeemed the rest, by paying them a thousand Ducats,
Upon the receiving the Money, they made
out to Sea, and the same Evening came into the Ha-canna
three Ships from Spain, who hearing of what
had chanced, prepared to follow them, taking several
Soldiers on board them ; the Admiral, who sailed
belt, got the first Sight of the Frenchman ; but being
fearful to attack him before the other Ships came
up, lay by. The Frenchman seeing that, boldly
set upon the first Flip, and took her without
fighting ; the second seeing that, tacked about,
and ran ashore, which was taken by the Flip's
Boat ; the third also run the same Fate, Flushed with
this Success, they returned to the Savannah the second
Time, and exacted a thousand Ducats more, or
elfe they threatened to level the City with the
Ground, which was paid them immediately. Then
they took their last Leave with this rich Booty, and
sailed for Rachel in France, where they shared
their Prizes. After this they built their Houses
with Stone, as they are now, which nevertheless
the English took about twelve Years after.

There are many fair Harbours besides the Savannah,
in Cuba, as that of St. Jago City and Harbour,
which is a handsome Place, seated on the South of
the Island, and is also a Bishop's See under the archbishopric
of St. Domingo, Three Leagues from St.
Jago lie those famous Copper Mountains, called by
the Spaniards, Sierra de Core. There's another Town
and Harbour situated on the EaCern Part of Cuba,

H z called



148 *she Adventures of

called Barca, where they gather the best Ebony of
all the Indies. There are many other good ones, as
St. Salvador, Trinidad, Puerto del Principe, which
Las a Fountain near it, that some Times of the Year
produces liquid Pitch.

Cuba was formerly divided into eight Provinces
and Governments, and better peopled than any other
Mand in America, before the Spaniards invaded
them ; but now there are but few Indians, which inhabit
several Parts of the Island unmolested by the
Spaniards ; but the Natives can never forget their
Barbarity, which they have by Tradition from Father
to Son. Nay, I have been informed that they
keep a solemn Festival once a Year, which was the
Time that the Massacre of the Indians happened ;
and if they can get any Spaniards, they sacrifice them
to satisfy the Manes of their dead Ancestors.

Hugh Linfcoten, the French Voyager, relates that a
Caffick, or one of the Lords of a Province, caught a
Spaniard at their first Landing, and threw him into a
River, to see if he would drown, which he did, and
that satisfied him they were not immortal. Whereupon
he encouraged his Men, and repulsed the Spa
?hoards several Times with great Loss ; but at last run
the same Fate with the well of the Natives. 'Tis reported
that the Spaniards, first and last, had massacred
sixty thousand Indians in the Island of Cuba.

'La Otftts, a Bishop in NetvSpajn, that wrote the
History of the Indies, tells us this Story of another
Cajfuk, that was taken by the Spaniards in Cuba,
and condemned to be burnt alive with green Wood,
that his Torture might be the longer and more

exquisite.



Capt. Richard Falconer. *49
exquisite. While he was tied to the Stake, before
the Fire was lighted, the Fryar that was present
preached to him the Truth of the Christian Religion,
and that all who died in that Faith, and trusted in
God that formed the Earth, and all the Creature*
therein, should immediately after their Purgation
ascend into Heaven, the Residence of our Creator,
there to converse with Angels, and such as died in
that Faith ; but on the contrary, if they persisted in
Ignorance, and died in a contrary . Opinion, they
should descend into Hell, and live in an Eternity of
Torments. Upon this the Caffick asked him if there

were *ny Spaniards in Heaven > And b<M*ng answered

there were many; when, said the Caffick, let me goto
Hell, fori would rather converse with those you
call Dtt ils, than you Spaniards in Heaven ; for I am
fury you are the world of Devils, and take Delight
in nothing but tormenting us. Though the Fryar's
preaching was certainly true, yet Men of any Reason
must conclude, that no Religion can be propagated by-cruelty
and the Sword, which was always the Spa*
wards Method with the Indians, wherever they came;
and all their Excuse was, that if they had not used
them in that Manner, they'could never have made
their Conquests, for they were forced to lcfTert
them, for fear their Numbers might overpower
them ; so that in short, as Dryden says, ia his conquest
of Mexico by the Spaniards, You threaten Peace,
but yon invite a H r ar.

I met there with a Priest, that I am sure harboured
nothing of Cruelty in his Bread, for he came to see

us every Day, and in such a friendly Manner, that
charmed us all. He was always lending us one
good Thing or other, and would take us to divert
us abroad. He understood Lain very well, and
some E?jglifb. On the Sunday he preached an excellent
Sermon in Spanish as Mr. Mvfgraw informed
us, whose chief Heads ran upon us, and to excite
Charity in the Auditors, to let us have what was
necessary in carrying us to Jamaica. The next Day
he brought us to the Value of fifty Pounds in Spanijb
Dollars, which were collected at the Church
Doors for us. There was a small Vessel of about
forty Ton upon the Stocks, that was bought of the
Owners for us, and a Collection made in the Town
for Money to pay for it. We told them of the provision
we had left on Shore, which by our Computation
could not be above twenty Leagues off ; but
they told us it would be difficult to find it. One
Day a Spaniard met us walking with Father Antonio %
in one of the Cloisters of the Convent, and reprimanded
him for favouring Hereticks (as he called us)
so much. He thought none of us understood
so was more free in his Conversation. Said
Father Antonio* We ought to use Charity even to
Brute Beasts, and much more to our Fellow Creatures,
who wear with us our Creator's Image ; I
would not be thought to make a Schism in our Religion,
which I am sure is the holiest and moll
pure; but yet 1 cannot consent in my Thoughts,
that all who are out of the Pale of our Church must
suffer Damnation ; it would be horrid to think it,

and would take away from the Lustre of our Opinion,
which shines so brightly. If they are in any
Errors, concerning their Belief, God, in whose
Breast it lies, can open their Eyes when he thinks
fit, that they may see those Errors. Then added
the Spaniard, with the same Reason you may say
the Indians and Natives may stili remain in Ignorance,
till Heaven shall think fit to open their Eyes,
as you say ; and if so, the Missionary Fathers may
spare their Trouble, No, replied the Father, Weare
there appointed by Providence to bring them
out of the Cloud that dims their Fights But of
People that own Christ, and fer ye. the, same God
with us, who differ but in a few outward Forms 0/
Worship, it is very hard to believe that those intruded
in that Worship, mull inevitably fink into
Damnation. I can't tell what the Spaniard's
Thoughts were upon this Discourse,. but I am sure
he , was more charitable tJ^an before, : for he .pulled
out of his Purse Moidore,. and gave Father Antonio
for our Vfe> which it seems he had refused to do,
when he went about collecting for us After he
was gone, he told us his Discourse pro and con, and
what he could not make out in Englijb^ t Mr* Margrave
cleared -O h us from the other's telling him in
Spanish what he meant. f .

We were told our VeiTel was ready, and therefore
might bfl, going when,. we pleased It was. a very
neat one as ever was built by the Spaniards, and

We had all Sorts of Provision sent on Board for
half a Year, or more, so that vvc only laid for the
Wind to rise, it being quite calm.

While we staid there, the four unfortunate Indian*
were to be executed in the Midst of the Parade.
They were first to be dragged by four Horses, nailed,
alorig the great Street to the Parade, and then
to be chained to a Post, fixed for that Purpose, and
burnt to Death ; I must confess, when I saw with
what barbarous Cruelty they designed to use them,
I repented my being an Instrument in the taking of
them. This Execution was ordered to be between
seven and eight in the Evening, being then it was
coolest : All the Indian Slaves that served Spanish
Masters in the Town, were ordered to go and be
Spectators of the Tragedy, that they might see
what they must expect, if they ever offered to rebel
in the like Manner When the Time came, the
whole Street was crowded with a vast Number of
People of all Conditions. But such a Sight 1 never
desire to see again ; each Indian was tied by the Feet
to the Harness of the* Horse,' and so dragged from
the Prison to the Place of Execution upon the bare
Stones naked, their Arms tied upon their Breasts,
and fattened upon their Backs, that they might not
lift them up to save themselves as they were dragged
along the Stones ; but by that Time the poor Creatures
Came to the Parade •, the Skin of their Legs,
Thighs, and Back, was almost (tripped off, yet
without the least Complaint ; as soon as they were
tied fall to the Stake, they took from a Pot of liquid




Capt. Richard Falconer. 153
quid Pitch, boiling hot, a Stick with something
fattened to the End on't, and rubbed over their
naked Bodies. One of them then, I observed, ,began
to faint, but was rated by another of his
in their own Language, which none
understood but Indians > and the Fellow seemed to
bear it much better. Before the Fire was put to
the Pile, a Fryar stepped up to them, and in Spanifh
spoke to the Indian that was ready to saint before,
who had been Servant in the Town, but run away
from his Matter, and understood Spanijb. The Fryar
desired them, if they would be happy in the other
World, to acknowledge themselves Christians, and

go out of the World in that Faith, Upon this the
Indian answered, ' When I lived among you-said

he) and was taught to worship your God, you

told me he was an upright God, aud a just God

to them that served him faithfully, but an avenging

Power to those that once offended him ; if
so, how comes it to pass that he has not punished
4 you for all your Crimes ? You have taught me,

that Whoring and Adultery were Sins not to be
€ pardoned, and yet you commit those Sins, as if

you were in no Fear of any Punishment. Murder is
4 one of your Commandments not to be forgiven,
« when at the same Time you'll hire a Bravo to kill

a Stranger that looks but wantonly on your
6 Wives. In short, I know not any one Thing
4 that I have heard preached to us poor Indians that
4 you practise yourselves. Therefore if your Spanijb

God be as you described him to us, the Curse rous

fall upon you if we cannot believe in him, being

we are deterred by the Cruelties you inflict upon

us, in serving him as you would have us, when
4 we find your Actions and Words differ more than
our Complexions. You preach up Holiness and

Righteousness, but you practise Debauchery and

Lewdness

He said more, which was to excite the Indians
to rebel, but they put a Flop to it, by putting Fire
to the Wood, which being composed of several
combustible Matters, foot consumed the poor
Wretches.

When all was over, Father Antonio took us home
to his Lodgings, to give us a small Collation for the
pastime, being the next Day we did all design to
lie on Board, in Expectation of the Wind's riling.
We told him by Mr. Mujgra-ve, that we thought ita
great Weakness in them to preach in that Manner
to Indians in their Condition, and it would be apt
to make others despise their Religion ; laid Mr. Margrave,
it is like courting a Woman to Love by
Stripes (pardon the Comparison) : Why, said Father
Antonio, I mull confess it is not what any of our
Fathers like, but it is what we are ordered to do,
and therefore must not be denied. Besides, at nest, it
was a Piece of barbarous Policy in the first Conquerors
of the Indies, they would order the Missionaries
to preach to all Indian Criminals, but out of hearing
of any Spectators; so as soon as they were executed,
they would declare to all the Indians that

they



Capt. Richard Falconer. k;S.

they died Christians, and were happy. Mr. Mus
asked him, What made them use them so inhumanly,
was it not enough that they suffered
Death, but rust be tortured in that barbarous
Manner? He replied, it was done to terrify the
other Indians from any Violence. Mr. Mufgraw
answered, That was certainly wrong, for 'as they
are an implacable Sort of People, and have handed
down to them from Father to Son, the filii Massacre,
though almost two hundred Years ago, they must
needs remember these Cruelties of so frefrTaDate,
which revive in their Memories the former, if they
had any Mind to forget them : He could not say
much to it, hefatd, but evaded the Discourse, by
bidding us be merry, that is, innocently and inoffensive
so, for he did not allow of Disorders in
any one ; so we refreshed ourselves, and took our
Leaves of the good Father, who blessed and embraced
us, and said he would pray to Heaven for
our prosperous Voyage. So on the next Day we
paid our hearty Acknowledgments to all oar Benefactors,
and went on Board ; where we had not
been a Quarter of an Hour, before an extraordinary
Message came from the Governor for Plymouth, our
Black, who went with them without any Hesitation, ,
and returned with a Present from the Governor, of
several Bottles of Arrack, Spanijb Wines, Fowls, Rice,
and Brandy, with twenty Pieces of Spanijb Gold, as
the Lessens-er told us, in Recompense for the Loss
of one of our Companions; for the Governor had
sent for Plymouth, to know if he would serve him in

H 6 Quality



1 56 The Adventures of

Quality of His Trumpeter, and he would settle a
Pension upon him for Lie. Plymouth thought fit to
accept of it, as having* no Mailer, nor knowing
when he should have one : But he got Leave to come
on Board to bid us farewel, which he did in a very
affectionate Manner. I bid him have a Care to
please the Governor, and then he need not fear doing
well ; so we parted with Plymouth, with our
hearty Thanks recommended to Father Antonio for
all his Favours, Plymouth had a Trumpet given
him by the Governor, as soon as he came on Shore,
which he brought with him, and founded all the
Way in the Boat, as he went back again to oblige
us ; for really he founded extraordinary well, and
had learned to play on several other Instruments,
having* a tolerable Undemanding in Musick. We
were sorry to part with Plymouth, as being a faithful
honest Fellow, yet glad he had got so good a Master.
The Wind rising, we weighed Anchor, and
left the Port with three Huzza's, and a Volley of
small Arms, (we having no Cannon) and in two
Days lost Sight of the Island of Cuba*

This famous Island, Cuba, which was first called
Joanna, by Columbus the first Discoverer, afterwards
Fernando, then Alpha and Omega, as. being the
fill and last Island the Spaniards touched at: But
afterwards was called Cuba, anc} Hill retains that
Name. This is reckoned one of the four Islands
of the Barlovcnto* The others are Hispaniola % Jamaica,
and Porto-Rico. The North Side of Cuba is

fortified



Capt. Richard Falconer, 157

fortified with a vast Number of small Islands,
called the Lmaier, which some Geographers have
taken for a Part of the main Land. The chief is
Bahama, which forms the Gdph of Florida, the
Passage that all Ships go through when they come
out of the Weft-Indies into Europe.

Cuba has on the North, Jucatan, a Province on
the main Land, distant about 50 Leagues; and on
the South Jamaica, about 40 Leagues: In Length
220, and in the broadest Part about 56. The Soil
in molt Parrs, that are inhabited by Spaniards, is
fruitful, and much more healthy than Hispaniola.
The Tobacco is reckoned the best in the Spanijb
Weft-Indies. I have seen very large Vines there,
which bear excellent Grapes, but not fit to make
Wine ; many have tried, but it turns four in a few
Days. And for Birds, Beasts, and Fishes, it
comes op to, if not exceeds any of the other
Islands. The Bird Flamingo is a Fowl something
bigger than our ordinary Geese, but Legs and
Neck twice as long, and all over red, and generally
go in a Body. At a Distance they look like a
Company of Soldiers marching. The Spaniards
have a Proverb here, That the Time will come
that Englijhmen will walk as freely in their Streets,
*as the Spaniards do now ; if it were so, it would be
of a prodigious Advantage to the EngUJb, being
the Havanneib is a Strait that commands all the Ships
that come out of the Indies for Europe, and I really
think from what I have seen, that it would be in
the Power of ten thousand Men, with a Fleet proportionable,

personable, to overcome the whole Island in a
little Time. Besides it is observed, that there are
more Prizes brought into the Havamwb> than any
four Havens in the Indies.

While we were at the Savannah, a Spaniard carried
two strange Beasts about the Streets for a
Show, that he brought from Brazil, the one was
called At y with a Head something resembling that
of a Man's, and covered with rough short grey
Hair : Each Foot has three Claws close together,
about a Finger long, very sharp Teeth, with a
smooth high black Nose, very small sleepy Eyes,
and no Ears, with a Tail small above and broad at
the Bottom, with Hair all over the Body of an
Ash Colour, This Beast is about the Size of a
large Fox, but so lazy a Creature, that when it
gets up a Tree, it never comes down till it has
devoured every Leaf, and when it has done, it
will sit there twenty Days together without eating,
and almost starved before it will take the Pains to
go down to feed. It cannot travel or creep in a
whole Day not above a Quarter of a Mile. This
that was mown to us, never would stir till roused
with a Stick, and it would be asleep again in an
Instant.

The other Creature was something like a Baboon,
but considerably larger, with a Face and long Beard,
like an old Man's, and hairy like a Goat, all over
the Body; his Ears bald, his Eyes black, large,
and sparkling. He that showed it to us, called it a
Cayon\ its Tail is about four or five Feet long,

which



Capt. Richard Falconer. 159

which they twist round a Tree, and so fling them*
selves to the next They are very fierce and subtile,
and when wounded, will set upon their Adversary
without any Fear; and if forced to climb the
Trees, they carry their Mouth and Hands full of
Scones to throw at Travellers as they pass by ; and
when wounded, they set up a Shriek, that immediately
brings all of their Kind, within Hearing,
to their Succour, who flop the Wound with Leaves
and Moss, which will soon be healed. This that
we saw war. brought up very young by the Person
that had him, and would play many comical
Tricks ; as he was shown to us, he urine in his
Paw, and threw it in our Faces, before we were
aware, and while 1 was wiping mine, he gave me
such a Salute with his Tail, that made me stand
farther off, which seemed to please him mightily,
for he looked at me and chattered, as much as to
say, I have given it you. The Spaniard told us,
they used to play at a certain Game with the Natives
for Money, and would often win, and then
go spend what they had got, upon a Liquor that
made them drunk, and as soon as they found themselves
so, they would retire very decently, and take
a Nap, by which they were very often caught.

Joseph de Costa, that wrote the History of the
Weft-Indies in Spamjb, tells us a Story of one of
these Sort of Creatures going to a Tavern, with a
Pot, and Money to pay for his Wine, yet would
not part with his Money, till they had filled his
Pot with the Wine ; b ut in the mean Time beat

four



160 ¥be Adventures of

four or five Boys, that did their Endeavour to take
it from him, and carried it safe to them that lent
him.

Peter Martyr relates another Story of one of
them, that seeing a Spaniard going to lire a Gun
at him, snatched up a little Child that was there,
and held it before him as a Buckler, and would not
let it go before the Spaniard was retired ; then he
laid the Child gently down, and ran away, after
having first urine upon it.

The Fellow that Showed them, sold them to the
Governor of Savannah for two hundred Dollars,
and would have gone witch us to Jamaica or anywhere;
but we durst not take him without an Order
from the Governor, who does not suffer any one to
go out of the Island without a Pass from him,
which costs a Dollar, and brings into his Purse a
great deal of Money in the Year, having no other
Revenue from the King of Spahi % only lb much a
Year for a Table, and a Palace ready furnished
with every Thing that is necessary, bolides Servants.
Every Ship that comes in pays two Dollars, and at
going out four more, so that the Government of
this Island exceeds in its Profit any other Government
(except the Vice-roy of Mexico) in the Spanish
Wcjl-indies.

The Weather continued favourable, so that we
arrived at Jamaica without meeting any thing remarkable
in our Passage * As soon as we had cast
Anchor, I ordered the Boat to be made ready to

carry



Capt. Richard Falconer. 161

carry me on Board my own Ship, which I saw ride
there. But when I got up the Flip's Side, I found
my Cloaths selling at the Mast, at, Who bids mere?
Which is the Method, as soon as a Person is dead,
or killed; the first Harbour they anchor in, the
Cloaths of the Deceased are brought upon Deck,
and sold by Auction,* the Money to be paid when
they come to England, for it generally happens
that Sailors have not any till they come Home
again.

They were at the lad Article, when I came up
the Flip Side ; which was a Pair of black Worsted
Stockings that cost I believe about four Shillings,
which went at twelve and Six-pence, though they
had been worn. As soon as I was seen by them,
sortie cried out, a Ghost ! a Ghost ! and others ran
away to secure the Cloaths they had bought, suspecting
that now I would have them again. When
they were satisfied Of my being alive, and were
told my Story, they were all rejoiced at my good
Fortune, but none would be prevailed upon to let
me have my Cloaths again. So I took up the
Slop-Book, and cast up what they were sold for,
and found; that what cost me about twenty Pounds,
were sold for four times the Money : When I was
satisfied in that, I called every Person, one by one,
that had bought any of my Cloaths, and struck a
Bargain with them for ready Money, and bought
them for about ten Pound ; but the ready Money
pleased them mightily.

Captain



i6z The Adventures of

Captain Vase being sick ashore, I went to pay
him a Visit, where he was mighty glad to see me r
as believing I had perished ; he told me that the
Vessel hung Lights out for several Hours, that I
might know where to swim, and laid by as long as
the Wind would permit, as the Crew acquainted
him when they came into Harbour* The Captain
told me, That he did not think he mould livelong,
therefore was mighty glad I was come to take
Charge of the Flip, which had failed before, if he
had been in a Condition to bear the Sea. From
thence I went on Board my new Bark, and fettled
my Affairs there with my Companions, who were
mighty sorry to think of parting "with me. Hood
and Rouse desired they might be received on Board
as Sailors, and go for England with us ; for Hood
was an Englishman, I mean, born in England, and
Rouse had Friends there. Besides it was as easy to
go from England to Bermudas, as from Jamaica. So
I spoke to the Captain, who was very well pleased
to receive them, for he had lost five Men by the
Distemper of the Country. The poor Captain
died in a Week after my coming, and left me Executor
for his Wife, who lived &t£r/Jlol.

As soon as we had buried him, I went on Board
with my two Men, and did design to fail in three
.Days at farthest, which I would have done before,
but that I was hindered by wanting a Chapman for
our Bark, being we had Shares to dispose of ; when
I came on Board, the Master told me he had no
Occasion for the two Men to add to their Charge ;

said



Capt. Richard Falconer. 163

said I, that is as I Shall think fit, for the Power is
in my Hands now; and who put that Power into
your Hands ? (said the Mailer). He that had Power
so to do (said I) the Captain, whereupon I shewed
him in Writing. He told me it did not signify
• any thing, and that he would find no one of the
Sailors would obey a Boy, incapable to steer a
Vessel. Said J, 1 don't desire to have any Command
over you, but only to represent the Captain
that is deceased : We have no Want of any Representatives
(replied the Mailer), and you shall go in
your own Station, or not at all. It would be a
pretty Thing, added he, for my Mate to become
my Captain, and as I was designed by the Captain
,to have ik* Command of the V^flel before you
came, so I intend to keep it. Rut, said I, this
Paper, signed by' his own Hand, is but of two
Days Date, and you cannot shew any thing for the
Command, is you pretend to: Therefore (said I)
I'll make my Complaint to the Governor, and he
shall right me. Ay, ay, do so ! (said he) Til Hand
to any thing he shall command. Whereupon Rouse*
Hood and myself went into the Boat agaiiv and
rowed immediately on Shore ; but the Governor
was six Miles up in the Country, and it being
pretty late, we designed to wait for his coming
Home, which we were told would be in the Morning
early. So I went on Board the Bark, and lay-all
Night, the Flip, lying beyond the Keys two
Leagues from the Harbour, in order to sail. The
next Morning getting up with an Intent to wait

upon



1 64 72" Adventures

upon the Governor, and looking towards the Place
where the Flip lay over Night, found she was
gone, and calling my Eyes towards Sea, saw a
Ship four or five Leagues distant from us, which
we supposed to be ours. I immediately went on
Shore, and found the Govei nor jail come to Town,
and made my Complaint. He told me there was
no Remedy, but to send immediately to Bkzvfe/ds
Bay, where he supposed they would flop to get
Wood, which was usual with our Ships that were
bound for England: Whereupon there was a Messenger
ordered for Blewfelds> which I accompanied,
to give Intrusions to the Officer that commanded
at the Fort, to seize the Mailer of the Flip, and
order him before the Governor at JW Royal: Ss
we got on Horse-back, and reached it in three
Days,, it being almost a hundred Miles, When
we came there, we found several Ships in the
Harbour, but none that we wanted: So we waited
a Week, but all to purpose, for (he passed the
Bay, as mistrusting our Design; upon this we were
obliged to return with a heavy Heart, and tell
the Governor of our ill Success, who pitied me,
and told me he would see me (hipped in the first
Vessel bound for England: So I went on Board my
own Bark, where they were all glad to see 1 me,
though sorry I was so disappointed. Now I was
very glad that I had not disposed of my Bark, for I
thought now it might be of Use to me., We confuted
together, to know what was belt to do; at
last I made a Bargain with them, if they would

venture



Capt. Richard Falconer. 165

venture with me in our Bark to England, I would
give them not only my Share of her, but as much
Money as came to the other two Shares, if they
would be willing to part with them : Upon this
we agreed, and with what Money I had, I began
to lade my Vessel with Things to traffick with. I
bought a good Quantity of Indigo, some Cotton,
Sugar, and Rum. In short, I laid out the best
Part of my Money ; and on June the gift, 1700, set
sail, and steered our Course for England.

Before I leave Jamaica, I think it will not be a-
miss to give some Account cf the dreadful Earthquake
that happened there in 1692. I am sure it is a true
Account of it, for it was wrote by the Rector of
Port Royal's own Hand, who was upon the Place
when the Accident happened. You shall have it in
his own Words.

From on board the Granada Merchant in
Port Royal Harbour, June 22, 1692.

Dear Friend,
c r DOUBT not but you will hear both from

A Garret's and Bris's Coffee-house, of the
€ great Calamity that hath befallen this Island by a
< terrible Earthquake on the 7th Instants Which
have thrown down almost all the House, Churches,

Sugar Works, Mills, and Bridges, through
« the whole Country; it tore the Rocks and Mountains,

and destroyed some whole Plantations, and
threw them into the Sea; but Port-royal h&d much
f the greater .Share in this terrible Judgment of

« God.



1 66 The Adventures ef

God. I will therefore be more particular in giving

you an Account of its Proceeding, that you may

know what my Danger was, and how unexpected
my Preservation. On Twfday the 7 th of June I had
been at Church reading of Prayers, (which I did
every Day) since I was Rector of Pori-Roya?, to

keep up some Show of Religion amongst a moil
ungodly, and debauched People. When Prayers
being ended, I went to a Place hard by the Church,

(where Merchants use to meet) where the President

of the new Council, who acts in Chief till we have

a new Governor, came into my Company, and
< enp-aped me to take a Glass of Wormwood Wine

with him, as a Whet before Dinner. He being

my very good Friend, I staid with him ; upon
1 which he lighted a Pipe of Tobacco, which he

Wis pretty long taking, and not being willing to
« leave him before it was out, I was detained from
1 going to one Captain Rudders' s where I was to dine ;

whose House upon the first Concussion sunk into

the Earth, then into the Sea, with his Wife and

Family, and some others that came to Dinner with
€ him. But to return to the President and his Pipe

of Tobacco ; before it was out, I found the Ground
i rolling and moving underneath my Feet; upon
« whichlfaid to him, Lord, Sir! What's this? He
replyed very composedly, being a very grave Manit

is an Earthquake, be not afraid, it will be soon

over ; but it did encrease every Minute, and we

heard the Church and Tower fall, upon which we
< ran to save ourselves ; I quickly lost him, and

made



Capt. Richard Falconer. 167

made towards Morgan's Forty which being a wide

open Place, 1 thought to be there more fecurefrom

the falling Houses : but as I mice towards it, I saw

the Earth open and swallow up a Multitude of People,

and the Sea mounting in upon us over the For
ratifications. I then laid aside all Hopes of escaping,
c and resolved to make towards my own Lodging,

and there to meet Death in as good a Posture as I

could, but I was forced to cross and run through

two or three narrow Streets, the Houses and Walls

fell on each Side of me, some Bricks came rolling

over my Shoes, but none hurt me : When 1 came

to my Lodging I found all Things in the same Order
I left them in, not a Picture (of which there
c were several fair ones in my Chamber) being out
< of its Place. I went to the Balcony to view the
1 Street in which our House flood, I saw never a
« House down, nor the Ground so much as cracked.
c The People seeing me there cried out to me toc
come and pray with them. When I was come into
the Street every one laid hold on my Cloaths,

and embraced me, that with their Fear and kindness

I was almost stifled. I persuaded them at la A
4 to kneel down, and make a large Ring, which

they did : I prayed with them near an Hour ; when
I was almost spent with the Exercise", they brought

me a Chair; the Earth working all the while with

new Motions, and trembling like the rolling of the

Sea ; insomuch ' that sometimes whilst I was at
Prayer, 1 could hardly keep myself upon my Knees*
By that Time I had been half an Hour longer,

setting



i68 The Adventures of

setting before them their many and heinous Sins,

some Merchants came to me, who desired me to

go aboard some Flip in the Harbour and refresh

myself j they told me they had gotten me a Boat to

carry me off. Coming to the Sea, which had entirely

swallowed up the Wharf, with all those
goodly Houses on it, mod of them as fine as those

in Cheapfidc, and two entire Houses beyond it, I
< upon the Tops of some Houses that lay level with

the Water, got first into a Canoe and then in a long
« Boat which put me aboard a Flip, called the Smm

Merchant, where I found the President safe, who

was overjoyed to see me: 1 continued there that

Night, but could not sleep for the Returns of the

Earthquake almost every Hour, which made all
4 the Guns in the Flip to jar and rattle. The next

Day I went from Flip to Flip to visit those that

were taken up in Boats bruised and dying, and to

pray with them ; also to do the last Office to them,
1 in saying the Form of Prayer that is used at the

Burial of the Dead, which hath been my for rows
ful Employment ever since I came aboard this Ship,

with Design to come for England: we having not
thing but Shaking of the Earth, Thunder, Light
king, and foul Weather ever since. And the People

being desperately wicked, it makes me afraid
to stay in the Place; for that very Time this ter*
c rible Earthquake was, as soon as it was Night, a
1 Crew of lewd Rogues, which they call Privateers,

rob and rifle their Neighbours, whilst the Earths

have been twice ashore to pray with the bruised and

I met too many drunk and swearing. I did not

spare them, nor the Magistrates who have suffered

Wickedness to grow to so great a Height. I have,

I bless God, to the best of my Skill and Power,
1 discharged my Duty in that Place, which you
will hear from nest Persons that come from hence;
€ I have preached so seasonable to them, and so

plain, in the last Sermon I preached in the

Church, by setting before them what would be

< the Issue of their Impenitence, that they have

since confessed it looked more like a Prophesy
than a Sermon. I had, I confess, an Impulse todo
it, and many Times I have preached in the
Pulpit, Things that I never meditated at Home,
and could not methought do otherwise. The

« TJNYERfince that fatal. Day (the most terrible

H/ that ever I saw) i have lived on Board a

Flip, for the Shaking of the Earth returns every
now and then : Yesterday we had a very great one,

but it seems less terrible Aboard than on Shore.
'Vet I have ventured to For: Royal three Times

(since its Desolation) among the mattered Houses

to bury the Dead, and ehriiien their Children.

SkuJcy last I preached amongst them in a Tent;

the Houses that remain being so mattered, that I
durst not pi each in them. The People are overjoyed

when they see me amongst them ; and wept

very bitterly when I preached co them. J hope by
4 this terrible Judgment, God will make them reform

themselves, for there was not a more nu
godly People upon the Face of the Earth. It is a
4 sad Sreht to see such a fair Harbour covered with
■* the dead Bodies of the People of all Conditions ;
4 for our great and famous Burial-place, the Palisades,

was destroyed by the Earthquake, and
< the Sea wafted the Carcases of those that were

there buried, oat of their Graves. Their Tombs

being dashed to Pieces by the Earthquake, of
4 which there were hundreds in that Place. Many
rich Men are utterly ruined, chilli many, by

watching Opportunities, searching the sunk
« Houses, even almost whilst the Earthquake lasted

(while Terror and Amazement had seized on all

I 2 4 the



IJ2 The Adventures of

the confiderable Persons) have gotten great Riches.

We have had an Account from several Places of
4 the Island, of Mischiefs done there by the Earthquake

: From St. Anne we hear, that above a

thousand Acres of Woodland are warned into the
4 Sea, carrying away whole Plantations in divers

Places, but none suffered like Port Royal, where

Streets were swallowed up by the Opening of the
Earth. The Houses and Inhabitants went down
4 together. Some of them were driven up again by the
4 Sea, which arose in the Breaches of the Houses, and

wonderfully escaped. Others were swallowed up to

the Neck, the Earth shut upon them, and squeezed

them to Death. And in that Manner several are
« left buried with their Heads above Ground, only

some Heads the Dogs have eaten. They are covered

with Dull and Earth by the People, which

yet remain on the Place, to avoid the Stench.

Thus I have told you a long ard sad Story, and
« God knows what worse may happen yet. The

People tell me they hear great Bellowing and
4 Noises in the Mountains, which makes some very

apprehensive of an Eruption of Fire ; if so, I fear

it will be more dehru&ive than the Earthquake. I
4 know not how to stay, and yet I cannot tell how,

at such a Juncture, to quit my Station. 5

I believe



Capt. Richard Falconer* 173

I believe this was the mod terrible Earthquake
that has ever happened since the Creation of the
World, and did more Damage. They tell a Story
of a wicked Fellow, that in the Time of the Earthquake
ravished a Merchant's Daughter, and after
murdered her, that he might not be discovered ; buta
Black, that happened to be in another Room,
and hearing what had happened, ran away to the
Ship where her Father was, to give him Notice,
that he might come and apprehend him. But when
he came and found his Daughter murdered, and the
Villain gone, he was almost distracted, and the
House tumbling with the Earthquake, he perished
in the Ruins bemoaning his Daughter. The execrable
Wretch was soon overtaken with divine Vengeance
; for going to make his Escape, a large
Stone from one of the falling Houses dropped on his
Back and broke it, where he was taken up in such
Misery, that he prayed for some one to knock him
on the Head to put him out of his Torture. The
Pain was so violent, that it took away his Senses,
and in the Height of his Raving, discovered himself
to be the Author of the horrid Fast mentioned;
but he died without Repentance, curling every body.

Another Story that was told me, was, That a
Gentlewoman had come out of the Country to lie
in there, being flic would be better accommodated,
and was brought to Bed but two Days before. The
Husband was gone out ; and at the hri\ Shock of the
House all her Servants left her, with the Infant with
her, which with the Violence of the Shock, was

3 overturned



J74 So Advent vns of

overturned in the Cradle : With this Accident, the
Gentlewoman in a Fright rose out of her Bed,
though in a weak Condition, and took up her
Child, and feeling the House totter, ran down
Stairs in her Shift, with her Infant in her Arms,
where she was met by her Huibami, who took her
in his Arms to carry her away, just as the House fell
upon them all, where they were drawn out, but
the Child was dead, and the Mother died in Half
an Hour, the Husband mightily bruised, with much
Pain lingered out to the next Day, and then expired,
and were all three buried together in one Grave.

One Abraham Matthews, an Inhabitant of Port*
Royal, that was alive when I was there, told me of
a remarkable Providence that happened to him, ashe
was packing up several Things to carry on
Board some Veliei that was in the Harbour, for the
more Security. He had no sooner come out
of the House where he lodged, but it fell down and
smothered several People within. Just as he got to
the Water-fide, the Boat was going off, and as he
put one Foot into the Boat, the Boat-man pumcd
him out again, and told him he must stay till he
came back, being the Boat was full. The Boat, in
turning the Point by the Fort, was over whelmed
by a Point of the Shore, which fell upon it, and all
that were in it perifticd. This was the second Deliverance.
When he saw what had happened, he retired
to the Church, which was open, to return God
Thanks, and beg his farther Protection ; or if
Death happened, he could not choose a better Place

to



Capt. Richard Falconer. i?S
tD die in. While he was at Prayers, he saw one of
the Buccaneers* or Thieves, floating away his Bundle,
wlvch he im mediately followed, seized, and took
it from him : As soon as he was out of the Church,
that fell to the Ground. When he had got the Bundle,
he kneeled upon the Earth to tie it (after, the
adjacent House sunk down also, and unoihcred the
Ftilow, with several others C at were in it. Going
a little far: her, he met foi*. of his Acquaintance,
who were getting a Canoe reside to convey themselves
on Board a Flip in the Harbour, where he
safely arrived, and gave God Thanks for his many
and happy Deliverance.

We put in at Eletujields Bny, for the Conveniency
of Wood and Water, and when we were provided,
steered our Course onward for England, But as we
came within ten Leagues of the Savannas a Spanijb
Man of War of forty Guns came up with us, who
commanded us to strike our Sails, which we did
immediately, and coming on Board us, were fur-prized
to find us all Englishmen, not expecting other
than Spaniards from the building of our Vessel
Whereupon they made us all Prisoners, and sent
fifteen Men on Board us to carry the Veflbl into the
Havana. Telling them how we came by the V effet
did not signify any Thing, for they said we were
Pirates, and had seized it. • And our Pass which we
had from the Governor of Havana, not being to
be found, made Things appear but with an indifferent
Face ; we were afraid we should find many
Difficulties in getting our Liberty, especially if they

I 4 went

went to their Station, which was St. Jago. Bat it
happened better than we expected, for (he made
d-'rcftly to the Port of the Hosanna y where we knew
every Thing would be placed in a true Light again.
When we were anchored, and the People could
come on Board us, we were soon known, and the
Captain going to the Governor, was soon informed
of the Matter ; so we were released immediately,
and had a Visit made us from Father Antonio, and
honed Plymouth, who were mightily rejoiced to see
us.

We were detained two Days, before we could
get away. And then we set Sail with a bri flc Gale,
first saluting the Town with our four Guns, and
four Parterres, which I had forgot to mention our
buying at Port Royal.

In two Says after our find Sailing we made Cap
Florida, and entered the Gulph that bears the same
Name, and passed it without Danger. But here a
sudden Calm overtook us, as frequently happens
when you are pad the Gulph ; and the Current set
strong to Westward, occasioned, as we supposed,
by the Opening of the Land upon that Coast. The
Calm lading for four Days, we were insensibly
carried within half a League of the Shore, but a
little Breeze rising from Land, helped us father
out again ; But dill our Danger more encreased,
for we soon perceived three large Canoes making
towards us, full of Indians armed. We had not
much Time to consult what to do, for they gained
upon us every Moment. Now Death, or something

worse



Capt. Richard Falconer. 177

worse than Death, glared us in the Face, and most
of us thought this the last Day we had to live.
Come, Friends, (said I) if we must, die, let us die
brave like Englijhmen* To die is just as common as
to live, only Life is Choice ; but Death we still
pursue, and every Step we take shortens our
Journey. If then we follow Death, why mould we
fear it ? Or if we mould fear, what would that
avail? since Fearing cannot put back the fated
Hour. Then let us, like those that would dispose
of somewhat, do it to the best Advantage. We
charged our four Guns with double and round, and
our Parterres with Muskets balls : The rest of our
Arms we got in Readiness, and resolved to die fighting,
and not suffer ourselves to be taken, to be
miserably butchered, as all the Indians of Florida do,
when they get any Whites in their Power. We
resolved to fire our six Mullets upon them as soon
as they came within Reach ; so we took oar Aim,
two at each C*?70*, and fired upon them, which did
them some Damage, for they flopped upon it,
which made us make the best of our Way ; but they
soon pursued us with loud and rude Shouts, By this
Time we had charged our Muskets-gain, and fired
as before at the same Distance ; but whatever Damage
we did them, they came on as fait as they could
but not before we had charged our Pieces the third
Time, which we-fired as before, but did more
Execution, as being nearer to us; and now we
charged them the fourth Time, and laid them
along upon the Deck for a farther Occasion ; for

they being so nigh, that our great Guns would
reach them with our double and round, which we
fired, one at a time ; the first we fired at was the
largest Came, which put them in such Confufion,
that they fell foul of one another, and being in a
Huddle together, we fired the other three, that
made a mighty Havock among them. We now-thought
of a Victory, instead of being made Slaves,
and bore up to them, that we might make our Pat-terrors
of Use to us, which we fired upon them
with Partridge (or Musket) Shot, that answered our
End ; for now they began to turn Tail, which we
seeing, fired our Muskets the fourth Time, which
killed them two Indians ; and charging our great
Guns with single Balls, of 3 Pound Weight, (or
3 Pounders, as they call them at Sea) and firing at
their Boats (or Canoes) we sunk one of them; but
the Men swam to the other Canoes, and taking
hold of the Sides, with their Weight turned it over.
Mr. Misgave, and the real of our Men, advised to
make up to them, and in this Confufion kill them
all. But I was satisfied with the Disappointment
they had met with, and as it was not in their
Power to hurt us farther, resolved to make the belt
of our Way ; but looking towards the Shore, save
eight more of their Canoes making up to us. This
put us upon making all the Sail we could, and the
Sea-breeze being now pretty strong, we made good
Way. We thought the Canoes would stay when they
came up with the other three, but they made after
us along with those Indians that they had taken up.

We



Capt. Richard Falconer. 179
We had charged our great Guns with great Shot,
and fired at them, but missed them; we changed
them the second Time, and one Shot, by good
Fortune, took the first Canoe, and overset her,
which put them into more Confufion than before;
but still live of them pursued us, which were met
with by some of our Musket Balls, that gave two
of them their Quietus eft ; and firing our great Guns
once more, sunk one of their Canoes ; but the
Men soon got into the other, and followed us still
Seeing this, we resolved to make one strong Effort,
and make the best of our Way: lo we backed our
main Sail, and laid by for them, and brought our
four Guns to one Side, and our four Parterres to
bear accordingly, we charged our Muskets once
more, and laid them in Readiness, with two Half-pikes,
and our Cutlasses ; and now we resolved not
to fire till every Gun might do Execution. We
staid till they came within two Ships Length of ui>,
and then we fired upon them as fa ft as ever we
could, which proved effectual, for we killed them
at least twenty. Upon which, they set up dreadful
uncommon Noises, and rowed back as fast as ever
they could ; we gave them our farewell Muskets
and made the bell of our Way. By a moderate
Computation, we killed them at leal 50 /w-
JiaitSf without their once firing at us; neither could
we conceive how they intended to assault us, or
whether they had any f ire-Arms, for we saw none*
After we had brought our Vessel to rights again,
ove assembled ourselves to Prayers, and returned

I 6 our



8o The Adventures of

our sincere Thanks to the Defender of the weak,
and Giver of all good Things, for our happy Deliverance.
We saw the Canoes paddling towards
Shore, and were met by several others, with a
Design, as we supposed, to assist them ; but we
were now too far for them, and there was nothing
more to be feared ; so we sailed on with a prosperous
Gale, and met with nothing worth Note, till
Thursday, July the 15th, we discovered Land,
which amazed us all, for we did not think of
falling in with any Shore till we saw England. We
went to consult our Charts, and saw we were near
Newfoundland and finding that we steered directly
into St. John's Harbour, which is the Capital of
the Island, I mean of that Part which belongs to
the English. The Harbour is large, fair, strong*,
and commodious, commanded by several good
Forts, and a strong Bomb that shuts it up. The
Town consists of about 800 Houses, but after the
Manner of the Houses in England,

Newfoundland, or Terra Nova, was discovered by
Sebastian Cabot, for King Henry the Vllth of England.
This Island is seated in fifty-two of Northern Latitude,
and divided from the Continent by an Arm of
the Sea, about 20 Leagues over. It is larger than
Ireland ; the Climate is much the same as in England,
very wholesome, has several commodious Harbours.
The English possess one Fart, and the French the
other : but the Englljb are more populous. This
Island is of great Benefit to the English, as well as
other Nations, from the vail Quantities of Fifth that

aae



Capt, Richard Falconer. share

caught upon the Banks of Newfoundland. This
is a very large Bank of Sand, which extends a
hundred and twenty Leagues to the West, near the
Continent, and about twenty Leagues broad in the
middle, and sharpens to each End. It is reckoned
the moll extraordinary Thing found in the Sea of
that Kind; for Ships may anchor, though twenty
or thirty Leagues from Land. The Fruits are the
same as with us in England, and the Soil so very rich,
that it will bear Pease, Beans, fcjfc. without Till acre,
which are as good as any in England. The Beaiis
the same, only the Bear, which is found there. In
short, Nmvjlwidland resembles England in every
Thing so much, that if a Man could be carried
from thence in his Sleep, he would only think he
was strayed somewhere out of his Knowledge.
There is only this to be said, that there is not so
many Inhabitants, so there is more Plenty of every
Thing for human Life. Their chief Trade is Fill,'
but they send great Quantities of Muck, Sables,
and other Furs. There is not one Indian to be
found upon the whole Island, but what are brought
from other Countries, and used as Servants ; though
it is reported, about twenty Years ago, towards the
North-well Parts, the French met with feme Indians,
that used to help them to cure their Fish, and make
their Oil. They describe them a civil Sort of
People, but no Knowledge of a superior Deity
and when attempted to be taught, they would
answer, We are well contented with our own God,
neither do we desire any other ; Why Should we

offer to change? We think our Forefathers wiser
than we are, and they worshipped the same with
us : Therefore, as we think of going to the same
Place where they are, we must worship the same
Power. You have your God, and we have ours ;
every Nation must have a God according tc heir
own Language. Should we pray to your God in
our Indian Language, how should we be understood ?
Or should you pray to ours, what would it avail
you, seeing he would not know what you said to
him. Now we have not one God only, but man* ;
as one for Fishing, one for Fowling, and another
for Husbandry ; and when we are about any of these
particular Businesses, we pray to that God; for it
would be too much for one to mind them ail.
Would it not seem ridiculous for one of us, if wc
wanted Success in Hunting, to pray to him that
times Care of Fishing? Or you that wear Cloaths,
would you go to a Fisherman to bid him clothe
you ? You tell us, there are a vail Number of Worshippers
of your God in all Countries; then what
need you any more? We will serve you as well and
as faithfully as if we had but one God, and pray to
our Gods to give you Success in whatever you undertake.
If you fish, we'll pray co that God; if
you go to sell Timber, we'll pray to that; and so
on, to whatever you employ yourselves in. When
you are out of their Dominions, you must pray for
yourselves to your own Cod. Jn lhoit, there is
neither fair Means nor soul, will ever bring these
poor Creatures to the Knowledge of the true God.

If you are angry with them, they will comply with
you, and say, Well, well, we will do as you would
have us ; but never think of it afterwards : If you
reason calmly with them, then they answer you as
above.

After being here two Days, we set sail, and made
our Course for England, July 25, 1700. We met
with no extraordinary Accident in our PafTage, till
we discovered the Land's End, August the 21ft. How
rejoiced I was to see my native Country, let them
judge that have been in the same Condition as I have
been; and I may with Truth say, that the Transports
felt in first seeing the white Cliffs of the I/land
that gave me Birth, exceeded the Joy I received when
I was delivered from the mod imminent Danger,
Here we consulted, whether it were better for us to
go to London:, or to Bristol but every one allowed
London to be the bell: Mart for our Goods; so we
made for the Thames, and the Weather being fair,
and brisk Gale, we anchored over-against Shadixcll
Dock. Now all that we had to do was to get a Chapman
for our Goods, I applied myself to a Merchant
upon 'Change, who soon struck a Bargain, and, with
the Consent of my Companions, sold the Lading,
Bottom and all, for nine hundred and twenty
Pounds, reckoning the Lading seven hundred
Pounds, which was my own, and two hundred and
twenty for the Vessel, and every Thing besides.
They were all contented with their Dividend, but
still resolved to go with me to Brifiol, to see after
my Affairs there. So we set out on Foot, intending





i S4 TJ?e Adventures of

tending to walk it, and be a little merry upon the
Road, for we expected more Diversion by walking
it leisurely, than going in any other Manner. I had
turned all my Money into Bank Bills, which amounted
to 800A with my Money that I had for my
Goods, and sewed them in the Waistband of my
Breeches, not that there could be any Danger, being
so many in Company. We took the Salisbury
Road, though something out of our Way, I being
resolved to carry my Friends to Brut on, the Place of
my Birth. Coming through Bafwgftcke, a Sailor
met us, begging Charity for God's Sake. I gave
him Sixpence, which he returned me many Thanks
for; I asked him how it came to pass, that a lusty
Sailor as he was did not go to Sea? (especially now
War being talked of between the English and French)
he answered, he was going to London for that Intent,
but was obliged to be beholden to , good Men to assist
him in his Journey. Why, (pursued I) have you
no Friends? your Cloaths are good, you don't seem
to have begged long. No, answered he, this is my
first Day ; I have made an End of the little Money I
had last Night. Have you been long from Sea,
(said 1)? But a Week, answered he. I had the
Misfortune to be cast away in Sight of Harbour.
From whence came you, (asked 1) ? Said he, We
came from Jamaica, and were bound for Bristol;
but a violent Storm overtook us within six Leagues
of the Mouth of the River Severn, and drove our Flip
upon some Rocks in the Mouth of the i- y, and all
the Men perished but myself. From Jamaica, (said



Capt. Richard Falconer. 185

1), pray what Flip ? The Albion Frigate, replyed he.
Who was your Captain, added I? The Captain died
at Jamaica, but the Mailer supplied his Place, one
Jacob Bingky. Did you ever hear of one Falconer?
Yes, he was the Mate, supposed to be left in a Voyage
he made to the Bay of Campechy, but coming
safe into Harbour afterwards, the Captain before his
Death gave him the Command of our Flip ; but the
Matter not approving of such a young Man to have
the Power over him, set Sail without him. This 1
learned on Board afterwards ; for I and another Sailor
were hired for the Voyage that Afternoon, before
the Morning we set Sail. We had but an indifferent
Passage the whole Voyage, which was made up with
nothing but Storms and Calms, that caused much
Uneasiness, and our Provision received Damage by
the Salt-water, which drove us to the last Extremity;
and when we were raised in our Hopes of setting out
Feet upon our native Country, we were devoured by
the tempestuous Waves. I myself was taken up for
dead upon the Shore by a Fisherman. Have you
any Friends (said I) at London? None, (replied he)
every Place to me is Home, a Sailor is never out of
his Way. If so, (said I) return with us to Bristol
where we are bound, and Til promise you, if I cannot
get you a Flip, I will give you wherewithal to
carry you to Londvi without begging. We easily agreed
upon the Matter, and honest Tar went on
with us. I asked him why he did not endeavour to
get a Flip aKBr.jlol? he answered, He would rather
chuse to go in a Man of War than a Merchant-man,

from thence we went in the same Manner to Bristol,.
where the first Thing was to enquire after my poor
Father; but I was informed by Capt. Ptutucy, that
he thought he was certainly dead; though he had
seen him but once since I had been abroad, and that
was in the January before, when he came privately
to him, and told him he was fettled in a small Village
near Hereford, and went by the Name of hawkins.
What convinces me he is dead is, that about
two Months ago, he sent me a Letter, which Til
Show you. He went up Stairs and fetched it, which
contained these Words ;

Grief so overcame me for a Time, that I was notable
to ipcak; to be robbed of a Father, and
a Father I loved so dearly, was a cutting Stroke;
and I was constrained to make Use of all my young
Philosophy to support it. My Father had left the
Writing of his Estate with Captain Quincy y he having
only mortgaged it before for five hundred
Pounds to a Friend, to prevent its being seized on.
by the Crown which was redeemed by the Captain,
by my Father's Appointment, when he cameo
see him last. I paid him his five hundred
Pounds, and would have given him Interest for it,
but he would not accept of it, but advised me to
part with it, without I designed to settle in England*
which I thought was the belt Way, whether I (laid
in England or not. The Captain undertook the
Matter, and sold it for four thousand Pounds* But
whilst he was busy about it, I got Mr. Mufgrave*

who



i88 The Adventures of

who was always my Bosom Friend, to go to
Hereford and if it were possible, to find out where
my dear Father was buried, and to see how Matters
flood there. Accordingly we hired a Couple of
Horses, and sat out : when we arrived at Hereford,
we found it not a little difficult, but at last, through
the Means of one Mr. Hall, Organist of the Cathedral
Church, we had Sight of the Place, which was
about half a Mile from the City. Mr. Hall came
by the Knowledge of it by the Means of an honest
Clergyman, that my Father had contracted a
Friendship with, before that unhappy Accident befel
him, that deprived him of his Life* He brought
us to his House, where the Gentleman was
laid up with a Fit of the Gout. As soon as we
were private, I let him know who I was, upon which
he tenderly embraced me, and was mightily toyed
to see the Son of his late Friend. Said he, I mould
have been at Bristol ere now, but that the Gout
prevented me. Your Father was a Person I had buta
short Acquaintance with, yet that little Time discovered
him to be a Man of Integrity, Honesty, and
Honour. When he was upon his Death-bed, he
told me his real Name and Circumstances, and what
Misfortunes had brought him to this Part; he told
me also, that he had a Son at Sea, and begged of me
to dispose of his little Fortune he had here, and see it
put in to the hands of Captain Pultmy at Brijlch which I
had done, but was prevented, as I said before, by
this sudden Fit of the Gout. I have taken Care of all
your Father's Effects, and the little Farm I have

bought

Bought myself, it being for my Turn. Upon that he
sent his Maid for a little Box, which he unlocked, and
told me out thundered Guineas. This is what your
Fatherleftinready Money behindhand ; disarm, &c.
I rate at two hundred and fifty Pounds more; there
are the Writings, and there is the Money: by the
Writings I saw it cost my Father but two hundred

Pounds, As for his Apparel, and other little Necessaries,
I gave them, by his Order, to a Maid
Servant, and a Man that he hired ; and for his
Goods, there are but few, nor have we made any

praised, I will give something more than what,
they are valued at, being I would willingly have
them along with the House ; Said I, neither
shall they be parted ; and if you please to accept
of them, be they what they will, you shall be
heartily welcome. He refused them obstinately,
but 1 prevailed with him to take them with much
ado. He also gave me a Ring, which I prized
mightily, because it had been my Father's from his
Infancy, given him by my Grandfather When he
had fettled every Thing, I went to see the Place
where my Father's Bones were laid, which filled me
with such awful Sorrow, that I could not refrain from *
weeping, in Spite of my Resolution to the contrary.
I would have erected a Tomb or Monument
for him, but it was his last Request, that he might
be buried as obscurely, as he designed to live there.

After parting with my Father's Grave with a
Load of Sorrow, we took Leave of my Friend the
Parson, and Mr. Ha//, and rode for Bristol again ,

by three Gentlemen of the Pad, that had got some
Notice of the Booty they should gain if they could
rob us ; for I was so inadvertent as to put all my
Money into my Bags, which I wore before me at
my Saddle. They pained us first, but looking wilfully
upon us, gave-us some Suspicion of what they
were. Mr. Mujgr&jve advised me to ride back again,
and Hay till we had more Company; but I told
him they would soon overtake us, and, seeing us
fearful, would make them more resolute ; so I rather
chose to face them, for we observed they were
returning to meet us. We resolved to be beforehand
with them, and we drew out our Pistols ready,
and if they offered to come too near us, to begin
with them. As Toon as they came within twenty
Yards of us, I called to them, and asked them
what they wanted ; if it was our Money, they
should fire take our Lives. They answered, they
had no i'uch Intention. Then what is your Reason
of passing us first, and then meeting us again ?
They answered, one of their Companions in alighting
to ease himself below the Hill had dropped
his Watch, and they were returning to find it if
they could. Why then pass by in the Name of
God, (said 1), and accordingly they did ; but we
were cautious of letting them come too near us. As
soon as they were pail us, we set Spurs to our
Horses, and got over the Heath before we looked
behind us; but riding leisurely through the Village,
we saw them coming after a full Gallop,
Wow we scented we had not flayed in the Village,

hut we resolved, as before, to encounter them if
they assaulted us. They soon overtook us, and
coming even with us, told us their Companion had
found his Watch, which he pulled out and Showed
us. They said they could not blame us in taking
them for Highwaymen ; but they assured us they
were Travellers, as we were, and were going to
JVorccJkr. We did not make any Words with them,
but rode along with them, indeed, because we
could not help it. They rode with us for about a
Mile, and then the Road going narrow, one of
them pretending to go foremost, seized hold of my
Bridle ; with the Surprize, my Horse, being a very
good one, rose up an End ; and h? discharging his
Pillow, the Ball grazed upon my Cloak-bag, and
did not do any farther Damage. Upon this I fired
one of my Pistols, but missed him; but I threw it
at htm with all my Force, which hit him on the
Head so full, that he staggered a little, and fell
from his Horse. The other discharged a Pocket*
Pillow at me, and wounded me slightly in the left
Shoulder; but going to discharge another, I set
Spurs to my Horse, and had the good Fortune to
snatch it from him ; but in the Bustle between us it
went off, and shot the other Highwayman's Horse in
the Head, which so enraged him, that he ran away
with him in Spite of all he could do to flop him.
Mr. Mil/grave^ who engaged with him, followed
him, but considering he had left me with two, returned
again, and in very good Time; for the
other Fellow that I bad knocked down with my

Philos



vgz The Adventures of

Pistol, had got up again, and had just caught his
Horse that was grazing under the Hedge. His
other Companion that I had taken the Pistol from,
had drawn a broad cutting Sword, and was laying
at me. J, by good Fortune, had before me a great
Coat for Fear of Rain, and the Ball of his Pistol had
broke the Strap, so that I wrapped it round my left
Arm, and received his Blow, which did me no
Damage, and in the mean Time thrust my Sword
into his Side up to the Hilt, which nevertheless
did not kill him But he called to his Companion,
Come, Any, let's make off, for by God I believe
I am killed. Accordingly they fled as fast as ever
they could back again, the Way we came, with my
Sword in his Bread ; for when he received the
Wound, he turned so short with his Horse, that
wrung the Hilt out or my Hand. Mr. Mufgra<ve
was for following them, but I found some Pain in
my Shoulder, and it began to grow stiff, being cold,
and chose to go on; but in our riding and talking
of the late Accident, we lost our Road, and had
taken that which led to Gloucester ; and riding on,
we met the third Highwayman, whose Horse had
run away with him, who was coming back, as we
supposed, to see how Things went. As soon as he
saw us, he turned his Horse, and rode away as
hard as he could, and we rode as fast after him, it
being, as we thought, our Road. We followed
him through several Villages, and called to the
People to Hop him, bat to no Purpose ; at last his
Horse Humbled, which gave us Time to come

pretty near him ; when he found he could notefcape
us, he turned about, and discharged a Pistol at us
I had one Pistol that I had not fired yet, which I
drew from the Roofing, and let fly at him, and
wounded him in the Neck. He fled as fast as he
could, and outhouses beginning to tire, he got out
of our Sight. We aflced several People we met, whether
they had seen any such Person, and they told us he
was gone into Gloucester Town before them. We
followed, and got into Gloiuejhr immediately, and
were told such a Man was seen to ride through the
Town ; so we pursued him no farther, our Horses
being very much tired ; but they fen t a Hue-and-cry
after him, but to no Purpose, for they returned
no wiser than they went out. We flayed at Gloucester
two Days to have my Wound dressed, and them
rode to Bristol where all our Friends waited impatiently
for us, because we had exceeded our Time
three Days. After having fettled my Money in the
Hands of People that the Captain appointed to improve
it for me, I resolved to make a Trip to Ireland,
to see my Sister, who was married very well
to a Merchant there. But hearing of the grand
Fleet making Preparation for some Expedition, put
us all agog, and my natural Genius for Travel,
made me once more resolve to be gadding. I opened
my Mind to Captain Pulley, who advised me to the
contrary ; but 1 told him I was so much concerned
for my Father's Death, (as indeed I was) that I
should sooner wear it off at Sea, than on Shore, because
here every Object that I saw put mc in Mind of

at last ; but, said he, I would not have you go in
any Post, but as a Volunteer, that you may not be
confined to slay longer than you Should desire* I
thought this the best Way, therefore resolved for
london with all my Companions, and got us a Flip*
I had Letters of Recommendation to Secretary Bur*

of the Navy, We arrived at London, February
the 8lh, 1701. Mr. Mufgr-awe and I entered on
Board the Breda, Captain Jog Commander, because
we were informed Admiral Be?ibo<w would hoist his
Flag in that Flip. Mr. Mufgraue, having formerly
had some Acquaintance with the Admiral, waited
on him, and had a Warrant for a Quartermaster
given him. The rest of our Companions entered before
the Mall, that is, common Sailors, in the same
Ship. Hood was soon made C> ok's Mate, and the
rest of them got force little Office, that raised them
something above the common Sailors, though they
entered as such, and all by the Means of Mr. Margrave,
who acquainted the Admiral with their Fortunes.
When we had sent all our Things on Board,
and not knowing when they would fail, Mr. Mus
I got Leave to go to Pcrtjhwuth by Land *

him ;) which was as follows : One Evening, coming
from seeing a Play at the Bull-Head, a Gentleman
coming out with a Lady, the Crowd by Chance
jostled me against the Lady, which this Gentleman,
Mr. Martin (Nephew to Johnny Gibson, Governor
of the Place) took as an Affront put upon him, being
he had the Care of the Lady ; but J begged her
Pardon, and told her it was an Accident I could
not help ; but he being in strange Passion, called
me several ungenteel Names, as Rogue, Rascal, and
such like, and (truck me over the Head with his
Cane. Though I did not much mind his Words, I
did not care to take his Blows without a Return,
which I did with Interest, and we were soon parted.
But an Hour after, being at the aforesaid Bull*
Head at Supper, the Drawer came up and told us,
there was a Gentlemen below desired to speak one
Word with Mr. Fal&$h'. There was one Mr. Langley
> Lieutenant to the Wind/or Man of War, that I
had made an Acquaintance with at the Play, who
promised to come and sup with us, and I took the
Message to come from him,, but was surprized to
find it the Gentleman that I had the Buffle with.
Heated to drink a Glass of Wine with me, he
said, and led me into a Room. When we were
there, he told me he came for Satisfaction for die
Affront I put upon him about an Hour ago ; therefore

endeavoured to pacify him with good Words, yet
all to no Purpose ; he made so many Thrusts at nie f
that I was in Danger of my Life ; but at last I di£

armed him, but not without a little Wound in my
Arm. As soon as I gave him his Sword again, he
pushed at me with all the Malice imaginable; and
hearing the People from all Parts of the House,
coming to see what was the Matter, he clapped his
Back against the Door, to keep them out, which
they on the other Side broke open, and giving him
a Push, his Bread ran against the Point of my
Sword, which appeared at his Back, and he fell
down without any Sign of Life. The People coming
in, I was immediately secured, and carried to
Prison, till they knew whether he would live or die.
I was mightily concerned, not that any Danger was
to be feared, but that it would be a Hindrance to
my Voyage. The Gentleman continued in a violent
Fever a great while, and his Life was despaired
of; but at lait, after a tedious illness, recovered,
but continued weak. One Day he came to vis mein
a Chair, where I was contained, and told me he
was very sorry for what had happened, and that
to-day I mould be at Liberty ; and accordingly an
Order came in the Afternoon fox my Freedom,
without paying any Sees. But to my great Grief
the Fleet was sailed, and Jyenbcw's Squadron defined
for the Indies. But Mr. Martin begged me
to be patient, and he would procure me a Passage
in a Storelhip, that would fail in a Week at farthest
for Jamaica ; and he was as good as his Word ; for
the next Day he carried me to Captain Young* Commander
of the Tyger Store flip, and entered me immediately*
Thea my Heart began to be at Rest,

and 1 gave him Thanks ; and for the Time we
stayed there, Mr. Martin and I were very intimate,
and he expressed himself so genteelly about our former
Encounter, that he gained my Esteem.

Passion, indeed, is certainly a Madness ; and
therefore what was done in that Heat ought to be
forgot, if the Persons themselves repent of it. But
how humane would it be, if in the Midst of that
Fire of Passion which blazes out, they could sprinkle
the cool Water of Reason, and quench it ? For nothing
more deforms the Mind or Body than Passion,
and 'tis then we lose our human Form, and are
metamorphosed into Beasts. How many great and
good Men have done such Things in a Passion, that
they have repented of all their Lives after; therefore
Passion may well be termed a pilfering Devil,
that steals away our Senses, and prompts us to d#
Actions unbecoming the Form we bear.

We set Sail from Spithead, May the 18th, 170;,
and our Captain gave us Hopes of overtaking th
Feet, by Reason, he said, one Ship could better
make Way than a whole Fleet, because they were
obliged to wait for one another. We met with nothing
extraordinary but a Storm, that drove us al-mod
upon the Island of Trladtira y which being so
nigh, our Captain resolved to anchor at, and accordingly
we did, in the Bay of the City of Funxal*
the Capital of the Place. Captain Young and \
went on Shore to view the Town.

Churches, all neatly built; two Cloisters, one for
the Men, and the other for the Women. The City
contains 1600 Houses. There is also computed to
be upon this Island 100,000 Inhabitants. I bought
a Portuguese Book here, that gives a better Account
of the list Discovery of this Island, than any I have
fen extant, which Mr. Mufgraw translated for me
into English* I have seen it in French since, but not
truly translated, because there was something left
out concerning King Edward the Third, that conquered
France. And as the Honour belongs to the
English, as the first Inhabitants, I shall here give it
you faithfully translated. It being but Short, I
hope it will not be found tedious ; for in all my
Voyages I avoid Prolixity, as being offensive to all
Readers, and the Places I describe are generally
such as are not frequented by the English it being

<^$£ Edward the Third, who conquered
France f and fixed his Royal Standard

the Ensigns now were furled, and Swords were
wore for Ornament, not Use. Among the rest that
embellished the Court, was one Lionel Machin, the
youngest Brother of a noble Family, and consequently
not over-rich ; yet a Gentleman (which
often happens in younger Brothers) that was reckoned
the only Ornament of the Root from whence
he sprung. This Gentleman fell desperately in
Love with a Lady, beautiful to Perfection, and tlve
only Toast of her Time. But there was a vast Disparity
in their Fortunes ; for she was the only
Daughter to a Nobleman, whose Riches exceeded
raft of his Rank, and consequently courted by
those that could make her a Jointure, equal to the
Fortune her Father would give her. But nevertheless
the Force of Love is such, that it never minds
Interest nor Duty; and the young Lady, whose Name
was Arabella, was so much taken with the winning
Behaviour of Lionel, that she placed her entire Affection
upon him, who was indeed, bating his
(lender Means, the most deserving of her. But the
Parents of Arabella hearing of the Amity that was
between them, complained to King Edward, and
begged that he would inter pose his Royal Authority.
The King used many Persuasions to Lionel to withdraw
his Affections, but it was like bidding the
Sun stand Hill, or the Wind, or Rain to cease ; for
their Affections were so strongly united, that
nothing could ever part them. The Father having
provided a fit Match for his Daughter, intreated

the King to secure Lionel till the Marriage was*

solemnized,



Capt. Ri c h,a rd Falconer. 201

solemn zed, who granted his Request, and clapt Lionel
in Prison under Pretence of some treasonable Practices.
When immediately the Marriage Rites were performed,
and Arabella was constrained to give her
Hand where it was not in her Power to give her
Heart ; and Parents are to blame to force their
Children to marry against their Inclinations, for
from thence spring such Disorders in Families that
are not in their Power to compose. As soon as the
Ceremony was over, the Husband carried his Lady
to a Palace, seated upon the River Severn* near
Brifiol: When done, Lionel was released out of
Prison, but with a heavy Heart, for the Loss orchis
dear Arabella. But Hill his Love encreased from the
Difficulties he found to obtain his Desire, and
knowing it impossible to live without her, thought
of a Stratagem that gave him Hopes of conquering
all Difficulties. He summoned about thirty young
Gentlemen, all resolute, bold, and fit for any Undertaking.
When he had got them all together .
he made this Short Oration to them :

Moi here are njy Relations? or what is a nearer 7ye>
my bosom Friends : You all know the Indignity I have
Suffered y by Arabella forced Marriage ; therefore I require
you all to assisi me in whatever I Jhall undertake
without tainting your Honour) to be revenged for tht .
Affront put upon me.

To this Request they all agreed to serve him with
their Lives and Fortunes, Whereupon it waa revived
to part and take several Ways to Brifiol:

When they all arrived at their Place of Rendezvous,
they consulted together, and resolved to seize any
Flip in the River, that they found was fit for their
Turn. Lionel thought nothing difficult when Love
was to be the Reward ; but now he wanted some
Means to let Arabella know their Design : But at
last it was agreed, that one of their Company
should enter into the Service of the Husband, which
fell out as they could wist, and a proper Person
was hired to be Groom, where he had the Care of a
line spotted Horse, that used to carry the Lady
abroad, to visit her Neighbours : The Wind
proving fair, Notice was given that the Project was
to be put in Execution ; the pretended Groom, to
favour the Business, had omitted giving Arabella*
Horse any Water, when Arabella had Notice
of the Hour, she ordered her spotted Horse
to be saddled under Pretence of taking the
Air, attended with her Groom and two more of her
Domesticks. When they came near the Cape of
Land, where Lionel and his Companions waited for
her, the Horse, by the beating of the Waves against
the Shore, heard and smelt the Water, and made
down to it to drink, where Lionel immediately laid
hold of the Lady, (who seemed to be mightily
frightened) and put her in their Boat and made off.
Now the Day that they had seized the Lady, was
illo pitched on to seize the Flip they had a Design
upon ; which was easily done, as their Crew were
moll of them shore. They cut her Cables, and
made erf to Sea with all the Sail they could bear,
*nd iota got out of Sigh and directed their Course

for France, but a Storm met them and drove them
quite contrary. Lionel's Friends now began to repent
of their Undertaking, and Lionel was mightily
concerned for the Danger of her he loved more
dear than Life ; who though mightily disordered
with the Sea, yet seemed contented in having the
Object of her Desire with her. Thirty Days they
were the Sport of the Waves, every Day expecting
Death ; bat one Morning they discovered Land,
high, craggy, and very woody, which filled them
with Joy, more especially Lionel, for now he hoped
a resting Place for his dear Arabella. None in the
Ship could guess what Land it could be, for they
knew it was not inhabited, because Birds of all
Forts were so tame, that they would suffer themselves
to be taken with the Hand. The Place they
chose for their Habitations was a fine Grove of
Laurel-Trees that were very delightful, as was also
every Part of the Country they had rambled over*
Finding they were to stay there a great while, they
got out of their Flip several Necessaries, and lived
very pleasant for about thirteen Days, designing tfc
commit themselves in a Day or two to the Mercy
of the Waves, for though the Island was delightful
to live in, yet it seemed tiresome to those that
wanted many Things they enjoyed in their own
Country.

The Night before they designed to embark, a
violent Storm arose, and drove the Flip from the
Island with about sixteen Men that were preparing
all Things for soiling the next Day. These were

toft by the Winds and Sea for many Days, but at
last, to their great Joy, discovered Land, where
they ran their Flip on Shore, for tie was so leaky
Ihe could hardly swim. But their Joy for being
saved from the watry Element, soon changed to
Sorrow, when they found themselves taken by the
Moors, they being landed on the Coast of Jfrkk.
Their new Matters (after hard Usage) arrived at the
City of Morocco, with their Purchase, where they
sold them in the Market like Cows, or Oxen ; but
all declaring they were Men of Rank, they were
imprisoned, in Hopes of large Ransom.

When Lionel and Arabella, and the rest that were
left on Shore, discovered the next Morning their
fatal Disaster, Grief seized them with fuchaForce,
that some of them lost their Senses, running frantick
up and down the Woods, and raving, killed
themselves. Poor Arabella's Grief sunk inward,
and preyed upon her Life with such Violence, that
Death appeared to her Rescue : She never upbraided
Lionel with her Misfortunes, but closed her Eyes
with a true Repentance of her Failings,

Lionel was like a distracted Man, laid himself
down at her Feet, and could not be removed till
Death gave him his Release. His Companions buried
them together in one Grave, and at the Foot
erected a Croft, to shew these that were interred
there, died under the Banner of Christ : Upon the
Bark of the Tree, they cut in Letters the whole
Story of their Misfortunes. The rest that remained
upon the Island, proposed to themselves of venturing




Capt, Richard Falconer. 205

turing into their Boat (which by good Fortune
was left on Shore) and steer their Course to the
nighest main Land, where they happily arrived
without Danger, but ran the same Fate with their
other Companions that were thrown on the same
Coast in the Flip, that they all thought was cast
away. All the Comfort they received in their
Misfortunes, was, that they were committed to the
same Prison, that their Companions were in. They
were over-toyed to find those alive that were
thought dead, but mourned to think of meeting in
such a melancholy Place. In the same Prison was
one Juan de Morales, a noted Pilot, and an excellent
Navigator ; this Man was mightily pleased with
the Tales of these English Gentlemen, and so often
begged them to repeat their Adventures, that he
had every Mark of the Island exact, and perfectly
saw it in Imagination. In the Year 1416, Don
Sancho, Son to Ferdinand King of Arragon, died in
Castile, and left confiderable Sums of Money to
redeem Spanish Prisoners that were Captive in Barbary
; among the rest was Juan de Morales; and at
the same Time the Englijb Gentlemen got their
Ransom, and safely arrived in their own Country,
with a Pardon for their Offence from the King of
England, and the Husband of Arabella. Morales,
and all the Flip's Crew, were taken by the Portuguese,
who met with them cruising in those Seas,
but all, excepting Morales, had their Liberty given
them, who was detained for his Knowledge in the

Mathematics,



206 Adventures of

Mathematicks, and Promises were made him of
great Recompence, if he would serve King John
of Portugal in his Discoveries.

As soon as they were arrived at Lisbon, Morals
was presented to the King, by Don Hey the Infant,
who was a great Encourager of new Discoveries,
where he opened the whole Story of Lionel and Arabella*.
Which was so generally received, that a Fleet
was ordered immediately for this new Voyage, and
June the 2d, 1420, set out to Sea well armed. They
designed first for Porto Santo, as being nigh the
Mand, as Morales conjectured, the English abandoned.


When they arrived there, the Inhabitants advised
them not to go any farther in their Discoveries towards
the N. E. being there was a black Cloud which
would terminate their Navigation, because there was
not any one that ever attempted it, but lost their
Lives for their Presumption, and were never heard
©f more. Notwithstanding Gonfales the Admiral,
and Morales the Pilot, were well assured that very
Cloud was the Island they wanted to find, they were
the more convinced in it, by Reason the Cloud continued
of the same Colour through every Change of
the Moon. But. the rest of the Flip's Crew were
of the contrary Opinion, and mutinied again ft Morales,
telling him that he being a Castilian, (and consequently
their Enemy) did it to disgrace them; and
that it was a presumptuous Thing to pretend to
search into the Secrets of Providence.

Notwithstanding



Capt. Richard Falconer. 207

Notwithstanding their Grumbling, they set sail
from Porto Sancho, and made forward for their Dis*
cover; but the nearer they approached this Cloud,
the more frightful it grew, which caused a terrible
Fear in all the Sailors, intreating Gonfales to return,
and not to be the Death of so many innocent People
But still they held their Course for all their
Clamours; yet Gonfales, to encourage the Sailors,
allured them it mutt.be firm Land, and to dissipate
their Fears made them this following Oration :

Whypould 1 be more hardy than you, but that I am
confirmed it is as I tell you ? If there should be any Danger ;
have I any Means to extricate myj elf more than yours elves P
Is not my Life as precious to me, as any of yours, my Comp
onions ? A Fool Hardiness does net become us, it is true ;
but a firm Courage is what all Men should be endued vjith*
Every Person here has ventured his Life for his King in
Battle before now, without half the Recompense or Honour
that will be rained by this Expedition, if we succeed, as
we certainly Shawl, if we arm ourselves with Resolution to
overcome all Difficulties : Banish your Fears, and call your
Reason to your Aid, and let us proceed in the Name, and for
the Honour of God, and our King.

They proceeded cheerfully, animated by this Oration,
and in a little Time entered the Cloud, or
fettled Fog; but the Tide driving the VeiTel too far
North, they put out their Boats to tow their Flip
in the midst of the Cloud ; but the farther they rowed,
the Cloud seemed to decrease, and presently after
they discovered Land to their great Joy, being
it was what but few of them expected ; The first

Cape



208 The Adventures of

Cape they discovered, was called by Gonfales, Cape
St. Lawrence, which they doubled, and saw a fine and
fertile Country full of fair and lofty Trees, that
made the Prospect delightful. Sailing on, they discovered
a large Bay, which Morales judged to be the
Place where the English were thrown ; but it being
late, Gonfales ordered to let fall the Anchors, not
caring to land till they had the whole Day before
- them. The next Morning they landed, and found
it to be the same Place where Lionel Machin and Arabella
were buried.

When they had given Account to the Admiral of
the State of Things, he landed and took Possession
of thelfland for his Matter, John the first, King of
Portugal They erected an Altar upon the Tomb of
the two Lovers, laid Mar, and returned God
Thanks for their happy Success.

Gonfales termed the Island MjJcra from the Quantity
of its Wood (which in the Portuguese Language
signifies Woody) that was found all over the Island,
but no human Inhabitants.

After they had searched well on Shore, Boats were
ordered to row round the Island, being it was dangerous
for their Flip, by Reason of many Rocks
and Shallows that lay in the Water. So steering Weil,
they discovered four fine small Rivers running into
the Sea, the Water being extremely clear. Gonzales
ordered some to be bottled to present to the King of
Portugal his Matter at his Return.

Going farther, several Soldiers were landed in a
Valley, which was watered by a fine River, and a

nobis

Grove of Trees that made a perfect Harbour,
where GonfaUs erected a large Cross.

Sailing on, they came to a Point of Land that raja
great Way into the Sea, which was inhabited by
such a Number of great different Birds, that the
Men were afraid of being devoured by them. This
Place was named Punta des Gra!hos> from the large
Number of Birds.

Going forward, they discovered a Valley covered
with fine large Cedar-Trees ; next to that they found
another large one, where was a great Lake or Pond,
from whence they could perceive the Bay they set
out from. In searching the Country, they discovered
a large Plain, which overlooked the rest of the
island, free from Trees, but covered over with a
beautiful Fennel, called by the Portuguese FumbalL
Upon this Plain they built a City, and called it
t from the Quantity of Fennel that was found
there, which was formerly a Bishop's See, but is still
the chief Place for Temporal Affairs.

From this Plain run three Rivers into the Sea,
which form an island, and landlock the Haven, fe
cure from Storms and Tempests.

GonfaUs still sent out more Men for Discoveries ia
the island, where they found a white Rock, called
by the Portuguese Pray Fortncja> or the fair Rock ;
below which was a fierce Torrent of Water, so clear,
that obliged them all to observe it. Two resolute
Soldiers pulled off their Cloaths, and attempted to
swim across the Stream", but were hurried away with
the Current in such an impetuous Manner, that they

had perished if they had not been timely succoured
by their Companions by Ropes, which they threw
in, and pulled them up against the Violence of the
Stream, This Torrent they named Sorceries.

The most remarkable Thing they found in their
Voyage, was a great Number of Sea Wolves, which
rushed out of a Cave into the Water when they approached
them, Gonfales gathered all Sorts of Plants,
Roots, Flowers and Minerals, together with all
Sorts of Birds, and a large Parcel of the Earth, and
embarked for Portugal, where he hMy arrived stuguft
the id, the same Year 1420, where he was received
with all the Favour imaginable.

In May 1421, Gonfales was made Governor of the
whole Island, with an additional Title of County and
in the same Month set Sail with his Wife and two
Daughters, and many more, for the inhabiting the
same, where he happily arrived, and laid the Fou citation
for the present Capital ofFunchalh or Funzal\
but to honour Lionel Machin, who was there interred,
he called the Place Porto Making, and over the
Grave he reeled a noble Church. Some Writer*
relate that Gonfales set the Woods on Fire, that continued
burning for seven Years, which made Wood
scarce in that Island ; but there is such Plenty of all
Sorts, that I look upon that Story but as a Fable.
The Island daily increased in its Inhabitants, till it
came to the now flourishing State it remains in.

Madeira is situated in thirty Degrees and thirty one
Minutes. In Circumference about forty Leagues,
twelve in Length, about two broad. The Air so

temperate.

temperate, that neither Heat nor Cold is troublesome,
and the Soil so fertile, that it yields more
Corn for the Bigness of the Place than any other If-land
as large again. The Grass shoots up so high,
that they are obliged to burn it, and in the Allies
they plant Sugar-Canes, which in six Months Time
produce Sugar. The Inhabitants are more civilized
than any of the Canary Islands.

After we had made an End of our Affairs, we set
Sail from thence, and directed our Course for Tern*
riff, one of the Canary Islands, or the Insula Fortunatus
of Ptolemy, where we safely arrived. This
Island lies in twenty-seven Degrees, and thirty
Minutes ; about fourteen Leagues in Length. Santa
Cruz, the Place where we anchored, is the chief
Harbour. It is an Island very well inhabited, containing
three Cities, or large Town*, besides «
great Number ^>f Villages. But what it's famed
moll for is the Pike, or high Mountain, that rears
its Head above the Clouds, and seems to scale even
Heaven itself. I have seen many People that have
told me they have been at the Top of this Mountain
: But none give so good a Description of it
(and even the whole Island) as the Right Reverend
Dr. Sprat in his Mimicry of the Royal Society ; which :
as follows :

Having furnished ourselves with a Guide,
wants and Horses, to carry our Wine and Prov
Won, we set forth for Oratava, a Port-town i.

from twelve at Night till eight in the Mornings

by which Time we got to the Top of the first:

Mountain, towards the Pico de Terrain: Thereunder
a very large and conspicuous Pine-tree, we
4 took our Breakfast, dined and refreshed ourselves

till two in the Afternoon : Then we patted

through many sandy Ways, over many lofty

Mountains, but naked and bare, and not covered

with any Pine-Trees, as our firth Night's Passage

was. This exposed us to excessive Heat, till we
4 arrived at the Foot of the Pico, where we found
4 many huge Stones, which seemed to have fallen

from some upper Part : About fzx in the Evening

we [began to ascend the Pico, but we were scarce

advanced a Mile, and the Way being no more
passable for Horses, we left them with our Sere
wants. In the Ascent of one Mile, some of our
1 Company grew very faint and sick, disordered by
'Fluxes, Vomiting, and agues Distempers, our

Horse's Hairs (landing upright like Bridles ; and
1 calling for some of our Wine, carried in small

Barrels on a Horse, we found it so wonderfully
f cold, that we could not drink it till we had made
1 a Fire to warm it, notwithstanding the Air was
very calm and moderate. But when the Sun was
set, it began to blow with such Violence, and
grew so cold, that taking pour Lodging among
the hollow Rocks, we were necessitated to keep
great Fires in the Mouths of them all Night,
About four in the Morning we began to mount
again ; and being comer another Mile up, one of

1 our Company failed, and was not able to proceed
any farther. Here began the black Rocks,

The rest of us pursued our Journey till we came t<f

the Sugar Loaf, where we began to travel again

in a white Sand, being fitted with Shoes, whose

single Soles are made a Finger broader than the

upper Leather to encounter this difficult Passage #
4 Having ascended as far as the black Rocks* which
4 lay all flat like a plain Floor, we climbed within
a Mile of the very Top of the Pico, and at last we

gained the Summit, where we found no such
4 Smoke as appeared a little below, but a continual

Perspiration of a hot and sulphurous Vapour, that
made our Faces extremely sore. All this Way we

found no confiderable Alteration of the Air, and
f very little Wind, but on the Top it was so impetuous,

that we had much ado to Hand against it,

whilst we drank the King's Health, and fired each
of us a Piece. Here also we took our Dinner,
4 but found that our strong Waters had lost their
< Virtue, and were almost insipid, while our Wine

was more spirituous and brisk than before. The

Top on which we flood being not above a Yard
« broad, is the Brink of a Pit, called the Caldera,
4 which we judged to be a Musket-shot over, and

near fourscore Yards deep, in Form of a Cone,
« hollow within like a Kettle, and covered with

small Loose Stones, mixed with Sulphur and Sand,

from among which|i!Tued divers Spiracles of Smoke

and Heat ; which being stirred with any Thing

4 were almost suffocated with the sudden Emanation

of Vapours, upon the removing one of these

Stones, which were so hot as not easily to be

handled. We descended not above four or five

Yards into the Calder y because of the Slippers

under Foot, and the Difficulty ; but some

have adventured to the Bottom. Other Matter*

observable, we discovered none, besides a clear
4 Sort of Sulphur which lay like Salt upon the
4 Stones. From this renowned Pico we could see

the Grand Canaries, 14 Leagues distant; Parma

18 ; and Genera 7 ; which Interval of Sea seemed'

not much wider than the Thames about London. We
% discerned also the Hcrro, being distant about 20

Leagues, and so to the utmost Limits of the Sea
4 much farther. As soon as the Sun appeared, the
4 Shadow of the Pico seemed to cover not only the
4 whole Island, and the Grand Canaries, but the Sea,
c to the very Horizon, where the Top of the Sugars
Loaf or Pico visibly appeared to turn up, and cast

its Shade into the Air itself, at which we [were

much surprized ; but the Sun was not far ascended,

when the Clouds began to rise so fast, as that
4 they intercepted our Prospect both of the Sea, and
■ 4 the whole island, except the Tops only of the
'subjacent Mountains, which seemed to pierce them
4 through. Whether these Clouds do ever surmount

the Pico, we can't say, but to such as are far below

they seem sometimes to hang above it, or
4 . rather wrap themselves about it, as constantly

as the West Winds blow ; this they call the Cap,
and is the infallible Prognostic of ensuing Storms*
One of our Company who made this Journey
again two Years after* arriving at the Top of the
Pico before Day, and creeping under a great Stone
to shroud himself from the cold Air, after a little
^ Time found himself all wet, and perceived it to

come from a perpetual Trickling of Water

from the Rocks above him. Many excellent and
4 exuberant Springs we found issuing from the Tops
4 of mo ft of the other Mountains, gushing out in

great Spouts almost as far as the huge Pine-tree
4 which we mentioned before. Having staid a-while
4 at the Top, we all descended the sandy Way, till

we came to the Foot of the Sugar-loaf, which being

Itecp, even almost to a Perpendicular, vvefooa

palled ; and here we met with a Cave about te*

Yards deep, and fifteen broad, being in Shape like

an Oven, or Cupola, having a Hole at the Top*

near eight Yards over. This we descended by a

Rope that our Servants held fast at the Top,
4 while with the other End (being fattened about
4 our Middles) we swung ourselves, till being over
a Bank of Snow, we slid down, lighting upon it;

we were forced to saving thus in our Descent, bet
cause in the Midst of the Bottom of this Cave,

opposite to the Aperture at the Top, is a round
4 Pit of Water, like a Well, the Surface whereof is
4 about a Yard lower, but as wide as the Mouth at
4 Top, and about six Fathom deep. We supposed

4 this

this Water not a Spring, but dissolved Snow

blown in, or Water trickling through the Rocks.

About the Sides of the Grot for some Height there

is Ice and Icicles hanging down to the Snow, But

being quickly weary of this excessive cold Place,
c and drawn up again, we continued our Descent

from the Mountains, by the same PafTage we went
4 up the Day before, and so about five in the Evea-
€ ing arrived at Oratava, from whence we set forth ;

our Faces were so red and sore, that to cool them,

we were forced to wash and bath them in Whites

of Eggs. The whole Height of the Pico in Perpendicular
is vulgarly esteemed to be two Miles

and a half; no Trees, Herbs, nor Shrubs did we
« rind in all the PafTage, but Pines ; and among the
« whiter Sands, a Kind of Broom, being a bushy

Plant ; and on that Side where we lay all Night,

a Kind of Coa/on, which had Stems eight Feet

high, and the Trunk near a Foot thick, every

Stem growing in four Squares, and emerging

from the Ground like Tufts of Rules ; upon the

Edges of these Stems grow very small red Buttons,
« or Berries, which being squeezed, produce a poi
nous Milk j which falling upon any Part of a
« Horse, or other Beast, fetches off all the Hair

9 Of the Island Teneriff itself, this Account was

given by a judicious and ingenious Man who

lived twenty Years in it, as a Physician and
Merchant : His Opinion is, that the whole Island

being a Soil mightily impregnated with Brimstone,
€ did in former Times take Fire, and blow up all,
4 or near all, at the same Time ; and that many
Mountains of huge Stone, calcined and burnt,
4 which appear all over this Island, especially in

the South-Weft Part of it, were call up, and raised
4 out of the Bowels of the Earth, at the Time of

that general Conflagration ; and that the greatest

Quantity of this Sulphur lying about the Center of
€ the Island, raised up the Pica to that Height at

which it is now seen ; and he says, that any one

upon the Place, that shall carefully note the Situs
action and Manner of those calcined Rocks, how
4 they lie, will easily be of that Mind ; for they lie

(says he) three or four Miles aloft round the

Bottom of the Pico, and in such Order one above
another, aloft to the Sugar-Leaf , as it is called,
4 as if the whole Ground f welling and rising up

together, by the Ascension of the Brimstone, the

Torrents and Rivers of it did, with a sudden

Eruption, roll and tumble them down from the

rest of the Rocks, especially (as is said before) to

the South-Weft, for on that Side from the very

Top of the Pico, aloft to the Sea-coast, lie huge
'Heaps of these burnt Rocks one under another;
4 and there (till remain the very Tracts of the
1 Brimstone Rivers, as they run over this Quarter of

€ the Mand, which has so wasted the Ground
4 beyond Recovery, that nothing can be made to
4 grow there but Broom: But on the North Side

of the Pico few or none of these Stones ap '
x feared ; and hence he concludes, that the

4 Volcano discharged itself chiefly on the South*

West Side. He adds farther, That at the
4 same Time Mines of several Metals were blown

up., some of those calcined Rocks resembling
4 Iron Ore, some Silver, and others Copper; pari
circularly on the South West Parts, called Axuleoh y
4 being very high Mountains, where never any Ens
glijhman but himself (that ever he heard of) was.
x There are vast Quantities of a loose bluish Earth,

mixt with blue Stones, which have a yellow Rust

upon them, like that of Copper, or Vitriol; as

also many small Springs of Vitriol Water, where
4 he supposes a Copper Mine ; and he was told by

a Bell-founder of Oratava, that he got out of two
4 Horse Loads of this Earth, as much Gold as made

two large Rings : And a Portuguese who had been

in the Weft-Indies told him, that his Opinion was,

there were as good Mines of Gold and Silver

there, as the bed in the Weft-Indies. Thereabouts

also arc Nitrous Waters, and Stones covered over

with a deep Saisi on-coloured Rust, rafting of

Iron ; and farther, he mentions one of his

Friends, which of two Lumps of Earth or Ore,
€ brought from the Top of this Side of the Mount
tain, made two Silver Spoons. All this he confirmed

by the last Instance of the /Vw-Ifland, ig

Leagues from the Tencrffi where, about 12 Years

4 since,



Capt. Richard Falconer. 219

c since, a Volcano was fixed, the Violence thereof

made an Earthquake in this Mand, so great, that

he and others ran out of their Houses, fearing they

would have fallen upon their Heads ; they heard
the Noise of the Torrent of flaming Brimstone,
like Thunder, and saw the Fires as plain by

Night, for six Weeks together, as a burning
Torch, and so much Sand and Ashes, brought
from thence by the Wind and Clouds, fell upon

his Hat, as would fill the Sandbox of his Inkhorn.


In some Places of this Island grows a crooked

Shrub called Legnan, which they bring to England
1 as a sweet Wood. There are like wise Apricots*
1 Peach-trees, and others, which bear twice a Year ;
f also Pear-trees as pregnant, Almonds with a tender
Shell ; Palms, Plantains, Oranges and Lemons,

especially the Paegnadaes, which have small ones

within them, from whence they are so denomi-
1 named. Also they have Sugar-Canes, and a little
Cotton, Cdloquintida, &c. The Roses blow at
Christmas ; there are good Carnations, and very

large, but no Tulips will grow or thrive there;
1 Samphire cloaths the Rocks in Abundance, and a
kind of Clover the Ground. Another Grass
1 grows near the Sea, which is of a broader Leaf, so
1 luscious and rank, that it will kill a Horse that
eats of it, but no other Beast. Eighty Ears of
Wheat have been found to spring from one Root,
but grows not very high ; the Corn of this is

4 The Canary Birds which they bring to us in

England breed in the Branch** or Gills, which the
4 Water has fretted away in the Mountains, being
4 Places very cold. There are also Quails, Pari
bridges larger than ours, and exceeding beautiful

large Wood Pidgeons, Turtles at Spring, Crows, and
sometimes the Falcons come flying over from the
Coast of Barbary.

Bees are carried into the Mountains, where they
prosper exceedingly, and there they have wild
Goats which climb to the very Top of the Pico
sometimes ; also Hogs, and Multitudes of
Coneys.

4 Of Fish, they have the Cherna, a very large and
excellent Fill, better tailed than any we have in
England; the Mere, Dolphins, Lobsters without
great Claws, Muscles, Periwinkle, and the Clacas,
which is absolutely the very best Shell-fin in the
World ; they grow in the Rocks, five or six
under one great Shell, through the Top-Holes
whereof they peep out with their Nibs, from
whence (the Shells being broken open a little
more with a Stone) they draw them ; there is
also another Sort oi Filii like an Ed, which hath
six or seven Tails of a Span long, united to one
Head and Body, which is also as short ; besides,
there they have Turtles, and CabriaVs which are
better than our Trout s. Shetland is full of Springs

4 they cleanse by percolating it through a Kind of

spungy Stone, cut in Form of a Bason. The

Vines which afford those excellent Wines grow
4 all about the Island within a Mile of the Sea;
4 such as are planted farther up are not so much
4 esteemed, nor will they thrive in any of the other

Islands. Concerning the Guancbic?% or ancient
4 Inhabitants he gave this full Account: The 3d of
4 September y about 12 Years since, he took his

Journey from Guitar, a Town for the most Part
4 inhabited by such as derive themselves from

the antient Guancbio's y in the Company of
4 some of them, to view their Caves, and the

Corps buried in them : (a Favour they seldom

or never permit to any, having the Corps
4 of their /.nceiiors in great Veneration, and like*
4 wife being extremely against any Molestation of
4 the Dead) but he had done several eleemosynary
4 Cures among them, for they are very poor (yet
4 the poorest think themselves too good to marry
4 with the bell Spaniard) which endeared him to
4 them exceedingly ; otherwise it is Death for any

Stranger to visit these Caves and Bodies. The
4 Corps are sewed up in Goats Skins, with
1 Thongs of the same, with very great Curiosity,
particularly in the incomparable Exactness and
Evenness of the Seams ; and the Skins are made
1 very close and At to the Corps, which are for the
4 molt Part entire, the Eyes closed, Hair on their

4 Heads, Ears, Nose, Teeth, Lips and Beard, ail

persia, only discoloured and a little shrivelled,
4 likewise the Pudenda of both Sexes. He saw

about three or four Hundred in several Caves,

some of them standing, others lying upon Beds of

Wood, so hardened by an Art they had (which

the Spaniards call Curay> to cure a Piece of Wood)

that no Iron can pierce or hurt it. These Bodies

are very light, as if made of Straw, and in some

broken Bodies he observed the Nerves and Tendons,

and also the Spring of the Veins and Arteries

very divinely. By the Relation of the

most ancient of this Island, they had a particular

Tribe that had this Art only among themselves,

and kept as a Thing sacred, and not to be communicated

to the Vulgar; these mixt not themselves

with the rest of the Inhabitants, nor married

out of their own Tribe, and were also their

Priests and Ministers of Religion. But when the

Spaniards conquered the Place, most of them were

destroyed, and the Art perished with them, only

they held some Traditions yet of a few Ingredients

that were used in this Business ; they took

Butter (some say they mixed Bear's-greafe with it)

which they kept for that Purpose in the Skins ;

wherein they boiled certain Herbs, first a Kind of
wild Lavender, which grows there in great
Quantities upon the Rocks ; secondly, an Herb

called Lara, of a very gummy and glutinous Cone
distance, which now grows there under the Tops

< of



Capt. Richard Falconer. 223

of the Mountains ; thirdly, a kind of Cyclamen*

or Sow-bread \ fourthly, wild Sage, which grows

plentifully upon this Island ; these with others,

bruised and boiled up with Butter, rendered it a

perfect Balsam ; this prepared, they first unbowei

the Corps (and in the poorer Sort, to save

Charges, took out the Brains behind) : after the
4 Body was thus ordered, they had in Readiness a
4 Lixivium made of the Bark of Pine-trees, wherewith

they warned the Body, drying it in the Sun
in Summer, and in the Winter in a Stove, this repeating
very often ; afterwards they began their

Unction, both without and within, drying it as

before; this they continued till the Balsam had
9 penetrated into the whole Habit, and the Muscles

in all Parts appeared through the contracted Skin,
c and the Body become exceeding light ; then they
4 sewed them up in Goats Skins, as was before

mentioned The Ancients way, that they have

above twenty Caves of their Brigs and great personages,

with their whole Families, yet unknown

to any but themselves, and which they will never

discover. Lastly he says, that Bodies are found in the

Caves of the grand Canaries in Sacks, quite consumed,

and not as these in Teneriff. Antiently

when they had no Knowledge of Iron, they made

their Lances of Wood, hardened as before mentioned.

They have earthen Pots so hard that they
f cannot be broken. Of these some are found in
1 the Caves, and old Balances, and used by the
« poorer People that find them to boil Meat in.

« and Honey, which they always carry with them

in Goats-skins at their Backs : To this Day they

drink no Wine, nor care for Flesh ; they are very
ingenious, lean, tall, active, and full of Courage,
c for they leap from Rock to Rock, from a prodigious

Height, till they come to the Bottom,
4 sometimes making ten Fathoms deep at one Leap,

in this Manner : First they terminate their Lances,
1 which are about the Bigness of a half Pike, and

aim with the Point at any Piece of a Rock, upon

< which they intend to light, sometimes not half a
4 Foot broad ; in leaping off they clap their Feet

close to the Lance, and so carry their Bodies in

the Air; the Point of their Lance comes first to

the Place, which breaks the Force of their Fall ;

then they Hide gently down by the Staff, and

pitch with their Feet on the very Place they first

designed, and so from Rock to Rock, till they

come to the Bottom ; but their Novices sometimes

break their Necks in the learning. He told also

(and the same was very seriously confirmed by a

Spaniard, and another Canary Merchant there in

the Company) that they whistle so loud, as to be

heard five Miles off, and that to be in the same

Room with them when they whistle were enough

to endanger the breaking the Tympanum of the

Ear; and added, that he being in Company of
1 one that whistled his loudest, could not hear perfectly
in 15 Days after; he affirms also, that they

throw

4 throw Stones with a Force almost as great as that
of a Bullet; and now use Stones in all their
< Sights as they did anciently.

This Account was given to that Ingenious and
Reverend Divine, Dr. Sprat, Bimop of Rochester,
by some EngUJh Merchants, who had the Curiosity
to ascend the Pico, one of the highest Mountains in
the World; neither could I find him out in any
Thing, but in the Height; he allows it to be but
two Miles and a half ; but all the Inhabitants agree
to make it a full League high.

Capt. Young and I attempted to ascend it; but
there was such a thick Fog, that we were persuaded
to the contrary ; we went up about a Quarter of a
Mile, but were lb wet with the Fog, that we had nota
dry Thread about us.

When we had satisfied our Curiosities as far as we
could, we set sail from Generis and made our Course
for the West Indies. We met a Dutch Flip from Ba-tum
a that was drove by ill Weather fever! Degrees
out of her due Course ; we spared them what Necessaries
we could, being they were in great Want, and
took our Leaves of them. The same Evening a
Storm overtook us, and drove us out of our Course,
but in the Night it turned stark calm. The next
Morning we discovered a Galley with Turkijh Colours
out, rowing up to us with all their Strength \ we
were all surprised and amazed, and could hardly
give Credit to our Eyes, as no one on Board us ever
heard of a Turkijh Galley so far from their own
Coast ; but it seems we were nigher Africk than we
supposed as it proved afterwards. Our Captain

L 5 told



226 Tie Adventures of

told us we had nothing to do but fight it to the last y
for if we were taken, we might be Slaves all our
Lives long. I advised our Captain to put out our
Boat, and tow our Flip from them : For, said I, if
a Wind does not rise in the mean Time, that we
may escape them, we shall gain more Time to put
ourselves in Readiness to receive them, when they
come up with us. This Advice was approved of,
and the Boat was got out immediately with six Men
to row, and I obliged myself to go along with her
to steer her right, that they might row with all their
Strength. We rowed Co tightly for an Hour, that
we made pretty good Way with our Flip ; but for
all our Endeavours, we found that in about another
Hour they would get up with us ; but we designed
to row, till they were within a Quarter of a Mile of
us, and then go into the Flip again. In the mean
Time our Men on Board had prepared every Thing,
and were in good Order to receive them. We had
sixteen Guns, and forty Men, and Ammunition
enough. We were preparing to come on Board,
when we found they were almost up with us, but our
Captain advised me not, and ordered us to have
Arms in the Boat, with some Hand-granada's ; and
as soon as we should see them engaged, to go to the
contrary Side of the Enemy, and lire upon them,
and by that Means we mould amuse them, that they
would not venture to board us. Immediately it was
agreed, and two more Men, together with our
Arms, were put into us. The Galley came up with
us in an Instant and hailed us in EngUJb> and bid

us



Capt. Richard Falconer. 227

us strike our Colours immediately, or it should be
worse for us, but were answered by us with our Cannon,
instead of our Voices, and we went to it.
Now to obey my Orders, I loosed my Tow-rope,
rowed to get on the other Side of the Galley, but
was mightily surprized to find their Boat out, and
about the Number of twenty Turks getting into her;
our Men in the Boat advised immediately, to return,
tut I told them it was too late, for it would be
worse for us if we did : Nay, our Captain called us
to come on Board, but I thought they would do us
more Injury in getting up the Flip's Side, than if
we flood them boldly, which we resolved to do ;
There were nine of us, and we had Arms enough;
so before they could fire at us, we discharged our
Muskets at them, and laid ourselves under the Gunnel
of our Boat to charge again : When we were
prepared, I ordered them not to stir till the Turks
had fired ; and as soon as they had done so, to see
Fire to the Fusee of their Hand-bravado's, and throw
them in upon them ; as soon as we heard the Turks
fire, which did us no Damage, we set fire to cur
Hand-granada as agreed upon, and threw them in
upon them: but they suspecting something, seems,
ordered but half their Number to fire first, and the
other half fired upon us so unluckily, when we rose
to discharge our Granada's, that they killed three of
my Men out-right, wounded another dangerously,
and myself in the left Arm. It is true our Granada's
killed them four, and wounded several; but
still their Number doubled ours, and now they pre

pared to board us. My four Companions and myself
fired upon them with our Pieces, but could not
prevent them boarding us ; yet we clubbed our
Muskets on both Sides, and fil to work; but a
Turk coming behind me while I was engaging with
another, struck the Cock of his Pistol into my
Skull, and I dropped down for dead; but when I
came to myself, which was not in several Hours, as
I was told, I found myself on Board the Galley.

They had ordered surgeon to dress my Wounds,
which were three; one in my left Arm, that in my
Skull, and another upon the Side of my Throat,
which I did not feel in the receiving. I was ordered
to be taken particular Care of ; for as 1 was not ina
Sailor's Habit, they thought I was something
above the rest, and therefore hoped to get a confiderable
Sum for my Ransom. The Surgeon that
dressed me was an Englijb Renegado, whose Name
was Matthew. The Captain was an Etrljlxnan too,
born ztDeptforJ, but the vilest Wretch sure that ever
breathed. There were several other En?l>fb Renegadoes
on Board, most of them profligate Wretches.
I understood from my Surgeon, that the two Vessels
parted after a desperate Engagement, and the
Turks had about fifty Men killed and wounded :
Three of my Companions were Prisoners likewise ;
the fourth being killed in the last Conflict, and the
other expired in the Boat with his Wounds. When
I began to mend, I walked upon Deck, and looked
about mc a little ; the other three (being well) had
renounced their Saviour Jesus Christ ; he who died

for their Sins, and took upon him the State of Man,
that he might redeem us miserable Sinners from the
Curse of the Serpent, What must be their Punishment,
who for a little Ease in this World, forego
their Portion of eternal Life? If the Tortures of
Hell have their Degrees, the last and greatest must
be their Lot. The Captain of the Galley ordered
me one Day to be brought before him on the Deck,
where he told me, If I did not in a Twelvemonth
procure him to the Value of eight hundred Pounds
for my Ransom, I should be chained to the Oar,
and be a Slave all my Life ; (it seems one of the
three that was taken with me, had told him of my
Abilities, and that I was pefleflfed of a plentiful
Fortune.) I answered, I would send to England y
and do my Endeavour to get that Sum; but I told
him it was more than I was worth, and there was
no Hopes of so much Money for my Ransom, unless
my Friends would out of Charity contribute
towards it. 1 added, I believed I could raise a hundred
and fifty, or two hundred Pounds : But he
stuck to his Text, and told me, He would bate me
nothing of that; and when the Time was expired
that he had fixed, if the Money did not come, I
should never have my Liberty. I told him, I would
do my Endeavour to procure it for him when we
came into Port, and had Liberty to write to my
Friends in England.

The Captain did design to cruize a Month longer,
that he might take some Prize to make him Amends
for his lait Disappointment. He never importuned

me



230 The Adventures of

me to forsake my Religion ; being, if I had been as
vile as the ethers, he would not have had any Hopes
of my Money to redeem me. We coasted off the
Shore of Afrkk a Fortnight or three Weeks, but met
with no Prize; which enraged the Captain very
much. One Day the Surgeon dressing the Wound
in my Head, slipt into my Hand a Letter, which
he bid me read^cautioufly, and give him an Answer
the next Day. I had not an Opportunity for several
Hours to read the Contents ; at hit I counterfeited
a sudden Weakness, and retired to my Cabbin,
which was in the Place we call the Forecastle.
When I laid myself down, and found no one was
near me, I opened my Letter, and read the Contents
to this Effect :

After I had read it, I prayed to God to aid us in
our Design. The next Day Mr. Matthews came to
dress me as before ; I gave him to underhand that I had
read, and considered the Letter, and told him my
Opinion was to execute it as sail as ever we could,
for Fear of any Accident that might happen : For,
said I, it is not impossible but we may meet with
one of their own Galleys, and then we shall find it
to be a fruitless Undertaking. Said he, wemuil wait
a convenient Time ; for if we should fail, we must
expect the worst of Torments. He went from me
upon this, being feme of the Turks came to look
upon my Wound. The Captain a Feed him how my
Hurts fared? Ah! Damn him, said he, the Christian
Dog will do well enough I warrant him : So
much the better, answered the Captain, for I am
informed he is worth a great deal of Money, and I
shall set his Ransom at a higher Rate than what I
fire determined. All this Discourse I heard, being
upon Deck, talking with my three Companions that

were taken with me, who treated me with ill Language,
and called me Christian Fool, that would not
turn Mahometan, when I might have all the Liberty
I desired. One of them carried the Jell so far, that
he gave me two or three good Strokes with his
Hand; but the Captain seeing them (laughing) Let
the Fool alone, 'tis not worth your while to soul
your Fingers about him. I said so much to them,
concerning Mahomet their false Prophet, that if the
Turks had understood me, I might have run the
Danger of being murdered. But generally the Renegadoes,
(that is, those that forsake the Christian
Faith, and turn Turks) have so little of any Religion
in them, that they laugh at those that have
any at all. At Night Mr. Matthews told me in
French very low, that the next Morning early was
designed for their Enterprize, being it was fonte
Fait-day with them, that they usually at four
o'Clock in the Morning rise, and wall themselves
all over, and pray to their Prophet for some Time;
and this being to be done below, they thought then
would be the right Time. Accordingly all that
Night thcy.fpent secretly in preparing every thing.
He that commanded the Slaves (which was Jenkins)
found Fault with them for something, and chastised
them as usual, but took the Opportunity to unlock
them all, and ordered them to lie Hill as if their
Chains were fait, till they hsd Command to do
otherwise. Every Thing succeeded to onr Wi flies,
for the Turks got up to their Devotion kroner than
we expected, even before it was L: Ju ; and huddling

cling down together, we clapt down the Hatches,
and secured the belt Part of them. The Captain,
with two Englishmen, and one Frenchman, were
seized in the Cabbin, and bound Hands and Feet;
and this without any Noise. About eight others
that had not got up as early as the rest, our G alley-slaves
seized ; and before we could prevent them,
had killed them all, and begged they might serve
the Captain and the whole Crew in the same Kind.

The Bustle the Slaves made in killing the eight
Turks, rouzed the others below from their Prayers ;
and when they found they were shut down, they
made a Noise, and knocking to be let out, which
we did ; but first we loaded a great Gun with Mus
and turned the Muzzle towards the Scuttle.
Then as they came up, we bound them ; but
being but few English* we could not hinder the
Slaves from killing several of these too. At last wc
bound them all, being twenty-five, there being killed
by the Slaves sixteen, and, afterwards, by the
Consent and Agreement of all, we chained twenty
cf them to the Oar in the Room of those we had
released ; but they began to be very stubborn at first,
but we put the Slaves to them, and they soon made
them work, by giving them the same Usage as they
generally used to receive from them.

When we had secured them, we returned God
Thanks for our happy Success, and then consulted
which Way we mould fleer. We Englijb agreed to

go for England) but the Slaves we redeemed, being
mostly Spaniards and Portuguese y were for going to



2 ^4 * 9"^* Adventures of
Spain ; in ftiort there was no agreeing, for they being
the greater Number, they pretended to have
the Command over us, never considering it was tous
they chiefly owed their Liberty. I must confess I
was very much dissatisfied at their Ingratitude, but
could not find any Means to help ourselves. Mr.
Matthews (poke to them in Spanish, and laid before
them the Benefit it would be for them to go for England
\ but it was like preaching to so many Beasts,
for they regarded him not, but resolved to follow
their first Design of directing their Course for Spain,
When we found there was no Remedy, we desired
them to touch at Lisbon in Portugal, and set us ashore
there ; which they consented to with much Intreaty.
If we had been of an equal Number, we would
have endeavoured to have forced them with us for
.England, that they might have repeated their Ingratitude.


They would not let any of us have the Command
of the Vdlel, but one Velafqiies a Spaniard was
chosen Captain, who immediately turned out Mr.
Matthews, that we had given the Captain's Cabin
te, and took Possession of it himself. This set us alla
murmuring, and we consulted to contrive some
Way to be even with 'em ; but they were so watchful
and always upon their Guard, that it was to no
Purpose to plot any thing. They used to put Sentinels
upon us every Time we went to rest. One
Night we were awakened out of our Sleep by Orders
from our new Captain Velasquez ; when we were
upon Deck, he told us there was a Flip discovered

to



Capt. Richard Falconer. 235
to Windward of us. Now my Reason of sending
for you, said the Captain,' is, we design to attack
her, and make a Prize of her, let her be of what
Nation the will, excepting Spanijb. When Mr. Matthews
had told us in English what he said, my Indignation
rose that 1 could hardly forbear rushing
upon him, and tearing his Throat out; but at last my
Reason conquered my Passion, and I became calm.
I bid Mr. Matthews let him know he could not expect
us to fight, if they were English, our Countrymen
; But he fworewe should fight, or be killed, if
they were our own Fathers. I bid Mr. Matthews
tell him, as for my own Part, I would not fight a
Stroke, let it be what Nation it would ; and for his
threatening to kill us, I did not know but it would
be better to die, than to associate with such an ungrateful
Crew as they were. The Flip now instead
of keeping her Course, as fine did at first, made all
the Sail (he could, and bore down upon us, which
they did not mind in our disputing. The Captain
then began to change his Tone, and thought it the
wise ft Way to fleer away before the Wind, and endeavour
to get from 'em. Whereupon he crowded
away, and belaboured the poor Turks with his Bastinado
to row with all their Strength, that I pitied
them. Looking towards the Flip that pursued us,
we could perceive English Colours out, which rejoiced
us English mightily. We now consulted how
we mould top the Galley ; for with sailing and rowing
we went salter than they. At last I resolved to
take a Pistol and shoot him through the Head, let

the



236 The Adventures of

the Consequence be what it would. So I laid hold
of one of the Pistols unperceived, (they having prepared
their Arms for the Engagement) went up to
Velasquez, and took him by the Throat with my
left Hand, and holding the Pistol to his Bread with
my Right, I threatened to moot him dead if he or
his Men offered to dir. Several of his Companions
were running to his Assistance, but were flopped
by Mr. Matthews, telling them if they offered to stir,
their Captain was a dead Man. This Battle caused
the Turks to lie upon their Oars, and in the mean
Tims Mr. Sloan brought the Galley to the Wind,
and lay by, and the Flip got up with us in an In*
tant, and without hailing us, poured in a Broad-fide
upon us, which killed us two of the Turks, and
five of our Spaniards among which was that ungrateful
Mender Velasquez f and the Wind of one of
the Shot threw me down upon Deck without any
further Hurt ; we had no Colours up at all but the
Vane upon the Top-mad Head, which (hewed us to
be a Turkijh Vessel ; I sent up George Kirk to take
down that, which prevented their firing again ;
upon this they hailed us : But after we told them we
were English, they sent immediately two Boats well
armed on Board us, and when we had satisfied them
how it was with us, we seized upon our vile Spaniards,
and Portuguese, and bound them ; we saw it
was an English Man of War, and upon an Enquiry
found it was the Ruby, Captain Walton Commander,
bound after the Fleet for the West Indies. They had
met with Captain Young and his Crew fleering their

Course



Capt. Richard Falconer* 237

Course for England, being they were so disabled
with the Engagement they had with the Galley of
the Turks that we were in, they duril not hold on
their Way for the West Indies, So the Stores were
moil of them put on Board the Ruby, and the rest
were to follow as soon as they could nip them in
another Vessel Now there were two Men, that
were Passengers in Captain Young's Ship, put on
Board the Ruby to pursue their Voyage, and they
seeing the Galley, knew her to be the same that engaged
with Captain Young in the Tyger, and that
was the Reason they fired upon us without hailing,
as is usual in those Cases.

I was very glad of an Opportunity to pursue my
Voyage ; I made my Address to Captain Walton
who very friendly received me ; while we were consulting
what we mould do about our Prisoners, the
Galley seemed to lie deeper in the Water, and go -
ing to examine her, found a Shot had pierced her
between Wind and Water, but it was impossible to
come to it to flop it ; so we took what we could out
of her, and going to unlock the Galley-slaves
Chains, the Key, was not to be found, and the Galley
was finking every Minute, and before we could
break the Chains the sunk downright with the
whole twenty poor unfortunate Turks, and all the
Spaniards, who being tied, could not help themselves,
neither had we Time to give them any Assistance.
I must confess I was very much concerned
to feeib many poor unfortunate Creatures meet with

Death



238 The Adventures of

Death, when it was in our Power ten Minutes before
to have saved them. Captain Walton was really
grieved at it, and showed a Temper full of Humanity.
We had just brought on Board the Captain,
and two more E?tglift?nen y with. the Frenchmen, Renegadoes.
The Captain was so sullen that he would
not eat or drink, but intended (as we supposed) to
stane himself to death. Captain Walton used all
gentle Means possible to bring him into Temper,
but to no Purpose, for he would not so much as give
any Answer to what was asked him ; and in about a
Week or eight Days after we took him on Board, he
was found dead in his Hammock : One of the Englishmen
told us he had po Honed himself, for he always
said if he was ever taken by the English he
would make away with himself, to prevent the Punishment
he should undergo. The other four Englishmen
that were instrumental in our Deliverance,
were all Mahometan in Appearance, as I said before,
that is, they forsook their Christianity in outward
Shew, but were really Christians in their Hearts, as
werelikewife my three Companions that were taken
in the Boat with me, but as they told me they only
did it to have some Opportunity of getting their
Liberty, and the Words that were used, though it
was in a Speech they did not understand perfectly,
flideked them in their Utterance, and they all hoped
their Peace was made with God for their Crimes,
with sincere Penitence from the Moment they had
committed it.

Mr.



Capt. Richard Falconer. 235

Mr. Matthews the Surgeon, George Jenkins, William
ashton, and Ralph Smallwooa r , were taken in a Flip
called the Two Brothers of Bristol, bound for Scent*
de soon, after an obstinate Fight, where all were
killed, excepting the abovementioned four, who
were taken and sold for Slaves, and continued fb
for some Years ; but seizing on a Boat with the four
Frenchmen that did design to venture for their
Liberty with them, they put to Sea, and rather
chose to trust in the Waves, and an open Boat,
than stay there to be Slaves forever. But Hornet
the Renegado, whose Christian Name was Lewis
Gordon, having Notice of their Flight, followed
them with . a swift Galley, and got Sight of them ;
Mr, Matthews (who relates the Story in this Manner)
and his Companions seeing it impossible to make
their Escape, thought of a Stratagem for four of
them to get the Good-will of the Renegado Hamlet;
which was this: Seeing no Likelihood of getting
clear off, the four English proposed to the French to
cast Lots, and that should decide which four should
be bound, and the other four should immediately
jow back, as if they had no Design of running
away, and make out their Story as well as they
could ; accordingly we drew, and the Lots fell
upon the four frenchmen. Immediately we bound
them, and rowed back, and were soon met by the
Galley, where we made our Tale good, by telling
the Turkey that going a Filling with the four
Frenchmen, they would have compelled us by Force
toJhave rowed with them in their Boat Ui S^m'st;

bat



240 The Adventures of

but we being not willing, fell to grappling with
them, and overcame them by main Force, tied
them, and were bringing them back. The Frenchmen
kept true to their Promise, and never contracted
us in our Story. Hamlet upon this became
very mil to us, and put us in Trust : He made me
immediately Surgeon to the Galley, Mr. Jenkins
Master of the Slaves, and our two other Companions
had some little Office that pleased them. We went
several Voyages with him, and took many Vessels,
but never met with any English Ship before the
wager that we had the desperate Engagement with.
The four Frenchmen were made Slaves to row in
another Galley, which was taken about two Months
ago by a Spanish Man of War, and by that Means
got their Liberty.

The other two Englishmen y and Frenchman, that
were taken in the Cabin, confessed that they had
been guilty of many Crimes, but more especially in
denying their Saviour, but they now felt in their
Hearts and Minds a yearning to Repentance, and
begged that Captain Walton would forgive them,
and not take their Recantation for a Falsehood, because
they were in some Danger, but a true Light
of the divine Brightness. Captain Walton freely
forgave them, and having a Chaplain in the Flip,
we christened them ; and the Fellows seemed ever
afterwards to have a true Sense of their happy
Condition. Captain Walton and myself were Godfathers
for them all. Therefore it behoved us to
see, that they were now instructed in their Faith ;

though



Capt. Richard Falconer. 241

though these were of sufficient Years to know their
Duty without Sureties for them. We have many
People that undergo that Office, but never consider
what their Duty is, and, in short, make it nothing
but an outward Ceremony, when if they thought
of it, as they ought to do, they would find it of the
utmost Concern; for the true Office of Sureties, or
Godfathers, &c. is to train up the young Plant,
till it is capable of bearing Fruit itself of good
Works. But many now a-days do as the Turtles
do by their Eggs, lay them, cover them with Sand,
and never more regard them.

We came into our old Course again, and pursued
it with Succession we were got into the Latitude
of the Tropickk, we ducked our Men as before;
but there was a great Mutiny of the Sailors: The
Captain had three Dogs on Board, and they would
have them ducked as well as themselves, unless he
would pay the usual Rate ; which being promised
them, they were composed again, and the Sailors
and Dogs were reconciled without going together
by the Ears.

We overtook an EngUJh Vessel that had suffered
much by an Engagement with a Spanifh Pyrate ; she
had lost all her Masts, but had raised a Jury-mainmast,
yet could make but little way, by Reason of
her Leaks* Our Captain sent a Boat on Board, and
gave them all the Assistance he could ; but finding
it was but two Days since the Engagement, we had
some Hopes of coming up with her, for we learnt
from the other Ship Ihe was mightily disabled as

M well



24 2 ^ Advent Isles

well as themselves. So we Crowded alt the Sail
we could ; and though it was in the Night, we
made the best: of our way. The Vessel we left,
saluted us with five Guns to take their Leave,
which we answered with three; and in a quarter of
an Hour afterwards heard several Guns fired now
and then, as if some Vessel was in Distress, and in
an Hour more discovered a Light, which we made
directly towards, and coming up with it, found it
to be the Spanifh Vessel that had engaged with the
other EngUJb Ship two Days before ; the Light that
they made was only a large Lanthorn fixed on their
Main Top Mart-head, that we might the sooner
perceive them. We immediately hailed them, and
commanded them to surrender : They readily
obeyed and begged our Assistance, which they had
creat Need of; for the Water gained upon them
every Moment, and in an Hour's time the Flip
sunk, but we preserved all the Men, being in
Number 23. having loll in the Engagement with
the English Ship 27, and received several Shot
between Wind and Wa-ter, which they did not
perceive till they discovered two Feet Water in the
Hold, and found no Hopes of being saved from the
merciless Enemy the Sea, if we had not fortunately
for them come timely to their Aihfrance. But to
a ]by their Joy for their Deliverance from Death,
they were made Prisoners, and being Pyrates (as wc
supposed) for there was no War declared between
the two Nations ;-and therefore they might very

probably



Capt. Richard Falconer. 243
probably think they were to be punished with
Death when they came on (lore.

The Ship sunk so fall, that we could save nothing
but the Men, which took us up about four Hours,
and then we pursued our Course, and about four in
the Evening made the Island ifor&w&tt ; where we
set our Spanish Prisoners on shore. Captain Walton
gave the Governor an Account of what had happened,
and left it to his Discretion to do with them
as he thought fit.

On June the twenty-third we set sail for Domini
co f where we arrived without any Accident. Here
I went on shore along with several of our Men to
get Wood and Water for our Flip. The Natives
seemed very civil and came on Board us in their
Canoes,

These Indians are m oft of them tall, lusty Men,
well featured and well limbed, but poor Brains, for
an ordinary Glass of Rum will make them drunk:
They mightily like this Liquor, and will call for
it as soon as ever they come on Board you: They
wear no Cloaths, but a little Skirt about theirWaill ;
but most of them have Pieces of Brass it* the Form of
a Three-quarter Moon in their Nose appears* I
gave one of these Indians a Pair of Breeches, and he
made an Essay to pot them on in this Manner. He
first put his two Arms into the Thighs of the
Breeches, and desired one of his Companions to
button the Waistband about his, Neck 5 but when
we shewed him the right Way, and he had put them
on, he walked as if he had formerly worn Irons,

and was so uneasy with them that he palled them
off, and made Signs to have Tome Linnen in Exchange
: In Return I gave him a long Cravat, and
tied it properly about his Neck r But to see how the
Fellow ftrutted/one would have taken him for one
of the Captains of the Trained Bands ready to
inarch.

I rambled with these Indians several Miles up in
the Country, and saw their Huts, that were digged
about three Feet deep in the Earth, and then rased
about six Feet high above the Surface, and covered
with Barks of Trees, and sometimes divided into
Apartments by a Couple of long Poles, and Fathers,
Sons and Daughters, lie promiscuously together.

The Day before we sailed, (after we had provided
ourselves with Wood and Water) J went up to
the Indian Huts to exchange a Trifle or two for one
of their Bows and Arrows ; and returning towards
the Flip, by myself, lost my way; and though I
directed my Course (as I thought right) I came to
that Part of the Shore where was no Flip to be found •
but endeavouring to go more West along the <SVrW,
my Way was intercepted by some high pointed Rocks,
which I made several fruitless Essays to pass : I then
endeavoured to make a Compass within Land to get
by the Rocks ; which I did, but could not find the
Bay where the Flip rode, I was now in a deep Perplexity,
and though very much tired, yet resolved
to look for the Track that would carry me back to
some of the ; Huts, Where I might get an Indian to ,
.direct me; but there were so many various ones,' that

I knew



Cap # Richard Falconer. 245
1 knew not which to chuse. At last I pitched upon
one that brought me to several of them, but not
those from whence I came: I searched them, but
could find no Indians in them. I from thence walked
a little farther, but was surprized with a Sight
that (hocked me with Horror. Near the Skirt of a
thick Wood I found one of our Men killed, with art
Arrow in his Throat ; and by the Posture he lay in,
I found it was done when he was easing Nature.
The Object so overcame me, that I thought not on
my own unhappy Condition, till 1 was awakened
from my Stupidity by a Noise and Gabbling I heard
in the Wood on my Right. This put me into a
terrible Fright, which made me run as far from the
Noise as I could; fori made no doubt, that if they
caught me, I mould run the same Fate with the
poor unfortunate Fellow, who perhaps might lose
his Life by his feeking^me. When I had got a confiderable
Distance, I entered the Wood, and ventured
to look out, where I could perceive (though
it was almost dark) what they were doing.

They cut off the poor Fellow's Head, and tore
out his Bowels in a mod inhuman Manner. Let any
One judge what my Conti tioiifnuft be; Fm sure my
Thoughts were so confuted, that I might justly say
1 never thought at all. I observed when they had
done, they carried him between Eight of them upon
four Staves, and went towards their Tents. When
they were gone, and I had Leisure for Reflection,
every Thought was a Dagger to me; but yet when
my Senses were composed, I put my Trust in God

that he would deliver me from this Danger, as well
as several other immediate ones, which through his
Mercy I had overcome.

J crept farther into the Wood to rest my Limbs,
but^ny Thoughts kept me waking all Night. When
Day approached I went still farther into the Wood,
not only to avoid those barbarous Indians, but to see
if, when on the .other Side, I could find some Path
that would-lead me to the Bay where our Flip rode;
but before I could get out cf it 1 heard a Cannon
discharged, that both rejoiced and grieved me ; it
toyed me to know that the Flip could not be far orT,
and grieved .me to think that it was certainly the
Signal for the Boat to come on Board, and perhaps
they might be that Moment under sail. I ran withall
-the Haste I could ; but with a Mind mixed with
flop and Year. J got out of the Wood at last, and
I dir-eyed my-cows to that Part as I thought the
JvlQifeof the Qun came from, but.cauld find no Path ;
yet ,at 3 aft £ gat to the Top of j/l Rock from whence
I could befool die Sqi,£fi<sl wits great G f ief &w aur

I immediately palled off my Shirt, and hung it on a
Stick I bad broke to support me in my Walking ;
but my Signal did not do me any good, for they saw
nothing of it. My Despair began to be predominant
ever my Reason, and I had often resolved to
throw myself down from the Rock to end my Misery
; but still my Conscience would give me £ see ret
Check ; and at last J resolved with myself to submit
to whatever Should befall me, with a through resignation





Capt. Richard FaicoweRi 247
Agnation to the Will of Heaven. As soon as the
Flip was out of Sight, I went down from the Rock
(not having Power to ilia before) and endeavoured
to Sci fine Food, but was prevented by a hideous
Noise 1 heard, , which drove me to Shelter in the
Wood again; but the farther I what, the plainer I
heard the Noise, so that I knew not what to do, for
at last it encreased on every-side ; so that coming to
a thick Parcel of Shrubs I laid myself down, and
couched so close, that it was impossible for them to
see me, unless they came into the very middle of it.
I had thrown my Bow and Arrows away, as being
of no Use to me; but I had my Sword, which, however,
I did not design to use-the Noise came so
nigh me, that I could hear, the Tread of their Feet,
and the Boughs rustle about me; but at last it went
insensibly away, so that I heard no more of them for
some Time.

When I found all was still, I began to get up and
look about me, where I saw them in the Plain engaged
with several other Indian's, whpnrl thought
I knew, though at a good Distance, I saw several
of them fall upon the Ground. At last thole Indians
that went hallooing through the Wood seemed tome.
to have the worftofit, and were drove by the
other Party quick back again; but did not pursue
them any farther, only let fly, the; r Arrows at them ;
and one of them came among the Shrubs where I
lay, which startled me, for I was afraid they would
come to look for their Arrows, and so find me.
After the Hurlyburly was over, I resolved to go out

H% The Adventures of

of the Wood, and follow those Indians that were
Vanquishers, with this Hope, That they, might "Be
of a milder Nature-ibid not so barbarous as the cither
who run through' the Wood; who to my thinking
had more stern Looks than those Indians I had
seen upon that Part of the I/land where we used toland
to get Wood and Water. So as l said, I got
up, and directed my Courfe'dut of the Wood after
the 'Indians, but fours discovered two Indian Men,
and four Women coming towards rhe, (which I suppose
had hid them selves d tiring the late Conflict:)
It waste no Purpose for me ,to fly, for they had got
Sight of me; or if I had, they would have soon fen t
one of their winged Messengers after me ; so I chose
boldly to meet tried. When we were come within
forty Paces of each other, one of the Indians was 26-

• toing

to shoot at me, but was with-held by one of the
Women: As soon as ever I came close to them, they
looked upon me with strange Gestures, and distorted
Countenances : I put my Hand to my Head and
Breast, which is the Token of Submission with the
Indians; and they let me know by Signs that I must
go with them, which I did not deny ; for if I had,
I knew I should be forced; so I went willingly enough.
When we had got through the Wood, one
of the Indian Men would have my Coat and Waistcoat
off, which I durst not refuse : The Coat he put
upon his Companion, and the Waistcoat on himself,
and strutted strangely. I gave my Handkerchief
ind Neckcloth to the Woman that hindered the Indian
from shooting at me, who received it with a

great deal of Joy, and seemed mightily pleased with
me. When we arrived at their Huts, there came
out at least a hundred frightful-looking Indians, who
came about me, and had a great deal of Talk with
those that brought me with them ; but the two Indians
were forced to part with their Cloaths they had
taken from me, to two of the oldest Indians, who
immediately put them on, and seemed mighty proud
of themselves. They gave me some Rice, and another
Sort of Victuals boiled ; but what it was composed
of, I could never learn, neither did I eat any
of the same all the while I was among them. When
Night came, I was sent into a Hut by myk\f } and
the Door (hut upon me, I had a Piece of Mat to lie
on, but nothing to cover me. Now I had Leisure
to reflect upon my Misfortunes, which I could not
do before, by Reason of the Fears I was in. I thought
my Condition was now worse than ever it was, for I
really believed they designed to make a Sacrifice of
me, for I thought to myself they were Cannibals, or
Men-eaters. I passed the Night with a thousand
Anxieties and Inquietude; but nevertheless my
Senses were so tired, that I slept whether I would
or no; and in the Morning was awakened by four
of the eldest Indians that came to visit me, who made
Signs to me to follow them, which I did without
any Hesitation; when I was out in the midi of
the plain Place before the Doors of their Huts,
they brought before me several of their Women,
and gave me to know by Signs that I should take
one of them to be my Mate, or Bed-fellow, or sum

but not giving myself much Time to weigh, or think
of the Matter, I pitched upon her that I had given
my Neckcloth and Handkerchief to, and immediately
all the rest were dismissed ; and my Bride and
I (for it was even so) were conducted to a Hut,
where there were several old Indians waiting for me
to compleat the Ceremony. When my Bride and I
came before them, we were

that they brought us a Piece of their Indian Cake,
of Bread, of which I was ordered to break off a
Piece, and give to my Bride. She then came and
laid her Head on my Breast; and then, kneeling,
put my right Foot upon her Neck; when that was
done, she rose and went out, but immediately returned,
and brought me some £lcfli broiled on the
Coals, which she tore into Morsels, and put in my
Mouth, and stood before me all the while I eat. I must

When they had made their frightful Noise for
some Time, they entered promiscuously Men and
Women. The Men came and took hold of me, and
the Women of my new Spofcfe, led us out with
Shouts, unpleasing Noises, and antick Gestures ;
They continued it till we came to a River, and
then we parted ; the Men with me, ;and the Women
with my Wife. They put me into the River, and
warned me all over, and I suppose the Women did
as much by my tawny Rib. After they had given
Notice by their Shouts, that they had made an End
of scouring me, they put on 'my Shirt and Drawers
again, and led me to the Bank where my Spouse
waited for me with her She-attendants, and we returned
with the same Noise as we came out. When
we came to the Huts, the old Indians met us; the
old Men took me, and the old Women my Wife,
and gave us an Entertainment separately, which
lasted two Hours, according to my Computation ;
when they had made an End, they fetched us outer
our different Tents, and seated us on a Bank
ands then danced, and played such mad, rude,
Monkey Gambols, that put me in mind of the mad
Feasts of the Baahii in Virgil, for they would tear
their Faces with their Nails, arid scratch one another
so violently, that one would have thought they
had been so many Bcthln?iitcs y and yet all in Mirth;
for they would laugh such Horse-laughs whenever
any one of them was hurt, they quite stunned me.
When this Sport was over, the young Indian of
both Sexes took my Bride and I into one of their

M 6 Huts,



252 . ' ■ Tif Adventures of

Huts, and gave us an Entertainment of Fish broiled
upon the Coals,' and a pleasant Liquor, in a Gala
bast, that was exceeding strong, which soon got into
Host of their Noddles ; and as fast as they grew a
little tipsy, they reeled out one by ope, and laid
themselves before the Door of the Hut, and went
to sleep. My good Wife, among the rest, got her
Dose too; but was so monstrously loving withal,
that I could not tell what to do with her. When
Night came, .we retired to our. Rest as beforehand
were waked next Morning by another Kind of Noise
that was made, with rude Knocking at our Door,
or rather Basket, for it was nothing elfe, and five
or six ofcthe old Indians came in with Hatchets, and
other Instruments, to enable us to get Food for ourselves,
as I understood. My Wife took me out by
the Arm, and carried me into the Wood with our
Bows and Arrows, and by her Signs gave me to understand
that me would bring me where I should
kill some Creature. At last we came :o the Foot of
a Hill, which we ascended with some Difficulty;
but when we had gained the Summit, we. discovered
vast Numbers, or Herds of Goats. My Spouse

a Bungler at it, that I never could do any Execution.
But my Spouse was very dexterous, 1 as all the
Indians are in the Island of Dominica. My Wife
Seemed to have a great Love fqr me, and would always
make much of me, her Way. When we had
skinned our Goat, we took out our Implements,
and made a Five to broil, some of it. When it >v<is

ready, I gave my Creator Thanks for providing for
us poor insignificant Mortals ; and looking towards
Heaven, the Residence of him that formed us all,
my Wife fixed her Eyes upon me, and then looked
upwards too, with a Kind of Concern. After we
had done, I returned Thanks again in the same
Manner as before, and my Wife did the same ;
that is, she flared upwards again as if £he had a
Mind to see something as she thought I looked at :
And when she found she could not see any Thing,
she came to me, and put her Arms tenderly about
my Neck, and with a Sort of begging Tone, fecm-
cd to ask me, by Signs and Words, which I could
not underhand, what I meant by looking upwards.
I was really grieved to know that I could not make
her underhand, for I could not learn any of their
Speech, but here and there a common Word ; neither
did 1 ever perceive they had any Manner of
Worship to any Thing; otherwise, if I could have
made her comprehend what I meant, I might have
found it no hard Matter to have converted her from
their abominable Heathenism ;-fop she was of a
mighty mild Nature, very loving and courteous,
and nothing like the rest of the savage Crew, who
were prone to all Manner of Wickedness Her
Voice too, differed from theirs, for moll: of the
Indians pronounced their Words in their Throat, as
in.decd.you coulcLnot well speak them without guttural
Sound; yetflie, whatever .was theMeaningof it,
spoke her Words a different Way from the rest, and
had a pleasing Manner. I really began to love her,

and only wished she had been my Wife in the usual
Forms : She could pronounce any Word in EngUJb
that I would say to her, but I could never get her
to repeat whole Sentences; and all (he did was like
a Parrot. After we had done our Hunting-work,
I was for going over the Hill to view the Country,
and walked up and down a good Way; but I observed
my Wife was very uneasy, but especially
when I got to the Brow of the Hill. On the other
Side, which was about half a League over, I made
an Essay to go down ; (he laid hold of my Arm, and
pulled me back with all her Force, and with many
supplicating Actions seemed to beg of me not to
go ; and when she found I was offering at it again,
she screamed out so dismally, that it affrighted me
from making any more Attempts. 1 endeavoured
to know what (he meant, but could gather nothing
from her Words or Actions, that could let me into
any Thing : But the would often handle her Bow
and An-vows, and with menacing Actions let me
know there was some Danger. As we went homeward,
this odd Accident' Fan very much in my
Head, and I was mighty desirous to find out the
Meaning of it, and every Time I wentto hunt therewith
my Wife, I wanted sadly to get down the Hill
on the Other Side. This Hill was of a vast Lengthy
and extended from East to South-weft, almost across
the island. I did 'not krioW how to contrives, bat
after hunting I made believe I was very much tired,
and laid myself down' In order to sleep ; and my
Wife, with' her usual good Humour, accompanied

me,



Capt. Richard Falconer. 255

me, and in a very little Time I found she was in a
sound Sleep. I immediately arose, and stole away
softly upon my intended Journey, I got away from
my Wife without her awaking, and came to the
Brow of the Hill, which I surveyed, and found no
Difficulty in the descending. When I had got to
the Bottom of the Hill, I was mightily pleased with
the Evenness of the Ground, and the Prospect: round
me, which I could compare to nothing but the Vale
of Pelham in U^ycefierjbire^ bating the Houses and
Towns in it. I had walked up and down the Vale
for near an Hour, and was preparing to go back
the same \\ ay I came, when looking back to take
my lait Survey, I saw a Smoke at a Distance, and
it ran in my Mind it was the very Place that our
Men used to go to, from on Board, to truck with
the Inhabitants. The Thought took up some of
my Time ; and I believe, if it had not been for a
tender Regard for my Wife, I had certainly directed
my Course to the Smoke I saw there. But I mud
confess, I could not think of leaving her behind me ;
but .Curiosity put it into my Head to go a little
nearer the Smoke I had discovered. But just as I
was moving that Way, I heard a dreadful, screaming
behind me, and turning about, I saw my Wife
upon the Brow of the Hill, making. the moil pitiful
Lamentation imaginable. The tender Regard I
now began to have for my Wife made me make all
the Haste I could to her Relief, as thinking some
Mischance might have befel her. When I came to
the Bottom of the Hill, I sow female of the Indians

of our Neighbourhood waiting for me above, and
some were coming down. As soon as I had got to
the Top of the Hill, 1 was immediately seized by
the Indians above, and dragged along as if I had
been the greatest Criminal imaginable, and my
poor Wife hanging upon my Arm all drowned in
Tears* 1 could not imagine what was the Matter,
and what could be the Reason of their using me in
that Manner. I found it must be something extraordinary
by the Grief of my Wife, whose Sorrow
increased the further I went towards our Huts ; but
ere we could get there, it rained and thundered so
violently, that we were all well washed before we
came to our Journey's End : When we were within
Ken of our Huts, the whole Tribe came near us,
some slopping and dancing, as mightily rejoiced ;
others with the Face of Concern, and hanging their
Heads in Sign of Sorrow, and mightily lamented
over my Wife. After the old Indians had consulted
some Time, they tied me to a withered Tree that
flood at the Mouth of the Huts; then I began to
underhand what they meant, for I could perceive
they were bringing Boughs of green Wood, in order
to bum me, . This Sight made my Courage fail
me, and.it was impossible to express my Despair
and Horror. Found now that the last Day of my
Life was come, (for it was impossible to foresee any
Thing to the-contrary). My last Recourse was to
the Maker and Giver of all good Things, for I had
tried all Other Means in 1 vain ; as also had my poor
Wife,' whose Rage and Despair overcame her; and*



Capt. Richard Falconer. 257
she was carried away by the Women in the utmost
Agony. After my Wife was gone, they set Fire to
the Wood which enclosed me; which being green
and wet with the late Rain, was a great while in
burning; all the while it was a kindling, some of
the Indians jumped round me, and danced after
their barbarous Manner, while others flood ready
with their Bows and Arrows to shoot at me (as I
supposed) if the Fire twould burn the Bands that
tied me, and I should offer to ran away. The Wood
being green (as I said before) was very stubborn
in kindling which made the Apprehension more
dreadful : I made several Essays to break the Bands
that held me,' but all my Efforts were but in vain ;
and I observed every Time I made my fruitless Endeavours,
the barbarous Crew Hoisted and laughed
for Joy. The Fire increasing, 'I prayed to Almighty
God to give me Strength to bear the horrid Pain I
was going to suffer ; and, if it was possible, to go
out of the World with the Patience and Fortitude
of a good Christians, who was only going to change
this troublesome Life for a better. Compared myself
to a wounded Person, that must bear probing of
his Hurts, in order to cure them.

I nov had given myself up entirely to my
Thoughts of the other World ; and this seemed tome
like abandoning a barren Island, in order to goto
one where was Plenty of every Thing. But
before the Fire reached me, there fell such a prodigious
Shower of Rain, mixed with Thunder and
Lightning, that extinguished it. The Storm lasted

for



258 The Adventures of

for several Hours with the utmost Violence, and I
remained still tied to a Tree. When the Storm was
over, they began to renew their Fire, and brought
the Wood nearer than before, it being at first half a
Yard from my Body all ro-und, but now they piled
it close to me, that the Fire might the sooner be my
Executioner, which I wished for, as knowing it
would put me to a speedier Death. But before they
had well placed the Wood, they heard Shouts, and
Noises in the adjacent Woods ; upon which the indians
immediately ran away from me, and took to
their Arms in an Instant, old and young. The
Noise came nearer, and nearer still, till at last I
could perceive several Indians bolt out of the Wood,
who were met by our Indians and a bloody Fight
ensued. The Enemy Indians seemed to have the
best on it, by Reason of some Fire Arms that they
had, with which they made strange Havock with
our Indians ; the Battle continued for some Hours
with a great deal of Heat, and many of our
diana fell. At last the Enemy Indians drove ours,
ever* beyond the Huts, and I could only bear the
Noise they made, fpr J was still fattened to the
Tree. The Fight continued out of Sight about
half an Hour, when my Wife came running withall
the Transports of Joy imaginable ,* and after
having put her Head under my Feet she untied me,
and fell upon me with all the Signs of a sin cere
Love. I must confess I was mightily rejoiced to
see rnyfelf at Liberty, and let what would happen,
my Condition could not be worse than it was some

Hours ago. I could not forbear expressing my
Love to my Wife by Kisses and Embraces. We
went to our Hut, and I took my Sword that had
been laid up from my first being amongst them, I
was going out of my Tent in order to go with my
Wife to some other Part of the Island, that was
not known to these Indians : But just as we came
among the Tents, three Indians met us that had runaway
from the Sight (as I conjectured). As soon as
they saw nie and my Wife, they came up with a
great deal of ill Nature in their Countenances ; and
after some Talk with my Wife, one of them with
his wooden Sword, went to make a Blow at me ;
but my Wife interposing, received the Blow upon
her Head, which struck her to the Ground, bloody
and senseless. My Rage rose so high upon this,
that I could not contain myself ; but I drew my
Sword, and thx.uft it up to the Hilt in the Wretch's
Body ; the other two seeing their Companion's
Death, ran upon me with the Rage of Lions, but I
shipping on one Side, avoided the Strokes intended
me; They turned immediately upon me, and let
drive at me several Blows, which had the good
Fortune not to hit me; but I run ope of them into
the Throat with my Sword ; upon which he set up
such a Cry that frightned me, and ran away, and
was immediately followed by the other. 1 then ran
to the Affiance of my Wife, wholayalmoft strangled
in her. own Blood. I raised. her from the Earth,
and seated her under the Thee where I was tied,

and



260 The Adventures of

and brought her to herself a little; but I found her
Skull was cracked with the Blow the Indian gave
her, and to my great Grief perceived she was just
expiring. But the Sorrow and Tenderness to part
with me, (as I judged by her Actions) struck me
to the Soul. She laid one Arm about my Waifs,
and her Head in my Lap, but with such piteous
Looks with her Eyes that almost distracted me.
She made Signs to me to look upwards (as I fancied)
to pray f<?r her, though I could not tell for
certain what (he meant; but she pronounced several
Word? with Earnestness and Passion ; arid I really
fancied, if we could have understood one another,
I should have found "the would have had some
Notions of a supreme Being. Before the expired,
the Enemy Indians retained \tfith all of our Indians
Prisoners; I mean all that they had not killed; for
out of two hundred Indians of our Party, there was
not above twenty two left. They were mightily
surprised to find me, for many of the Enemy Indians
knew me ; and when I came to examine their Faces,
I remembered they were the Indians that inhabited
about the Bay where our Flip lay. One or two of
them could speak a little English*, which they learned
by convey ling with the English that usually anchored
in the Bay. One of them knew my Name,
that he had gathered from our Sailors enquiring forme,
when sent by the Captain before the Flip
sailed. Master Falconer y said he, me be glad to see
you ; white Men belong to great Ships come look
for you very great, and not look you here go away
,much sorry. My Wife took up all my Thoughts,

Capt. Richard Falconer. 261
who was just dying; and though her Strength and
Speech failed her, yet me endeavoured to pull
down my-Face to hers, which me kitted; and then .
sunk her Head into my Bosom and expired. I was
really as much concerned as if! had married one of
my own Complexion and Country ; for I had great
Hopes, if ever I could have made my Escape with
her, and could but have taught her EngLjb, to have
made her a good Christian. With the Assistance of
my now friendly Indians* I laid her in the Earth ;
They told me she was Daughter to one of the
Chief of their Enemy-Tribe. From these Indians I
learned, that those I had fell among were a Tribe
of Indians that had lived on this Side the Ridge of
Mountains for many Years, and declared open War
with those of the other Side for holding Correspondence
with /TZv/<?/ ; and where so stria, that they
put all Indians to Death that ever attempted singly
to go over the Mountains, which was the Reason
of my Danger of burning. The Women that they
took, (all that were with Child) were (hot to
Death, and the Men in general ran the same Fate ;
for they were resolved not to have any one of the
Breed alive. When they plundered the Huts, they
went through the Woods, and over the Mountains
again, and so to their own Huts, which I knew.
The old Men and Women met them, skipping and
dancing for Joy of their Success, and some mourning
for a Husband, Brother, or Father, that was
slain in Battle. These friendly Indians were often
plagued with their sudden ruining upon them, and

destroying



262 The Adventures of

destroying many of them, till at last they took up a
Resolution to assault them, and if possible to extirpate
the whole Race ; and they had often made
Inroads upon them, which lessened their Number
till this last ended them, as I said before. The
Women and female Children dwelt contentedly
among them, being they had no where to go. I
began to live contentedly among these Indians, and
used to partake of their Diversion and Labour;
as, Hunting and Fishing, &c These Indians were
so expect in mooting with their Bows and Arrows,
that I have seen them hit the Mark three hundred
Yards, within the Compass of a half Crown .

This Island of Dotnlnico took its Name from its
being discovered on a Sunday. It is computed to
be in Length about thirty Leagues, and about
twenty eight in Breadth. It is very mountainous,
especially to the North East. I have heard there
are some Fre?icb Settlements upon the Island; but I
enquired of the above mentioned Indian, who
assured me there were not any Inhabitants but Natives,
and of those not above an hundred Families,
who were mostly seated near that Part that composed
the Harbour. Said the Indian that I used to
talk with, there be some indeed a great Way off inde
Island, dat are our Fathers and Mothers; and
some of our Wives, that when dey die we throw
into the Sea, and dey swim to dat place ; and when
we die we swim dere too. By this we might perceive
they had some Notion of the Immortality of

to no Purpose. I told him of a superior Being; that
commanded all Things below, and that righteous
People dwelt with him after this Life. He aflced,
where my God did live ? His Throne is in Heaven,
answered I, pointing upward, where he sits to
judge the Quick and Dead. He live up dare,

It is our immortal Part, added 1, that ascends, our

after their Wise's Death ; with which they seemed
satisfied, but made me promise when that Time
was expired to change my Condition of Widower to
that of Married Man. I might have been accommodated
with a She-Companion if I had found
any Inclination, but I evaded it as well as I could.

The Soil of the lfiand is very fruitful, and there's
Plenty of evcrv Thing.

I could not perceive that these Indians worshipped
any Thing except the Moon : Which when at full,
they would all gather together, and, locking ,
(land, gazing a considerable time, and then
with one Consent pronounce a Word which sounded
like Hiu! This Word they generally repeated three
Times. When they had done Star-gazing they
would fall to Jumping and Capering like so many
mad Thing?. When that was over, they would
retire to their several Huts, and not stir out till
Morning upon any Account.

I asked Will (for that was the Name of him that
could speak Eugli/b, who was mighty proud, to be
called so) what Ceremony was it they performed
after they were retired into their Huts ? But he answered,
Me 710 Jell dat, Wife make much Noise, see no
care for at ; when you have new Wife, you know what
ave do, but me no tell till den* What gave me a Curiosity
to know, was, Will told me, that after the
Ceremony was over, I must not offer to come out of
my Hut, nor come nigh any of theirs ; for if I did
they would kill me. The Hut that was built forme
was ordered in another Manner than their own,

I used to go to fish in their Canoes with them,
where they would catch good Store ; and Jet it be
what it would, the Cargo was divided among the
whole Tribe, only he that caught them chose nrih

I told Willy that as soon as ever a Flip arrived
there, I did design to embark in her, in order to
pursue my Voyage : But he told me I mud take
care not to let any other of the Indians know it, for
they would never suffer any one to go from them,
after they had been once fettled among them.
How do you know that, fa id I ? Have you had
any Talk with them concerning me? He told me
he had not, but it was their Way: For he gave me
to underhand, that about six Years ago there were
four Men left on Shore upon their toland, by
Reason of their Vessel driving out to Sea by a
Hurricane ; and these four Men fettled among them,
and married Indian Wives, and had Children by
them. But at any Time when a Flip came into
the Bay, they were hurried a great Way up in the
Country, and detained there till the Ships were
gone, and then lived with them as before. But a
imam Vcffc! putting in there by Night, the ZV
glijtmun spied it, before any of the Indian, and
were got to the Shore-fide, conversing with the
Crew of the Vessel before the Indian found them
out ; but v.iieN they saw them talking together, they
were mi^U.Ay enraged. The four Men watson

trymen, and afterwards came on Shore again and
made it no Secret that they designed to go on Board
that Vessel in order to go to their own Country.
The Indians took no Notice for the present : But the
Day they designed to em bark, they set upon the Vefi'ei
with their Canoes, and killed every Person on Board
it. When they had done that, they took as ms.iy
Things out of her as they had Occasion for, and lot
her adrift* He told me that the four Lnglijkmcn
were the first that taught them to use Fire-Arms,
and in the Flip they took, they hid several
Mulktcs and Quantities of Powder and Shot. But
carrying the Powder to their Huts, a Boy met
them fmoakin* in a Care, they call a smoking
Cane, and by 1 me Accident the Fire caught hold
of the Powder ana Mew it up, ruth the Death of
eight Indians, and wounding several others. After
they had brought every Thrrig up to their Huts,
they took the Wives of the four Sailors, (the Indians
with their Chidden) and feet them to Death
with Arrows. This is the Sense of the Story Indian
Will told me, which was pretty hard to pick
out too, considering his Manner of telling it. The
Relation made me very upcafy, yet put me upon
thinking to shake my Escape the first Opportunity.
I waited a full Mouth before I could see any Vessel!,
but at lait one came into the Harbour. I perceived
they came in order to get Wood by hoisting out
their Long Boat ; but as I was observing. :hem I
was seized by several Indians, and carried at leal
six Miles up in the Country, in order to be secured

till the Flip was gone. I began to despair now of
ever getting away, being it was natural to suppose,
that they would be more watchful over me for the
future. Besides, I did not know but they would
use me after another manner, and not let me have
so much Liberty as I had before. I wanted for
nothing in my Confinement, and was only guarded
by four Indian that went to sleep when I did. I
once thought I might make my Escape whilst they
slept ; but afterwards repented that Thought, in
knowing if they should chance to wake, I was certainly
a dead Man ; for Indian Will told me, as I
was carrying away, that the Indians had Orders to
shoot me if I offered to make my Escape : Besides,
I should have found it difficult enough to have
known my Way, especially in the Dark ; for they
carried me a Place that I had never been at before.
I had been here four Days, and had given over all
Hopes of my Liberty, and began to call together
my scattered Thoughts, that were flustered upon
that Occasion ; when, on the fourth Day about
Noon, I was agreeably surprized, and wished they
might come to the Place where I was. I was not
hong in expecting them ; for one of them spying the
Hut, where I was, called out to the others to come
along; for here's an Indian's Hut, said he ; we'll
go in it, and see what they'll give us. With that
they immediately came in before two of my Indian
could hide me, (the other two being gone in the
Morning to the Village) : as soon as every favvthem,
though Strangers, I could not forbear mowing mv

263 The Adventures of

Transports at the Sight of my Countrymen. They
were mightily surprised to see nec ; and when I told
them my Condition, they said they would have me
alone. 'With them in Spite of their Teeth : But I told
them that was very dangerous ; for if these Indians
should raise the Village (that lay within a Mile of
the Shore) we should all lose our Lives* Some advised
to knock them on the Cad ; but I could not
agree to that, for these were Indians that had never
injured me. Two of my Countrymen had got a
Couple of Saw Water Flasks filled with Rum,
upon the Sight of which a Thought came into my
Head, that seemed the most likely to ctmpafc my
Design. 1 told my Countrymen, if wc could make
the Indians drunk there might be some Hope of
getting off without either hurting them or endangering
our K es. We drank to one another, and
the Indians did us Ju/\ ice in pledging us; for I
believe out of the two Flashes they drank one and
three quarters. It soon began to work with them,
and they got up and fell a dancing moil madly,
and a while after dropt down drunk ; we resolved
to t'.e them Hands and Feet, that if they awaked,
they might not follow us, and raise the whole Body
of lad.am upon us. With the Help of our Garters
we tied them fall enough without waking them,
and made the bell of our Way towards the Sea side.
AH the Danger we ran was iu meeting with any of
the other ImHsms, but wc happily avoided them,
and came to the Place where the Boat lay. The
Slr.p was ready to sail, having got their Wood and

Water



Caps. Richard Falconer. 269

Water aboard; and these eight Men were thole
that had been labouring hard in cutting Wood, £sr.
and so were resolved to go up the Country to view
it, never having been farther than the Place where
they felled the Trees, and happily for me came to
give me my Liberty under Province. As we
were getting into the Boat to go on Eoa.d (the Flip
having made a Waft in her Ancient) Indian Will
came running down almost out of Breath, and
cried, get quick in Flip, they come down presently
kill all, me go wit you, dey kill me else for tell
you. We hurried away, and Indian Will with us,
and got on Board in very good Time ; for before we
were well under Sail, wecoulJ perceive at Call two
hundred Indians bringing their Canoes them.
We had a brisk Gale, so that they could not well
overtake us ; for they never go above two Leagues
from Shore. Nevertheless they put their Canoes
into the Water, and began to paddle after us.
The Captain was for firing at them with our green
Guns, but I persuaded him against it, by telling
him it might be worse for other English Vessel that-should
come after us; and as they could not overtake
us to do us any Damage, it was bell not ta
take any Notice of them. When we had loir Sight
of Dominico* I asked Indian Will the Reason of their
endeavouring to detain all Whites i n that clandestine
Manner; and he gave me to know, that they
feared if the Whites llio-ald- know the Smallness of
their Number, that they would put them all to
Death, and seize upon the whole Islands The

N 3 , Ship



270 The Adventures of

Ship that took us up was called the Twins from
Carolina, Captain Fuller Commander; she came
then from Barbadoes, and was bound for Jamaica.
I took Indian Will as my Servant, and did design to
give him some Coats, as soon as we arrived at
Jamaica ; but for the present I had none for rnyfelf,
*nd made but an odd Sort of a Figure. My Beard
was pretty long, and being something inclining
to red, looked but oddly : My Linnen was all gone,
so that my whole Dress confided of a Hat, a Waistcoat,
a Pair of Breeches, and a Pair of Shoes, the
Captain was so kind as to lend me a Shirt and a Pair
of Stockings, and I got my Beard off, and once more
looked like a Christian. We made Jamaica without
meeting with any Thing material, and found the
Fleet at Anchor. I went on Board the Admiral,
and paid my Respects to him, which he took very
kindly. 1 there once more met with my Friend
Kir. Mnfgra<ve, and the rest of my Companions who
had given me over for lost ; for Captain Walton told
the Admiral and my Comrades, that I was certainly
murdered by the Indians. I had all my Things restored
me, that were brought in the Albion Frigate,
that arrived about a Week before me with the Stores
of the Fleet, after she had been in the Dock at
mouth and well mended. She also brought News of
War being declared between England and France,
and the Death of his Sacred Majesty King William
the Third, of Glorious Memory, and the Coronation
of her Majesty Queen Jnm. July the nth 1702,
the whole Fleet set out from Jamaica, in order fora
Descent upon St. Dominico, as was supposed ; but

Captain Fog, with six other Men of War, <r/~. Defiance
> Cap twain Kirby ; Greenwich, Captain Wade ;
Wind/or, Captain Constable ; Ruby , Captain I-fait 'on ;
Falmouth, Captain Vincent ; and Pendcnnu, Captain
Hudson, went in Quest of Monsieur Du Cafife, the
French Commodore, that was designed for America
with Ammunition, Forces, Provision, and Money
to pay the Garrison, besides several Governors to
be put in the Room of others that were called back*
We directed our Course to Port London, where Du
Cojjc was expected every Day : But when we came
there we were informed that Du Case was sailed for
Cartagena, upon which we directed our Course for
that Place, after having taken three Ships, one of
sixteen, another of thirty, called Heine de Angeles, or
the Queen of Angels, and another of six Guns
richly laden, besides three Barks taken by Captain
Constable, in the Wind/or, and a fourth sunk ; like-wife
a French Man of War of forty Guns burnt.

On the 19/A of August, O. S. about ten in the
Morning, we discovered ten Sail to the Eastward of
us, which we bore up to, and found them to be the
Fleet we were in Quell: of ; though there were ten
Fail, yet there were but six righting Ships, the rest
were Store-ships which made the best of their Way;
so when the Admiral came up with them we had but
six to engage. The Line of Battle was formed about
• Three in the Aftemeou, the Defiance led the Van,
the Wind/or the second, and Btmbow in the Breda the
third. These three kept pretty close together, but

*she Adventures cf

the other four were a League behind. At four in
the Afternoon we began the Engagement, but the
Defiance after firing three Guns bore away to Leeward,
and lay there out of Gun-flint all the Evening,
so that the whole Strength of the French Fleet lay
♦ upon the Admiral and the Wind/or till it was dark.
1 n the Night the Wind/or fell foul of our Flip, which
flared a great many, that were not upon Deck, as
believing it might be a French Fireihip, though
we knew they had not one in the Fleet ; but Fear,
as well as Passion blinds our Reason. The Wind
chopped about in the Night, so that we had the
Weather gage of them ; upon which we bore down
upon them, and engaged for three Hours; but the
Jtufy 9 Captain Walton, was disabled, and ordered
by the Admiral to make for Port+RoyaL My Man
Indian Will, who was on Board, defied like an European,
was terribly frighted with the Noise of our
Guns ; and every Time he saw the Flam, of our Enemy's
Cannon, he would squat down upon the Deck,
and lye flat upon his Belly for feme Time; one of
our Men that was shot in the Guts lay expiring, and
Indian Will was getting away on t of Danger, he said,
but unfortunately Humbled over the dying Man,
who in the Pangs of Death grasped Will so fall,
that he cried out lustily for Help ; but it was more
than' I could do unclench his Hand till he was
quite dead, and then we released poor Will, frighted
out of his Wits, who could not be prevailed
upon to come upon Deck any more till we told him
we had done Fighting. Yv'c took one Flip from

the

the French* that they had taken from the English in
their Voyage. The Fight lasted six Days, on and-off;
but the Admiral being wounded in the Thigh,
and finding that Wade* Kirby, and Hudson, did not
care for fighting, we left them, after disabling two
of their Ships, and directed our Course back to
Port-royal As soon as we arrived there, the Admiral
sent Orders to confine Captain Constable, Wade, •
Kirby, and Hudson and summoned a Court Marshal,
tried them, and found' 'them guilty of Cowardice,
excluding Constant ; and accordingly the other three
were sent to England ' to receive Sentence of Death,
which was executed upon two of them. The third, •
Captain Hudson, died in the Voyage, and so prevented
an ignominious Death. How easy it had been
for the English to have , taken the French, if they "
had been unanimous ; but such an Instance of Pusillanimity
is not to be found in the-records-of the *
Navy.

December the i^th, 1702, we were all concerned at :
the News of Admiral Eembo-w's Death, who died
of the Wound in his Thigh that he received in the '
Engagement with Monsieur Du Case, lamented by
all. I observed there was a perfect Groan in every "
Flip in the Fleets when the Admiral Fig was lowered
with a Whiff, - which is the Custom at Sea. He •
was buried at Kujgst&ivn,. where he died. He had "
several rich Plantations in Jamaica* and many Slaves.
He had made five successful Voyages' to Jamaica
and returned home laden with Wealth and Honour j ;
but the sixth proved fatal to him. He had a perfect -

274 Adventures of

Knowledge in the Navigation of America, having
been several Years Captain of a Privateer there. He
was a Man beloved of both Officers and common
Sailors; a Person of true Courage, and Fortitude:
for when he 'was wounded in the Engagement, he
Ordered the Carpenters to make him a Cradle, that
he might be upon Deck to give Orders. Nothing
went more near his Heart than this unfortunate Expedition
; and the Surgeons reported, that the Grief
he conceived from it, hindered the Healing of his
Wound, which was given with a Musket-Ball, and
not a Chain Shot, as has been reported in our Publick
Papers. Admiral Martin, as being the ended
Officer, supplied his Place till Admiral Whet Jl one
arrived in the Boyne* My very good Friend Captain
Hercules Mitchell, Captain of the Stromlolo Fireihip,
was made Captain of the Windsor ; and Admiral
Bembo being dead, I removed myself, with Capt.
fog's Leave into his Flip. The Fleet set Sail with
the Merchant Ships for E .gland, March the Bth y
1703, and met with nothing worthy of Note.

On May the we entered St. John's Harbour
in Newfoundland and flayed there till May the izth,
then set Sail for the Bay of Bulls, a convenient
Harbour for Wood and Water in the same island.
After we had provided every Thing we wanted there,
ve weighed Anchor in order to sail for Enghvtd. In
weighing our best B.ow:r (an Anchor so called) the
Nippers giving Way, the Captors-Bars killed us
three Men and broke the Back of a fourth, who died
in a. Week after*



Capt. Richard Falconer. 27^

November the 1 ft, we were separated from the Fleet
by a dreadful Storm, that threw all our Masts by
the Board, and our Bowsprit was also sprung, but
we wished that which preserved it. We were in a
very pitiful Condition, and I am furein great Danger,
for I really heard some of the Sailors at their
Prayers. We lost two of our Men, who fell with
the Main-mail over Board. The Storm lasted for
two Days, and the Weather continued so hazy we
could not take our Observations. We put up our
Jury-Malls, but could make but little Way We
had Captain T*iubbur?i y $ Company of Manes, and
Major Bowls* Major of the Regiment that did belong
to Colonel J ores, who died in the Voyage ; so that
having above our Complement, our Provision began
to be at an Ebb, which obliged us all to come to 1
half Allowance, and half a Pint of Water a Daw to
each Man, for we did not know how long we should
be out at Sea; but we made Ireland beyond all our
Hopes November the 20// 1 , and got fife into Galway
Harbour on the i^d, and it was a great Providence
we did so ; for on the zyb there arose such a violent
Storm, that mull have inevitably destroyers. This
was that fatal Hurricane that did so much Damage
in England, tsf* There were two Ships in Gdkvaf
Harbour that were stranded, and it was allowed by
every Body that we should have run the same Fate,
if our Masts had been standing; but having none but
Jury-masts, which we took down when the Storm
began to be pretty high, so that the Wind could
nothave the same Power over us , neither do I think

N. 6 that



276 The Adventures of

that the Storm was so violent in Ireland, by all Description,
as it was in England, Holland, and France.
We flayed at Galway four Months, and in that Time*
we had got Marts up and repaired our other Damages.
While the Flip was sitting up, I lay on Shore
in the Town. Galway is a neat well fortified Town,,
as big as Sal/Jlury, yet has but one Church. Every
Thing is very cheap there. I had my Board in a*
private House for four Shillings per Week, and feU
dom dined without two or three Ditties at Table r
W e bought the bell French Wine for Fourteen Pence
prr Quart, and sometimes under. We set Sail from
Galkytiy, February the zjtb, 1704, and arrived safely
at Plymouth. Thus after many Misfortunes and
Hazards I once more set my Feet upon my dear native
Country (accompanied with Indian Mill, who
stili lives with me, and proves an honest faithful
Servant; and J have taken Pains to have him intruded
in the Christian Religion, and likewise to
have him christened by the Name of WdHam Dominica,*
from the Island that he came from ;) and though
warned by many Dangers I had run, I could not
forbear making three Voyages more, but yet in a
Station different from what I went before. But a*
th y vivere but common Voyages, that is, nothing
extraordinarily happening, I shall conclude with
my Prayers and Thanks to Heaven for the many.
Mercies I have received; wishing long Life and
Happiness to my King, Prosperity, Peace and Riches
to my Country* and a hearty Union among my
Fellow Subjects.

Commodities, that ye have made London as famous
as that City of Tyre, that crowned City, whose
Merchants are Princes, and whose Traffickers are the-honourable

between the Trade of thane worthy Merchants that furnish
us with Spices, Plumbs, and Tajfaties, and our E aft-country
Trade thai bring' th us in Masts, Materials for
Cordage, and Necessaries for Shipping, as there is in Religion,
between Ceremonies and Fundamentals. Spices and
such Things are pretty Ornaments > and ceremonial Supplements
to our t'Veli being: But our East Conn try Commodities
are these which do constitute the Being, an J lay the
Foundation of a rich and flour wishing Commonwealth : And
without them, if not the Art, yet the Practice of Navigation
would be left among us. For we cannot jail to the Indies

nvlje Merchant in the Gospel, who when he had found
one Pearl of great Value, sold all and bought that
Pearl, which was the Kingdom of Heaven.

The first that sought after Christ, and (when they had
found him) fr fenced him with Gifts, were the Vise Men
that came from the Earl: They pre fenced to him Gold,

sat upon my Spirits, so that I could not look out
cheerfully upon my departing Friends : But I took
my Farewell of them, as if I had been going not
only out of England, but out of the World. I can
give no Reason for this Dcliquium, for I was sent on
a good Message, to preach the Gospel of Jesus
Christ ; I was embarked in a stout Flip with a fair
Wind, and a skilful Pilot ; so that the understanding
and rational Part of my Soul could not foresee
any, nor suspect the least Danger : But (Aire) Nature

was sensible of some approaching Storm ; for I was
no sooner at Sea, but I was in a strange Anguish
and Prepossession, so that I suffered Shipwreck in
my Mind, and all the Terrors thereof before it
came. I presently fell sick (as I usually do at Sea)
for Water has always been an unkind Element tome
: Yet that Sickness hath no specifical Name ;
we neither call it Fever nor Ague, Palsy nor Gout ;
but I think it is all these, with the rest of human
Infirmities, or at least an Index where we may find
them ; for I was so really Tick* that to be drowned
had been a Punishment indeed, but in my Thoughts
no Affliction to me. This Sickness was neither Tertian
nor Quanta, but Quotidian ; for I was as sick
the next Day as before. About four of the Clock
in the Afternoon, the Mailer of the Flip came
into our Cabin with more Haste than he was wont,
for he was quickened with the Sense and Apprehension
of some sudden and ensuing Danger ; which
though he concealed from me, I saw it in his very
Countenance, written plainly in pale Characters of
Fear and Amazement, which made me ask him,
Whether all was well? And like a loving, a tenderhearted
Man, who is loth to tell his dying Friend
that he is so near his End, he answered me, All is

nvclL ,

But when I saw him ftiift himself, and make

Haste out again in great Speed, but greater Passion,
I rose from my Bed, and crawled upon the Deck,
where I saw a sad Spectacle • The Flip having

seeing Death was so near. Oh how the Face of
every Man was changed by this Affrighted, so
that we could not know aloft one another, having
lost our natural Complexions through the Extremity
of Passion ! One was at his Prayers, another wringing
his Hands, a third his Eyes shedding of Tears,
when we had no need of more fait Water But after
this Fit, they soil to Work, and (as it is usual in
such Extremum) we were all busy about doing of
nothing, and we did we knew not what. We began

one Thing fed facti pattitet, but we presently

fell to another, and perfected nothing to our Safety.
The Mailer's Mate and Brother, whom we sent
down to search out the Leak, quickly returned tous
with a sad Countenance ; though naturally his
Face was red, yet Fear had snowed it into a pale
Complexion. This Man with trembling Hands,
Gnashing of Teeth, a quivering Tongue, and
Words half spoken, signified to us that the Wound
was incurable, that the Leak could not be flopped;
and the Water came in so fast upon us, that we mush
perish in this Moment. I never heard a Death's
Head speak before ; for he did look not like a Messenger,
but Death itself ; had he said nothing, we
might have read. our Fate, and Ruin in his Countenance.


Here was now no Room for Counsel, neither had
we Time to ask one another, what was best to be
done? But we presently cast out our Long-boat, and

shot off Come eight or nine Guns, which Teemed tome
to be so many Tolls of a Passing-bell before our
Death. But it was to give Notice to one Bartholomew
Cook t who was Mailer of that Flip that came
out with us, , and was but a little before us, that he
should come to our Relief. In these fair Hopes we
leaped into the Boat; but it was my sad Chance to
leap short, one Leg in the Boat, ahernm in Cbarontis
cy?nba : but not without some Danger, I scrambled
out of the Sea into the Boat; but was no sooner
there, but one of the Mariners leapt out of the Flip
upon me, and beat me down with his Weight;
which I took kindly enough, being willing to have
carried them all upon my Back to have saved their
Lives. But there was one, and but one, left in our
iinkingShip, who made such lamentable Moan, that
his Tears prevailed against the Fears of our present
Danger, and we took him into the Boat, when we
expected our Flip (whose Sails lay now flat upon
the Water) should fink immediately, which mull
necessarily have drawn our snail Boat after it, as
the greater Fifties swallow up the less.

But (God be thanked) we all came clear off the
Ship, but now were rowing we knew not whither :
For Mr. Cook came not to our Relief, and we been

not been kind enough to us; when all that knew
him will say, he was a Man of a soft, tender Nature,
and a Friend to others rather than to himself.

Now were all our Hopes dallied, as well as ourselves,
being in Despair of human Help ; for we
were left in the North Seas, which flora wear a
smooth Brow, but at this Time contending with the
Wind, swelled into prodigious Mountains, which
threatened every Moment to fall upon us.

To speak plainly, it blew half a Storm, and we

were now in a small Vessel :' what Credit could we

give to our Safety in a small and open Shallop, when

so Lately a Castle of Wood, which we but now lost,

could not defend itself against the Insolence of the

Waves ; we were many Leagues from any Shore,

having no Compass to .guide us, no Provision sustain

us, being stained with Cold, as well as for

Want of Visual ; and the Night grew black upon

us, having nothing in our Boat buta

nor drink our Silver; neither could our Pieces of
Eight keep us warm. Money, in its own Nature,
is but an impotent Creature, a very Cripple, inutile
pondus, a Burthen of no Value.

Good God! into what a sad Condition hast thou
now brought us ! for which of our Sins doll thou
thus punish us ? Teach us, O Lord, that we may
know it, and first drown ourselves in Tears of Repentance,
before the Sea swallow us up ; that
though our Bodies be cast away, we may save our
Souls. Such Language my troubled Thoughts spake
within me; for it was with us now as it was with
St. P aut ; All Hopes that <we should be saved were
taken away y A As xxvii. Nothing could preserve us
but a Miracle, being out of the Reach of human
Help ; we were sinful Creatures, and could not ex-peel
that God mould go out of his ordinary Way to
save us. Though the Waves carried us up to Heaven,
yet we could not hope or believe that God
should put his Hand out of the Clouds, and take us
miserable Caitiffs unto himself from the Top of the
riling Wave ; we had nothing to help us but our
Prayers. I am sorry that Word slipped from my
hasty Pen. Prayer is a Multitude, a Troop of Succours,
and many enough to deliver us out of the
Depth, though we were entombed in the Belly of a
Whale, as it did Jonah. Prayer, if it be well qualified,
is that Rod of Moses, that can turn the Sea
into a Wildemejsy and make us pass through upon dry
Land, Psal. vii. Upon this only Staff did we all
lean ; and I suppose it was with us, as in the Case

of



A Great Deliverance at Sea. 7
of Jonah : The Mariners were afraid, and every Man
called upon his God, Jonah ii. And truly, I think I
may with Modesty confess, I thought on those
Words of David, though after a more imperfect
Manner ; Out of the Depth ha ve I cried unto thee :
Lord, hear my Voice, and let thine Ears be attentive
to my Supplication. I Jink in the deep Mire, where
there is no landing. Let not the Water-food overflow
me, neither let the Deep swallow me up, Psal. lxix.

But beside our personal Devotion, I persuaded
the Extremity of our Condition pleaded for us, and
ourMifery cried aloud in the Ears of God, for Pity
and Compassion. It is an usual Expression, when we
see any Man extremely poor and miserable, to say
his Poverty, or his Misery speaks /or him. And commonly
we are not so much moved with a clamorous
Beggar, who hunts after our Alms with open
Mouth, and makes Hue and Cry after our Charity,
as if we had stolen something from him who begs of
us, I say, we are not so much moved with such
loud Impudence, as with the Silence of those diseased
Cripples, and infirm Lazar's, that lie at our Doors,
in the Streets, and say nothing, but shew only their
Wounds and Sores to those that pass by. These Beggars
fpeakloudefl to our Affections ; their very Condition
is eloquent; quot Funera, tot Or a ; Jo many
Wounds, /o many Mouths, that cry aloud for Pity, and
cannot chuse but melt us into a charitable Compassion.
This was our Case ; our Misery was louder
than our Prayers, and our deplorable Condition cero

vainly was more prevalent with Almighty God, that
our imperfect Devotions; for we may say with the
People of Israel) He beard our Cry, and bad Compassion
on us, Exod. ii. It is the usual Way of God
to help in Extremities ; when we are in absolute despair
of all outward Means, he loves to save us, that
we may say, // is bis doing alone.

For in this Moment of Death, when we were
without the least Expectation of any Deliverance, he
sent a Flip to us, which we mutt needs confess to
be Digitus Dei, the Finger of God, that pointed and
directed that Flip to our Deliverance : For though
many Ships come from the same Place, and are bound
for the same Haven, yet :hey seldom meet in the
vast Ocean, and fail in the same Line : for there are
no beaten Paths in the Floods, no Highways and
common Roads in the Sea. But such was theGood-
nefs of God, this Flip made towards us, and we
what we could towards it ; but we had but two Oars,
and the Seamen counted that a great Disadvantage
both to their Speed and breaking of the Waves :
Besides, it blew hard, and the Sea, that knows no
Pity, rose high upon us, so that we were forced to
sit close to one another, to keep out the Sea with
our Backs; a poor Shelter against raging Enemy,
who finding himself checked, through Indignation
flew over our Heads into the Boat, and fell upon us
in angry Showers ; so that had we not had that
Kettle, to call the Water out as fast as it came in,
we might have been drowned from above with Rain
of our own making. It was my Lot to sit on the

Weather

Weather-fide, (and there is no Compliment,, or
changing of Places in a Storm) and the Waves beaton
me so fail, that I had almost said with the Prophet
David, The Waters bad even entered into my

Soul, Psal. vi. 9.

And now we grew into another Despair ; for
with all our Endeavours we could not reach the Flip,
nor the Flip us: Yet that good Man the Skipper,
hung on the Lee, and did what he could to retard
the Course of his Flip ; and we, or the other Side,
did what we could to speed our own. His Flip
rode on furiously before the Wind, like the Chariot
of Aminadab ; and ours slowly, like the Chariots
of Pharaoh; and how could we expect, that our
Snail should overtake this Dromedary ! Thus our
pregnant Hopes brought forth nothing but Wind
and Water ; and we that before flattered ourselves
with an A flu ranee of Safety, are now as much confounded
with a Certainty of Perishing. It had
been better, I t'nink, and less AiHi&ion to us, to
have had no Hopes at all of a Deliverance, than
presently to fall from it. Ic did redouble the punishment
of Tantalus to kiss those Apples with his
Lips, which he must not taste with his Tongue :
to have Happiness near us in our Eye, and not to
enjoy it, is the Extremity of Unhappiness. Many
Manners, in a Storm and Tempest, when they see
a fatal Necessity upon them, are contented to die;
but these Men would murmur, Port ferre, to perish
in an Haven.

O 6 This



lo A Narrative of

This was our Condition ; we had a Flip hard
by, but could not board her by Reason of the Weather;
so that we were ready to perish, whilst we
looked Safety in the Face. And that which, in all
Probability, increased our Danger, and made our
Fate inevitable, it grew dark Night, so that we did
not know which Way to row.

But this, though it was an Evil in its own Nature,
by Accident became a Benefit to us ; for now,
not seeing our Danger, we understood not, ands
grew bolder, and applied two to an Oar, and so
broke through the Waves in a moil desperate Condition
towards the Flip, as we conceived ; and that
good Christian, the Mailer of the Vessel, hung out
a Light to us, which was as a Star to guide us to
him ; and so, by Degrees, we grew nearer and
nearer.

But left the Howxoner (for the Mailer was one of
Horizon) mould think we were lost, and so hoiil up
r his Sails and be gone, (for he could not see us by
Reason of the Night, though we saw him by Virtue
of the Light he lent us) Order was given, that
when a Wave took us up, we should give a great
Shout, which we did so loud, that I believe our
Cry was heard to Heaven ; for by God's miraculous
Alfiftancewegrew very near the Flip, and our own
Safety.

Now were we in Dispute which Side of the Flip
we Should go aboard, which was concluded on the
Lee-fide ; and Promise was made we should go up
by Order as we sat, left by a hasty Rising we should

endanger



A Great Deliverance at Sea. n

endanger ourselves, and by making too much Hade
to save our Live, lose chem. But we had no sooner
come to the Flip, but they all strove to run up at
once; and the Seamen being dextrous in the Art
of climbing, got up in a Moment, and left me
alone in the Boat : Neither do I blame them, for
Life is sweet, and when that is in Jeopardy, we
care only for ourselves.

And now was I the third Time loll, and in the
greatest Danger of drowning ; for besides the natural
Weakness I had in my Hands, they were so benumbed
with Cold and Wet, and made useless, that
I could not climb up a Rope though it was to save
my Life. But I held the Rope which was flung tome
out of the Flip fait in my Hands, that our Boat
might not stave off ; but it struck three Times against
our rowling Flip, or rather our Flip against it, and
as often struck me down in the Boat, which was half
full of Water; so that I was afraid I should have
been drowned in that Epitome of the Sea. It would
have grieved a Man, but now to have escaped the
vail Champlain of the Sea, and to be drowned in its
Enclosure; And it was God's Providence, the Boat,
being so often struck, did not break in Pieces, as it
did presently afterwards, when it had done its last
Office to my Deliverance. But having used several
Ways to get up in vain, there came at last, two Seamen
down to me on the Side of the Flip, and would
have heaved me up by the Arms : But being so often
wet, my Cloaths, together with my own Weight,
were too heavy a Burthen to be trusted in their

Arms ;



12 J Narrative of

Arms ; and in this Strait and Exigency, I really knew
not what to do. I began to have sad Thoughts of
my fdf, and to think, that I alone was the Offender,
and must now be sacrificed to the Fury of the Sea, to
appease and calm the Tempest. But whilst I was thus
wounding my B re a ft with these Thoughts, one of the
Seamen gave me down a Rope with a Noose, and bid
meput it about my Middle : But as soon as I got it on
one Shoulder, he began to pull, and had like to have
forced me into the-sea; but defining him to stay a-
while, I then got it over both Shoulders, and ordered
him to pull, but the Boat waving up and down, cast:
me off at some Distance, to that he firil drew me into
the Sea, and my own Weight drew the Rope so
fast through his Hands, that had there not been a
Knot at the End of the Rope by meer Chance, (for
he tied it not, as he afterwards told me in England)
I had gone down into the Deep in a Moment; so that
.1 may truly say, there was not an Inch between me
and Death. Then at the next Pull, he struck me a-
gainst the Side of the Flip, which I (hall always look
upon as a Courtesy, being the kindest Blow that ever
I received ; it was like a Dole oi Opium to a Man that
hath the Extremity of the Stone, which maketh him
forget himself as well as his Sorrow; and so it served
me, for I remembered no more either Good or Evil.
But certainly the Mailer was a good Christian, and
.was indulgent to me; fori found myself in his own
Cabin the next Morning, where I slept all Night
very well, though in wet Cloaths: But I found myself
fore and lame all over. I thought of the Man

in



A Great Deliverance at Sea. I J

in the Almanac, wounded in every Part and Member;
only I really was what he seemed to be, and
had some Signs Likewise of it on my bruised Body.

But I rose from my Cabin, very desirous to know
how it fared with my Fellow-sufferers ; and truly I
found them, contrary to my Expectation, heavy, not
with Sleep, but with Sorrow. I thought I should
have seen Joy ride in Triumph in their cheerful Countenances;
but their Looks were dejected, and they
murmured within themselves, suffering (I suppose)
over their Shipwreck again in their sad Thoughts,
and every Man telling himself of his own Misfortune:
But the Truth was, they having saved their
Lives, were now at Leisure to think of the Loss of
their Goods : And I know it was a heavy Loss to
some, who loll much; and yet a greater Loss to
others, who loll less. For they having but a little,
lost a great Deal, that little being all they had. For
my own Part, I lost more than I had, (for it call mein
a Debt, which I have not yet waded through:)
But the Quantity of my Loss doth not so much trouble
me as the Quality; for (besides my Goods and
whole Library*) I lost all my Sermons, Notes and
Observations of some Years Travel abroad, Things
in themselves of no Value, nor much in my Esteem,
yet they were the Fruits of my (many Years) Labour
and Study, and might have been useful to me, both
in my ministerial Function, and Likewise in the secular
and Lay-Part of my Life. But it were a Fame
to name any Loss, when God so graciously gave us

'our Lives; and a Sin to juurraur at any Damage,

when



14- A N AR Ratio E Of

when God so often and so miraculously snatched us
out of the very Jaws of Death, It seers to me like
calling Lazarus out of the Grave, and do we
think Lazarus, when he was restored unto Life,
complained that his Winding-sheet, and Napkin,
were spoiled by lying four Days in the Grave? Or
that he murmured that the Ointments and Spices
were spent in vain at his Funeral? For sure Mary,
that had a Box of Ointment for the Burial of our
Saviour, would boat some Colt at the Funeral of her
beloved Brother Lazarus. But these Things are not
to be thought upon, when our Life is given us : But
we are so enamoured of the World, that we cannot
but look back upon Things we love and lose ; and
we. would fain be comforted after our LolTcs, as Job
was, with twice as much as we had before : But then
we must remember, it was at the latter End of Job;
and before that Time Gcd may redouble these temporal
Blessings upon us.

The next Day, being I'ucfday, it blew very fair
for Norway* thither oui Flip was bound ; and about
Twelve o'Clock at Noon we came in the View of it:
But Norway being a ragged Coast, full of Rocks, and
seeing we could not reach it whilst it was Day, and
afraid to come upon it in the Dark, we turned our
Sails, and thought to have kept off the Coast till the
Morning, that the Sun might shew us the Way thither.
Which done, we sat down to Meat, some of
us having taken no Sustenance since we first came to
Sea; and truly I eat an hearty Meal, being the only
Meal, I made in five Days : And so we were all very
well refreshed and comforted. And now God thought

it



A Great Deliverance at St a. 1 5

it fit we should suffer again; had it pleased the Lord
before this Refreshment to have brought us in some
newDiftrefs, we certainly, being weak, had perilled
under the Weight of it, and the very Conceit of
it would have killed us, and a little more Sorrow have
drowned us without a Wave. But God will lay no
more upon his Children than they are able to bear.

About Ten o'Clock at Night, when we had set
our Watch, and prayed, with safe and secure
Thoughts we laid ourselves to rest, some of us upon
our Beds; but God had appointed an harder Lodging
for us, such as he provided for Jacob in his Journey
to Pagan-Aram, when be took of the Stones of the
Place, and made himself a Pillow 9 and lay down in that
Place to Sleep. For this our second Flip with full
Sails ran upon a Rock, and gave so great a Crack,
that it was able to awake the most dead asleep among
us: I wondered, I confess, what the Matter was ;
but the Mariners, knowing the Danger better than
myself, cried out, Mercy, Mercy, Mercy, with so doleful
a Tone and Accent, that, together with that hideous
Noise which both the Wind and Waves made
in this pitched Battle one against the other, it seemed
to me to be the very Image and Representation of
the Day of Judgment. I made what Haile I could
out of my Cabin, but was the last that came upon
the Deck; where meeting with our own Mailer,
with both his Hands upon his Eyes, which yet could
not (top that Current of Tears, which ran down his
Cheeks, he bade me pray for them, pray for them, for
*ve ball certainly perish. I could believe no otherwise,
being taught that Lesson by our Mailer; and therefore

fore I fell presently upon my Knees, and vvasjuft
in the Condition of a condemned Person that expected
the Stroke of the Executioner, the Night having
put a Blind before mine Eyes ; and having prayed
awhile, I wondered the Waves did not come to do
their Office ; for 1 forgave them with all my Heart,
having wholly resigned up myself to Death.

But so it pleased God, that the Flip with full
Sails (truck itself so fall into the Cleft of the Rock,
or rather, as the Seamen say, between two Sledges
of Rocks, with her Bow over the main Rock, so
that it flood as firm, for the present, I mean the
former Part of the Flip, as the Rock itself. So I
presently rose, and pulled off my Coat, with an
Intention vs cast myself into the Sea, and swim
thither; but was advised to the contrary by a
present ensuing Danger : For presently there arose
a high and mighty Wave, one of the chief Giants
of the Sea, which first knocked against our Flip,
as if it would have called me forth, and then with
greater Violence dashed against the Rock, and
brake itself in Pieces ; which did plainly represent
unto me my future Condition, and foretel my Fortune,
had I ventured to stride that great Leviathan,
and endeavoured to swim to the Rock*

But presently our Flip, like St Paul's Ship,
brake in the hinder Parts, and we were taught to
escape our Danger, by our Danger; for our Flip

breaking in the Stern, we were for-matthew
Bird cet to fly to the former Part ; and one
of Ipswich. of the Seamen (the same that pulled

me up by the Rope) leaped from the

Bow



A Great Deliverance at Sea. 17

Bow of the Flip upon the Rock with a Rope in his
Hand, which was fattened to one of our Mails, and -
held it with so stiff an Hand, that another slipt
down by it, and so all our Company, and some of
the Days, (Eight and Twenty in Number) came
safe to the Rock that Way.

AW this while, being left alone upon Deck, I began
to wonder what became of my Company, not
then knowing that they had found any iJeans of
Deliverance ; but perceiving that they all crowded
to the Head of the Flip, I went to see (God knows
that was all my Intention) what they did there, and
so I came to the Knowledge of their Escape, and
an Opportunity of my own. For I found a Dane
endeavouring to Aide down himself and a small
Leather Trunk by that Rope, who like a loving
Man took Pity on me, and presently whipt away his
Trunk, and bid me Aide down there : But I returned
him his Kindness, and desired him to go
down first ; not so much out of Compliment, but
that I might know how to Aide down ; for I saw
none of them go before me, and I did not know
whether I mould go with my Head or "Heels foremost.
I had no Time to aft Counsel, or make Experiment,
but presently I got upon the Rope, with
my Heels foremost, and Back uppermost ; But the
Waves beat upon me, and the Wind (which was
high) blew me round, and had almost made me
let go my Hold ; but, 1 praise God, I came safely
to the Side of the Rock, and they cried, Of, off
not out of Unkindness to me, (whom they knew

not

not in the Dark) but that I might make speedy
Way for another, which I quickly did : For having
laid one Hand upon the Rock, I came off the Rope,
and so on ail four, climbed up to the rest of the
Company.

I was the last that came down the Flip that Way,
for in that very Moment the Flip began to decline
from us, and give Way, which the Mailer perceiving,
(who was still aboard) made lamentable
Moan to us to help him, which we did with our
utmost Endeavours ; But the Flip brake, and sunk
immediately ; there was this good Man, and four
of the Mariners drowned. I saw the Matter, with
a Light in his Hand, fall into the Sea ; the saddest
Sight that lever yet beheld in this World, and
that which pierced my very Soul, to see him that
saved our Lives, lose his own. There was nothing
so bitter to me in all my Suffering at Sea, as the
Loss of this Man; it raised such a Storm and
Tempest again in my Affections, that I am not yet
calm within. I never think of him, but I am cast
in a troubled Sea of Sorrow, and suffer Shipwreck
daily in my Mind ; for as he was a Man of a meek
and charitable Disposition unto all, so I found him
kind unto myself after a more special Manner*
How solicitous was he for us in our Distress, and
used all Means, though it was to his own Hindrance
to save us ! and in all Probability, had he
not staid for us, he might have arrived at his own
Harbour in Safety. What shall we say ! shall we
plead with the Almighty, with the Prophet, Jeremy?

St. Peter on the Sea of Galilee, Mat. xiv, to come
to him, that for this high A& of Charity he might
receive him, and presently crown him with Glory.

Now were we upon the Rock, but knew not
where ; and some of the Company, before I came
to them, had measured it round with their Feet,
and had found it both a Rock and an IiJe, and,
contrary to our Hopes, inhabitable ; so that we
waited for the Morning Star to draw the Curtain
of the Night, and discover us sir ft to ourselves,
(for as yet, in the Dark, we were as ignorant of
ourselves, as of our sad Condition) and then, to-shew
and discover some Coast or Land to us, which
we hoped we were near to. It was a long and sad
Night with me : A Rock is an hard Pillow to sleep
on; beside, I was thinly clad, having cast off" my
Coat, when I intended tofwim, and had no Leisure
to put it on again, for 1 thought it belt to leave
that behind me, rather than myself. We went

from



20 i Narrative 0/

from Place to Place, up and down, I may truly
say, for I had many a Fall upon the flirny Rock;
sometimes we were up to the Ankles in Water, I
cannot say over Shoes, for I had none, so that my
Feet were cut with the sharp Stones, as my Body
with the cold Wind; so that I felt the very Teeth
of Winter bite quite through me: for Winter in
that Country, is an old Man with a grey Head,
when it is but a Child with us. At length
we lighted on a Hole of the Rock, which was
a wym Shelter to us against the Wind, And
now the long expected Morning drew near, and
we fain would have seen bcfoic we could. In
that Twilight, every black Cloud we discerned,
we flattered ourselves was Land; and here it was,
we said, and there it was : But when the Sun arose,
we saw it no where, only we had a Glimpse of
the Coast of Norway ; but it was at that Distance,
that we were not in any Capacity to reach it, but
with our Desires.

Truly, when I rose up and took a View of the

Sea, and the Place where 1 was, I was struck down
again with Amazement to see many Hundreds of
Rocks round about us, lying for the most Part under
Water, which the Seamen call Breakers, because
they break the Sea, and turn it into Feathers. It
was a great Providence of God, that we should in
the Night, with full Sail, pass by all these Rocks,
(the least Touch against them had been as mortal
to us as our Sins) and then to come to the great
Rock, which was as a Church above Water. I am

sure



J Great Deliverance at Sea. 2i
Aire it was an Asylum to us. The Country People
deservedly call it Jm-Scare. It was vie same Hand
again of God's Providence, that our Flip should be
carried with a full strong Wind into the Cleft and
open Part of the Rock, which was as a Bosom to
receive us ; had we touched upon any other Part,
we had been utterly lost in the Twinkling of an
Eye. They bat go down to the Sea in Ships, and occupy
their Business in great Waters, these see the Works
of the Lord, and his Wonders in the Deep y Psal. vii.
The Wonders of his Deliverancess, as well as the
Miracles of his Creation : Neither are the Creatures
more to be admired than his Mercies. There is as
much Wonder and Variety in these as in the other.
Oh that iw would therefore praise God for his Goodness
and the Wonders he doth for the Children of Men,
Psal. vii. 8.

But now again were we lost in the Eye of Man, all
our Hope was, that a Flip might pass by to relieve
us, which in my Judgment was Vanity of Thoughts.
For if a Flip should by Accident come by us in the
Day-time, they seeing the Rocks would be afraid
to come at us ; had it come in the Night, it had certainly
perished, as ours did. And yet we did hope
even against Hope. But having spent all that Day,
with sore Eyes, in Expectation of an imaginary Deliverance,
in looking for a Flip (or rather Castle in
the Air) and seeing nothing come towards us, we
began to despair, having now no Kind of Sustenance
to feed on, nor scarce Cloaths to keep us warm; so

we



21 A Narrative of

we again crept into an Hole of the Rock, and lodged
there, rather than rested, the second Night.

In the Morning we arose before the Sun, and still
we were looking for that which came not : And now
we began to be an hungry ; and some of our Cour
any went searching about the Rock, wishing (I suppose)
those Stones were turned into Bread. One of
the Sea-Boys brought me a Leaf of Scurvy-grass,
which I told him was Sauce rather than Meat. Some
of us went a riming, but with no other Angle than
along Arm, nor no other Hook then a bent Finger.
They put their Arms into the Sea as far as they could,
and drew up some small Muscles, which they eat
heartily. I began to be very sick in a feverish Distemper,
and ib had no Stomach, which I think is a
Benefit when we have no Meat to eat : But I did burn
with Their, so that I would have given all that
I had for a Draught of fresh Water. God
oftentimes makes us know the Worth of his
Creatures by the Want of them: Nothing so mean
in our Esteem as a little Water, we spill it every
where upon the Ground, and we look not after it
anv more; yet at this Time a Drop of cold Water
had been more welcome to me than the Gold of O-
phir> and in my Esteem, a better Creature. I went
into the highest Place of the Rock, thinking the Water
(that flood every where in Holes) might be frefti-
cr there ; but I found it fait ; so I perceive in some
Storm it bounded thither from the Sea. Though it
was fait, yet it-as Water; and therefore (like one
of those that were chosen to fight against Midian,) I
lapped ic with my Hand to my Mouth, till it

quenched my Thirst : But it came up again as fast as
it went down, and brought a great Drought with it;
and this I did very often, which I am persuaded was
both my present Cure, and future Preservation of my
Health, as a learned Physician told me since, Dr. H.

And now between Ten and Eleven o'Clock we
saw a Flip coming towards us with full Sails, which
lifted up allourHearts with Joy, gilded overourHearts
with Cheerfulness, and so painted our Faces with
Gladness, that we seemed to be new Creatures. The
Ship came nearer and nearer, and then we went all
of us to the Top of the Rock, and waved our Hats
to shew ourselves to the Men of the Flip. But I
know not the Cause, for they never came at us ; neither
did they send out their Boat to know what we
were, or our Condition. Whether this Unkindness
proceeded from the Fear of our dangerous Rocks,
or from their own more stony Hearts, harder than the
Rock we lay upon, I cannot say; but it put us out
of Charity with them, as they seemed to be with us.
He was a Dam, of the same Country with our former
kind loving Matter; so that I perceive there may be
several Dispositions under the same Climate, and one
Womb may bring forth Twins of several Natures;
one was as smooth to us as Jacob, the other rough
as Esau. When we saw the Flip pass quite from us,
our Hearts began to sail, and our Countenances
changed into their former Paleness. How soon was
our fair Morning clouded over, and our beautiful
Hopes turned into Deformity and black Despair? To
teach us that Man's Happiness is but for a Moment,

now-we-were all lost, even in our own Eyes; our
Condition, being ready to famish, would not give
us Time to expect another Ship, neither had we
now Faith enough to believe, should there come oneby
Chance, that the Mariners would venture their
own Lives to save ou .

So we betook ourselves to our old Remedy, <p«p-
(Mikqv KGtBofav.ovy our Prayers* The Danes (I con fess)
first began their Devotions, having sung ones Luther's
Psalms, fell to their Prayers, and then we sung one of N
our own Psalms, and as long as I was able to speak, I
prayed with the Company; and after some Exhortation
to my Pet low-sufferers, being very weak, I laid
myself down upon the Rock, thinking I mould rife
no more in this World.

But 1 overheard one of the Seamen, M. B. (the
same that first. leapt upon the Rock) say Let us ?nata
Ruth and venture to Sea, I had rather be drowned, than
lie Ure nd he flawed. They all presently concluded
to .follow that Design, though it was full of Danger.
Eut, you know, a finking Man will take hold of a
Bill-rum, and one that is ready to perish will catch
at a Feather. All Things fell out to further this design
n: For the Waicr had now fallen from the Rock,
and left on the Side of it the Bottom of the Flip, the
Anchors, the the Sails lying on the Rock

like Linen upon an Hedge. In a Short Time they
brake a Ma ft in Pieces, untwisted a Cable, made
small Cords, tied four or five Boards to the broken
Mail, put up the small End of the Mizcn-M«lt, cut
out a small Sail, with some slight Stern they had

made.



A Great Deliverance at St a.

made, and so ventured to Sea oh these Ruins* God'
oftentimes saves by weak Means, and preserves us by
% Improbabilities. There were four on this Raft, two
Danes, and two Englijb ; I do not remember whether,
it was by Lot* or voluntary EledlibiT. *

It was now a great Calm, fucft a Calm I conceive
as was upon the Sea of Galilee when our Saviour
rebuked the Sea and the Winds, Mat. viii. It
blew only * small Breath, which was our Advantage,,
for it directly carried them toward that Place we conceived
the Coast lay. It was the miraculous goodness
of God, that after the Loss of two great Ships,
he ftioujd save ns by a swimming Plank: For this
Raft past through, and get clear of all the Breakers;
had it touched only on one of them, they would have
rent the Raft in Pieces, as Sampson did the Wreath
when the Philistines were upon him : But they pasted
by them all, and we that were upon the Rock followed
them with our Eyes as long as we could see,
or rather as long as they could be seen ; for our Life
wa? wrapt up in theirs, and the Hope of our Deliverance
had no other Foundation but their Safety.

And now I may say, God stretched forth his Hand,
as Christ did to Saint Peter when he was ready to
fink, and saved these Mel, and brought them to
Shore; which yet we were ignorant of, and so pulled
in Pieces between two several Passions, Hope and
Fear, and both of them equally troublesome as we
see in, an Ague, which hath two several Operations,
contrary in themselves, as hot and cold, yet both of
them alike afflictive. Our Hope being with that

P 2 Violence



2,6 ^ Narrative of

Violence of Passion, was as wounding to our Affections
as our Fear.

But these Fits were soon over, for before Night
we spied several Shawls rowing towards us, which
gave us a certain Knowledge of the Safety of our
Men, and a Promise of our own Deliverance : They
brought with them Provision ; but we were more
greedy of the Shore than our Meat, and therefore we
made Haste into the Boats, and by God's Goodness
unto us, we came all of us once more to Land.

The Place that we arrived at was an Island in
Norway, called by the People Waller I/land; so mean
and inconsiderable, that Ortclius takes no Notice of it in

his Maps, for I have searched with
My Lord of E. better Eyes than my own, I mean
Dr. H. more knowing in Geography, and

could not find it* A Place it seems
not worthy to be remembered, but I am sure never
to be forgotten by us. Though it was a Wilderness
in its own Nature, yet it was a Paradise us.

There was but one House where we landed, and
that was the Parson's, an honest Lutheran, who had
many in his Family. They shewed us, as Saint Paul
says, no little Kindness : Acts xxviii. 2. The Language
they spake was Nos; but I think it was not much
unlike Dutch, for we that spake Dutch, did partly
understand them, and they us, and yet two several
Kinds of Speech. I suppose there is the same Difference
between these two Languages, as there is between
a Lobster and a Cray-fish, (which both are in

Plenty



A Great Deliverance at Sea. 27
Plenty there) for though they both are alike, yet they
are two several Species*

We made a Shift to tell the sad Iliad of our Misfortune
to the People of the House, and they made
a Shift to understand us, for they wept moil bitterly atour
Relation ; so throne would have thought that they
had suffered Shipwreck, and not we. Which shewed the
Goodness and Tenderness of their Nature, which are
principle* gratia, the very Beginnings of Grace* or elfe I
may safely say, they are theirs Dispositions, or at least,
Capacities of Grace*

They set before us what Meat they had; and the
Mariners fell to it so heartily, as if they would have
repaired all they lost before by their long Fasting, a^
one Meal. Their ordinary Bread was Rye-Pancakes,
but their Beer very strong. I thought of thztEngliJb
Proverb, A Cup of good Beer is Meaty Drink and charming.
Sure these People thought so ; for though at
that cold Season some of the People had no Stockings
nor Shoes to their Feet, yet they kept their understandings
warm, and their Mouths well lined with
Lubeck Beer.

I lost my Stomach not with eating, but long falling,
and so went sick to Bed : in the Morning 1 found,
myself well, 1 praise God. And we began now to
examine ourselves, and one another, what Monies
cur double Shipwreck had left us : all that we had
we freely laid down ; but there was an Ananias a-
mongst us, who, we suspected, would conceal some
Part; and therefore we fearchedhim, and found no
less than four and twenty Pieces of Eight, which

certainly this Man ftoleout of our Bags when we were
in the Boat, after our first Shipwreck, at that present
Time when we expelled every Moment we Should
be call av>ay. Did this Man think that Saint Peter
would not let him into Heaven without his Peter's
Pence? Or that he should go the other Way, and
mus: pay Chatcn nauhm fuutn ? It was a sad Thing fora
Man to ideal in article mortis at the Point of Dtutb*
But it wzz well for us, for we lost ail our
Monies in the second Shipwreck, but what this Man
side from us. There are some Divines that say, Sin
is committed crdlnante D:o ; but the Ancients are wont
to say Ceo frnm'ittcnte> which is a more modest and
civil Expression. I will not dispute the Que (lion
here: But I believe, if God did ever ordain Sin, it
was in this Man's Healing; for this Money was our
Relief in cur necessitous Condition.

We laid in this Island till Sunday : In the Morning
we went to hear our Landlord preach ; after Sermon
he gave us Coma dulix 9 a doubtful Meal, full of
Variety in one Dim, as Beef, Mutton, Lard, Goat,
Roots, and so many of God's Creatures, that it
seemed to me to be the £rft Chapter of Genesis in a
Dim > but so confounded, that the befit: Palate could
not read what he eat, nor by his Taste know and
distinguish the Creatures. Though God hath given all
his Creatures for the Use of Man, so that we may do
what weplcafev/ith them ; yet I think it not handsome
with our grand Me/Ie's and OlfcfwJiJa's to confound
and undo the Creation, cook it into a new Chaos, and

sauce



A' Great Deliverance at St a* 29

sauce God's Creatures out of o'lir Knowledge. I love
to know what I eat, that I may praise God for the
Variety ot his Blessings,: 'W truly I do rot K*mc
the People of this Place ; for I think it is not Cu^o-
-fityhere, butCuftom, and good Husbandry, rather
than Uxurioufriefs, who boil all together to fare
Charges,

After much Thanks, and a little Money, we
parted with this good old Priest ; and I having
purchased an old Pair of Shoes, at the Price of a
new, we travelled on Foot to Frederkkftat a City m
Norway by the Coast Side, and were very kindly
entertained by the Burgomaster The chief of his
Discourse to me, was in Commendation of the hie
Archbishop of Canterbury, whom he called Exalhn-
tijpmum Dominus, I wonder how he came to know
him. But Aire, thought I, if he be thus charitable
to speak well of the Dead, who could not hear
him, he will be bountiful to the Living, who are
ready to thank him even beforehand. And truly
he was Very kind to us, for he commanded some of
the City to entertain us civilly, and provided us
Ships both for Holland and England, with the :
Promise of some Provision at his own Charge.

I remember how the People ran after us in the
Streets, and what their compassionate Eye saw we
wanted, their charitable Hand was ready to give %
without asking. A good old Man bestowed on mean
excellent Pair of Mittens, which I brought into
England. We found much Civility every where:
though the Country is all rocky, yet the People's

P 4 Hearts



3° A Narrative of

Hearts are tender; God made them e melton fur*,
cut of a better Soil than their own Country.

But to make haste out of my Story, as well as
out of Norway; We went away from Frederkkftat
three or four Miles to Overfond, the Haven where
our Ships lay, having laid into the Flip, that was
bound for England, some small Provision, as much
as our Stock could pay for, yet not so much as our
Necessity required ; for had not God blessed us
with a favourable Wind, we certainly had wanted
much. But we, with all that was left us, which
wa now nothing, but ourselves, entered into the
Flip in the Evening. In the Morning, before wc
went out, there came a Flip from Lynn in Norfolk,
that (truck against our Harbour, which was naturally
walled about with Rocks, and so perished immediately.
This was a sad Omen, and it seemed
to me as a Prologue to a new Tragedy. We had
not been above two or three Hours at Sea, but
there was a sad Distraction amongst us in the Flip,
and the Mariners crying again for Mercy, Mercy,
for we had almost fell foul on a Rock, which lay so
cunningly in the Water, that we did not spy it till
we were upon it; but by the Goodness of God we
sailed close by it, and escaped it ; the leaf! Touch
of it had been our Ruin. Thus God oftentimes
doth bring his Children as near the Mouth of
Danger, as may be, but he lets them not fall
therein, that they may both fear and praise his
Name.

About



A Great Deliverance at Sea* 31

About Noon we came clear off all the Rocks on
the Coast of Norway, and were sailing for England
with a fair Gale of Wind. Bat in this Prosperity
another sad Accident befel us ; this third Ship
sprang a Leak, a new one I cannot say, but rather
repeated an old one, and so our Flip began to
swim within as well as without; and we had no
Way to relieve ourselves, (for the Leak could not
be found) but by Pumping ; which we did Day
and Night, and so took Revenge of the Sea, by
spitting that Water back again in its Face, as fast
as it came into our Flip. But now again we were
an a sad and deplorable Condition, being in Danger
to be drowned from the Spring that rose within us,
and to suffer an interline Shipwreck, which, like a
Civil War, is most dangerous, We had our Life
now at our Fingers Ends ; and if we had not lifted
up our Hands to pump, as Mcfcs did to pray, these
Jmahkites had prevailed ; I mean these merciless
Waves had overcome us. Good God ! in what,
and how many Streights hast thou brought us ?
,Our Sins are many, as the Waves of the Sea; and
so halt thou, O Lord, made our Punishments.

For now we were, as I conceive, in a worse Condition
than ever before; for though our Dangers
were great, or rather greater, yet they
came upon us so on a sudden, that we under*
flood them not. That Danger is ifs afflictive
which we less understand ; and that Misery we
apprehend not, is none at all, or at leal none of

P 5 our



3^ " A N A R R ATI VI

our own. But now we see Death before our Eyes,
and are ia Expectation to peril every Moment;
so that we may say, with Saint Paul, We die daily.
I Cor. xv. We were in the Condition of him that
seeth himself bleed to Death. In our former
Dangers we had like to perish • suddenly, which
had been less penal to our Affections : We were
now to die at Leisure, and to be drowned with
Premeditation ; which is more afflictive to our
Thoughts, though a less Pumfhmeiit for our Sins. -
Melius cjl per ire semel, quam timer c semper : the Fear of
Death is more dreadful than Death itself ; and it
is better once to die, than to be always dying.

With these Fears about us, and black Apprehensions,
we sailed on still with a fair Wind ; and after
four or five Days and Nights sail, so it pleased
God, we came in the View of the EngUJh Coast on
Norfolk Side, near Pinkerton ; where we saw the
Ruins of a Shipwreck, and the Country-people enriching
themselves with the Losses of other Men ;
the worst way of getting in the World. This was
the Epilogue to our Tragedy, yet we had one Scene*
of Sorrow more * For when we came near Yarmouth-road,
on our left Hand lay the Shingles, on our
right, the Shore; and we could not agree amongst.
ourselves on which Side we should go. Our two
Matters, and two Pilots, (for so many : we had in
one Ship,) like four Winds, blew contrary Ways*
In this Contest they made a fearful Noise and Quarrel
; their Language was as soul as the Weather, and
as high as the Wind, - and brought us in as

great



>



A Great Dlliwranee at Sea* 33
great Danger {as our own Matter told me), as ever

I think Monarchy is the belt Government in a
Ship-as well as in the State. Many Pilots with
their Overwifdomnefs, are oftentimes the Ruin'
both of themselves and their Vessel. .

At length we did agree, and ordered one of our;
own' Company (a Man, who best knew the

Coast,) to lit at Stern; but this crazy and ill-built
Ship, though fte was (leered one Way, stew another,;
as if all Things had conspired to our Ruin. We
resolved to sail by the Shore Side, that in Case our
Ship should miscarry, we might swim to Land.
These were but sad Hopes; but it pleased God,
we came safe into Yarmouth Road ; and having, call
our Anchor, thought ourselves secure. But our
Anchor came Home to us again; and the Wind
which was very high, had like to have driven
us on a Scotchman: They cried out, and so did
we; for they could not be more afraid of m>
than we were of ourselves ; for had we boarded
them, we certainly had endangered Both our
ships : but that God that had begun and gone
along with us in such visible Characters of his extraordinary
Mercy, would not now leave us at
the last, but did perfect our Deliverance; for our
Anchor, held, and we rode very secure that Night.:
The next Morning we hung out a Whiff, and there
came four Men in a Shallop from Yarmouth, and
demanded no less than thirty Shillings to carry mea
Angle Person, to Shore, when our whole Sto,cfc
was but two Pieces freights Though I did long
for Land, yet I could not purchase it at iWh a

P 6 Rate :



34 / Narrative

Rate : But at length they were content to take
less, because they could not get any more; and
took something, rather than to turin back with
nothing.

But they no sooner had got me into the Boat, but
they rowed me up and down, to weigh Anchors ;
for there had been a great Storm the Night before,
and many Ships had broke their Cables, and were
driven away by the Temper. They tried at several
Anchors not without great Danger, as I conceived;
but finding themselves not strong enough, they at
length brought me to the Shore, which was no
landing Place; but four Men, which flood waiting
for us on the Shore, ran into the Sea up to their
Middles, laid Hands on our Boat, and so ran it
on the Sands, and tumbled us over and over ; so
that I cannot say, whether I set my Head or Feet
first on the Shore. After this Manner sure Jonah
was cad upon the dry Land, when the Whale vomited
him up ; I suppose that great Leviathan did
not cast him upon his Legs : But a Man that had
made such a Trade of frittering at Sea as we did,
and after so long a Succession of Evils, would be
glad to be cast on dry Land in any Polite.

From the Shore I went into Yarmouth Town, with
a Company of People following at my Heels, wondering
me, as if 1 had been some strange Creature
come out of America, though they knew none of
my Sufferings, but saw me in a sad ragged, weatherbeaten
Condition. I presently got into an
Jnn, to hide myself from the Wonder of the People,

and

and from the Trouble of their impertinent Questions
; but chiefly, that I might praise God in
private for his great ard many Deliverancess. I
cannot chuse but tell you so much, lest I mould
seem ungrateful to my gracious God : But I will
say no more, left I may seem vain-glorious to my
Friend. Therefore I will conceal from you my
particular Devotions : Non eft Religio ubi omnia
patent ; I learned it from the Door of a Capuchin's

Convent.

The Sign of the Inn was the Arms of Varmottif?,
the Man, I suppose the Host of the House, was as
kind to me as Saint Paul 9 * Host Gains was to him.
And here I must not forget the kindness
of a true Friend indeed, a good * Thomas Lc-
Samarhatu * who had Compassion on man, Esq. of
me, bound up my Wounds, pouring TVenbejlon in
in Oil and Wine, and set me on his SajblL
own Beast, brought me to his own
House, and had a Care of me ; and, which I took
most kindly, he bestowed on my Sufferings Nazi-
anzen's Charity, a Tear of Companion, [Rat 6.
5/ nihil babes, da iaernmulam']. Gcd I hope, will turn
this Kindness to me, in Blessings upon him, and
his dear Wife and Children. By the Kindness of
this Gentleman, 1 was recruited with all Manner of
Comforts ; and now behold another Shipwreck,
not of my Goods but good Name. Some there
were, when they heard of the Monster of my Sufferings,
were affrighted out of their Wits, I
suppose, as well as out of their Charity, and concluded




3f A Parr a time of '

eluded I was a Malignant. Thus God is pleased
to assimilate my Sufferings to Saint Paul's in some
Measure (the Latchet of whose Shoe I am not
worthy to untie) who, when he had escaped the
Danger of the Sea, was flung by a Viper as soon
as he came to Shore. Arts xxviii. Suppose I should
say, I do serve my God that Way which the World
calls Malignancy. Ami such an one, because the
People say it ? Or was Saint Paid an Here tick, because
the World thought him so ? I do not care

Baptist, the Morning Star of the Gospel! ; and like-wife
our Blessed Saviour himself, that glorious Sun
of Righteousness, or as St. Ltdc calls him, Lukeiw
the Day that f-rings from on h ;gh ; although their Deportment
in the World vas different, walking under

the Sen of Man is come eating and drinking, and yc
soy behold a gluttonous Man, and a JVinc-hihher, and a

Thus the People are never pleased, neither fail nor
falling. Neither the; Austerity of St. Johns Life,
nor the Sweetness and Familiarity of our Saviour's
Conversation could content the People.

But you are a knowing Person, and one whose

Thus I have given, at your earnest Request, the
sad. Story of my Sufferings in my Eaftlaiid Voyage*
What I have related, my unhappy Evidence hath
found it too true ; yet I cannot tell you nil, for
there were many Dangers which I understood not.
It was my Chance, a if car after our Arrival in England,
to meet with one of my Fellow Sufferers,
(M. B. the same Man that drew me out of the Sea) :
he presently began to repeat our Shipwrecks, (for
Men that have faltered together, love to talk of
their Dangers past, and bemoan one another) ; he
made Mention of several Streights, Extremities,
Dangers, Deaths that we were in, which I do not
remember; so that from his Mouth this Story
seemed to be so prodigious a Romance, that few but
those that felt it would believe. But I have not
told you in this Relation, what others say, but what
1 myself have faltered; and though I was loth to
begin, I am now as unwilling to make an End' -
Omnibus hoc Vitium — And therefore I shall tell you
what further Adversity I have suffered by this barbarous
Element of Water.

I will not tell you of my Venture over the Ears
in foul Weather to the Mm at Dantzk.i in the baltic
Seas, for that it may be was our Fear, and not
Danger; neither will I speak of my Passage from

I was advised by a French Gentleman, that had

formerly travelled with my noble

Whose Bro Lord t ] ie pre sent Earl of weather,
Mr. Robert ^ * net tQ ^ thebaid
Fane, was in our .
Company. at Agency, for the Badge is

made, not with a direct Line
over the River, but something obliquely, and so
oftentimes dangerous to Passengers. When we
came near the Bridge, I would have bribed the
Bather with a $part cFE/cu, to have fct myself and
two of my Company ashore on this Side the Bridge,
and to have taken us in on the other Side. But the
rest of the Company were unwilling to be hindered
in their PafTage, and we were almost as contented to
venture. But this thin Deal Boat (which Boats are
made on purpose to swim down the River to Wants 9
and return no more), came with a swift Stream towards
a Corner of one of the Arches of the Bridge,
which the Bather seeing, cried Sous sommes perdu,
We are all lost. He did strive, by putting his Rudder
against the Bridge, to keep off the Blow, but
brought it upon himself ; for it beat him all along,
and (truck off one Beard of our Boat, that we Adam
almost equal with the Stream, and the Water looked
in upon us : One Touch more would have darned

our

our Boat in Pieces, and so we had been all drowned
in whole sale ; for there was no Avimmiog oat of a
Crowd, when our Arms were pinioned together with,
fitting close to one another. But by the Goodness
of God we got through the Arch, and came safe to
Shore.

There came presently to me two Corddier Friars
which were our Fellow Passengers ; the one bade me
thank him, for he made the biggest Cross ; the other
told me, / must thank him, for he prayed unto the
Blcjfd Virgin for us. I do remember, indeed, when
we were in our greatest Danger, these Friars being
struck with Fear, (which oftentimes killed before
Death), fell down in the Midst of the Boat ; one
of them measured himself with his Finger, or, a3
he saith, crossed himself ; the other pulled out a
small Image, I suppose of Wood, about the bigness
of my great Toe, and it seemed to me not
much unlike; to this he whispered something,
which I believe it did not hear, no more than we.
I thanked them both, one for his civil Ignorance,
the other for his religious Folly. I confess, in so
sad and serious a Matter as drowning, I do not love
fuel Puppet Piety, such mechanic and handicraft
Devotion; my Thanks must be addressed to God,
the Author and Fountain of our Deliverance, after
a more fpi ritual Manner.

After this, the same Year, it was my Business to
return into England. I came to Calais the Day after
the Packet-boat was gone. Being weary of a chargeable

Town, and burning with desire of seeing my
own Country again ; having taken Advice by a
Merchant, I ventured to Sea in a Shallop, which

the Tide before ane from Dwr, and brought
three Ahnaim safe to Cain*, without any
Danger. The Example of their safe Arrival,
was a sufficient Argument to persuade rne to
venture from thence to Dover. So at four of
the Clock in the Mo/nin* with the Tide we went
to Sea; but had not r r-nc half a Le.'^ue. but there
arose a great and mighty Wind, which did blow
not only our Candle, but our Lanthorn out, I mean
out of the Boat, so that we were fain to let our Boat,
drive till it was Day-light.

I o ire red the Seamen their Fare to carry us back
again to Ca!r.ts> which they did endeavour, but
could not, the Wind was so strong ; yet as fair a
Wind as could blow out of the Sky to carry us to
Dover ; but we had too much of it* The Surfeit of
good Things is as great an Evil as the Want of
them, and a Man may be too well sometimes. How
did Neptune play at Tennis with us poor Mortals,

and how like Balls were we banded up and down by
his furious Waves ? Sometimes, as the Psalmist
faith, they mounted us up to Heaven, as if they would
have shewn us Lazarus in the Bosom of Abraham.
Sometimes they carried us down in the Deep, as if we
had been sent with more than a Drop of Water to
cool the Tongue of Dives. By and by there arose
a great Wind, which with the first Blast split our
Fail in Pieces ; so that we were forced to use our
great Sais, which was too big for the Wind, as the

Wia



A Great Dehwrance at Sea* 41
Wind was for it, and therefore we made Use but of
one half: the other lying on the Side of the Boat,
made it run so much on that Side, that I expected
every Moment it mould topple over. We could
not go backward, and we were afraid to go forward.
I laid myself down in the Boat from the
View of these threatening Waves (as a dying Man
is not willing to look the Executioner in the Face),
expecting every Moment to be swallowed by those
roaring Lions of the Sea, who came upon us with
open Mouths, ready to devour us. But God flopped
the Mouths of those Lions that they mould not
hurt us; and our small Velle rode in Safety and
Triumph upon the Head of the proudest Wave. We
could not say to the Pilot, as the Emperor did, O-
farm <z'cJw, Esse. — but there was in our Boat a noble
Gentleman, both by Birth and Virtue, (the bell
and truest Nobility), and likewise another civil person.
These Gentlemen had so much Worth and
Merit in them, that they should not need fear the
Threatening of an insolent Wave, but might boldly
say unto the Sea, Sea, do thy nvcrft. But I'll rather
impute all to the Goodness of God, in whose Hands
we were, and therefore could not miscarry.

By and by a Wave took us up, and shewed us
England: But it was with us as it was with Moses, we
might from this watry Pi hah > and Mountain of the
Sea, behold the Land with our Eyes, which yet we
must not reach with our Feet. One of these Gentlemen
called to me to rise, saying, I might see Dover
Castle : But I thought it of no Concernment tome,
and therefore lay Mill, but wishing that we

The Storm continued fall, and the Wind blew very

Wgh, which though it put us in great Danger, yet

being fair for us, blew us the sooner out of it.

For now we came near Dover, and therefore I
desired my Friend to lie off my Legs, for now I
thought I should have some Use of them myself ;
which he did, and I rose up and saw a World of
People Handing upon the Pier at Dover, holding up
their Hands, not only in Admiration of our Dangers,
but in Zeal and Devotion for our Deliverance.
They directed us with their Hands which Way we
had best: enter into Dover, and so with a fresh Gale
of God's Mercy, as well as with a fair Blast of
Wind, with full Sails, we, not without some Mango
in hitting the Pier, ran ashore.

I must not omit one Mercy more, (which I forgot
in my last) because it is so near of Kin, and allied
to my Deliverancess at Sea, a Pre-deliverance, a
Deliverance before-hand, an antedated Mercy,

For



A Great Deliverance at Sea. 43

For after I had spent Come Time in Prussia, and
had seen Ebbing, Koninjberg, which is the University ;
the Pillow, which is both the Key to the Country,
and to the chief Revenue of the Marquis of Brandenburg
in Prujpay I returned to Daztzick, with a
Resolution for England, having met with a fair Opportunity
as well as a Wind ; for there was one
Captain Sharper of Ncw-Cafth, a King's Man, (as
they call those that love the King in that Country) ;
this was Argument enough both to confirm and
hasten my Resolution.

This honest Captain being ready fraught and bound
for England, 1 presently went to him tofpeak forum
PafTage; he, like a kind Man, as well as a King's
Man, promised me a Passage gratis. The English
Company at DantzSck understanding so much, the
greater Part of them came to me, and importuned
me to stay with them, and continue my preaching
with a Promise to answer my Pains with more than
I could desire or deserve. This unexpected Kindness
and Love, which is above the Price of any Reward
upon Earth, soon melted me into a Compliance with
their Desires, and so without any Contract, I freely,
as suddenly, without farther Counsel, promised
to stay with them.

But God was in it, who inclined our Hearts to
those Ways which lead to our Safety and Felicity,
though we do not for the present see the Secrets of
his Love and Wisdom ; for this good Man, Captain

tain Sharper* with all his Company # , Come few
Bays after they went to Sea, were cast away near
the Sound, not a Man escaped. Thus God sometimes,
prevented his Children from falling into Evil, *s .

To deliver his Children when they are fallen into
any Calamity and Trouble, is an high and broad
Expression of his Love and Kindness to them ; yet
there is some Bitterness in the Evil, though there
be Sweetness in the Deliverance : but now, by
IrH .Grace and Goodness, to escape before weare
taken, and to be delivered before we suffer,
is a Mercy we cannot hope for, a Blessing we
could not expect, and I am fare cannot express.



Amongst them were my two loving Friends,
Mr. Randolph Price, el deft Son to Mr. Price of Ember,
a Gentleman of great Hopes, taken away in the
Flower of his Youth and Virtue. I gave him the,
Holy and blessed Sacrament before he went to Sea, .
which he received with much Devotion, which no
Doubt was a present and heavenly Cordial to himself;
so I mention it as a dwelling and perpetual
Comfort to his still weeping Friends, Captain Vaug- X
han, who accompanied me in my first Voyage into
the Earl Country. .

I* is like pure Wine without the Allay of Water;
a lively Picture, and true Portraiture of the States
the Blessed In Heaven, who possess Fulness of
Joy without any Mixture of Sorrow, and Life
without the Shadow of Death. I hope I (hall never
forget this great Mercy ; and it is the greater,
because it was bellowed upon one that had no
Tideto.it> but the free Grace and Goodness of
God.

After these great and many Dangers at Sea,
and as many and great Deliverancess, I had
thought once to tell you what happened to me oa
the Shore. > * *

Plus habet infeft Terra tigris Aqua.

But T will conceal them from my Friends; for in
this (ad Age every Man hath Sorrow enough of his
- own, and is not atJLeifure to consider the sad Condition
of another from bemoaning and pitying
himself: I will therefore conclude, giving Glory to
God for his many Mercies, and my Thanks to
you for giving me an Opportunity to remember
them.

I hope you will pardon my plain Language; Sorrow
is dull and black, and sad Stories ought not to
be presented in painted Words, and gaudy Expressions
of Rhetorick, No Man mourned in coloured
Safety. What is wanting in Allegories, you have
