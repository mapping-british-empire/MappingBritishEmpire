        Description of Rio De Janeiro
        A De[s]cription of the Bay or River of Rio de Janeira
        The few days delay we met with in geting out of of Rio de Janeira gave me an opportunity to draw a Plan of Plot or Sketch of great part of the Bay, but the Strict Watch that was kept over us dureing our whole stay [strike needed to be checked] ^ hinderd me from takeing so accurate a Survey as I could wished ^ to have done and as all the observations I could make was taken from on board the Ship, for this reason the Plan hath no pretentions to accuracy, yet it will give a very good Idea of the place, difering not much from the truth in what is essential. 
        The Bay of Rio de Janeira ^ is by some called a River which ^ its name signifies, but this I think is improper it being nothing more than a deep inlet of the Sea, into which no considerable fresh water River empties it self that I could hear of: be this as it will, it is Capacious and Capable of containing a Vast number of Shipping where they may ride in perfect Security. 
        The entrance is Situated WBN 18 Leagues from Cape Frio and may be known by a remarkable Hill in the form of a Sugr Loafe at the West entrance of the Bay; but as all the Coast is exceeding high terminating at top in peek'd Hills, it is much better known by the Islands laying before it, one of which / calld Rodonda / is high and round in form of a Hay Stack and liesSBW 2½ Leagues from the Sugr Loaf or entrance of the Bay. A little without the East entrance of the Bay and near the Shoar lay two Islands near each other. 3 Leagues to the Eastward of these Islands and 4 Miles from the shoar are 2 low rocky Islands and which are the first you meet with in coming from the Eastward or from Cape Frio. 
        To Sail into Rio de Janeira there is not the least danger untill you are the Length of the Fort of Santa Cruz which stands on the point which forms the East entrance of the Bay or River. At the West entrance is Fort Lozio built upon a Rock which lies close to the Main land, the distance from one Fort to the other is ¾ of a Mile East and West, but the Channell for Shipping is not quite so broad by reason of suncken rocks laying off each of the Forts. These rocks may not be properly place'd in the Plan being only laid down from the information of the Pilots. The narrowness of the Channell here causeth the tides both Flood and Ebb to run pretty strong in so much that you can not stem it without a fresh breeze of wind, now there ^ nor is it safe anchoring by reason because the bottom is foul and rocky. By keeping in the Middle of the Channel you will not only a Voide being force'd to come to an Anchor but all other dangers. 
        Being got within the Entrance your course up the Bay is first NBW½W 
                
              
              
              
              
                
              
            
        
      

        
        and NNW something more than one League. This brings you the length of the Great Road, and NW and WNW one League more carries you the length of the Ilha dos Cobras which lies before the City. Keep the North side of this Island close on board and Anchor above it in 5 fathom water where you see most convenient before the monestry of Benidictines which stands upon a hill at the NW end of the City: Small Ships and Vessels generaly lay between the Town and the Ilha dos Cobras but in order to get there they must come round the North side of that Island.
        I shall now give the best description I can of the different Forts that are erected for the defence of this Bay; the first you meet with coming in from Sea is a Battry of 22 Guns, seated in the bottom of a Sandy Bay which is on the South side of the Sugr Loafe, and can be designed for no other use than to hinder an Enemy from landing in that Vally from whence I suppose they may march up to the town, or round by the West side of the Sugar Loafe to attack the Forts that are on that side of the entrance into the Bay, the first of which is seated under the foot of the Sugar Loafe on a low isthmus which Joines the peninsula or point of the Bay with the land of the Sugar Loafe, it appears to be a square of Stone Work, without a ditch, with Bastions and furnished with cannon. A little within this Fort are 2 Battries of 5 or 6 Guns each, they are design'd to play upon Shipping but nithir these Batterys or the Fort are out of the reach of a Ships Cannon. Hard by these batteries stands Fort Lozio it is an erregular Hexagon built of Stone upon a small rock standing at the west entrance into the Bay and is surrounded on all sides by the sea. It is mounted with 14 or 15 Guns which are place'd so as to play upon Shipping going in and out of the harbour, there is only one way to go into it which is by steps leading up to a Sally port on the NW side. Opposite this is the Fort of Santo Cruz built upon a low rocky point that forms the East entrance of the Bay, it hath the appearence of a regular fortification of stone work built upon the Slope of the rock on which account there are in some places two tier of guns, it hath no ditch but on the land side where it is cut out of the rock, in every other part the sea washes up to its walls, it seems every where to be well mounted with cannon, except on the land side where none are wanting, because they could be of no use the land being so very high above it; Yet after all neither this Fort nor those on the opposite shoar ^do not appear to be of any great strength even againest shipping for which they are wholy designed being the key to this Bay. Ships They lay low and Ships may come so near as to have them intirely within the reach of their guns, but it would require five or Six sail of the Line to insure Success. Between two and three Miles within the entrance of the Bay, on the west side is the Isle Borghleone upon the East point of which is erected a Battery of Stone and Mounted with 17 pieces of Cannon, besides this on the highest
            
      

        
        part of the Island is a Battery of 6 Guns Mounted on an open platform. These Batterys are design'd to play upon Shipping in the Bay and seem not ill design'd for that purpose, yet they would be oblige'd to submit to the Attack of Shipping or that of a land force there being nothing to hinder the latter from landing on the Island behind the Batterys.
        Opposite to this Island on the low point on the south ^East side of the Bay is the Battery of St Domonica of 7 guns - a little without this Battery on the East side of the Bay is a small, but high Island close to the Shore on the top of which is the Church of Bonn Voyage, about half way down the clift below the Church is a Battery of 3 guns. Neither the one nor the other of these Batterys are of much consequence, they serve indeed to force Shipping coming into the Bay between two fires and hinder them from anchoring on that side untill they are silenced.
        The next Fortification is that on the Ilha dos Cobras, the East point and North side of which consists of a Rampart, Bastion and a Parapet faced with stone and mounted with cannon, but no ditch which is not much wanting as the Works are built on the edge of the riseing ground: an the other side next the Town hath no other in closure but a plain Wall without any Guns - It is said that the works on this Island are in bad repair on account of being so extensive that they would take more men to defend them than they could spare and placeing no dependencey in str their strength let them go to decay- the ground on which the Monistry of Benidictines Stands commands the works on the Island: Over the South end of the City Stands the Castle of St Sebastian, it is seated upon a hill and Commands the whole town and this is all I know of it, only that it is not counted a place of any great strength. For the defence of these Forts and the town the King of Portugal Maintains Seven Regments of Regular Troops, those I saw were well cloathed and in a good condition but this as I was told was not the case with the whole: besides these troops are three Regments of Militia two of Horse and one of foot, these consist of the of the principal inhabitants of the place Who serve without pay, Muster and Exercise in times nine months in the year on which account they rank with the regular Troops.
        The City of Rio de Janeiro is in the Lat. Of 22° 50' South and Longitude of 42°..15' West from Greenwich according to Observations made at Sea; It is seated on a plain close to the Shore on the west side of the Bay at the foot of several high Mountains, it is neither ill designed nor ill built, the Houses are mostly of Stone generally one and two Story high, with Balconys to the most of them, the Streets are of a convenient bredth and cross each other at right angles and the whole City may be about 3 Miles in compass. It is Governed by a Governor appointed by the King
            
      

        
        the present Governor is Don Anto Mendoza y Fartado who is no friend to the English; it likewise is the Residence of the Viceroy and Captain General of the States of Brasil, who is as absolute as any Monarch on Earth and the people to all appearence as much slaves. This City and adjacent parts about the Bay are said to contain one hundred thousand Souls, but not much above a twentieth part are Whites the rest are blacks and many of whom are free and seem to live in tolerable circumstances.
        The City of Rio de Janeiro is supply'd with water from two different parts of the adjacent Mountains [:] that which comes from the southward is conveyd across a deep Vally by an aqueduct which consists of a great number of arches placed in two rows one upon the other, from thence in pipes to a Fountain which stands in the middle of the square before the Viceroys Palace; at a nother part of the City is a Reservoir to which the water is convey'd much in the same manner; from these two places, but mostly from the former the inhabitants fetch all they want^where there is always a Centinal to keep order: and it [is] likewise here that the ships water: they land their Casks upon a smooth sandy beach about one hundred yards from the fountain, and upon application to the Viceroy they^you have a Centinal to look after them and to clear the way for to come at the fountain to fill your water - upon the whole Rio de Janeira is not a bad place for Ships to put in at that wants refreshments, not only because the Harbour is safe and commodious, but that Provisions and all manner of refreshments may be had in tollerable plenty; Bread and Flower are however Scarce and dear, being brought hither from Europe and are never the better for that passage: in lieu of these are to be had Yams and Casada - All sorts of grain tho it may be the Produce of this Country is dear: Fresh Beef / tho bad / is to be had in plenty, at about 2½ a pound and Jerke'd Beef about the same price. This is cure'd with salt and dry'd in the shade, the bones being first taken, out and the meat cut into large but very thing slices, it eats very well and if kept in a dry place will remain good a long time at sea. Rum, Sugar and Mollasses are both all good and Cheap, Tobacco is cheap, but not good. Mutton they have very little; Hoggs and all sorts of Poultry are to be got tho in no great p[l]enty and of Course rather dear- Garden stuff and Fruits in plenty, but none that will keep long at Sea except Pumpkings- They have a yard for building Shipping and a small Hulk to heave down by, there being no other Method to come at a Ships bottom as the Tides doth not rise above 6 or 7 feet at the New and full Moon- and it is high water at that time about [ ] oClock when the land and Sea breezes are regular, but when they are not the course of ^the tides are alter'd. The Sea breeze begins to blow about 10 or 12 oClock and continues untill sun set when it dies away and is succeeded by the land breeze which continues most part of the night. From a little after Sunrise untill the Sea breeze sets in, it is generally ca^lm and is then the hotist and disagreeablest part of the whole day 
            
      

        Description of Parts of the Coast of Terra del Fuego
        We fell in with this Coast 21 Leagues to the Westward    of Strait Le Maire and rainged the Coast from thence ^to the Strait Within two or three Leagues of    the Land, and had soundings all the way from 40 to 20 fathom a gravelly and    sandy bottom; the land near the Shore is in general low, but hilly, the face    of the Country appear'd green and Woody, but in land are ^craggy Mountains.   they appeared to    be of no very great height, neither nor    were they cover'd with Snow.  The most remarkable land on Terra del Fuego is    a high mountain in form of a Sugar Loaf, situated not far from the Sea on the    S.W. side of the land, and three hills call'd    the three Brothers, they lay near the shore and [9] Miles to the   Westward of Cape St Diego ^which is a low point that formsor    the NW entrance of Strait
            
      

        
        Le Maire and are    contigueous to each other, the Sugar Loaf lies from these Hills SSW    and when it was in this situation the appearences of the land is represented    in the first View in the Chart, but it must be Observd    that from this Point of View the three brothers appear far more conspicuous    than from any other: These land marks are by some Voyagers thought very necessary    to Know Strait Le Maire by, but whoever coasts Terra Del Fuego with sight of    land cannot possibly miss the Strait, it being of it self so very conspicuous,    and Staten Land, which forms the East side is still more so from its very rugged    appearences.   one League and a half to the westward of Cape St    Diego lies Cape St Vincent, between these two    Capes lies Vincents Bay, a small cove wherein is Wood and water and before which    a Ship might Anchor with a southerly or S.W.    wind, but the ground is none of the best unless you go into the very mouth of    the Cove which is on the East side of the first Bluff point from Cape St    Vencent, where there is anchorage in 4 to    fathom a sandy bottom,   in going in keep clear of the Sea weed and    first send a Boat a head to Sound.    at best this is but a bad    place for Shipping and only recommended, to such as are in want of Wood and    water, and have no oppertunity to put into the Strait, which in prudence ought    not to be attempted but with a fair wind or moderate weather, and upon the very    first of the Tide of Flood which happens here at the full and Change of the    Moon about 1 or 2 oClock, and then to keep as near to Terra Del Fuego Shore    as the winds will permit: by useing these precautions you will be sure of either    geting quite through the Strait in one Tide or to the Southward of Success Bay       and it may be more prudent to put in there, should the wind    be southerly than to attempt to weather Staten land with a Lee wind and Current;    for I believe this to be the Cheif reason why Ships have run a risk of being    drove on that Island.
        Strait Le Maire is forme'd on the West by part of Terra    Del Fuego and on the East by the West end of Staten land or Island, its Length    and breadth and Length is about 5 Leagues    each; about the middle of the Strait is Success Bay on Terra Del Fuego side,    and about a ¼ of a League ^more    to the Northward is Port Maurice.   a little Cove before which we    anchor'd in 12 fmThe Bay of Success is discover'd immidiatly upon entering    the Strait
            
      

        
        from the Northward, there is likewise a good land Mark near the South    head to know it by whi this is a Mark on    the land like a lane or broad road leading up from the sea into the country:    this Bay is ½ a League wid[e] at the entrance and lies in West 2½    Miles and hath good Anchorage in every part of it in 10, 8 and 7 fathom clear    ground, and affords plenty of exceeding good wood and water--   the    wood is of the Birch kind, but of a different quallity to that in England or    North America, here are likewise of the winter Bark tree and some few others,    Wild Sellery, some berries like Cranberries, but grow on bushes [check ref here].    Very few wild Fowle of any sort, and no fish, except shell fish such as Muscles,    Limpets &Ca and what we saw of the interior    parts of the Country is still more barren of the necessarys of life then the    Sea-- The few days we stayed here we had constant bad weather, the winds from    the S.W ^and WSW with  rain hail and snow; snow generally fell on the hills every where with these    winds when we had rain in the Bay or upon the sea Coast,   I observed    the same with respect to Staten land; but as it never frose it did not lay long.       yet it must render the Country cold and barren and unfit for cultivation —
        The Tides in Success Bay flowes at the full and change    of the Moon, about 4 or 5 oClock and riseth between 5 and 6 feet perpendicular,    but in the Strait it the flood runs two or    three hours longer.   and there the Ebb or S.W.    Southerly current runs near double the strength of the Flood or Northerly current—
        Staten Island lies nearest East and West and ^from what I could see and judge of it may be    about 12 Leagues in length and 5 in breadth, on the North side are the appearences    of Bays or Harbours and the land is not distatute of wood and Verdure, nor cover'd    with snow any more than Terra del Fuego —
        On the S.W. side    of the Cape of good Success / which forms the SW    entrances of Strait Le Maire and is known by some rocks off it / lies Valintines    Bay.   the entrance of which we only saw; from this Bay the land trends    to the WSW for 20 or 30 Leagues, in appears    high and Mountainous and forms several Bays and inlets; SW½S.    14 Leagues from the Cape of Good-Success, and 2 or 3 Leagues from the Shore    lies New Island,   it is 2 Leagues in length NE    and S.W.   the NE    end is terminated by a remarkable hillick--   S.W.    7 Leagues from New Island lies the Isle Evouts, and South a little westerly    from this Island lies Barnivelts, two small flat Island close to each other    they    are partly environed with rocks of different hieghts above water and lay SW.    24 Leagues from Strait La Maire. From Barnivelts Islands
            
      

        
        to the SE    point of Hermites of Hermites Islands is    SWBS. distant 3 Leags      these Islands lay S.E. and N.W.    and are pritty high, and will from most points of View be taken for one Island,    or a part of the main-   From the S.E    point of Hermites Isles to Cape Horn the Course is SWBS.    diste 3 Leagues--   the appearence    of this Cape and Hermites Islands is represented in the last View in the Chart    which I have drawn of this Coast from our first making the land unto Cape Horn    in which is included Strait Le Maire and part of Staten land. In this Chart    I have laid down no land nor figure'd out any shore but what I saw my self.      and thus far the Chart may be depented upon.   the Bay and inlets    are left void the openings of which we only see from the Ship        it cannot be doubted but what there is Anchorage ^Wood and water in those ^bays and it must have been in some of them that    the Dutch Squadron Commanded by Hermite put into in the year 1624, It was the    Vice Admiral Chapenham of this Squadron, who first discover'd that the land    of Cape Horn was composed ^consisted of a number of Islands, but the Account    they have given of those parts is very short and imperfect and that of Schouton    and Le Maire still worse.   that it is no wonder that the Charts hitherto    published should be found incorrect, not only in laying down the land but in    the Latitude and Longitude of the places they contain; but I can now venter    to assert that the Longitude of few parts of the World are better assertain'd    then that of Strait Le Maire and Cape Horn be found    ^being determined    by several observations of the Sun and Moon, made both by my self and Mr    Green the Astronomer. —
        We found the Variation of the Compass on this Coast    to be from 23° to 25° East, except near Barnivelts Islands and Cape    Horn where we found it less and unsittled: it is likly that it is here disturbed    by the land as the Duch Squadron before mentioned found in this very place all    their Compasses to differ from
            
      

        
        each other: The declination of the South point    of the Dep^ing Needle when set up a Shore in    Success Bay was [check figure - 68° 15'] below the Horizon. Between Strait    Le Maire and Cape Horn we found a Current Seting generally pretty Strong to    the N.E. when we was in with the Shore but    when 15 or 20 Leagues off we was not sencable of any.
            
      

        Description of King Georges Island
        This Island is called by the Natives Otaheite and was first discover'd by Captain Wallice in His Majestys ship Dolphin on the 19th of June 1767. ^and to the credit of him and his officers the Longd of Royl Bay was by settled ^by them to within half a degree of the truth, and the whole figure of the Island not ill described     It is situated between the Latitudes of 17°..29' and 17°.. 53' South and between the Longitudes of 149..10 and 149..39 West from the Meridian of Greenwich. Point Venus, so called from the Observation being made there is the northern extremety of the Island and lies in the Longitude of 149°..30' being the mean result of a great number of observations made upon the spot. The Shores of this Island are mostly guarded from the Sea by reefs of Coral rocks and these form several excellent Bays and Harbours wherein are room and depth of water sufficient for the largest Ships. Royal Bay ^called by the natives Matavie in which we lay and the Dolphin before us is not inferior to any on the Island both in point of conveniency and situation; it may easily be known by a prodigious ^high mountain in the middle of
            
      

        
        the Island which bears due south from Point Venus which is the eastern point of the bay. To sail into it either keep the West point of the reef which lies before point Venus close on board, or give it a birth of near half a mile in order to avoide a small shoal of Coral Rocks whereon is but 2½ fathom water   the best anchoring is on the eastern side of the Bay in 16 or 14 fathom of water an owsey bottom; the shore of the bay is all a fine sandy beach behind which runs a river of fresh water so that any number of Ships might water here without discommodeing one another   the only wood for fual upon the whole Island is are fruit trees and these must be purchased of the natives if you mean to keep on good terms with them 
        There are some harbours to the westward of this bay that have not been mentioned but as they lay contiguous to it and are to be found in the plan a description of them is unnecessary 
        The land of this Island except what is emmediatly bordering upon the Sea Coast is of a very uneven surface and riseth in ridges which run up into the middle of the Island, and there form mountains that are of a height sufficient to be seen at the distance of 20 leagues. Between the foot of the ridges and the sea is a border of low land surrounding the whole Island, except in a few places where the ridges rise directly from the Sea, this low land is of various breadths but no where exceeds a mile and a half, the soil is rich and fertile being for the most part well stocked with fruit trees and small plantations and well water'd by a number of small rivulets of excellent water which come from the
            
      

        
        adjacent hills. It is upon this low land that the greatest part of the inhabitants live, not in towns or Villages but dispersed every where round the whole Island. The Tops of most of the ridges and mountains are barren and as it were burnt up with the sun.   yet many parts of some of them are not without their produce and many of the Vallies are fertile and inhabited 
        The produce of this Island is Bread fruit cocoa-nuts, Bonanoes, Plantains, a fruit like an apple, sweet Potatoes, yams, a fruit known by the name of Eag melloa and reckend most delicious, Sugar cane which the inhabitants eat raw, a root of the Salop kind call'd by the inhabitants Pea, the root also of a plant call'd Ethee and a fruit in a pod like a Kidney bean which when roasted eats like a chestnut and is call'd Ahee, the fruit of a tree which they call Wharra something like a Pine Apple, the fruit of a tree call'd by them Nano, the roots of a Fern and the roots of a Plant call'd Theve   all these articles the Earth almost spontaniously produces or at least they are rais'd with very little labour, in the article of food these people may almost be said to be exempt from the curse of our fore fathers  scarcely can it be said that they earn their bread with the sweat of their brow, benevolent nature hath not only supply'd them with necessarys but with abundance of superfluities.   the sea coast supplies them with vast variety of fish most excellent fish but these they get not without some trouble
            
      

        
        and perseverance.  fish seems to be one of their greatest luxuries and they eat it either raw or dress'd and seem to relish it one way as well as the other.   not only fish but almost every thing that comes out of the sea is eat and esteem'd by these people. Shell fish Lobsters Crabs and even Sea Insects and what is commonly call'd Blubbers of many kinds conduce to their support
        For tame Animals they have Hogs, Fowls and Dogs the latter of which we learnd to eat from them and few were there of us but what allowe'd that a South Sea Dog was next to an English Lamb, one thing in their favour is that they live intirely upon Vegetables.   probably our Dogs would not eat half so well.   Little can be said in favour of their fowles but their Pork is most excellent. They have no Beasts of prey of any sort and wild fowle are scarce and confind to a few specious   When any of the Chiefs kill a Hog it seems to be almost equally divided a mong all his dependands and as these are generaly very numerous it is but a little that comes to each persons share so that their chief food is Vegetables and of these they eat a large quantity    Cookery seems to have been but little studied.   here they have only two methods of applying fire  broiling and Baking as we call'd it.   the method this is done I have before described and I am of opinion that Victuals dress'd this way are more juicy and more equally done than by any of our methods, large fish in particular   Bread fruit, Bananoes and Plantains dcook'd this way eats like boild Potatoes and was used by us by way of bread when ever we could get them.   of bread fruit they make two or three dishes by beating it with a stone pestil till it makes a paste mixing water or cocoa nut liquor ^or both with it and adding ripe plantains bananoes ^Sour paste &Cathe paste made of the bread fruit alone
            
      

        
        they were on our first arrival for by this time full half the Ships Compny ^of themhad got the Venereal disease in which situation I thought they would be ill able to stand the cold weather we might expect to meet with to the southward at this Season of the year, and therefore I resolved to give them a little time to recover themselves while we run down to and exploar'd the Islands before mentioned.
        Mahuare
        [At some point after his arrival at Cape Town, Cook added  the following:]
         
        Upon our arrival at Batavia we were informd the two French Ships a Frigate ^and a store Ship commanded by the Sieur de Bougainville touch'd at that place ^two years ago in their way home from the South Seas. two years ago. We were here told many circumstances of these two Ships all tending to prove behond ^a doubt that they were the same 2 ships that as were at Georges Island ^some months before us which we then Judged were ^to be Spaniards, being lead into
            
      

        
        this mistake by the Spanish Iron &Ca we saw among the Natives, which is easy accounted for, for we are told that while Bougainville in the Frigate was delivering up that part of Faulkland Islands poses'd by the French, to the Spaniards ^which service we were told he was sent upon the Store Ship ^was trading with the Spaniards in the River Plate where it is very probable she disposed of all her European goods and purchas'd other to trade with the Islands in the South Seas - What To confirm these last circumstances we were told that when they arrived at Batavia the Frigate had on board ^a great quantity of Spanish Dollars  I think we were told also that they had been trading upon ^the Spanish M[a]in in the South Seas. Some days after our Arrival at the Cape of Good Hope I was told by some French officers that were just come from the Island Mauritius that Orette the Native of Georges Island which Sieur Bougainville brought away with him was now at the Maritius and that the French were fitting out a ship at ^that Island in order to carry him to his Native country and where they / the French / intend to make a settlement, a hundred Troops for that purpose were to got  out in the same ship    this account is confirm'd by a French Gentleman &Ca
            
      

        
        This Note to follow the discriptions of Ulietea &Ca     Tupia informs us that in the Months of November, December and Janry they have constant Westerly winds with rain  and they know very will how to take the Advantage of these winds in their Navigations 
        Note. As we advance'd to the south ward into cold weather and a troubled sea, the Hogs we got at Ulietea began to die apace    they cannot indure the least cold nor will they hardly eat any thing but Vegetables so that they are not att all to be depended upon at Sea 
            
      

        Description of the Islands Ulietea, Otaha and Bolabola
        So   call'd by the Natives and it was not thought adviseable to give them any other   names but these three together with Huaheine, Tubai, and Maurua as they lay   contiguous to one a nother I have named Society Isles. They are situated between   the Latitude of 16°.10' and 16°.55' South and between the Longitude   15 0° 0' and 151°..42' West from the   Meridian of Greenwich. Ulietea and Otaha lay close to each other and are both   inclosed within a reef of Coral rocks, and altho the  passage    distance between the one and the other  ^is   near 2 Miles yet there is no passage  between   for Shipping, By means of this reef are form'd several excellent Harbours, the   entrances into them are but narrow but when a ship is once in nothing can hurt   her; those on the East side have been already discribed. On the West side of   Ulietea  ^which is the   largest Island of the two are three, the northermost of which / call'd   Ora ^otanue we   lay in, the Channoll leading in  ^is   a ¼ of a Mile wide and lies between 2 low sandy Islands,  and    which are the northermost small Islands on this   side   You have good anchorage between or just within the 2 Islands   in 28 fathom, soft ground, this harbour tho' but small yet it is prefferable   to any on the Island on account of the easy geting of fresh water and being
            
      

        
        seated in the most fertile part of the Island. The other two harbours lay to   the southward of this and not far from the south end of the Island, in both   of them are good Anchorage in 10.12 & 14 fathom water; they are readily known   by 3 small woody Islands that lay at their entrance. The southermost Harbour   lies within and to the southward of the southermost Island, and the other lies   between the two northermost. There are more harbours at the south end of this   Island as I am inform'd but these were not examind by us 
        Otaha affords two very good Harbours, the one on the   east and the other on the west side, that on the East side call'd Ohamene hath   been already mentioned.   the other is called Oherurua, and lies about   the Middle of the  SW side of the Island,   it is pretty large and affords good anchorage in 20 and 25 fathom water, and   there is no want of fresh water. The breach in the reef which  admits   of  forms a Channell into this harbour   is ¼ of a Mile broad, steep too on both sides and the same may be said   of all the others, and in general there is no danger but what is Visible 
        The Island of Bolabola lies  NWBW   from Otaha distant 4 Leagues, it is incompass'd by
            
      

        
        a Reef of rocks and several   small Islands and the circuit of the whole appear'd to be about 8 Leagues: on   the  SW side of the Islands / as I am inform'd   / is an opening in the reef which admits of a Channoll into a very good harbour     This Island is very remarkable on account of a high craggy hill   upon it, which terminates at top in two peeks the one higher than the other,   this Hill is so perpendicular that it appears to be quite inaccessible. The   land on Ulietea and Otaha is of a very hilly, broken and uneven surface  ^except   what borders upon the Sea Coast - and high withall, yet the Hills look   green and pleasent and are in many places Cloath'd with woods 
        The produce of these Islands  ^and   manners and customs of the natives are much the same as  ^at   King Georges Island, only as the Bread fruit Tree is here in not such plenty     the Natives to supply that deficience, plant and cultivate a greater   quantity of Plantains and Yam ^ms   of several sorts and these they have in the greatest perfection.
        Their manners and customs   appear to be nearly the same they  ^The   inhabitants are rather of a fairer  complexion   Colour than the generallity of the natives of Georges Island, but more  particularly    especialy the Women who are much fairer and handsomer   and the men are not so much addicked to theiving and are more open and free   in their beheavour 
        The only difference we could see in their Religion was   in the Houses of thier Gods which were very different to those we saw on Georges   Island.   those here were made about the size and
            
      

        
        shape of a Coffin   oppen at one end, they are laid upon a number of small wooden Arches which are   framed and fasten'd together  ^like   the roof of a house and these are generally supported about 3 or 4 feet   above the ground by posts; over the box is a small roof or shade made of Palmeto   thatch   in this Box are deposited the oblations of the Gods such   as peices of Cloth, Human Bones &C a and these   places they hold sacred and some are place'd in their Maries.   and   some not. They have a Custom in preserving the Sculls and  ^under   jaw-bones of the dead but whether of their friends or enimies I can not pretend   to say; several of the sculls we observed were broke, and its very probable   that the owners of thim had been killd in battle as some of their weapons are   well calculated for breaking of heads, and from what we could learn it is a   custom with them to cut out the lower jaw of their enemies, but I believe not   before they are kill'd.   and these they keep as trophies and are   sometimes hung up in their Houses 
        The Cheif or King of Bolabola hath of late years usurped   the Sovereignty of the other two, and the
            
      

        
        Bolabola men at this time posess great   part of the lands on Ulietea and Otaha that they have taken from the natives     The Lands adjoining to the Harbour of Oraotanue belonged to T obiaupia   the Person we have on board who is a native of Ulietea. This people are very   ingenious in building their Proes or Canoes and seem to take as much care of   them having large shades or houses to put them in built for the purpose and   in these houses they likewise build and repair them and in this  ^they   shew a great deal of ingenuity, far more than one could expect: they are built   full bellied and after the very same  moddl   model as those Six we saw on Georges Island  and   which I have already described,  ^and   some of them are full as largeand   it is more than probable that these six Proes were built at some of these Islands.   In these Proes  or Canoes,  or   Pahee's as the[y] call them from all the accounts we can learn, these   people sail in those seas from Island to Island for several hundred Leagues,   the Sun serving them for a compass by day and the Moon and Stars by night. When   this comes to be prov'd /  which I have now not the   least doubt / we shall be no longer at a loss to know  ^how   the Islands lying in those Seas came to be people'd, for if the inhabitants   of Uleitea have been at Islands laying 2 or 300 Leagues to the westward of them   it cannot be doubted but that the inhabitants of those western Islands may have   been at others as far to westward of them, and so we may trace them from Island   to Island quite to the East Indias 
            
      

        Description of Queen Charlottes Sound
        Description of Queen Charlottes Sound 
        The ^entrence of this Sound is situated in the Latitude of 41° 0 South and in the Longitude 184°..45' West, and at the S.W. entrance of near the middle of the SW side of the Strait which separates the Land of            from that of before mentioned, The ^land of the SE head of the Sound call'd by the Natives Koamaroo / off which lies two small Islands and some rocks / makes the narrowest part of the Strait. There stretcheth out two miles NEBN from the NW head
            
      

        
        a reef of rocks a part of which is above water. This account of the two heads will be found sufficient guide to know this Sound, which is three Leagues b[r]oad at the entrence and lies ^inSWBS, SW and WSW at least 10 Leagues and is a Collection of some of the finest harbours in the world ^and this as will evidently appear from the Plan which was taken with all the accuracy that time and circumstance would admit The one ^harbour or Cove in which we lay call'd Ship Cove is not inferior to any in the Sound both in poi^nt of Securety and other conven conveniences; it lies on the west side of the Sound and ^is the southermost of the three coves lying within Motu-oura, which Island bears due East from it. You may sail into this Cove either between this last mentioned Island and the Isle Hamote or between Motu-oura and the West shore    in this ^last channell are two ledges of rocks 3 fathom under water but they may be known by the Sea weed which grows upon them. In sailing in or out of this Sound with little wind attention must be had to the Tides which flows 9 or 10 oClock at the full and change of the Moon and rises and falls upon a perpendicular 7 or 8 feet. The flood comes in through the Strait f^rom the SE and sets strong over upon the NW head and the reef laying off it, the Ebb sets with great rapidity to the SE over upon the Islands and rocks lying off the SE head. The Variation of the Compass we found from good observations to be 13°. 5' East. The land about this sound is of such height that
            
      

        
        we first saw it at the distance of 20 Leagues   it consists wholy of high hills and deep Vallies well stored with a variety of excellent Timber fit for all purposes excepting Ships Masts for which use it is too hard and heavy. The sea abounds with a variety of fish and in such plenty that without going out of the Cove where we lay, we caught daily what with the Saine and hook and line quite sufficient for all hands, and upon our first arrival we found plenty of shags and some few other wild fowls which to people in our situation was fresh food not to be dispised 
        The number of Inhabitants hardly exceeds 3 or 400 hundreds people, they leive desperse'd along the Shore in search of their daly bread which is fish and firn roots for they cultivate not no part of the lands. Upon the appearence of danger they retire to their Hippa's or strong holds for in this situation we found them and they remaind so for some days after. This people are poor when compared to many we have seen and their Canoes are mean and without orament, the little traffick we had with them was wholy for fish for we saw nothing ^little else they had
        t
            
      

        
        o dispose of,   they seem'd to have some knowlidge of Iron for they very readily took Nails in exchange for fish and some times prefer'd them to any thing else which was more than the people of any other place would do, they were at first fond of paper but when they found it spoild by being wet they would not take it, nor did they set much Value upon the cloth we got at Georges Island, but shew'd an extraordinary fondness for English broad Cloth and Red Kersey, which shew'd them to be a more sensible people than Ma[n]y of their Neighbours Besides the common dress some of these people wore on their heads ^round Caps made of birds feathers which were far from being unbecoming 
            
      

        General Description of New Zealand
        Before I quit this land altogether I shall give a short   and general discription of the Country, its Inhabitants their manners, Customs   &Ca in which it is necessary to observe   that many things are founded only on Conjetor for we were too short a time in   any one place to learn much of their interior policy and therefore could only   draw conclutions from what we saw at different times 
        Part of the East Coast of this Country was first discover'd   by Abel Tasman in 1642 and by him calld New Zeland    he however   never landed upon it probably he was discouraged from it by the natives killing   3 or 4 of his people at the first and only place he anchor'd at  This   country, which before now was thought to be a part of the imaginary Southern   Continent, co[n]sists of Two large Islands divided from each other by a strait   or passage of 4 or 5 Leagues broad, they are Situated between the Latitudes   of 34° and 48° So and between the Longitude   of 181° and 194° West from the Meridion of Greenwh   The situation of few parts of the world are better determined than these Islands   are being settled by a great number some   hundreds of Observations of the Sun and Moon and one of the transit of   Mercury made by Mr Green who was sent out by   the Royl Society to observe the Transit of   Venus 
        The Northermost of these Islands as I have before Observed   is call'd by the Natives Aehei no mouwe and the   Southermost Tovy Poenammu, the former name we   were well assurd comprehended the whole of the Northern Island.  but we   were not so well satisfied with the latter whether it comprehended the whole   of the Southern Island or only apart of it 
            
      

        
        This last according to the accounts of the Natives of   Queen Charlottes Sound ought to consist of two Ilds   one of which, at least we was were to have   saild round in a few days, but this was not verify [ed] by our own observations.   I am inclinable to think that they know'd no more of this land than what came   within the limets of their sight. The Chart which I have drawn will best point   out the figure and extent of these Islands, the situation of the Bays and harbours   they contain and the lesser Islands lay about them - and now I have mentioned   the Chart I shall point out such places as are drawn with sufficient accuracy   to be depended upon and such as are not begining at Cape   Pallisser and proceed round Aehei-no mouwe   by the East Cape &Ca the Coast between   these two Capes I believe to be laid down pretty accurate both in its figure   and the Course and distance from point ^to   point. the oppertunities I had and the methods I made use on to obtain   these requesites were such as could hardly admit of an error; from the East   Cape to Cape Maria Vandiemen altho it cannot be perfectly true yet it is without   any very material error, some few places however must be excepted and these   are very doubtfull and are not only here but in every other part of the chart   pointed out by a prick'd or broken line   from Cape Maria Vandiemen   up as high as the Latitude of 36°..15' we seldom was   were nearer the Shore than from 5 to 8 Leagues and therefore
            
      

        
        the line of the   Sea Coast may in some places be erroneous; from the above latitude to the   nearly the length of Entry Island we run along and near the shore all the way   and no circumstance occur'd that made me liable to commit any material error.   Excepting Cape Teera whitte we never came near the shore between Entry Island   and Cape Pallisser and therefore this part of the Coast will   may be found to differ something from the truth.   in short I believe that this Island will never be found to differ materialy   from the figure I have given it and that the coast affords few or no harbours   but what are either taken notice of in this Journal or in some measure point[ed]   out in the Chart.   but I cannot say so much for Tovy-poenammu     the Season of the year and circumstance of the Voyage would not   permit me to spend so much time about this Island as I had done about   ^at the other   and the blowing weather we frequently met with made it both dangerous and difficult   to keep upon the Coast. However I shall point out the places that may be erroneous   in this as I have done in the other. From Queen Charlottes Sound to Cape Campbel   and as far ^to the SW   as the Latitude 43° will be found to be pretty accurate     between   this Latitude and the Latitude 44°..20 the coast is very doubtfully discribed,   a part of which we hardly if attall saw     from this last   mentioned Latitude to Cape Saunders we were generally   at too great a distance to be particular and the weather at the same time was   unfavourable - the Coast as it is laid down from Cape Saunders to Cape South   and even to Cape West is no doubt in many places very erroneous as we hardly   ever were able to keep upon near   the coast shore and were some times blowen   off altogether     From the West   Cape down to Cape Fare-well and even to Queen Charlottes Sound will
            
      

        
        in most places to differ not much from the truth.
        Mention is likewise made in the Chart of the appearence   or Aspect of the face of the Country. With respect to Aehei   no mouweTovy poenammu   it is for the most part of avery Mountainous and to all appearence a barren   Country,  the people in Queen Charlottes Sound, those that came off to   us from under the Snowey Mountain and the fire we saw to the SW   of Cape Saunders were all the inhabitants or   signs of inhabitants we saw upon the whole Island. But most part of the Sea   Coast of Aeheino mouwe except the SW side   is well inhabited and altho it is a hilly mountainous Country yet the very hills   and mountains are many of them cover'd with wood and the ,^Soil   of the planes and Vallies appeared to be rich and fertile and such as   we had an oppertunity to examine we found to be so ^in   a high degree and not very much incumberd with woods    it   was the opinion of every body on board that all sorts of European grain fruits   Plants &Ca would thrive here. In short   was this Country settled by an Industrus people they would very soon be supply'd   not only with the necessarys but many of the luxuries of life. The Sea Bays   and Rivers abound with a great varity of excellent fish the most of them unknown   in England, besides Lobsters which were allow'd by every body to be the best   they ever had eat, Oy[s]ters and many other sorts of shell fish all excellent   in their kind - Sea and water fowles of all sorts are however in no great plenty,   those known in Europe are Ducks, Shags, Gannets & gulls all of which were   eat by us and found exceeding good    indeed hardly any thing   came amiss to us that could be eat by man. Land fowl are likewise in no great

        Description of New Holland
        In the Course of this Journal I have at different times made mention of the appearence or Aspect of the face of the Country, the nature of the Soil, its produce &Ca. By the first it will appear that to the Southward of 33° or 34° the Land in general is low and level with very few Hills or Mou^ntains, further to the northward it may in some places
            
      

        
        be called a Hilly, but hardly any where can be call'd a Mountainous Country, for the Hills and Mountains put together take up but a small part of the Surface in comparison to what the Planes and Vallies do ^which intersect or divide these Hills and Mountains:indeed these last , especially near the Sea, are I beleive very much interjected with Salt Creeks, Lakes &Ca It is indefferently well watered, even in the dry Seasons, with small Brooks and springs, but no great Rivers, unless it be in the wet Season when the low lands and Vallies near the Sea I do suppose are mostly laid under water; the small brooks may then become large Rivers but this can only happen with the Tropick. It was only in Thirsty Sound where we could find no fresh Water, excepting one small pool or two which Gore saw in the woods, which no doubt was owing to the Country being there very much intersected with Salt creeks and Mangrove land 
        The low land by the Sea ^and even as far in land as we were, is for the most part friable, loose, sandy Soil; yet indefferently fertile and cloathed with woods, long grass, shrubs, Plants &Ca. The Mountains or Hills are Checquered with woods and
            
      

        
        Lawns. Some of the Hills are wholy covered with ^flourishing Trees; others but thinly, especially to the northwardand the few that are on them are small and the spots of Lawns or Sav-annahs are Rocky and barren, especially to the northward where the country did not afford or produce near the Vegetation that it does to the southward, nor were the Trees in the woods half so tall and stout. 
        The woods do not produce any great variety of Trees, there are only 2 or 3 sorts that can be could^call'd Timber; the largest is the Gum Tree which growes all over the Country, the Wood of this Tree is too hard and ponderous for most common uses. The Tree which resembles our Pines, I saw no where in perfection but in Sting^Botany Bay Harbour, this wood as I have before observed is some thing of the same nature as America Live Oak; in short most of the large Trees in this Country are of a hard and ponderous nature and could not be applied to many purposes. Here are several sorts of the Palm kind, Mangroe and several other sorts of small Trees and shrubs quite unknown to me and wholy out of my way to describebesides a very great Variety of Plants hetherto unknown, but these
            
      

        
        things are wholy out of my way to describe, nor will this be of any loss sence not only Plants but everything that can be of use to the Learn'd World will be very accuratly described by Mr Banks and Dr Solander. The Land naturly produces hardly any thing fit for man to eat and the Natives know nothing of Cultivation. There are indeed growing ^wild in the wood a few sorts of fruits  / the most of them unknown to us /  which when ripe do not eat a miss, one sort especially, which we call'd Apples, being about the size of a Crab-Apple; it is black and pulpy when ripe and tastes like a Damson, it hath a large hard stone or kernel and grows on Trees or Shrubs
        In the Northern parts of the Country as about Endeavour River, and probably in many other places, the Boggy or watery Lands produce Ta^a or Cocos which when properly cultivated are very good roots, without which they are hardly eatable, the tops however make very good greens 
        Land Animals are scarce, as so far as we
            
      

        
        with a few observations on the Currents and Tides upon the Coast, because I have men-tioned in the Course of this Journal that the latter hath some times set one way and some times a nother, which I shall endeavour to account for in the best manner I can. From the Latitude ^of32° or ^abovebeforedown to Sandy Cape in the Latitude of 24°..46' we constantly found a Current seting to the Southward at the rate of 10 or 15 Miles per day more or less according to the distance we were from the land, for it runs stronger in shore than in the offing: all this time I had not been able to satisfy my self whether the Flood Tide came from the Southward Eastward or Northward but judged it to come from the S.E. But the first time we Anchor'd upon the Coast, which was in the Latitude of 24°..30' and about 10 Leagues to the SE of Bustard Bay, we found there the Flood to come from the NW. On the Contrary 30 Leagues further to the NW, on the South side of Keppel Bay we found the Flood to come from the East, and at the northern part of the said
            
      

        
        Bay we found it come from the Northward but with a much slower Motion than the Easterly Tide. Again on the East side of the Bay of Inlets we found the Flood to set Strong to the Westward as far as ^the opening of Broad sound  but on the North side of that Sound the Flood come with ^a slow motion from the NW, and when at Anchor before Repulse Bay we found the flood to Come from the Northward.  We need only admit the Flood Tide to come from the East or SE and then all these seeming contridections will be found to be conformable to reason and experience. It is well known that where there are deep Inlets, large Creeks &Ca, into low lands that it is not occasioned by Fresh water Rivers, there is a very great indraught of the Flood Tide, the direction of which will be determined according to the posision ^or direction of the Coasts which form's the entrance in to such Inlets, and this direction the Tide must follow let it be ever so contrary to their general Course out at Sea, and where the Tides are weak as they are in general upon this Coast, a Large Inlet will ^if I may so call it attract the Flood Tide, if I may say for many Leagues 
        Any one need only cast an Eye over the Chart to be made sencible of what I have advanced
            
      

        
        To the Northward of Whitsunday's Passage there there are few or no large inlets and consequently the Flood sets to the Northward or NW according to the Direction of the Coast, and Ebb the Contrary; but this is to be understood at a little distance from land or where there are no Creeks or Inlets,  for where such are be they ever so small they draw the Flood from the South-ward Eastward, and Northrd, as I found by experience while we lay in Endeavour River. Another thing I have Observe'd upon the Tides which ought to be remark'd, which is that there is only one high Tide in 24 hours and that is the Night Tide; or spring Tides the difference between the perpendicular Rise of the Night and Day Tides is not less than 3 feet which is a great deal where the Tides are so inconsiderable as they are here; this inequality of the Tides I did not observe till we run ashore, perhaps it is much more so to the Northward than to the southward -   After we had got within the Reefs the second time we found the Tides more considerable than at any time before except in the Bay of Inlets, it may be owing to the water being confin'd in Channells between the Shoals, here the Flood also sets to the NW, to the extremity of New Wales, from thence West and SW into the India Sea
            
      

        Description of New Guinea
        This place lies in the Latitude of 6°..15' St, about 65 Leagues to the N.E of Pt S. Augustino or Walsche Caep, and is near to what is call'd in the Charts ^by the long name ofC. de la Colta de Sa Bonaventura. The land is very low like every other part of the Coast we have seen, here it is thick and Luxuriously cloathed with Woods and Verdure all of which appear green and flourishing; here were Cocoa-nutt Trees, Bread fruit Trees and Plantain trees, but we saw no fruit but on the former and these were small and green; the other trees, shrubs, plants &Ca were ^like wise such as is common in the South-Sea Islands and in New-Holland. Upon my return to the Ship we hoisted in the boat and made sail to the Westward with a design to leave the Coast altogether to the no small satisfaction of I beleive the Major part of ye Ships 
            
      

        
        company^this however ^it was contrary to the inclination and opinion of some of the officers who would have had me send a party of men a shore to cut down the Cocoa-nutt Trees for the sake of the Nutts  a thing that I think no man leiving could have justified, for as the Natives had attack'd us for meer land^ing without takeing away any one thing, certainly they would have made a vigorous effort to have defended their property in which case many of them must have been kill'd and perhaps some of our own people too  and all this for 2 o[r] 300 green Cocoa-nutts which when we had got them would have done us little service ^besides nothing but the u[t]most necessity would have oblige'd me to have taken this Method to come at refreshments  its true I might have proceeded farther a long the Coast to the northward and westward untill we had found a place where the Ship could lay so near the shore as to cover the people with her guns when landed but it is very probable that before we had found such a place - we should have been carried so far to the West as to have been obliged to have gone to Batavi by the way of the Moluccas ^and on the North side of Java where we were all utter strangers    this I did not think was so Safe a Passage  as to go to the South of Java and
            
      

        
        through the Straights of Sunda - the way I propose to my self to go; besides as the ship is leaky we are not yet sure whether or no we shall not be obliged to heave her down at Batavi, in this case it be comes the more necessary that we should make the best of our way to that place, especially as no new discovery can be expected to be made in those seas which the Dutch have I beleive long ago narrowly examined, as appears from ^3 Maps bound up with the French History of Voyages to the Terra Australis, published in 1756, which Maps I do suppose by some means have been got from the Dutch as we find the names of many of the places are in that Language. It should likewise seem from the same Maps that the Spaniards and Dutch have at one time or a nother circumnavigated the whole of the Island of New Guinea as the most of the names are in these two Languages, and such part of the Coast as we have been ^were upon I fo^und the Chart tolerable good which obliges me to give some Credit to all the rest notwithstanding we neither know by whome or when they were taken, and I allways understood before I had a sight of these Maps that it was unknown whether or no New-Holland and New-Guinea was not one continued land, and so it is a said in the very History of Voyages these Maps are bou^ntd up in; however we have now put this wholy
            
      

        
        out of dispute but as I beleive it was known before tho' not publickly I clame no other merit than the clearing up of a doubtfull point. A nother doubtfull point I should liked to have clear'd up ^altho it is of very little if of any concequence which is whether or no the Natives of New-Holland and those of New-Guinea are or were original one People which one might well suppose as these two Countries lay so near to each other and the intermediate space fill'd up with Islands   on the other hand if these Two People have or ever had any ^friendly communication with each other it seems strange ^as I have before observed that they should not have transplanted from New-Guinea over to New Holland, Cocoa-nutts. Bread fruit, Plantains &Ca &Ca^all very usefull Articles for the support of man that we never saw grow in the latter and which we have now seen in the former   La Maire hath given us a Vocabulary of words spoke by the people of New-Brittain / which before Dampiers time was taken to be a part of New Guinea / by which it appears that the people of New-brittain speak a very different Language from those of New-Holland. Now should it be found that the Natives of New-Holland Britain and those of New Guiney have had one Origin and speake the same Language, it will follow of Course that the New-Hollanders are a different people from both 
            
      

        Description of Savu
        Before we proceed any farther it will be proper in this place to say [some] thing of the Island we have been last at, ^whi^ch ^is call'd by the Natives Savu it the Middle of it lies in ^about the Latde of 10°..35' St Longde 237°.30'Wt&C it ^may be about 8 Leagues in length from East to West, but of what breadth I know not because I only saw the north side. There are as I am told three bays where Ships can Anchor, the best is on the South West side of the SE point, the one we lay in call'd Seba  lies on the NW side of the Island   this bay is very well shelter'd from the SE Trade wind but lays wholy open to the NW - The Land of this Island which bounds the Sea is in general low, but in the Middle of the Island are Hills of a Moderate height and the whole is agreeably deversified with woods and Lawns which affords a most pleasing prospect from the sea. We were told that the Island is but indifferently water'd in the dry season, especially towards the latter end of it, at which time there is no runing stream upon the whole Island, only small springs which are all at a distance
            
      

        
        from the Sea side. The dry season commences in March or April and ends in November or the remaining 3 or 4 Months they have westerly winds with rain and this is the time that their crops of Rice, Callivances and Indian Corn are brought forth which are Articles that this Island produceth, they also breed a great number of Cattle such as / viz / Buffaloes, Horses, Hogs, Sheep and Goats,   Many of the former are sent to Concordia where they are Kill'd and salted in order to be sent to the More Northern Island[s] which are under the dominion of the Dutch - Sheep and Goats flesh is dried upon this Island, packe'd up in Bales and sent to Concordia for the same purpose. The Dutch Resident from whome we had these informations told ^us that the Dutch ^at Concordia had lately behav'd so ill to the Natives of Timor that they were obliged to have recourse to this Island and others adjacent for provisions for their own subsistance, and likewise Troops / Natives of this Island / to assist the Dutch againest those of Timor. Besides the above productions this Island here are an emmence Number of Palm Trees from which is extracted the Palm Wine, as it is call'd, avery sweet agreeable Cooling liquor, what they do not emmidiatly use they boil down and make Syrrup ^or Sugar of which they keep in earthen jarrs. Here are likewise Cocoa-nutts and Tamarind Trees, Limes &Ca but in no great plenty. Indico ^Cotton and Cinnamon sufficient to Serve the Natives, this
            
      

        
        last Article we were told the Dutch discourage the growth of The Island is divided into five Kingdoms which have lived in Peace and Amity with each other for these hundred years, At present the Whole Island is partly under the direction of the Dutch East India Company who have a Resident or Factor who constantly lives ^here without whose leave the Natives are not to supply any other Nation with any thing what ever, but the whole product of the Island besides what serves themselves is to be sold to the Company at their ^prefer'd own price ^to be paid for in for European or some other Foriegn Commidity's and not for ^in Gold or Silver. in a manner the property of the Company - The Company by way of a Tribute oblige them to raise and pay Annualy a certain quantity of Rice, Indian Corn and Callivances, for which the Company make each of the Kings a Yearly present of a Casks of Arrack and some other trifles, the live stock Sheep and Goats flesh ^&Ca they pay for in Goods. The small Island which lies about a League to the westward of this pays Annualy a certain quantity of Areaca Nutts which is allmost the only produce of that Island. The Island of Rotte is upon the same
            
      

        
        footing as this of Savu. Both these Islands and the Three Solors belong to the Goverment of Concordia   From what we could learn of the Island of Timor it seems to be much upon the same footing as it was in Dampiers time which is that the Dutch Posess little more of that Island than what lies under the command of the Fort Concordia; the Rest is in posession either of the Native Indians or the Portuguese. we were likewise told that the Island of Ende belongs to the Portuguese, that the principal settlement was is at Larentucka where there is a Fort and a good harbour. We were told that Concordia on the Island Timor is a free Port for Ships of any Nation to touch at where they would not only be supplied with refreshments but Naval stores also,   Tradeing Ships might probably meet with a good reception, but Kings Ships I am perswaided would be look'd upon as spys   for my own part was I only in want of refreshments and obliged to touch at any of these Islands I should prefer going to a Portuguese settlement, before any of the Dutch and when I was solicited by the officers to call at Timor I propose'd going to one of the Portuguese settlements but ^this Mr Hicks made some objections to which was sufficient for me to lay it aside as I had not the least inclination to touch any where till we arrived at Batavia, for my falling in with Savu was mere
            
      

        
        they seldom end so long as the giver has got any thing left alive upon his Estate. They are said to be a people of good morals, Virtuous and Chaste, each man having only one wife which he keeps for life    Fornication and Adultery is hardly known among them. When a great Man Marries he makes presents to all his wifes Relations of European and other foreign commodities to the Value of 100 Rix-Dollars    this custom the Dutch East India Company find it their intrest to incourage. They speake a Language peculiar to themselves into which the Dutch have caused the Bible and New-Testament to be Translated and have interduced them it with the use of letters and writing among them; by this means several hundreds of them have been converted to Christianity, the rest are either ^some Heathens or ^and others of no Religion attall, and yet they all Stick up to the strick'd rules of Morality. They all both men and women Young and old Chew of the Beetle Leaf, Araeca Nutts, and a sort of white lime which I beleive is made from Coral ^Stone this has such an effect upon the teeth that very few even of the young people have hardly any left in their heads and those they have are as black as Ink; their houses are built on post[s] about 4 feet from the Ground, we ask'd the reason why they built them so, and was told that it was only custom, they are however certainly
            
      

        
        the Cooler for it.   they ^are thatched with Palm leaves and the Floor and sides are boarded 
        The Man who resides here ^upon this Island in behalf of the Dutch East India Company is a German by birth   his name is ^Johan Christopher Lange it is hard to say upon what footing he is here, he is so far a Governor that the Natives dar[e] do nothing openly without his consent, and yet he can transact no sort of business with Foreigner's either in his own or that of the Companys name ^nor can it be a place of either honour or profit, he is the only white man upon the Island and has resided there ever sence it hath been under the direction of the Dutch which is about 10 years He is allowd 50 Slaves / Natives of the Island / to attend upon him, these ^belong to and are Mentain''d by the Company. He goes the circuit of the Island once in two Months, but on what account he did not tell us; when he makes these rounds he carries with him a certain quantity of spiret to treat the great men with, which he says he is obliged to look well after otherwise the[y] would steal it and get Drunk and yet at a nother time he told us that he never know'd a theft commited in the Island, but some of the Natives themselves contridicted him in this by stealing from us an Ax,   however from their behavour
            
      

        
        to us in general I am of opinion that they are but seldom guilty of these crimes. His going round the Island once in Two Months is most likly to see that the Natives make the necessary preparations for fullfilling their engagements with the Dutch and to see that the Large boats or small Vessels are taken proper care of which the Dutch keep in all the Bays of this Island in order to collect and carry the Grain &Ca to the Ship which comes Anualy here, they are likewise employ'd in carrying Catle grain &C to Timor and when not wanted they are hauld ashore into Houses or Shads built on purpose. As I have mentioned Slaves it is necessary to Observe that ^all also all the great Men have slaves which are the Natives of the Island, they can dispose of them one to a nother but cannot sell them ^to go out of the Island, the price of a Slave is a good large fatt Hogg. Horse &Ca - I have before mentioned that many of the people can speake Portuguese, but hardly any one Dutch    from this it is probable that this Island was formerly under the Jurisdiction of the Portuguese tho the Dutch Governor never own'd as much but said that the Dutch had Traded here these hundred years past 
            
      

        Description of Batavia
        Batavia is a place that hath been so often Viseted by Europeans and so many Accounts of it extant, that any description I could give would seem unnecessary: besides I have neither abillities nor Materials ^Sufficient for such an undertakeing for whoever gives a faithfull account of this place must in many things contridect all the Authors I have had an oppertunity to consult, but this task I shall leave to some abler hand and only take notice of such things as seems to me necessary for seamen to know. The City of Batavia is situated on a low flat near the Sea in the bottom of a large Bay of the same name, which lies on the North side of Java about 8 Leagues from the Straights of Sunday -   it lies in 6°..10’ South Latitude and 106°..50’ East Longitude from the Meridian of Greenwich, settled by Astronomical observations made on the spot by the Reverend MrMohr, who has built a very Elegant Observatory which is as well
            
      

        
        well furnished with Instruments as most in Europe. Most of the Streets in the City have canals of Water runing th[r]ough them which unite into one Stream about half a Mile before they employ^ discharge them selves into the [Sea], this is about 100 feet broad and is built far enough out into the Sea to have at its entrance a sufficient depth of water to admit small craft, Luggage boats &ca: The communication between the Sea and the City, is by this canal alone, and this only in the day for it is shut up every night by a boom, through which no boats can pass from about 6 o Clock in the evening to between 5 and 6 the next Morning. Here stands the custom house where all goods either impord or exported pay the customary Duties, at least an account is here taken of them and nothing can pass without a permit weather it pays duty or no 
        All kinds of Refreshments, Naval Stores and Sea Provisions are to be had here but there are few Arti[c]les but what bears a very high price, especially if you are obliged totake them of the Company which you are Obliged to do if you want any quantity, for none but themthat is of such Articles as they monopily to themselves
            
      

        
        which are all manner of Naval Stores and salted Provisions 
        The Road of Batavia or place where Shipping Anchor lies right before the City and is so large as to contain any number of Shipping. You Anchor with the Dome of the Great Church bearing about south in 7, 6 or 5 fm water about 1½ or 2 Miles from shore, and nearer you cannot come with large ships by reason of a Mud bank which lines all the Shore of the Bay. the ground you anchor in is of such a Nature that the Anchors buries themselves so deep that it is with difficult[y] they are got out, for this reason Ships always [lays] at Single Anchor being in no manner of danger of fouling them   You lay apparantly open to the Winds from the NW to the ENE, but the Sea that is caused by these winds is a good deal broke before it reaches the Road by the small Islands & Shoals without: these shoals have all of them either Buoys or Beacons upon, but if these guides should be Move’d there is a very good Chart of this Bay and the Coast of Java as far as the Straeghts of Sunday bound up in the English East India Pilot sold by Mount & Page
            
      

        
        in this Chart every thing seems to be Very accurately delineated 
        Fresh Water and wood for fuel must be purchas’d here, the water is put on board the Ships in the Road at the ratea Spanish Dollar or 5 Shillings a Leager containg 150 Gallons but if sent to Onrust, which is one league from the Road, it cost a Duckatoon or Six Shillings & Eight pence. The supplying Shipping with water, especially Foreigners is a perquisite of the Commodore who is always an officer in the states service, but acts here under the Company. He takes care to tell you that the water is very good and will keep sweet at Sea whereas every boddy else tells you that it is not so, be this as it will Batavia is certainly a place that Europeans need not covet to go to, but if necessity obliges them they will do well to make their stay as short a[s] possible otherwise they will soon feel the effects of thate unwholsome air of Batavia which I firmly beleive is the death of more Europeans than any other place upon the Globe of the same extent, such at least is my opinion of it which is founded on facts. We came in here with as healthy a ships company as need [go] to Sea and after a stay of not quite 3 Months lift it in the condition of an Hospital Ship besides the loss of 7 Men and yet  all the Dutch Captains I had an oppertunity to convers with said that we had been very lucky and wondered that we had not lost half our people in that time
            
      

        Description of the Cape of Good Hope
        The Cape of Good Hope hath been so often discrib’d by Authors and is so well known to Europeans that any discriptions I can give of it may appear unnecessary. However I cannot help observing that most Authors, particularly the Author of MrByrons Voyage, have heighten’d the picture to a very great degree above what it will bear, so that a stranger is at once struck with surprise and disapointment, for no Country we have seen this Voyage affords so barren a prospect as this, and not only so in appearence but in reallity. The land over the Cape which constitutes the Peninsula form’d by Table Bay on the north and False Bay on the South consists of high barren Mountains, behind these to the East or what may be call’d the Isthmus is a vast extensive Plain, not one thousand part of which either is or can be cultivated. The soil consists mostly of a light kind of Sea Sand and produceth produceing hardly any thing but heath, every Inch of ground that will bear cultivation is
            
      

        
        taken up in small Plantation consisting ^of Vineyards, Orchards, Kitchen Gardens &Ca, hardly any two lay together, but are despers’d at some distance one from another. If we may Judge from circumstances the Interior parts of this Country is not more fertile, that is the fertile land bears a very small proportion to the whole; we were told that they have settlements 28 days Journey inland which is computed at 900 English Miles, and thus far they bring provisions to the Cape ^by land Carriage  it is also said that the Dutch farmers are so despers’d about the Country that some have no neighbours with^in four or five days Journey of them; admiting these to be facts and it will at once appear that the Country in general cannot be very fertile, for it would be absurd to suppose that they would raise provisions at such an emence distance, where the trouble and expence of bringing them to market must increase in proportion, could it be done nearer    The Dutch assign another reason for being oblige’d to extend their scater’d settlements so far inland, which is that they never disturb the original Natives but always leave them in peaceable posession of whatever lands they may have approbated to their own use, which in some places is pretty extensive and that probably none of the worst, by which good policy the new settlers very seldom if ever meet with any disturbance from the natives; on the Contraory many of them become their servants and mix among them and are usefull members to Society. Notwithstanding
            
      

        
        Notwithstanding the many disadvantages this Country labours under such is the Industry,  Oconomy and good management of the Dutch that not only the necessarys but all the luxuries of life are rais’d here in as great abundance, and ^are sold as cheape if not cheaper then in any part of Europe some few articles excepted. Naval Stores however do not want form Price any more here than they do at Batavia, these are only sold by the Company who have a certain fix’d exorbitant price from which the[y] never deviate
        The Inhabitants of the Cape Town are in general well bred and extremely civile and polite to all strangers, indeed it is their Intrest so to do for the whole Town may be consider’d as one great Inn fited up for the reception of all comers and goers - Upon the whole there is perhaps not a place in the known World that can equal this in affording refreshments of all kinds to Shipping -  The Bay is Capacious, pretty safe and commodious, it lies open to the NW winds, which winds we are told very Seldom blow strong, but some times sends in a great sea for which reason Ships moor NE and SW and in such a manner as to have an open hawse with NW winds; the SE winds blows frequently with great Volience but as this is right out of the Bay it is attended with no danger. Near the Town is a Warfe built of Wood run out a proper distance into the Sea for the conveniency of
            
      

        
        of landing and Shipping off goods, to this warfe water is convey’d in pipes and by means of Cocks several boats may fill water at one and the same time; the company keep several large strong Boats or Hoys, to carry goods, Provisions, Water &Ca to and from Shipping as well strangers as their own. Fuel is one of the scarcest articles they have and is brought a long way out of the Country and consi[s]ts of Roots of Trees Shrubs &Ca:  ^ except a few English Oaks which they have plantedIndeed this Country is wholy distitute of Wood, except at too great a distance to be brought to the Cape. In the Article of Timber Boa^rds &Ca they are chiefly supply[’d] from Batavia   Three of the Winter Months (viz) from the Middle of May to the Middle of August the Dutch obliged all their ships to godo not allow any of their Ships to lay in Table Bay, but oblige them to go into false Bay where there is a very safe harbour, and every other conveniency both for their own shipping and strangers and where every produce of the Country can be had as cheape as at the Cape Town. The Dutch I am told never diveate from this custom of sending their Ships to False Bay at this season of the Year, notwithstand[ing] there has not a gale of wind happen’d for many Years that would have put them in the least danger in Table Bay.
        Table Bay is defended by a Square ^Fort situated on the East side of the Town close to the Sea beach
            
      

        
        together with several other out works and Battries along the Shore of the Bay on each side of the Town; they are so situated as to be Cannonaded by Shipping and are in a manner defenceless againest a Superior land force. The Garrison at present consists of 800 Regulars besides the Militia of the Country which comprehends every man able to bear arms 
        They can, by means of Signals, alarm the whole country in a very short time and then every man is emmidiately to repair to the Cape Town, The French at Mauritius are supply’d with large quantitys of Provisions from the Cape / viz /  Salted Beef, Biscuit, Flour and wine; while we lay in the Bay two store Ships belonging to the King of the burthen of 50 or 60 Gun Ships and a snow, sail’d for that Island Load with Provisions besides a ^Large Kings Frigate we left in the Bay takeing in her Cargo. The Provisions contracted for by the French this year were Salt Beef 500,000 lbs: Flour 400,000 lbs: Biscuit 400,000 lbs: and Wine 1200 Leagers
