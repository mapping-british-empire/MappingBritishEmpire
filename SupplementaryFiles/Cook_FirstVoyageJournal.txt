Yet we cannot have had this current long because the Longitude   by account and by that by Observation agree to-day but yesterday   she was 28' to the westward of the Observation.

We also try'd the Deping Needle belonging to   the Royal Society and found the North point to dep 26° below the Horizon, but   this instrument cannot be used at sea to a very   any great degree   of accuracy on account of the motion of the Ship which hindors the Needle from   resting. however as the Ship was pretty steady and by means of a swinging table   I had made for that purpose we could be certain of the dep to two degrees at   most. the observed Lat.d and that by account   nearly agrees.

This day  at Noon being nearly in the Lat.d of the Island  Ferdinand Noronha to the Westward of it by some charts and to the Eastward by  others, was in expectation of seeing it or some of those shoals that are laid  down in most charts between it and the main, but we saw neither one nor a nother.  We certainly pass'd to the Eastward of the Island, and as to the shoals I don't  think they exhist grounding this my opinion on the Journal of some East India  Ships I have seen, who was were detaind by  contrary winds between this Island and the main and being 5 or six Ships in  Compney, doubtless must have seen some  of them did they lay as marked in the charts.

To the Northward of the Island and between it and the Main there appears to lay several smaller Islands near each other. The main land on the Sea Coast appears to be low, but inland are high Mountains. Drawing N 4 exhibites a View of this Island when it bore WNW distant 4 Leagues.

        Monday, 14th Moderate Sea and Land breezes and fine plasent weather. At 5 PM anchor'd in 5 fathom water just above the Isle of Cobras which lies before the City of Rio de Janeiro: a little before we anchor'd the Pinnace return'd and inform'd me that the Viceroy had thought proper to detain the Officer untill I went a shore - soon after we anchor'd a boat came on board bringing several of the Viceroy's officers who asked ma[n]y questions in respect to the Ship, from whence She came, Cargo, number of men Guns &Ca. all of which was answerd to their satisfaction - they told me it was the custom of the Port to detain the first officer that came from any ship on her first Arrival until a Boat from the Viceroy had visited her, that my officer would be sent on board as soon as they got a shore, which was accordingly done. About this time a Boat fill'd with soldiers kept rowing about the Ship, which had orders, as I afterwards understood, not to suffer any one of the Officers or Gentlemen except my self, to go out of the Ship. In the Morning I waited upon the Viceroy and obtain'd leave to purchase Provisions, Refreshments, &ca for the Ship, but obliged me to employ a person to buy them for me, under a pretence that it was the custom of the place, and he likewise insisted / notwithstanding all I could say to the contrary / on puting a Soldier into the Boats that brought anything to or from Ship, aledging that it was the Orders of his Court and they were such an as he could not despence with, and this indignity I was obliged to submit to other wise I could not have got the supply I wanted, and being willing as much as in me lay to avoid all manner of disputes that might cause the least delay, and at the same time to convince him that we did not come here to trade as I believe he imagined for he certainly did not believe a word about our being bound to the South ward to observe the transit of Venus but look'd upon it only as an invented story to cover some other design we must be upon, for he could form no other Idea of that Phanomenon / after I had explained it to him / then the North Star Passing thro. the South Pole (these were his own words.) He would not permit the Gentlemen to reside a shore during our stay here, not permit Mr Banks to go into the Country to gather plants, &ca but not the least hint was given me at this time that no one of the Gentlemen was to come out of the Ship but myself, or that I was to be put under a Guard when I did come; but this I was soon convinced of after I took my leave of His Excellency and found that an Officer was to attend upon me where ever I went, which at first the Viceroy pretended was only meant as a compliment, and to order me all the Assistance I wanted. This day the people were employ'd in unbending the Sails, in fiting and rigging the spare topmasts in the room of the others, and getting on Shore empty water casks.

For these three days past I have remonstrated to the Viceroy and his officers againest his putting a guard into my Boat, thinking I could not answer it to the Admiralty the tamely submitting to such a custom which, when practised in its full force must bring disgrace to the Brittish Flag, on the other hand I was very loath to enter into disputes seeing how much I was like to be delay'd and imbarrassed in geting the supplys I wanted, for it was with much difficulty that I obtain'd leave for one of my people to attend the Market to buy necessaries for my Table and to Assist the Agent to buy the things for the Ship; having gain'd this point and settled every thing with the Agent in regard to what was wanting for the Ship: I resolved rather than be made a prisoner in my own Boat not to go any more a shore unless I could do it without having a Soldier put into the Boat, as had hitherto been done, and thinking that the Vice roy might lay under some Mistake which on proper Application might be cleared up: I therefore drew up a Memorial, stating the whole case and sent to the Viceroy this afternoon, and thus a paper war commence'd between me and his Excellency, wherein I had no other advantage than the racking his invention to find reasons for treating us in the manner he did, for he never would relax the least from any one point.
            
      

        18 November 1768
        Friday, 18th This day I received an Answer to my Memorial wherein he tells me amongst other things that if I think it hard submitting to the Customs of this Port I may leave it when I please, but this was what did not suit my purpose at present, but I resolved to may make my stay as short as possible. I must own that this Memorial of the Viceroys was well drawn up and very much to the purpose, which is more than I can say of any of the Subsequent ones.
            
      

        19 November 1768

        20 November 1768
        Sunday, 20th First part close clowdy weather, the Middle a very hard Storm of wind and rain, the latter Moderate with rain. This afternoon sent Lieutenant Hicks in the Pinnace with an Answer to the Viceroys Memorial, with orders not to suffer a Soldier to be put into the Boat upon which the guard boat attended him to the landing place and reported it to the Viceroy, who refused to receive the Memorial and order'd Mr Hicks on board again, but in the mean time they had put a guard into the boat which Mr Hicks insisted should be order'd out that he might return on board in the same manner as he came Without a guard, and upon his refuseing to return otherways, all the Boat's Crew were by Armed force taken out of the Boat / tho they gave no provications nor made the least resistance/ and hurried to prision where they remain'd until the next day: Mr Hicks was then put into one of their Boats and brought on board under the Custody of a guard: emmidiately upon my hearing of this I wrote to the Viceroy demanding my Boat and crew and his Excellencys reason for detaining her: and inclosed the Memorial he had before refused to received. This I sent by a Petty Officer, as I had never objected to a guard being put into any of my Boats wherein was no PettyCommission officer He was admitted a Shore and deliver'd the letter, and was told an Answer would be sent the next day. This Evening, between 8 and 9 oClock came on an excessive hard storm of wind and rain, the Long boat coming on board the same time with 4 Pipes of Rum in her, the rope they got hold of broke and she went a drift. The Yawl was emidiatly sent after her, but the Long boat filling with water they brought her to a Grappling and left her and the Yawl with the People got on board about three in the morning. Early this Morning I sent to the Viceroy to acquaint him with the loss of our boat, to desire leave and the assistance of a Shore boat to look after her and at the same time to demand the Pinnace and her crew. After some time the whole was granted and we was so fortunate as to the find the Long boat the same day and lik[e]wise the 4 Pipes of Rum but every other thing that was in her was lost.
            
      

        21 November 1768
        Monday, 21st This Morning I received his Excellencys Answer Answer to my last Memorial and letter, in his letter he owns there was some indecency in detain[in]g the boat, but lays the blame to my Officer, who only executed the orders I gave him with spirit. In one part of his Memorial he says that from the built of the Ship and other circumstances he doubts that she is the Kings. This I thought proper to answer in writing by telling his Excellency that I was ready to produce my Commission. Rain the most part of this day.

This day I received from the Viceroy an Answer to my last Memorial wherein he still keeps up his doubts that she is not a Kings Ship, and accuseth my people doth of Smugling a thing I am very certain they were not guilty of, and for which his Excellency could produce no proff, notwithstanding many artfull means were made use of to tempt such of our people as were admitted ashore to trade by the Very Officers that were under his Excellencys own roof. I thought it incumbant on me to answer this Memorial, in which I desired his Excellency to take into custody any one of my people that should be found trading even if it amounted to no more then one of the sailors seling his Cloths from of his Back for a Bottle of Rum, for what his Excellency found call'd smugling I was very certain amounted to no more, and even this was only suspicions of my own.
            
      

        24 November 1768
        Thursday, 24th This day a Spanish Packet / a Small Brigg / arrived here from from Buenos ayres put in here in her way to Spain. This Vessel belonged to His Catholic Majesty, and notwithstanding the Viceroy had all along pretended that the orders he had respecting Foreign Vessels were general yet this Vessel met with very diferent treatment from us, no Guard was put over her and her officers and crew respected went wherever they pleased.

        First part Strong gales and very heavy Squalles with Hails  and rain  the remainder more moderate, but unsettled sometimes a fresh  breeze and Squally  and some times little wind; Kept Plying in the Straits untill 1/2 past  4 PM at which time the Tide had made Strong  againest us and the wind not abating bore away intending to have hauled under  Cape St Diego, but was prevented by the force  of the tide which carried us past that Cape with surprising rapidity   at at the same time caused a very great sea.  at 6 the Weather being clear took Nine or  three sets of observations of the Sun and Moon in order to find the Longitude  of the place.    and as they perhaps are the first observations  of this kind that were ever made so near to the extremity of South America I  have inserted them below just as they were taken that every boddy may judge  for themselves, Cape St Diego bore at this  time SBE distant about 4 Leagues  at  1/2 past 7 Tacked and stood to the SE  Cape St Diego bearing SBE  Distce 5 Leagues  At 1 AM  Squally, wore Ship Staten land extending from from  North to East. at 4 Moderate Weather, loose'd a reef out of each topsail, the  Cape of Good Success WBS and Cape St  Diego NNW being now in the Strait, but the  tide turning against us, soon carried us out    The Violence  of the Tide of Ebb rais'd such a Sea off Cape St  Diego that it looked as if it was breaking Voilently on a lidge of rocks and  would be taken for such by any who knew not the true cause; when the Ship was  in this torrent she frequently Pitched her bowsprit in the Water   by  noon we got under the land between Cape St  Diego and Cape St Vincent where I thought to  have Anchor'd, but found the bottom every where hard and rocky   the  depth of water from 30 to 12 fathom   Set the Master to examine a  small Cove which appeared to our View a little to the Eastward of Cape St Vincent
            
      

        15 January 1769
        Sunday 15th Moderate breeze  at South & SE  and Clowdy weather the greater part of this Day   
        At 2 PM the Master return'd  with an account that there was Anchorage in 4 fathom water and a good bottom  close to the Eastward of the first black bluf point which is on the East side  of Cape St Vincent, at the very entrance of  the Cove we saw from the Ship / which I named Vincents Bay / before this Anchoring  ground lay several rocky Ledges cover'd with Sea Weed, on these Ledges I was  informed was not less than 8 or 9 fathom, but in standing in with the Ship the  first we came upon had only 4 fathom upon it. I therefore thought that Anchoring  here would be attended with some risk, and that it would be better to endeavour  to find some port in the Strait and there compleat our Wood and Water. however  I sent a Boat with an officer a Shore to attend on Mr  Banks and People who was very desireous of being aShore at any rate, While I  kept plying as near the shore as possible with the Ship. At 9 they return'd  on board bringing with them several Plants Flowers, &Ca  most of them unknown in Europe and in that alone consisted their whole Value;  they saw none of the Natives but met with several of their old Hutts-- hoisted the Boat in and made Sail  into the Strats, and at 3 AM Anchor'd in  121/2 fathom Water, / the bottom Corral rock, / before a small cove which  we took for Port Maurice and near 1/2 a Mile from the shore Cape St  Diego SSW and Cape Bartholomew / which is  the So point of Staten Land / ESE   Port Maurice appeared to afford so little Shelter for Shipping that I  did not think it worth while to hoist a Boat out to Examine it  We  saw here two of the Natives come down to the Shore who stay'd some time then  retired into the woods again  
        At 10 oClock got under sail wind at S.E.  and Plyed to Windward 
            
      

        16 January 1769
        Monday 16 A Fresh breeze of Wind at South and S.W.  with frequent Showers of Snow and rain -   at 2 PM  Anchor'd in the Bay of Success, in 9 fathom the bottom owse and sand, the south  point of the Bay bore SE and the North Point  ENE. This Bay I shall describe when I come  to speake of the rest of the coast -   hoisted out the Boats, and  Moor'd with the Stream Anchor, while this was doing I went a Shore accompany'd  with by Mr  Banks and Dr Solander to look for a Watering  Place, and to speak with the Natives who were assembled on the beach at the  head of the Bay to the number of 30 or 40; they were so far from being afraid  or surprised at our coming amongest them that three of them came on board without  the least hesitation. They are something above the Middle size of a dark copper  Colour with long black hair, they paint their bodies in  Streakes mostly Red and Black, their cloathing consists wholy and  of a Guanacoes  skin or that of a Seal, in the same form as it came from the Animals back, the  Women wear of a peice of skin over their  privey parts but the Men observe no such decency   their Hutts are  made like a behive and open on one side where they have their fire, they are  made of small Sticks and cover'd with branches of trees, Long grass &Ca  in such a manner that they are neither proff against Wind, Hail, rain or snow,  a sufficient proff that these People must be a very hardy race; they live chiefly  on shell fish such as Muscles, which they gather from off the rock, along the  sea- shore and this seems to be the work of the Women; their arms are Bows and  Arrows neatly made, their arows are bearded some with glass and others with  fine flint, several pieces of the former we saw amongst them with other European  things such as Rings, Buttons, Cloth, Canvas &Ca  which I think proves that they must sometimes travel to the Northward as we  know of no ship that hath been in those parts for many years, besides they were  not at all surprised at our fire arms, on the contrary seem'd to know the use  of them by making signs to us to fire at Seals  or Birds that might come in the way  they have no boats that  we saw, or anything to go upon the water with   their number  doth not exceed 50 or 60 young and old and there are fewer Women then Men.    they are extreamly fond of any Red thing and seemed to set more Value on Beeds  than any thing we could give them: in this consists their whole pride, few either  men or Women are without a necklace or string of Beeds made of small Shells  or bones about their necks 
        They would not taste any strong Liquor, neither did they seem  fond of our provisions-   we could not discover that they had any  head or chief, or form of Government, neither have they any usefull or necessary  Utentials except it be a Bagg or  Basket to gather their Muscels into: in a Word they are perhaps as miserable  a set of People as are this day upon Earth   Having found a  convenient place on the So  side of the Bay to wood and Water at, we set about that work in the morning,  and Mr Banks with a Party went into the Country  to gather Plants &Ca

        Thursday [Tuesday] 17th Janry  Fresh gales at South, SW and W,  with rain and Snow and of Course very cold weather, notwithstanding we kept  geting on board Wood and water, and finished the Survey of the Bay. Mr  Banks and his Party not returning this Evening as I expected gave me great uneasiness  as they were not prepared for staying out the night, however, about noon they  returned in no very comfortable condition and what was still worse two black  servants to Mr Banks had perished in the night  with cold; great part of the day they landed was spent before they got through  the woods, after which they advanced so far into the Country that they were  so far from being able to return that night that it was with much difficulty  they got to a place of tolerable shelter where they could make a fire   these two men being intrusted with great part of the Liquor that was for the  whole party had made too free with it and stupified themselves to that degree  that they either could or would not travel but laid themselves down in a place  where there was not the least thing to shelter them from the inclemency of the  night. This was about a 1/4 of a Mile from where the rest took up their  quarters and notwithstanding their repeated endeavours they could not get them  to move one step farther, and the bad traveling made it impossible for any one  to carry them, so that they were oblig'd to leave them and the next morning  they were both found dead 

        Thursday 19th  All this  time the Ship Road very easey with her broad side to the swell -  the great  Surf that always will be upon the Shore when the wind blows hard from the Southward,  makes wooding and watering tidious, notwithstanding there are great party of  both close to high-water mark 

        Friday 20th Moderate  gales and clowdy with frequent showers of rain all this day: this evening the  Surf abated and at 2 AM sent the People on  shoar to Wood and water and cut brooms all of which we compleated this day    in this service we lost our small Kedge anchor, it having been laid off the  watering place to ride the Long boat by, and the gale had brok a way the Hawser  and Buoy rope, and perhaps buried the anchor in the sand, for notwithstanding  our utmost endeavour We were not able to hook it 
        took up the Stream Anchor and made ready for sailing  

        Monday 23rd Winds Variable  from SE round by the SW  to NW, first part a fresh breeze and squally,  the remainder Moderate breezes and sometimes Calm and clear weather which is  more then we have had for several days past:   at 4 AM  saw the land in the SW quarter and a small Island bearing West-   from  this time untill 9 it was calm, at which time the Ship drove very fast to the  W EB  NEBN, at 9 sprung up a light breeze at North  loosed all the reefs out and set the Studding sails, the Cape of Good Success  bore NEBN, Staten land seen from the deck  bearing N.E. the Sugar Loafe on Terra del  Fuego NNE / and is the same Hill as is seen from the NE  side of the land, it appears to stand but a little way inland from the Shore  / and the mainland and Islands on the Coast of Te  extending from the Cape of Good Success to the SBW.    the Country is Mountainous of an  indifferent height, the tops were cover'd with Snow, which had latly fell as  it did not lay long   there appeared to be several Bays and  inlets and Islands laying along the coast; the 3rd  View in the Chart exhibets the appearences of this coast: where g is new Island,  c the Sugr Loafe and h the C. of Good Success--      at noon the West End of New Island bore NWBW,  5 leagues. Latd Observed 55°.. 25' South.  This Island I named New Island because it is not laid down, in any Chart 

        Tuesday 24th Janry  The fore and middle part of these 24 hours Moderate gales and clowdy with some  showers of rain, the latter a fresh gale with flying showers: at 7 PM  New Island bore NWBN, and a small Island  laying to the Westward of it bore WBN, Variation  pr several Azimuths 21°..0' East which  is much less than we have yet found it upon this coast   Yet I am  satisfied with the goodness of the observations    at 1/2  past 1 AM the wind shifted from SSW  to ESE.   Tacked and stood SW,  at 6 saw the land to the Westward makeing like several Islands    at  8 two small Islands laying off a low point of land bore WBS  distt 3 Leagues and the small Island we saw  last night bore NNW: this I take to be the  Island of Evouts, it is about one League in circuit and of a moderate height  and lies 4 Leagues  from the Main near the south point of it are some peeked Rocks pretty  high above water--   the wind coming to the Southward we did but just  Weather this Island, in passing it sounded and had 40 fathom water sand and  broken shells-   At Noon it bore NE  Distt one League and the low point of land  before mentioned So 17° West distant 4  or 5 Leagues, Tacked and Stood to the SE  wind at SSW   from this low  point the land trends to the N.W. about 4  Leagues where it ends in a low point round which to the westward appears to  be a deep Bay, unless this land should prove to be an Isld  or Islands which is most likely: it rises into high craggy Hills and the Shore  seems to form several Bays, if so they must afford good shelter for shipping  against southerly and westerly winds 

        Wednesday 25th  of Janry Winds from the South to the WNW,  the first part fresh gales and squally with some rain, middle little wind with  hail and rain, latter, fresh gales and hazey with showers of rain     at 8 PM the Island of Evouts N.W.  distt 3 or 4 Miles -   Variation  pr morning Amplitude 21°..16' East. At  8 AM the Souther most low point of land seen  yesterday boare So 74° Wt  and a remarkable Peeked Hill to the Southward of it S.W.  and soon after we discoverd that the land which we took yesterday to be apart  of the main or an Island, was three Islands which I take to  be Hermites,   at Noon the south point of the Southermost Island bore  NWBW  distt 3 Leagues, having then 55 fathom Peble  stones; this Point is pretty high and compared  consists of Peeked  craggy rocks and not far from it lay several others high above water; it lies  in the Latitude of 55°.53' South and SW  26 Leagues from Strait La Mair, and by some on board thought to be Cape Horn,  but I was of another oppinion and with good reason because we saw land to the  southward of it about 3 or 4 Leagues    it appeared not  unlike and Island with a very high round hummock upon it: this I believe to  be Cape Horn for after we had stood to the Southward about 3 Leagues the weather  clear'd up for about a 1/4 of an hour which gave us a sight of this land  bearing then WSW but we could see no land  either to the Southward or Westward of it, and therefore conclude that it must  be the Cape, but whether it be an Island of it self, apart of the Souther most  of Hermites Islands or a part of Terra del Fuego I am not able to determine      however this is of very little concequence to Navigation, I only wished to have  been certain whether or no it was the Southermost Land on or near to Terra del  Fuego, but the thick Foggy weather, and the westerly winds which carried us  from the land prevented me from satisfying My curiosity in this point; but from  its Latitude and the reasons before given I think it must, and if so it must  be Cape Horn and lies in the Latitude of 55°..59' South and Longitude 68°..13'  - West from the Meridian of Greenwich, beeing the mean result of Several Observns  of the Sun and Moon made the day after we left the land, and which agree'd with  those made at Straits Le Maire, allowing for the distance between one place  and the other, which I found means very accuratly to determine:  As we  are now about takeing our departure from the land which we are not likely to  fall in with again, I shall give a more full discription of such parts of the  Coast of Terra del Fuego as have fallen under my inspection 

Latter Clear with a sharp cold air-    at 2PM saw the Land bearing North  Distant about 8 Leagues, it made in 2 hummocks  and appeared to be an Island, which I take to be the Isle of Diego Ramirez.    it lays in the Latitude of 56°..38' South and Longd  68°.47' West from Greenwich; found the Variation this Evening to be 22°  East. AM had 3 sets of Observation of the  Sun and Moon, which gave the Longitude 69°..7'..15" W.  The Longd of the Ship at Noon by the Obsern  is 69°..24'  1° 48'   the Longd  made from Cape Horn is = 67°..36'   the Longd  of the Cape which is 52' less than the result of yesterdays observations. This  difference may arise part[l]y from the observations and partly from the Ships  Run; the Mean of the 2 gives 68° 2' + 68°..24', the Longitude of the  Cape from the observations taken at Strait Le Maire = 136.26' 136..26   x 2    = 68°..13'  West from Greenwich, the Longd of Cape Horn, being deduced  from no less than 24 observations, taken at no very great distance from  the Cape and on both sides of it, and when the Sun was both to the East and  West of the Moon, for in this case the errors ariseing from observation are  most likely to correct one a nother 

        The first part of these 24 hours Moderate breezes and  clowdy    the remainder fresh gales and clowdy, PM  saw a great many Albetrosses and other Birds about the Ship, some were all white  and about the Size of Teal  Took several observations of the  Sun and Moon, the result of which gave 90°..13' West Longitude from Greenwich-   the Variation of the Compass by the Mean of several Azth  17° East  The Longitude by account is less then that by Obsern  37' which is about 20 Miles in these high Latitudes, and nearly equall to the  Error of the Logg Line before mentioned: this near agreement of the two Longitudes  proves to a demonstration that we have had no Western current sence we left  the Land 
        From the foregoing observations it will appear that  we are now advanced about 12° to the westward of the Strait of Magellan  and 31/2° to the northward of it,, having been 33 days in doubbling  Cape Horn or the land of Terra del Fuego, and arriving into the degree of Latitude  and Longitude we are now in and without ever  being brought once under our close reefe'd Topsails since we left Strait La  Maire a circumstance that perhaps never happen'd before to any Ship in those  seas so much dreaded for hard gales of wind insomuch that the doubling of Cape  Horn is thought by some to be a mighty thing and others to this Day prefer the  Straits of Magellan.   as I have never been in those Straits, can  only form my judgement on a carefull comparrison of the different Ships Journals  that have pass'd them and those that have sail'd round Cape Horn particularly  the Dolphins two Last Voyages and this of ours being made at the same Season  of the Year when one may reasonably expect the Same winds to prevail. The Dolphin  in her last Voyage was 3 Months in geting through the Straits not reckoning  the time she lay in Port Famine, and I am firmly peraswaided  from the winds we have had, that had we came'd  by that passage we should not have been in these Seas; besides the fatiguing  of our people the Damage we must have done to our Anchors Cables Sails and Rigging  none of which have suffered in our passage round Cape Horn 
        From what I have said it will appear that I am no advocate  for the Straits of Magellan, but it may be expected that I should say some thing  of Strait le Maire through which we pass'd - and this is the more incumbant  on me as it was by choise and contrary to the advice of  given by Mr  Walter the ingenious Author of Lord Ansons Voyage who adveiseth all Ships not  to go through this Strait but to go to the Eastward of Staten land, and likewise  to stand to the Southward as far as 61° or 62° South before any endeavour  is made to get to the westward; with respect to the passing of Strait Le Maire  or going round Staten land, I look upon of little consequence and either one  or the other to be pursue'd according to circumstances: for if you happen to  fall in with the land to the westward of the Strait and the winds favourable  for going through it certainly must be a peice of folly to loose time in going  round Staten land for by paying a little attention to the directions I have  already given no ill concequences can attend; but, on the contrary if you should  fall in with the land to the eastward of the Strait or the wind should prove  boisterous, or unfavourable, in any of these cases the going to the Eastward  of Staten land is the most adviseable--   And next, as to runing into  the Latitude of 61° or 62° South before any endeavour is made to get  to the westward, is what I think no man will ever do that can avoide it, for  it cannot be suppose'd that any one will Stear South mearly to get into a high  Latitude when at the same time he can Steer west, for it is not Southing but  Westing thats wanting, but this way you cannot steer because the winds blow  almost constantly from that quarter, so that you have no other choise but to  stand to the Southward, close upon a wind, and by keeping upon that Tack you  not only make southing but westing also and sometimes not a little when the  wind Varies to the northward of west, and the farther you advance to the Southrd  the better chance you have of having the winds from that quarter or Easterly  and likewise with of meeting with finer weather.   both  of which we ourselves experence'd. Prudence will direct every man when in those  high Latitudes to make sure of Sufficient westing to double all the lands before he thinks of Standing  to the Northward. When the winds was westerly the mountains on Terra Del Fuego  were generally cover'd with dense clowds, formed as one may reasonably suppose  by watery exhalations and by vapours brought thither by the westerly winds:  for from that quarter came frequent showers of Rain, Hail and Snow, and after  we had left the land and was were standing  to the Southward with the winds westerly dark dense clouds were continuely forming  in the horizon and rose to about 45° where they began to disspate, these  were generally attended with showers of rain or hail and Sqls  of Wind; but as we advanced to the southward these clowds became less dence,  and in ye Latd  of 60°..10', where we got the winds Easterly the weathrwas  more serene and milder, again as we advanced to the northward we had a constant  clowded sky & dark gloomy weather, ye whole  time exceedg cold -

The Man of War and Tropic Birds are pretty well known but the Egg Bird / as it is call'd in the Dolphins Journals / requires some description to know it by that name.  it is a small slender Bird of the Gull kind and all White, and not much unlike the small white Gulls we have in England, only not so big; there are also Birds in Newfoundland called Stearings that are of a the same shape and Bigness only they are of a Greyish Colour- These Birds were call'd by the Dolphins Egg Birds, on account of their being like those known by that name by Salors in the Gulph of Florida-  Neither they nor the Men of War Birds are never reckoned to go very far from Land 

At 1/2 past 10 AM saw land bearing South distant 3 or 4 Leagues - hauld up for it and soon found it to be an Island of about 2 Leagues in circuit and of an Oval form with a Lagoon in the Middle for which I named it Lagoon Island -   the Border of land circumscribing this Lagoon is in many places very low and narrow particularly on the South side particularly on the South side where it is mostly a beach or Reef of Rocks, it is the same on the north in three places and these disjoins the firm land and makes it appear like so many Islands cover'd with Wood-   on the West end of the Island is a large tree which we took for a            tree that looks like a Large Tower - and about the Middle of the Island are two Cocoa-nut trees that appears above all the other wood, which as we approache'd the Island look'd very much like a flag- We approach'd the north side of  this Island within a mile and found no Bottom with a 130 fathom of line neither nor did there appear to be any Anchorage about it-   we saw several of the Inhabitants, the Most of them Men and these March'd along the shore abreast of the Ship with long clubs in their hands as tho they meant to oppose our landing,   they were all naked except their privy parts, and were of a dark Coper colour with long black hair, but upon our leaving the Island some of them were seen to put on a covering- and one or two we saw in the skirts of the Wood was Cloathd in white, these we supposed to be Women  This Island lies in the Latitude of 18°..47' and Longd 139°..28' West from the Meridian of Greenwich  Variation 2°..54' East 

        A fresh steady gale and fine weather. at 1 PM made sail to the westward and at half past 3 saw land to the N.W. which we got up with at sun set, and it prov'd to be a low woody Island of a circular form and not much above a Mile in Compass  This Island I call'd Thrum Cap, it lies in the Latitude of 18°..35' So and in the Longitude of 139°..48' West from Greenwich, and North 62°. West 7 Leagues from Lagoon Island- We saw no Inhabitants nor the appearence of any and yet we was were within half a Mile of the Shore. I observed by the shore that it was near Low-water.   and at Lagoon Island I observed that it was either High-water or else there was no Ebing and flowing of the sea - from these circumstances I infer that a SBE or South Moon makes High-water-- Here we caught a King Fish being the first fish we have got in those Seas 

        A fresh Trade and fine pleasent Weather- At 3 PM, saw land to the westward which prov'd to be an Island of a bout 12 or 15 Leagues in Compass, is very low and intirely down'd in the Middle forming there a Large Lake into which their appear'd to be no inlet; the border of land and Reef surrounding this Lake like a wall appear'd to be of a Bow-like figure, for which reason I named it Bow Island, the South side a long which we saild was one continued low narrow beach, or Reef, like a causeway for 4 Leagues and upwards and lies EBN and WBS- The East and west ends and North side of this Island are wooded in Groves, and the firm land appear'd disjoind and like a number of Islands and very probably is so  The North-West parts of the Island we only saw a Cross the Lake and not very distinct on account of its great extent: and night coming on before we had run the whole length of the Island, this discription must be imperfect and the whole Island may form a different figure to what I have here described.

        Fresh gales and Clowdy. at 1/2 past 2 PM got up with the East end of the land seen yesterday at Noon, and which prov'd to be an assemblage of Islands join'd together by Reefs, and extending themselves NWEBN & SEBS in length 8 or 9 Leagues and of various breadths, but there appear'd to be a total Seperation in the Mid[dl]e by a Channell of half a Mile broad, and on this account they are called the two Groups. The SEermost of them lies in the Latitude of 18°..12' and Longitude of 142°..42' West from Greenwich, and W1/2N distant 25 Leagues from the West end of Bow Island 
        We rainged along the SW side of these Islands and hauld into a Bay which lies to the NW of the Southermost point of them, and where there appear'd to be anchorage and the Sea was smooth and not much surf on the shore, but we found no ground with 100 fathoms 3/4 of a Mile from the Shore and nearer we did not go. Here several of the Inhabitants assembled together with their Canoes with a design, as we thought, to come off to us as they hauld one of them over the reef seemingly for that purpose.   but after waiting near half an hour and they not attempting to come off we bore away and made sail, and presently the a Canoe put off after us, but as we did not stop, they soon went back again- They were in all respects like those we had seen on Lagoon Island and arm'd with clubs and Long pikes like them 
        At 1/2 past 6 AM, saw a small Island to the northward, hauld our wind for it and soon got close in with it-  it is about 3 or 4 Miles in circuit and very low with a pond in the middle    there is some wood upon it but no Inhabitants but birds and for this reason is call'd Bird Island. It lies in the Lat 17° 48' and Longd 143°..35'Wt and W1/2N 10 Leagu[e]s from the West end of the two Groups; the birds we saw about were Men of war Birds and several other sorts 

        The first part Clowdy and Squally with Showers of rain.   the remainder Gentle Breezes and clear weather - At 4 PM the NE point of Royal Bay W½N-- Run under an easy Sail all night and had soundings from 22 to 12 f m 2 or 3 Miles from the Shore-- At 5 AM made sail for the Bay, and at 7 Anchor'd in 13 fathom.   
        At this time we had but very few men upon the Sick list and these had but slite complaints, the Ships compney had in general been very healthy owing in a great measure to the Sour krout, Portable Soup and Malt; the two first were serve'd to the People, the one on Beef Days and the other on Banyan Days; The Malt Wort was made of the Malt and at the discrition of the Surgeon given to every man that had the least symptoms of Scurvy upon him by this Means and the Care and Vigilanc ye of M r Monkhous the Surgeon that this disease was prevented from geting a footing in the Ship- The Sour Krout the Men at first would not eate it untill I put in practice a Method I never once kn oew to fail with seamen.   and this was to have some of it dress'd every Day for the Cabbin Table, and permitted all the Officers without exception to do the make use of it and left it to the option of the Men either to take as much as they pleased or none atall; but this practice was not continued above a week before I found it necessary to put every man one on board to an Allowance - for such are the Tempers and disposissions of Seamen in general that whatever you give them out of the Common way, altho it be ever so much for their good yet it will not go down with them and you will hear nothing but murmuring gainest the man that first invented it; but the Moment they see their Superiors set a vallue upon it, it becomes the finest stuff in the World, and the  an inventer ana damned honest fellow 
        Remarkable Occurences at Georges Island 
        Note, The way of reckoning the Day in Sea Journals is from Noon to Noon, but as the Most material transactions at this Island must happen in the Day time this method will be attended with ilconveniences in inserting the transactions of each Day; for this reason I shall during our stay at this Island but no longer reckon the day according to the civil account, that is to begin and end at midnight 
        We had no sooner come to an Anchor in Royal Bay as before Mentioned than a great number of the natives in their canoes came off to the Ship and brought with them Cocoa-nuts, &ca and these they seem'd to set a great Value upon- amongest those that came off to the Ship was an elderly Man whose Name was is Owhaa, him the Gentlemen that had been here before in the Dolphin kne ow and had often spoke of him as one that had been of service to them, this man, / together with some others / I took on board / and made much of him thinking that he might on some occasion be of use to us 
        As our stay at this place was not likly to be very Short, I thought it very necessary that some order should be Observe'd in Trafficing with the Natives: that such Merchantdize as we had on board for that purpose might continue to bear a proper value, and not leave it to every ones own particular fancy.   which could not fail to bring on confution and quarels between us and the Natives, and wo uld infallible Lesen the Value of such Articles as we had to Traffic with: in d order to prevent this the following Rules were Orderd to be observed. / viz /
        RULES to be observ'd by every person in or belonging to His Majestys Bark the Endevour, for the better establishing a regular and uniform Trade for Provisions, &c:a with the Inhabitants of Georges Island 
        1 st To endeavour by every fair means to cultivate a friendship with the Natives and to treat them with all imaginable humanity 
        2 d A proper person or persons will be appointed to trade with the Natives for all manner of Provisions, Fruit, and other productions of the earth; and no officer or Seaman or other person belonging to the Ship, excepting such as are so appointed, shall Trade or offer to Trade for any sort of Provisions, Fruit or other Productions of the earth, unless they have my leave so to do 
        3 d Every person employ'd a shore on any duty what soever is strictly to attend to the same, and if by neglect he looseth any of his Arms or working tools, or suffers them to be stole, the full Value thereof will be charge'd againest his pay, according to the Custom of the Navy in such cases- and he shall recive such farther punishment as the nature of the offence may deserve 
        4 th The same penalty will be inflicted upon every person who is found to imbezzle, trade or offer to trade with any of the Ships Stores of what nature so ever unless they
        5 th No Sort of Iron, or any thing that is made of Iron, or any sort of Cloth or other usefull or necessary articles are to be given in exchange for any thing but provisions 
        J.C.
        As soon as the Ship was properly secure'd, I went on Shore accompanied by M r Banks and the other gentlemen, with a party of Men under arms, we took along with us Owhaa who took us to the place where the Dolphin water'd, and made signs to us as well as we could understand that we might occupy that ground   but it happen'd not to be fit for our purpose  [6]
        No one of the Natives made the least opposission at our landing but came to us with all imaginable marks of friendship and submission - We afterwards made a circuit through the Woods, and then came on board - We did not find the inhabitants to be numerous and therefore at first imagaened that several of them had fled from their habitations upon our arrival in the Bay *but MrGore & some others who had been here before observ'd that a very great revolution must have happen'd - not near the number of inhabitants a great number of houses raiz'd, har[d]ly a vestage of some to be seen, particularly what was call'd the Queens and not so much as a Hog or Fowl was to be seen - no very agreeable discovery to us of whose Ideas of plenty upon arrival at this Island / from the report of the Dolphin / was carried to the very highest pitch-
            
      

        14 April 1769
        1769 Friday Apl 14th This morning we had a great many canoes about the Ship, the Most of them came from the westward but brought nothing with them but a few Cocoa-nuts &Ca  Two that appear'd to be Chiefs we had on board together with several others for it was a hard matter to keep them out of the Ship.  as they clime like Munkeys, but it was still harder to keep them from Stealing but every thing that came within their reach, in this they are prodiges expert- I made each of the two Chiefs a present of a Hatchet things that they seem'd mostly to Value- As soon as we had partly got clear of these People, I took two Boats and went to the Westward all the Gentlemen being along with me, my design was to see if there was not a more comm[o]dious Harbour, and to try the disposission of the Natives having along with us the two Chiefs above mentioned; the first place we landed at was in Great Canoe Harbour / so call'd by Capn Wallis / here the Natives Flock'd about us in Great Numbers and in as friendly a Manner as we could wish, only that they shew'd a great inclination to pick our pockets. We was were conducted to a Chief who for distinction sake we called Hercules, after staying a Short time with him and distributing a few presents about us, we proceeded further and came to a Chief who I shall call Lycurgus, this man entertain'd us with Broil'd fish Bread fruit Cocoa-nuts &Ca with great hospitality.  and all the time took great care to tell us to take care of our pockets.  as a great number of people had crowded about us.  notwithstanding the care we took Dr Solander and Dr Munkhouse had each of them their pockets pick'd the one of his spy glass and the other of his snuff Box; as soon as Lycurgus was made acquainted with the theift he dispers'd the people in a Moment and the method he made use of was to lay hold on the first thing that came in his way and throw it at them and happy was he or she that could get first out of his way  [7]
        he seem'd very much concern'd for what had happend and by way of recompence offer'd us but every thing that was in his House, but we refuse'd to accept of any thing and made signs to him that we only wanted the things again. he had already sent people out after them and it was not long before they were return'd   We found the Natives very Numerous wherever we came and from what we could judge seem'd very peaceably inclin'd.   about 6 oClock in the evening we return'd on board very well satisfied with our little excursion 

        Saturday, 15th Winds at East during the day, in the night a light breeze off the land, and as I apprehend it be usual here for the Trade Wind to blow during great part of the Day from the Eastern board and to have it calm or light breezes from the land that is Southerly during the night with fair weather, I shall only mention the wind and weather weather when they do not deviate from this rule
        This morning several of the Chiefs we had seen yesterday came on board and brought with them Hogs, Bread fruit &Ca and for these we gave them Hatchets, Linnen and such things as they Valued- Having not met with yesterday a more convenienter situation for every purpose we wanted than the place we now are,  I therefore without delay resolved to pitch upon some spot upon the NE point of the Bay properly situated for observing the Transit of Venus and at the same time le under the command of the Ships Guns, and there to throw up a small fort for our defence, accordingly I went a Shore with a party of men accompanie'd by Mr Banks, Dr Solander, and Mr Green, We took along with us one of Mr Bank's Tents, and after we had fix'd upon a place fit for our purpose we set up the Tent and Mark'd out the ground we intended to occupy-  by this time a great number of the Natives had got collected together about us, seemingly only to look on as not one of them had any Weapon either offensive or defensive - I would suffer none to come within the lines I had marked out excepting one who appear'd to be a Chief and old Owhaamo  to these two men we endeavour'd to explain as well as we could that we wanted that ground to sleep upon such a number of nights and than we should go away-  whether they understood us or no is uncertain, but no one appear'd the least displeased at what we was about - Indeed the ground we had fix'd upon was of no use to them being part of the Sandy beach upon the shore of the Bay and not near to any of their habitations. It being too late in the Day to do any thing more a party with a Petty officer was left to guard the Tent While we with a nother party took a walk into the woods and with us most of the natives,   we had but just cross'd the River when Mr Banks shott three Ducks at one shott which surprise'd them so much that most of them fell down as tho they had been shott likewise. I was in hopes this would have had some good effect, but the event did not prove it, for we had not been gone long from the Tent before the natives again began to gather about it and one of them more daring than the rest push'd one of the Centinals down, snatched the Musquet out of his hand and made a push at him and then made off and with him all the rest, emmidiatly upon this the officer order'd the party to fire and the Man who took the Musquet was shott dead before he had got far from the Tent but the Musquet was carried quite off; when this happen'd I and Mr Banks with the other party was were about half a Mile off returning out of the Woods, upon hearing the fireing of musquets and the natives leaving us at the same time we susspected that some thing was the Matter and hasten'd our march, but before we arrive'd the whole was over and every one of the Natives fled except old Owhaamo who stuck by us the whole time and I beleive from the first either knew - or had some suspicion that the People would attempt something at the Tent as he was very much agai[n]st our going into the woods out of sight of the Tent.  however he might have other reasons for Mr Hicks being a shore the Day before the natives would not permit him to go into the woods.  this made me resolved to go and see whether they mea[n]t to proscribe bounds to us or no.  Old Owhaamo as I have said before was the only one of the Natives that stay'd by us, and by his means we prevail'd on about 20 of them to come to the Tent and their sit down with us and endeavour'd by every means in our power to convence them that the man was kill'd for taking away the Musquet and that we still would be friends with them   at sunset they left us seemingly satisfied and we struck our Tent and went on board 
            
      

        16 April 1769
        Sunday 16th This day warpe'd the Ship nearer the Shore and moor'd her in such a Manner as to command all the Shore of the NE part of the Bay, but more particularly the place where we intended to Erect a Fort.  Punished Richd Hutchins Seaman with 12 Lashes for disobaying command.  Several of the Natives came down to ye Shore of the Bay but not one of them came off to the Ship during the whole day- in the evening I went a Shore with only a Boats crew and some of the Gentlemen.   the natives gathered about us to the number of about 30 or 40 and b[r]ought us Cocoa nuts &Ca and seemed as friendly as ever 
            
      

        17 April 1769
        Monday 17th At 2 oClock this Morning departed this Life Mr. Alex. Buchan Landscip Draftsman to Mr Banks, a Gentleman well skill'd in his profession and one that will be greatly miss'd in the course of this Voyage, he had long been subject to a disorder in his Bowels which had more than once brought him to the Very point of death and was at the same time subject to fits of one of which he was taken on Saturday morning.   this brought on his former disorder which put a period to his life,  Mr Banks thought it not so adviseable to Enterr the Body ashore in a place where we was utter strangers to the Customs of the Natives on such Occations, it was therefore set out to Sea and committed to that Element with all the decencey the circumstance of the place would admit of   [8]
        This morning several Chiefs from the Westward made us a visit  they brought with them Emblems of Peace which are Young Plantain Trees   these they put on board the Ship before they would venture themselves, they brought us a present of two Hogs / an Article we find here very scarce / and some bread fruit, for these they had Hatchets and other things-  in the after noon we set up one of the Ships Tents a Shore and Mr Green and myself stay'd a Shore the night to Observe an Eclipse of Jupiter's fi[r]st Setilite which we was hinder'd from seeing by clowds 
            
      

        18 April 1769
        Tuesday 18th Clowdy weather with some Showers of rain- This morning took as many people out of the Ship as could possibly be spar'd and set about Errecting a Fort, some were employ'd in troughing up intrenchments while others was cutting faccines Pickets &Ca  the natives were so far from hindering us that several of them assisted in bring[ing] the Pickets and Faccines out of the woods and seem'd quite unconcern'd at what we were about.   the wood we made use on for this occation we purchased of them and we cut no tree down before we had first obtain'd their consent.  [9]   By this time all the Ships sails were unbent and the Armourers Forge set up to repair the Iron work &Ca. Serve'd Fresh Pork to the Ship's Compney to day for the first time, this is like to be a very scarce Article with us but as to Bread fruit Cocoa-nuts and Plaintains we have the Natives supply us with as much as we can distroy 
            
      

        19 April 1769
        Wednesday 19th This morning Lycurgus, whose real name is Tobia Tomita Toobouratomita came with his Family from the westward in order from what we could understand to live near us, he brought with him the covering of a house with several other Materials for building one, we intend to requite the conf[i]dence this man seems to put in us by treating him with all imaginable kindness- got on Shore some empty casks which we place'd in a double row along the bank of the River by way of a breast work on that side 
            
      

        20 April 1769
        Thursday, 20th Wind at S.E. and Squally with rain; all hands employ'd a Shore, and nothing remarkable excepting that a Hog weighing about 90 pounds was brought along side the Ship for sale, but those who brought it would not part with it for any thing we could offer them but a carpenter's broad ax and as this was what we could not part with they carried it away; thus we see those very People who but two years ago prefer'd a spike Nail to an Axe of any sort, have now so far learnt the use of them that they will not part with a Pig of 10 or 12 pounds weight for any thing under a Hatchet, and even those of an inferior or small sort are in no great esteem with them - and small Nails such as 10d 20d or any under 40d are of no Value atall; but Beeds particularly white cut Glass Beeds are much Value'd by them    [10]
        Mr Banks and Dr Solander lay ashore tonight for the first time, their Markee's being set up within the walls of the Fort and fit for their riceptoin 
            
      

        21 April 1769
        Friday, 21st Got the Copper Oven aShore and fix'd it in the Bank of the breast Works 
        Yesterday, as Mr Green and Dr Munkhouse were taking a Walk they happen'd to meet with the Body of the Man we had Shot; as the Natives by signs made them fully understand, the manner in which the body was enterr'd being a little extraordinary I went to day with some others to see it. Close by the House wherein he resided when living was built a small Shade, but whether for the purpose or no I cannot say for it was in all respects like some of the Shades or house's they live in. This shade was about 14 or 16 feet long, l0 or 12 broad and of a proportional height, one end was wholy oppen and the other end and the two sides were partly inclosed with a kind of wicker'd work. In this shade lay the Corps upon a Bier or frame of wood with a Matted bottom like a Cot frame use'd at Sea, and supported by 4 posts about 5 feet from the Ground, the body was cover'd with a Mat, and over that a white Cloth, along side of the Body lay a wooden Club, one of their weaphons of warr-  the Head of the Corps lay next the close end of the Shad, and at this end lay 2 Cocoa-nut Shells such as they sometimes use to carry water in-   at the other end of the Shade was a bunch of Green leaves, with some try'd twigs tied all together and stuck in the ground and a stone lying by them about as big as a Cocoa-nut, near to these lay a young Plaintain tree, such as they use as Emblems of Peace, and by it lay a stone Axe; at the open end of the Shade was hung in several Strings a great number of Palm nuts:  without the Shad was Struck upwright in the ground the Stem of a Plaintain tree about 5 feet high on the Top of which stud a Cocoa-nut shell full of fresh Water, and on the side of the Post hung a small Bag wherein was a few pieces of Bread fruit roasted ready for eating, some of the pieces were fresh and others stale. The Natives did not seem to like that we should go near the Body and stod at a little distance themselves While we examine'd these matters and appear'd to be please'd when we came away-  it certainly was no very agreeable place, for it Stunk intollerably and yet it was not above 10 yards from the Huts wherein several of the Living resided. The first day we landed we saw the Skeleton of a human being laying in this manner under a Shade that was just big enough to cover it, and some days after that when some of the Gentlemen went with a design to examine it more narrowly it was gone 
        It was at this time thought that this manner of enterring their Dead was not common to all ranks of people as this was the first we had seen, except the Skeleton just mentioned; but various were the opinions concerning the Provisions, &Ca laid about the dead; upon the whole it should seem that these people not only beleive in a Supream being but in a future state also, and that this must be meant either as an offering to some Deitie, or for the use of the dead in the other world, but this last is not very probable as there appear'd to be no Priest craft in the thing, for what ever provisions were put there, it appeared very plain to us that there it remaind untill it consum'd away of it self-  It is most likely that we shall see more of this before we leave the Island: but if it is a Religious ceremoney we may not be able to understand it.   for the Miysteries of most Religions are very dark and not easily understud even by those who profess them   [11]
            
      

        22 April 1769
        Saturday, 22nd to Thursday, 27th Nothing worthy of note happned, the people were continueally at work upon the Fort and the Natives were so far reconciled to us that they rather assisted us than not- This day we Mounted Six swivels at the Fort, which was now nearly finished, this Struck the Natives with some fear, and some fishermen who live'd upon the point move'd farther off, and old Owhaa told us by signs that after 4 days we should fire great guns from the Ship, there were some other circumstances cooperate'd with this mans Prophecy, whither an opinion hath prevail'd amongst them that after that time we intend to fire upon them, or that they intend to attack us we know not, the first we do not intend and the latter is unless the latter takes place which is highly improbable   [12]
            
      

        28 April 1769
        Friday, 28th This Morning Several a great number of the Natives came to us in their Canoes from different parts of the Island several of whome we had not seen before   one of these was the Woman called by the Dolphins the Queen of this Island, She first went to Mr Banks's Tent at the Fort where she was not known till the Master happening to go aShore who knewed her and brought her on board with two men and several Women who seem'd to be all of her Family.  I made them all some presents or other, but to Obariea, for such is this womans name, I gave several things, in return for which, as soon as I went a Shore with her, she gave me a Hog and several Bunches of Plantains, these she caused to be carried from her Canoe's up to the Fort in a kind of a Procession, she and I bringing up the rear. This Woman is about 40 years of Age and like most of the other Women very Masculine-  she is head or Chief of her own Family or Tribe but to all appearence hath no authority over the rest of the Inhabitants whatever she might have had when the Dolphin was here. Hercules, whose real Name is Tootaha, is to all appearences the Chief man of the Island and hath generally Viseted us twice a week sence we have been here, and came always attended by a number of Canoes and people, and at those times we was were sure to have a supply, more or less, of every thing the Island afforded; both from him self and from those that came with him - and it is a Chance thing that we got a Hog at any other time,  he was with us at this time and did not appear very well pleased at the notice we took of Obariea  but I soon but him into a good humor by takeing him on board and makeing him some presents
            
      

        29 April 1769
        Saturday, 29th This day got the four Guns out of the Hold and mounted 2 of them on the Quarter Deck.  and the other 2 in the Fort on the bank of the River 
        For this day or 2 past about 30 Double Canoes, in which might be between 2 & 300 people, had come into our neighbourhood   this made us keep a very good lookout & a strick eye over all their motions 
            
      

        30 April 1769
        Sunday, 30th This being the Day that Owhaa told us that we should fire our Guns, no one of us went from the Fort except such as were sent out to watch the Motions of the natives   however the day past over without any Visable alteration in the beheavour of any one of the Natives them   Queen Obaria visited us this morning pretty early and made me sencible that I must give her a hatchet & then she would give me a Pig. I agree'd to her plan and the Pig was produced 
            
      

        1 May 1769
        Monday, May the 1st This morning Tootaha came on board the Ship, and was very desireous of seeing into every Chest and Drawer that was in the Cabbin. I satisfied his curiosity so far as to open most of those that belong'd to be [me], he saw several things that he took a fancy to and collected them together, but at last he cast his eye upon the Adze I had from Mr Stephens that was made in immitation of one of their Stone Adzes or axes, the moment he lay his hands upon it he of his own accord put away everything he had got before and ask'd me if I would give him that which I very readily did and he went away without asking for any one thing more which I by experence knew -- was a sure sign that he was well pleased with what he had got 
        This day one of the Natives who appear'd to be a chief dined with us as he had done some days before, but than there were always some Women present and one or a nother of them put the Victuals into his mouth but this day there happen'd to be none to perform that office; when he was helpt to Victuals and desired to eat he sat in the chair like a Stattute without once attempting to put one morsel to his mouth and would certainly have gone without his dinner if one of the Servants had not fed him: We have often found the Women very officious in feeding of us, from which it shwould seem that it is a custom upon some occations for them to feed the Chiefs, however this is the only instance of that kind we have seen, or that they could not help themselves as well as any of us 
        This afternoon We set up the Observatory and took the Astronomical Quadt a shore for the first time, together with some other Instruments. The Fort being no[w] finished and made as Tenable as the Time, Nature and situation of the ground, and materials we had to work upon would admit of -  The North and south parts consisted of a Bank of earth 41/2 feet high on the inside, and a Ditch without, 10 feet broad and 6 feet deep: on the west side faceing the Bay a Bank of earth 4 feet high and Pallisades upon that, but no ditch  the works being at highwater mark: on the East side upon the Bank of the River was place'd a double row of casks: and as this was the weakest side the 2 four pounders were planted there, and the whole was defended beside these 2 Guns with 6 Swivels and generally about 45 Men with small arms including the officers and gentlemen who resided aShore; I now thought myself perfectly secure from anything these people could attempt;
            
      

        2 May 1769
        Tuesday, 2d This morning about 9 oClock when Mr Green and I went to set up the Quadt it was not to be found, it had never been taken out of the Packing case / which was about 18 Inches square / sence it came from Mr Bird the Maker; and the whole was pretty heavy, so that it was a matter of astonishment to us all how it could be taken away, as a Centinal stood the whole night within 5 Yards of the door of the Tent where it was put together with several other Instruments, but none of them was missing but this. However it was not long before we got information that one of the natives had taken it away and carried it to the Eastward- Immediatly a resolution was taken to detain all the Large Canoes that were in the Bay, and to seize upon Tootaha and some others of the Principle people and keep them in Custody untill the Quadt was produce'd   but this last we did not think proper immidiatly to put in execution as we had only Obaria in our power and the detaining of her by force would have alarm'd all the rest. In the mean time Mr Banks / who is always very alert upon all occations wherein the Natives are concern'd / and Mr Green went into the Woods to enquire of Tabia Tomita Tooboura tomita which way and where the Quadrant was gone,   I very soon was inform'd that these Three were gone to the Eastward in quest of it and some time after I follow'd my self with a small party of Men, but before I went away I gave orders that if Tootaha came either to the Ship or the Fort he was not to be detain'd for I found that he had no hand in takeing away the Quadrant and that there was almost a certainty of geting it a gain. I met Mr Banks and Mr Green about 4 miles from the Fort returning with the Quadrant   this was about Sun set and we all got back to the Fort about 8 oClock, where I found Toota ha in Custody and a Number of the Natives Crowding about the gate of the Fort. My going into the Woods with a party of arm'd men so alarm'd the Natives that in the evening they began to move off with their effects and a double Canoe puting off from the Bottom of the Bay was observ'd by the Ship and a boat sent after her; in this Canoe happen'd to be Tootaha and as soon as our boat came up with her, he and all the people that were in the Canoe jump'd over board, and he only was taken up and brought on board the Ship together with the Canoe, the rest were permited to swim ashore. From the Ship Tootaha was sent to the Fort, where Mr Hicks thought proper to detain him untill I return'd-  The Scene between Tabia tomita Toobouratomita and Toota ha, when the former came into the Fort and found the latter in custody, was realy moveing, they wept over each other for some time, as for Tootaha he was so far prepossess'd with the thought that he was to be kill'd that he could not be made sensible to the contrary till he was carried out of the Fort to the people, many of whom express'd their joy by embraceing him; and after all he would not go away untill he had given us two Hoggs, notwithstanding we did all in our power to hinder him, for it is very certain that the treatment he had met with from us did not merit such a reward. however we had it in our power to make him a present of equal Value when ever we pleased 
        We had now time to enquire consider how the quadrant was Stoln.  It is very probable that the man who took it had seen the box brought into the Tent or else had been well inform'd by others and had from that moment resolved to steal it, for about sunset last night a man was seen crawling a long the bank of the River behind the Fort, but on being spoken to he went away.   however it is very clear that he was watching for an opportunity to get into the Fort in the dusk of the evening before the centinals were call'd in and while the most of our people, after leaving of work, were diverting themselves with the natives.  however my self and some others were never out of the Fort and I did not stir out of the Tent where the quadt was till Sun set, then walk'd several times round the Inside of the Fort after which I went into Mr Banks's Markee and order'd the Drumer to beat the tattoo  in the doing of which he went 3 times round the works yet in one of these Short intervals when either mine or the drumers back turn'd the man found means to carry off the Box for immidiately after upon beating the Tattoo every boddy came into the Fort, the centinals call'd and place'd in the inside when it wold have been impossible for him to have done it. Indeed we found it difficult to beleive that a naked Indian, frighten'd of f[i]rearms as they are, would have made such an attemp'd at the certain risk of his life
            
      

        3 May 1769
        Wednesday 3rd Very early this morning Tootaha sent for the Canoe we had detained yesterday, and in the afternoon sent a man for an Ax and a Shirt in return for the Hogs he gave us last night, but as this man told us that Toota ha would not come near us himself in less than 10 days, th we thought proper not to send them to try if he would not come himself for them sooner 
            
      

        4 May 1769
        Thursday 4th Some people came to the Fort to day from York Island, one of them gave us an account of 22 Islands lying in the neighbourhood of this--  Set up the two Clocks, the one in the Tent wherein Mr Green and I lay and the other in the observatory- This evening Toota ha sent a Man again for the Ax and Shirt.   and we sent him word by the same Man, that Mr Banks and I would come and see him tomorrow and bring them along with us; for it now became necessary that we should take some step in order to reconcile this man to us in order to procure a Sufficient supply of Bread fruit and Cocoa-nuts which we have not had for these two days past, owing as we apprehend to Tootaha's not being reconciled to our being still displeas'd with our late conduct, or otherways the people take this method to shew their resentment of the treatment their Chief met with 
            
      

        5 May 1769
        Friday 5th Early this morning Tootaha sent some of his people to put us in mind of our promise and these seem'd very uneasy untill we set out, which Mr Banks Dr Solander and myself did about 10 oClock in the Pinnace having one of these men with us: as soon as we came to appara, the place where Toota ha resides, we saw a great number of people at the landing place near his house; one amongest them who was had a large Turband about his head and a long white Stick in his hand  drove the others from the landing place by beating them with his stick and throwing stones at them, and at the same time directed us where abouts to land; after we landed he conducted us to the chief but in this there was no order, every one crowding upon us crying out, Tyo Tootaha, that is Tootaha was our friend. We found the chief siting under the shade of a large tree with a circle of Old men round him, he made us sit down by him and immidiatly ask'd for the Ax, I then gave him one together with an upper garment made of Broad Cloth after their fashion and a Shirt; the garment he put on, but the Shirt he gave to the man who first recived us at landing who was now seated by us and the Chief seem'd desirous that we should take particular notice of him, by this time Obarea and several other Women whome we knew came and sat down by us. Tootaha did not stay long before he went away, as we thought to show himself to the people in his new dress, but he was not gone long before he return'd and took his seat again for a few Minutes, then went away again as we was were told, to order something to be got for us to eat.  and at this time we gladly would have gone too being almost suffocated with the crowd that was about us-  however here we remaind for a bout 10 Minutes longer when word was brought us that the Chief wanted us, we was were then conducted to our own boat, where we found him siting a lone under the awning. he made signs to us to come into him which we did and as many with us as the boat would hold; here he order'd some Bread fruit and Cocoa-nuts to be brought of both of which we taisted -- after we had set here some time a Message was brought to the Chief who immidiatly went out of the Boat and we was were desired to follow and were conducted to a large Area or Courtyard on one side of his Long House where we was were entertaind with Publick Wrestling. Tootaha seated himself at one end of the place and several of his principal men sat round him in a semicircle. We were desired to sit down here likewise but we rather chose to walk about- every thing being now ready several men enter'd the Theater, 8, 10, or 12 and some times more, these walked about in a Stooping dancing posture, with their arms with their left hand upon their right breast forming a large Corve with their arms and almost every moment app[l]ying their left arm bent near their bodys and with their right hand open struck with a smack their left arm and fore arm [and] breast   in this manner they walk'd about untill one challeng'd a nother which was done by motion and gesture without speaking one word-  the Two Antagonist[s] would then meet and endeavour to throw seize each other by the thighs, but if that faild, they would seize each other by the hair of the head or wher ever they could and then wristle together untill by main Strength the one or the other was thrown on his Back, this was always / except once / follow'd by three hurra's from some old men who sat in the house and at the same time a nother compney of men would dance for about a Minute, the wrestlers all the time continuing their game without takeing the least Notice of any thing else. The only dexterity the wrestlers seem'd to make use of was in first seizing each other for after they had close'd it was all decided by main Strength. It would sometimes happen that neither the one nor the other could throw his antagonist  in this case they would either part by mutal consent or were parted by others. The conqueror never  exulted over the Conquer'd, neither did the Conquer'd ever repine at his ill luck.   but the whole was carried on with great good humour Notwithstanding during the Combat their countenances appear'd to express as much fury as if they had been realy in earnest  The Women seem'd in a manner wholy to be excluded from this diversion There were present young and old near 500 people, the women do no[t] seem to pertake of this deversion, only some few of the principal ones were present and that appear'd to be owing to us being there - After this was over we was given to understand that we were to go to dinner and were desired to follow Tootaha who led us into our own boat and soon after came a small Pig ready Roasted with some bread fruit and cocoa-nuts and here we thought we were to have dine'd but Tootaha after waiting about 10 Minutes in purfound silence made signs to us to put of the Boat and go a Board which we did bringing him and Tobia tomita Toobouratomita a long with us: as soon as we got on board we all dine'd on the Cheer the Chief had provided 
        We soon found the good effects of having made friends with this man for it was no sooner known to the Natives that he was on board the Ship than they brought Bread fruit, Cocoa-nuts &Ca, to the Fort.

        Saturday 6th and Sunday, 7th Nothing remarkable only that the Natives supply us with as much bread fruit & Cocoa-nuts as we can destroy 

        8 May 1769
        Monday 8th Early this Morning the Master went to the Eastward in the Pinnace to try if he could procure some Hogs and Fowls from that quarter, but he returnd in the evening without success, he saw but a very few and those the Inhabitants pretended belonged to Tootaha so great is this mans influence or authority over them that they dare part with nothing without his consent, or other wise they only make use of his name to excuse themselves from parting with the few they have, for it is very certain these things are in no great plenty with them 

        Tuesday 9th, Wednesday, 10th, and Thursday, 11th Nothing remarkable happen'd for the three days. Oberea, the Dolphins Queen, made us a Visit for the first time sence the Quadrant was Stolen, she introduce'd herself with a small Pigg for which she had a Hatchet, and as soon as she got it she lugg'd out a Broken Ax and several peices of Old Iron, these I believe she must have had from the Dolphin, the Ax she wanted to be mended and Axes made of the Old Iron.  I obliged her in the first but excuse'd my self from the latter  Sence the Natives havea Seen the Forge at Work they have frequently brought pieces of Iron to be made into one sort of Tools or other, which hath generally been done when ever it did not hinder our own work, being willing to oblige them in every thing in my power; these pieces of Old Iron the natives must have got from the Dolphin, as we know of no other Ship being here and very probably some from us; for there is no species of theft they will not commit to get this Artic[l]e and I may say the same of the common seamen when in these parts 

        12 May 1769
        Friday 12th Clowdy weather with Showers of Rain  This Morning a Man and two young women with some others came to the Fort whom we had not seen before: and as their manner of introduceing themselves was a little uncommon I shall insert it: Mr Banks was as usual at the gate of the Fort trading with the people, when he was told that some Strangers were coming and therefore stood to receive them, the compney had with them about a Dozn young Plantains Trees and some other small Plants these they laid down about 20 feet from Mr Banks, the people then made a lane between him and them, when this was done, the Man the Man / who appear'd to be only a Servant to the 2 Women / brought the young Plantains singley, together with some of the other Plants and gave them to Mr Banks, and at the delivery of each pronounce'd a Short sentence, which we understood not, after he had thus dispose'd of all his Plantain trees he took several peices of Cloth and spread them on the ground, one of the Young Women then step'd upon the Cloth and with as much Innocency as one could possibly conceve, expose'd herself intirely naked from the waist downwards, in this manner she turn'd her Self once or twice round, I am not certain which, then step'd of the Cloth and drop'd down her clothes, more Cloth was then spread upon the Former and she again perform'd the same ceremony; the Cloth was then rowled up and given to Mr Banks and the two young women went and embraced him which ended the Ceremoney 

        Saturday 13th Nothing worthy of Note happen'd dureing the day, in the night one of the Natives attempted to get into the Fort by climbing over the Walls but being discovered by the Centinals he made off; the Iron and Iron tools daily in use at the Armourers Forge are temptations that these people cannot possibly withstand 
            
      

        14 May 1769
        Sunday 14th This day we perform'd divine Service in one of the Tents in the Fort, where several of the Natives attended and behaved with great decency the whole time: this day closed with an odd Scene at the Gate of the Fort where a young Fellow above 6 feet high lay with a little Girl about 10 or 12 years of age publickly before several of our people and a number of the Natives. What makes me mention this, is because, that it appear'd to be done more from Custom than Lewdness, for there were several Women present particularly Obarea and several others of the better sort and these were so far from shewing the least disapprobation that they instructed the girl how she should act her part, who young as she was, did not seem to want it.
            
      

        15 May 1769
        Monday 15th Winds variable and Clowdy weather. Last Night one of our Water casks was taken away from the out side of the Fort where they stood full of water   in the Morning there was not one of the Natives but what knew it was gone, yet contrary to what we had always met with on these occasions, not one of them would give us any information about it, and I thought it of too little consequence to take any methods to oblige them 
        Tootaha, would needs lay all night by the Casks to prevent any more from being taken away, but as we had place'd a Centinal there this care of theirs became unnecessary and they were prevaild upon to go home, but before they went away they made signs to the Centinal to keep his eys open   from this it should seem that they knew  that an attempt would be made in the night to take away more which would have been done had not the Centinal prevented it 

        Tuesday 23rd Wind Southerly and fair weather in the Fore noon, but in the afternoon showery- We have had a Scarcity of Bread all sorts of fruit for these 2 days past which we immagine to be owning to the wet weather.
            
      

        24 May 1769
        Wednesday 24th Fine Clear weather all this Day - Having found the Long-boat leakey for these few days past, we haled her ashore to day to stop the leakes, when to our great surprise we found her bottom so much eaten by the worms that it was necessary to give her a new one, and all the Carpenters were immidiatly set to work upon her 

        26 May 1769
        Friday 26th Some flying showers of rain. This morning we haled the Pinnace a Shor to examine her bottom and had the satisfaction to find that not one worm had touched it, notwithstanding she hath been in the water nearly as long as the Long-boat; this must be owing to the white Lead with which her bottom is painted, the Long-boats being pay'd with Varnish of Pine, for no other reason can be assign'd why the one should be preserv'd and the other destroy'd when they are both built on the same sort of wood and have been in equall use.    from this circumstance alone the bottoms of all Boats sent into Countrys where these Worms are ought to be painted with white lead, and the Ships supply'd with a good Stock in order to give them a new coat whenever its  necessary, by this means they would be preserve'd free from these distructive vermin. The Long-boats bottom being so much destroy'd appear'd a little extraordinary as the Dolphins Launch was in the water at this very place full as long and no such thing happened to her, as the officers that were in the Dolphin say 

        28 May 1769
        Sunday 28th Winds Southerly and clear weather- This morning, my self, Mr Banks and Dr Solander set out in the Pinnace to pay Tootaha a Viset who had moved from apparra to the SW part of the Isld   What induced us to make him this Viset was a message we had received from him some days ago importing that if we would go to him he would give us several Hogs, we had no great faith in this yet we was resolved to try, and set out accordingly, it was night before we reached the place where he was and as we had left the Boat about half way be hind us we were obliged to take up our quarters with him for the Night- The Chief received us in a very friendly manner and a Pig was order'd to be dress'd kill'd & dress'd for supper, but we saved his Life for the present thinking it would do us more service in a nother place and we supp'd on fruit and what else we could get; here was along with the Chief Obarea and many more that we knowed, they all seem'd to be travellers like ourselves, for nither the Canoes they had along with them nor the houses neither houses where they were were sufficient to contain the one half of them. and after supper We were in all Six of us and after supper began to look out for lodgings, Mr Banks went to one place  Dr Solander to a nother, while I and the other three went to a third, we all of us took as much care of the little we had about us as possible knowing very well what sort of people we were a mong, yet notwithstanding all the care we took before 12 oClock the most of us had lost something or other, for my own part I had my stockings taken from under my head and yet I am certain that I was not a Sleep the whole time, Obarea, took charge of Mr Banks's things and yet they were stolen from her as she pretended, Tootaha was acquainted with what had happen'd I believe by Obarea her self and both he and her made some stir about it but this was all meer shew and ended in nothing; a little time after this Tootaha came to the Hutt where I and those that were with me lay and entertain'd us with a consort of Musick, consisting of three Drums four Flutes and Singing, this lasted about an hour and then they retire'd; the Musick and singing was so much of a peice that I was very glad when it was over. We stay'd with them till near noon the next day in hopes of geting some of our things again, and likewise some Hogs but we were at last obliged to come away with the one we had save'd out of the fire last night, and a promise from Tootaha that he would come to the Ship in a Day or two with more and bring with him the things that we had lost, a promise that we had no reason to expect he will fulfill. Thus ended our Viset and we got to the Fort late in the evening 

        3 June 1769
        Saturday 3rd This day prov'd as favourable to our purpose as we could wish, not a Clowd was to be seen the Whole day and the Air was perfectly clear, so that we had every advantage we could desire in Observing the whole of the passage of the Planet Venus over the Suns disk: we very distinctly saw an Atmosphere or dusky shade round the body of the Planet which very much disturbed the times of the contacts particularly the two internal ones. Dr Solander observed as well as Mr Green and my self, and we differ'd from one another in observeing the times of the Contacts much more than could be expected  Mr Greens Telescope and mine where of the same Mag[n]ifying power but that of the Dr was greater than ours-  It was ne[a]rly calm the whole day and the Thermometer expose'd to the Sun about the middle of the Day rose to a degree of heat / 119 / we have not before met with / 119 /

        6 June 1769
        Tuesday 6th This Day and for some days past we have been inform'd by several of the Natives that about 10 or 15 Months ago, Two Ships touched at this Island and stay'd 10 days in a Harbour to the Eastward calle'd Ohidea   the Commanders name was Toottera so at least they call'd him and that one of the Natives / call'd Orette Brother to the Chief of Ohidea, went away with him;  they likewise say that these Ship[s] brought the Venerial distemper to this Island where it is now as common amongst them here as in any part of the World and which the people bear with as little concern as if it they had been accustom'd to it for ages past. We had not been here many days before some of our people got this disease, and as no such thing happen'd to any of the Dolphins people while she was here that I ever heard off, I had reason / notwithstanding the improbability of the thing / the to think that some in the Endeavour had brought it here we had brought it along with us which gave me no small uneasiness and I did all in my power to prevent its progress, but all I could do was to little purpose for I may safely say that I was not assisted by an one person in ye Ship, and I was oblig'd to have the most part of the Ships Compney a Shore every day to work upon the Fort and a Strong guard every Night and the Women were so very liberal with their favours, or that else Nails, Shirts &Ca were temptations that they could not Withstand, that this distemper very soon spread it self over the greatest part of the Ships Compney; but now I have the satisfaction to find that the Natives all agree that we did not bring it first here. However this is little satisfaction to the poor Natives them who must suffer by it in a very great degree and may in time spread it self over all the Islands in the South Seas, to the eternal reproach of those who first brought it among them   I had taken the greatest pains to discover in any of the Ships Company had the disorder upon him for above a month before our arrival here and order'd the Surgeon to examine every man the least suspected who declar'd to me that only one man in the Ship was the least affected with it, and his complaint was a carious shin bone; this man has not had connection with one woman in the Island-
        We have several times seen Iron tools and other articles with these people that we suspected came not from the Dolphin and these they now say they had from these two Ships 

        11 June 1769
        Sunday 11th Clowdy with rain last night and this Morning the remainder of the day fair weather. This Day Mr Banks and I took Tabia Toobouratomita on board the Ship and shew'd him the Print containing the Colours worne by the Ships of different Nations and very soon made him understand that we wanted to know which of them it was worne by the Ships that were at Ohidea he at once pitched upon the Spanish Flag and would by no means admit of any other: this together with several Articles we have lately seen amongest these people Such as Jackets Shirts &Ca usually worne by Spanish Seamen, proves beyond doubt that they must have been Ships of that Nation and come from some Port on the Coast of South America 
            
      

        12 June 1769
        Monday 12th Yesterday Complaint was made to me by some of the Natives that Jno Thurman and Jams Nicholson Seamn had taken by force from them several Bows and Arrows and Plated Hair, and the fact being proved upon them they were this Day punish'd with two Dozn lashes each 

        20 June 1769
        Tuesday 20th Got the Powder a Shore to air, all of which we found in a bad condition and the Gunner inform's me that it was very little better when it came first on board  Last night Obarea made us a Viset, who we have not seen for some time; we were told of her coming and that she would bring with her some of the Stolen things which we gave credit to because we knew - several of them were in her possession which but we were surprised to find this woman put her self wholy in our power and not bring with her one article of was what we had lost; the excuse she made was that her gallant, a Man that used to be along with her, had stolen did Steal them and she had beat him and turn'd him away; but she was so Sensible of her own guilt that she was ready to drop down through fear - and yet she had resolution enough to insist upon Sleeping in Mr Bank's Tent all night and was with difficculty prevailed upon to go to her Canoe altho' no one took the least notice of her. In the morning she brought her Canoe with every thing she had to the Gate of the Fort, after which we could not help admireing her for her Courage and the confidence she seem'd to place in us or else she depended a good deal upon what she brought with her which was and thought that we could do no less than to receive her into favour and except the presents she had brought us which Consisted of a Hog a Dog Some Bread fruit & Plantains, things we have not been over stock'd with of late: We refused to except of the Dog as being an animal we had no use for at which she seemed a little surprised and told us that it was very good eating and we very soon had an oppertunity to find that it was so, for Mr Banks having bought a basket of fruit in which happend to be the thigh of a Dog ready dress'd, of this several of us taisted and found that it was meat not to be despise'd and therefore took Obarea's dog and had him immediatly dress'd by some of the Natives in the following manner. They first made a hole in the ground about a foot deep in which they made a fire and heated some small Stones, while this was doing the Dog was Strangle'd and the hair got off by laying him frequently upon the fire, and as clean as if it had been scalded off with hot water, his intrails were taken out and the whole washed clean, and as soon as the stones and hole was sufficiently heated, the fire was put out, and part of the Stones was were left in the bottom of the hole, upon these stones were laid Green leaves and upon them the Dog together with the entrails,   these were likewise cover'd with leaves and over them hot stones, and then the whole was close cover'd with mould; after he had laid here about 4 hours, the Oven / for so I must call it / was open'd and the Dog taken out whole and well done, and it was the opinion of every one who eat taisted of it that they nNever eat sweeter meat, and we therefore resolved for the future not to despise Dogs flesh. It is in this manner that the Natives dress, or Bake all their Victuals that requires it. Flesh, Fish and fruit 
        I now gave over all thought of recovering any of the things the natives had stolen from us and therefore intend to give them up their Canoes when ever they apply for them 
            
      

        21 June 1769
        Wednesday 21st Empdtdrying the Powder geting on board Wood, Water &Ca Confined Robt Anderson seaman for refusing to obey the orders of the Mate when at work in the hold    This morning a Chief whose Name is Oamno, and one we had not seen before, came to the Fort, there came with him a Boy about 7 years of Age and a young Woman about 18 or 20; at the time of their coming Obarea, and several others were in the Fort and they went out to meet them, having first uncover'd their heads and bodies as low as their waists and the same thing was done by all those that were on the out side of the Fort; as we looked upon this as a ceremonial Respect and had not seen it paid to any one before we thought that this Oamo must be some extraordinary person  and wonder'd to see so little notice taken of him after the Ceremony was over    the young Woman that came along with him wCould not be prevaild upon to come into the Fort, and they Boy was carried upon a Mans Back, altho he was as able to walk as the Man who carried him,  This lead us to inquire who is they were and we was inform'd that the Boy was Heir apparent to the Sovereignty of the Island and the young woman was his sister and as such the respect was paid them, which was due to no one else except the Arreedehi which was not Tootaha from what we could learn.  but some other person who we had not seen, or like to do, for they say that he is no friend of ours and therefore will not come near us. The Young Boy above mention'd is Son to Oamo by Obarea, but Oamo and Obariea do not at this time live together now as man and wife he not being able to endure with her troublesome disposission   I mention this because it shews that separation in the Marrige state is not unknown to this people 
            
      

        22 June 1769
        Thursday 22nd This morning I released Robt Anderson from confinement at the intercession of the Master and a promise of behaving better for the future 

        Friday 23rd This morning Manuel Ferrara Seaman a Portugese was missing, and I had some reason to think that he was gone with an intent to stay here. It was not long before I was inform'd that he was at Apparra with Tootaha, the man who gave us this information was one of Tootahas Servants, he was offer'd a Hatchet if he would go to Apparra and bring him to us   this was perhaps no doubt the very thing he came for, for he immidiately set out and return'd with the man in the evening; He the man in his difence said, that as he was going to the boat to go on board last night, he was taken away by force by 3 men, put into a canoe and carried to apparra and upon enquiry I found it to be so and that Tootaha wanted to wold have kept him, he had not been perswaided to the contrary, or perhaps he thought the ax od more value then the man 

        26 June 1769
        Monday 26th Very early this morning I set out in the Pinnace, accompined by Mr Banks and one of ye Natives with an intent to make the Circuit of the Island in order to examine and draw a Sketch of the Coast and Harbours thereof- We proceeded to the Eastward and found the shore to trend EBS and ESE about 10 Miles unguarded by any reef   About 8 oClock we landed on the district of  Ohiainu and was introduced to the chief whose name was Ahio; here we found some of our old friends one of which would needs accompany us. From hence we proceeded on foot / the Boat rowing along shore sounding and met with nothing remarkable / excepting a small roaste'd Pig laying upon an Alter near to a place where lay the body or bones of a dead person / untill we arrived at Whidea a large district in which there are two chiefs Toomohinneo and Orrette, in this last chiefs district calld                         we were inform'd the Spanish Ships had Anchord, We were Shew'd the place where they pitch'd their Tents and the Brook they had water'd at together with the Situation of the Ships and this was all the proof we had of Shipping having been there: this place is situate on the west side of a deep large bay of which place are two small Islands, Booarou & Taawirey on the first of which Mr Hicks made His observation of the Transit. Here the coast trends SBE and South about 4 Leagues to the bottom of the bay - before it lay reefs of corral rocks which together with the shore form several good Harbours in which are good anchorage in 20 and 24 fathom water. From                we proceeded on foot untill we found it impractical to reach the bottom of ye Bay before night without the boat which was now call'd in. Our last Indian companion endeavour'd to perswaid us to go no farther, telling us that we were going to a place where no provisions was to be got and that the People would kill him & that they were at War with Tootaha & would kill us - we made light of these reports and let him see us put balls into our guns on which he consented to accompany us.   we row'd to the bottom of the Bay where we did not arrive till after dark here in stead of find[ing] enemies we found several of our old acquaintance who were there in their canoes and appear'd to be travelers like our selves, by them we were accomodated with lodgings. At day break we got up and while the boat was geting ready, I took a walk into the Country which I found here to be a low neck of landwith a chain of morasses over which they track their canoes across the Isd which may be about 2 Miles or more; this Isthmus divides the Island into two districts or Kingdoms, wholy indepentant of each other as we were told.   We were told also that the country we were now in, as well as all the country we had come from was call'd Tiarreboo Oboreanoo or Otahite Ete nua and was Subject to Tootaha, but we were now on the borders ofTiarreboo or Otahite Ete the Enimies country we had yesterday heard of - We embark'd and proceed along Shore by the direction of our pilots and landed in one of the first whennuas or districts, in the enemies country calld Annuwhe, the chiefs name Marie Tata here we were well recieved and after some delay furnish'd with a large Hog for which we gave a axe; we observ'd here that on our landing every one but the chief had their ahous stripe'd down of their Shoulders. We saw also twelve pound shott, one mark'd with the English broad Arrow, which they said had been given them by Toottero the Commander of the Spanish Ships - Among the crowd which was pretty numerous there were only two that we remembered to a Seen 
        From hence Mr Banks and I proceeded on foot and sent the boat to a distant point, as these people shewed as much friendship both to us and our guides as we had any where met with. At last we arrived at the district of Oheea
           Ohitepepa, Chiefs name Waheatua Earee de hi of the Kingdom of Tearraboo, situate on the Eastermost point of the large bay before mentioned along the sides of which we had till now been travilling. On the west side of the above point is Ohitypepa bay which in many respects is similar to Royal or Matavie bay and is seated in every bit as fertile a part of the Island, there are also harbours between this and the Isthmus proper and convenent for Shipping made by reefs of Corral rocks. In Ohitepepa bay is [a] river so large that we were obliged to ferry over in a Canoe, & our train which was pretty numerous, to swim - We were disire'd to stay and Sleep and was told that Waheatua would come to us, but the day being far Spent I would not stop but proceeded on foot towards the SE points of the Island & presently met with King Waheatua who was a very old man with a white beard, not at all attended by a crowd of people, we just stop'd to pay our compliments and recieve the same, than proceeded along a very fine country every part of which was cultivated, the very brooks were wall'd in to a very narrow channell and the Sea bank'd out, on every point was a Morai and and several inland all ornamented with carved work, some with the images of men standing on each others head, others with a kind of lattice work on the top of which were the figures of Birds &Ca We likewise saw a great number of large double Canoes hauld up upon the Shore, they were of different built from those we had seen and much larger and their awnings supported on carved pillors, there Sterns very high and ornamented with carving. After having tire'd our selves with walking we took to the boat and here we miss'd both our Indian guides, we had however with us one whome we knew.  the young chief Tiaree who call'd himself son of Whaeatua and seem'd to have much influance, he went with us and we rowed along shore till dark then put into a little creek not far from the SE point of the Island- here we found a deserted long house where we resolved to spend the night and began to search for something to eat, but nothing could we get; soon after came Tiaree's retinue and his double canoe in the Awning of which Mr Banks slept while I and the peepe [people] slept in the long house - in the night our first Indian guide Taoahow, joind us and came and laid down by me 

        Tuesday, 27th.Winds Easterly and fine weather. It was late last night before we reached the Isthmus, and all the Observations I could make this morning was that it appeared to be a Marshey flatt of about 2 miles in Extent aCross which the Natives Haul their Canoes partly by land and partly by water. From the Isthmus the land trends East Srly. near 3 Leagues, to the SE point of the Great Bay which lies before the Isthmus. On the west side of this point is a Bay called Ohitepepa, which is in many respects similar to Royal Bay, and is situated in every bit as fertile and populous part of the Island. There are other places formed by the Reefs that lay along the Shore between this and the Isthmus, where Shipping can lay in perfect security. The Land then trends. SE and S. to the SE part of the Island, which is near 3 Leagues, and covered all the way by a Reef of Rocks, but no Harbour. We took up our Quarters at the East part of the Island, being conducted thither by a Young Chief we had Often seen on board the Ship, and the next morning proceeded round the SE point of the Island, part of which is not cover'dby any reef, but lies wholy open to the Sea and here the Hills rise directly from the Shore. At the Southernmost part of the Island the Shore is again cover'd by a Reef, and there forms a very good Harbour, and the land about it very fertile. At this place we saw a Goose and a Turkey left at Royal Bay by the Dolphzn; they were in possession of a Chief who came along with us in the Boat, and remain'd with us the remainder of the day, and conducted us over the Shoals we here meet with; and for this piece of service we lent him a Cloak to Sleep in in the night, but we had not been laid down above 10 minutes before he thought proper to move off with it, but both Mr. Banks and I pursued him so close that he was obliged to relinquish his prize, and we saw no more of him. When we returned to our Lodging we found the House, in which were not less than 2 or 300 people when we went away, intirely deserted, so that we had one of the Largest and best houses on the Island wholy to ourselves; but when they found that we meant them no harm the Chief and his Wife with some others came and Slept by us the remainder of the night. This place is situated on the SW side of T'arreboo, the SE district of the Island, and about 5 miles SE from the Isthmus. Here is a large, safe, and Commodious Harbour, inferior to none on the whole Island, and the land about it Rich in Produce. We found that the people of this district had had little or no communication with us, yet we was everywhere well received by them. We found all this part of the Island very fertile and the Natives numerous, and had a great many large Double Canoes built and Ornamented uniformly. They were all hailed ashore, and appeared to be going to decay for want of use. Their Mores or Burial places stood generally upon these points of land that projected into the Sea, and were both better built and Ornamented than those about Royal BayTootahais excepted. In general this district appear'd to be in a more flourishing state than the other, although it is not above one fourth part as big and cannot contain nothing near the Number of inhabitants.
            
      

        28 June -  circa 1 July 1769
        WEDNESDAY 28th Before we set out in the Morning we waited a little in hopes that the people would furnish us with some provisions, but seeing that none came we proceeded with our guide Taoahow, leaving the young chief behind us -  After walking a few miles the boat rowing along shore, we came up to a number of double canoes and [were] surprized to find in them a great number of our friends an[d] acquaintance;  here we made sure of geting some provision but we were here again disappointed, for altho the Cocoa nut trees were full of fruit, our friends had no property in them or in any thing else we wanted, we therefore imbarked in our boat and proceeded round the SE point of the Island, here the land rose in hills directly from the Sea and of course but thinly inhabited the reef was broken and danger[ou]s and had it not been for our pilot we should have found it difficult to proceed; after rowing about a league round this point of the Island we arrived at a flat, cali'd Ahowe governed by Chief Mathiabo,   here the shore is wholy cover'd by a firm Reef which forms a very good harbour in which we landed and purchass'd a good supply of provisions. Here we saw an unusual sight in one house, at one end was a board of a semicircular figure to which was fasten'd 15 of the lower Jaw bones of men, all seemingly firm and in good condition with scarce a tooth wanting among them - we could not learn the reason of their being placed there  We saw here a goose and a Turkey left at which were left at Matavie by the Dolphins Capn Wallice. When we left this place King Mathiabo desired to accompany us to a friend of his who was a great man, we accordingly took him into the boat and he made us call at as many whennuas as possible but we met with nothing worth remarking, except in one place where we saw two of the largest Canoes we had seen any where upon the Island, the general face of the country was much more wooded than the other side of the Island.   the flats fruitfull and populous. In the course of our progress we bought Cocoa nutts, Bread fruit & fish more than enough   We proceeded all the way within the reef and in some places met with very shole waters.   In the evening we opend the large bay which lay opposite to that on the other side of the Island - About two thirds down the Bay we resolved to take up our lodgings for the night at a large long house in the Whennua owiourou govern'd by King Wiveraw who received us with great hospitality and orderd his people to assist us in dressing our provisions which they did with great readiness.   here we supped and occasion observed that our friend Mathiabo was certainly a great man as Wiverow with his own hands dMixed a Shell of poipoi / that is Breadfruit, Plantains &C mixed with Cocoa nut Milk and water to the consistance of Custard / for his Supper: When bed time came he complaind much of cold and desired a cloak to sleep in which was granted him as he had behaved so well all day, we went and prepared a bed for him, Mr Banks and my self, in which we two lay down, thinking that Mathiabo who was absent was gone to wash himself,   however very soon one of the Natives came and told us that our friend had made off with the cloak: at first we did not believe it but soon after Tooahow came and confirmed the report, we started up and immidiately gave chase in the dark obliging Wiverow's brother to go with us he being the first that came in our way - We pursued about 3/4 of a mile and so close thatwhen the Cloak was brought us and we return'd to our lodgings where all hand[s] were mattowed,that is frighten'd, and fled, we soon however prevail'd on some of them to return & Wiverow & his wife slept on the floar nigh us the remainder of the night 
        Towards morning we were awaked by the alarming circumstance of our boat being missing, we were however soon relieved by from our uncomfortable situation by the sight of the boat which had drove from her grapling - By such time as the boat return'd it was day-light and we set off and rowd to the next Whennua which lies on near the bottom of the bay and is governed by Omae, he together with his wife accompanied us in our boat about a mile farther where we land and saw a very extraordinary curiosity called by them Mahuwe and said to be used in their Heiva's or publick entertainments as Probably as Punch is in a Puppet show; it was the figure of a man made in basket work 71/2 feet high and every other way large in proportions   the head was ornament with four Nobs resembling stumps of horns, three before and one behind   the whole of these figures are cove'd with feathers a great way, passing the bottom of the Bay where the country divides; in this passage we were obliged to come without the Reef which we had been within ever sence we past the SE point of the Island. I had forgot to mention that at Oweourou which is situate on the SW side of Tearreboo about 5 Miles SE from the Isthmus, is a large safe and commodious harbour, inferior to no one on the Island and the land about it rich in produce 
        We landed upon the first Whennua in Opooreonoo where we found several of our old acquaintances,   What we saw here remarkable was a Morie paved and adorned with [a] pyramid about five feet high of the fruits of Cratova & Palm nuts, on the pave'd floor near this were three skulls of men laid in a row & nigh them a little shade covering a very rough image of stone about 18 Inches high; near to the Morie stood an Altar under which lay the Skull bones of 26 Hogs and 6 Dogs. From hence we proceeded farther and met with a very extraordinary curiosity call'd Mahuwe ± and said by the Natives to be used in their Heiva's or publick entertainments, probably as punch is in a Puppet Show. It was the figure of a man made in basket work 71/2 feet high and every other way large in proportion, the head was ornamented with four nobs resembling stumps of horns three stood in front and one behind, the whole of this figure was cover'd with feathers, white for the ground upon which black imitating hair and the Marks of tattou - it had on a maro or cloth about its loins, under which were proofs of its being intended for the figure of a man 
        ± See Note page 21.
        From hence we proceeded to Papara the seat of our friend Oborea where we meant to sleep, in this rout way we pass'd through a very good harbour, and the only one on the South side of Opooreonoo fit for shipping   it is Situate a bout 5 Miles to the westward of the Isthmus, between two small Islands that lay near the shore and about a Mile from each other;  about a League and a half to the Westward of this Harbour is the seat ofObarea where we, as I have before observed, we landed, we got here some time before night, she proved not to be at home, however we found People enough to entertain us, and therefore resolved to sleep in her house, a small neat one with open bamboo walls. Near this place stands the Morie of Oamo or Obarea, a wonderfull peice of Indian Architecture and far exceeds every thing of its kind upon the whole Island, it is a long square of stone work built Pyramidically, the base is 267 feet by 87, the breadth and length at top is 177 feet by 7.   it riseth by large steps all round, like those leading up to a sun dial, there are 11 of those each 4 feet high which makes the whole height 44 feet; the foundation is of squared rockstone of a redish Colour one Corner Stone of which measured 4F..7I by 2 ft 4 In.   its thickness 15 Inches; every step was composed of one row of Coral rock very neatly squared the rest of round Stones like large pebbles which seem'd to have been worked by their uniformness in size and Shape - of the Coral Stones some were large / 31/2 feet by 21/2 /    On the middle of the top stood the figure of a bird carved in wood and near it lay the broken one of a fish carved in stone: there was no hollow or cavity in the inside the whole being fill'd up with stone -  the whole was inclosed in a Spacious Area part of one side of which it made,   the Size of this Area was 360 feet by 354F. incompass'd by a wall of stone, in it were several Etoa trees, or what I call Cypress, and Plantains. Near to this Morie were Several small ones all going to decay, and on the beach between them and the Sea lay great quantitys of human bones; near the great Morie were many large Altars Supported by 6 or 8 pillars each about 10 feet high, on which were exposed meat for Eatua or God, there we saw the Sculls and bones of many hogs and dogs. This Morie stands on the South side of Opooreonoo upon a low point of land about 100 Yards from the Sea,   it appear'd to have been built many years ago, being in a state of decay as most of their Mories are, from this it should seem that this Island has been in a more florishing state than it is a[t] present, or that Religious customs are, like most other nations, by these people less observed 
        In the morning proceeded again meeting with nothing worth notice all day, only that we were a good deal retarded by reefs shoals &Ca   At night we came to Attahouroo where we had been once before on a Viset to Tootaha  Here we met with many of [our] Acquaintances who receiv'd [us] very cordially giving us a good supper and makeing us a good bed. From hence we proceeded homeward the next morning through a Country which we had before seen in our way   Viseted Tootaha and met with a favourable reception, at least he was not a We stay'd with him but a short time and then proceeded to the Fort where we arrived in the evening of Saturday July the 1st  having made the circuit of the whole Island which I estimated at some thing more than 30 Leagues,   the Plan or Sketch which I have drawn, altho it cannot be very accurate yet it will be found sufficient to point out the Situations of the different Bays and harbours and the figure of the Island and I believe is without any material error 

        Sunday July 9th When sometime in the Middle Watch Clement Webb & Saml Gibson both Marines & young Men found means to get away from the Fort / which was now no hard matter to do / & in the morning were not to be found, as it was known to every body that all hands were to go on board on the monday morning & that the ship would sail in a day or 2, there was reason to think that these 2 Men intended to stay behind, However I was willing to stay one day to see if they would return before I took any step to find them.
            
      

        10 July 1769
        [Note: The portion of this entry from "Monday 10 [to]... Certain intelligence" does not appear in National Library  of Australia  MS 1, and has been supplied from the text of the copy of the Journal now in the Public Record Office (London), Adm 55/40]
        Monday 10th The 2 Marines not returning this morning I began to enquire after them & and was inform'd by some of the Natives that they were gone to the Mountains & that they had got each of them a Wife and & would not return, but at the same time no one would give us any Certain intelligence where they were; upon which a resolution was taken to seize upon as many of the Chiefs and as we could.   this was thought to be the readiest method to induce the other natives to produce that the two men. We had in our our Custody Obarea, Tabia Tooboura tomita, and two other Chiefs but that I know'd that Tootaha would have more weight with the Natives than all these put together, I dispatch'd Lieutt Hicks away in the Pinnace to the place where Tootaha was to endeavour to decoy him into the boat and bring him on board which Mr Hicks perform'd without the least disturbance. We had no sooner taken the other Chiefs into Custody in Mr Banks's Tent, than they became as desireous of having the men brought back has they were before of keeping them, and only desire'd that one of our people might be sent with some of theirs for them; accordingly I sent a Petty Officer and the Corporal of Marines with three or four of their people not doubting but they would return with the two Men in the evening, but, they not coming as soon as I expected I took all the Chiefs on board the Ship for greater safety. About 9 o oClock in the evening Web the Marine was brought in by some of the Natives and sent on board, he inform'd me that the Petty officer & the Corporal that had been sent in quest of them were disarm'd and seiz'd upon by the Natives and that Gibson was with them. Immidiatly upon geting this information I dispatch'd Mr Hicks away in the Long boat with a Strong party of men to resque them but before he went - - - - - Tootaha and the other Chiefs was made to understand that they must send some `of their people with Mr Hicks to shew him the place where our men were, and at the same time to send orders for their immidiate releasement for if any harm came to these men, they, the Chiefs, would suffer for it.   and I believe at this time they wished as much to see the Men return in Safty as I did, for the guides conducted Mr Hicks to the place before day light and he recover'd the men without the least opposission: and return'd with them about 7 oClock in the morning of [Tuesday 11th ]
            
      

        11 July 1769
        Tuesday 11th I then told the Chiefs that there remaind nothing more to be done to regain their liberty but to deliver up the Arms the people had taken from the petty Officer and Corporal and these were brought on board in less than half an hour and then I sent them all a Shore, they made but a short stay with our people there before they went away and and most of the Natives with them - but they first wanted to have given us four Hogs, but these we refus'd to accept as they would take no thing for them. Thus we are likely to leave these people in disgust with our behaviour towards them, owing wholy to the folly of two of our own people for it doth not appear that the natives had any hand in inticeing them away and therefore were not the first agressors,  however, it is very certain that had we not taken this step we never should have recover'd them 
        The petty officer whom I sent in quest of the deserters told me that the Natives would give him no intelligence where they were nor those that went along with him but on the contrary grew very troblesome and as they were returning on board in the evening they were suddenly set Siezed upon by a number of arm'd men that had hid themselves in the woods for that purpose   this was after Tootaha had been seized upon by us so that they did this by way of retaliation in order to recover their Chief.   but this method did not meet with the approbation of them all, a great many condem'd these proceedings and were for having them set at liberty, while others were for keeping them untill Toataha was release'd and the disputes went so far that they came from words to blowes and our people were several times very near being set at liberty.  but at last the party for keeping them prevail'd; but as they had still some freinds no insult was offer'd them; a little while after they brought Web and Gibson the two deserters to them as prisioners likwise but at last they agree'd that Web should be sent to inform us where the others were 
        When I came to examine these two men touching the reasons that induce'd them to go away, it appear'd that an acquentence they had contracted with two Girls, and to whome they had stron[g]ly attache'd themselves was the sole reason of their attempting to Stay behind. Yesterday we weigh'd the small bower Anchor the Stock of which was so much eaten by the worms as to break in heaving up and to day we hove up the best bower and found the Stock in the very same Condition. This day we got every thing off from the shore and to night everybody lays on board 
            
      

        12 July 1769
        Wednesday 12th The Carpenter Empd stocking the Anchors and the Seamen in geting the Ship ready for sea; this morning we found the Staves of the Cask the Natives stole from us some time ago laying at the Watering place but they had been Sencible enough to keep the Iron Hoops, and only return what to them was of no use 
            
      

        13 July 1769
        Thursday 13th Winds Easterly a light breeze   This morning we was viseted by Obarea and several others of our acquaintances, a thing we did not expect after what had happen'd but two days ago; but this was in some measures owing to Mr Banks Dr Solander and my self going to Apparra last night where we so far convinced them of our friendly disposition that several of them was were in tears at our comeing away 
        Between 11 and 12 oClock we got under sail and took our final leave of this people after a stay of just Three Month, the most part of which time we have been upon good terms with them: some few differences have now and than happen'd, owing partly for to the want of rightly understanding one another and partly to their natural thievish disposission which we could not at all times, neither bear with or guard against: but these have been attended with no ill concequences to either side except the first in which one of them was kill'd, and this I was very sorry for because from what had happen'd to them by the Dolphin I thought it would have been no hard matter to have got, and kept a footing with them without bloodshed - For some time before we left this Island several of the natives were daily offering themselves to go away with us, and as it was thought they must be of use to us in our futereure discoveries, we resolved to bring away one whose name is Tobia Tupia, a Cheif and a Priest: This man had been with us most part of the time we had been upon the Island which gave us an oppertunity to know some thing of him: we found him to be a very intelligent person and to know more of the Geography of the Islands situated in these seas, their produce and the religion laws and customs of the inhabitants than any one we had met with and was the likeliest person to answer our purpose; for these reasons and at the request of Mr Banks I received him on board together with a you[n]g boy his servant 
        For the first two months we were at this Island the Natives supply'd us with as much Bread fruit Cocoa-nutts &Ca as we could well despence with, and now and then a few Hogs but of these not more than hardly sufficient to give the Ships Compney one and some times two fresh meals a Week and as to fowles I did not see above 3 Dzn upon the whole Island and fish they seldom would part with - but during the last month we got very little refreshment of any sort, the detain[in]g of their canoes broke off trade at that time and it never after was begun again with any spiret. However it was not wholey owing to this but to a scarcity.   the season from bread fruit was wholy over and what other fruits they had was were hardly sufficient for themselves, at least they did not care to part with them. All sorts of fruits we purchased for Beeds and Nails not less than 40d penny for a nail under that size was of no Value; but we could not get a Hog above 10 or 12 pounds weight for any thing less than a Hatchet  not but that they set great Value upon spike Nails but as this was an article many in the Ship was were provided with the women soon found a much easier way at comeing at them than by bringing provisions. Our trafick with this people was carried on with as much order as in the best regulated market in Europe; it was managed a shore chiefly by Mr Banks who took uncommon pains to procure from the natives every kind of refreshments that was to be got 
        Axes, Hatchets, spikes, large Nails, Looking-glasses Knives, and Beeds are all highly valued by this people and nothing more is wanting to trafick with them for every thing they have to dispose off: they are likewise very fond of fine Linnen Cloth both white and printed, but an Ax worth half a Crown will fetch more than a peice of Cloth worth twenty shillings 

        Friday July 14th Gentle breezes at N, E. and clear weather     I have before made mention of our departure from Royal Bay on the preceeding fore-noon, and like wise that I had determined to run down to Haheine and Ulietea before we stood to the southward, but haveing discover'd from the Hills of Georges Island an Island laying to the Northward, we first stood that way to take a nearer View of it. / this Island is call'd Tethuroa / at 1/2 past 5 PM it bore NBE1/2E distant 4 Leagues, the Island over Royl Bay S.E.B,E, and York Island SWBS.This Island it lies N1/2W distant 8 Leagues from point Venus it and is a small low uninhabited Island and frequented by the people of Georges Island for fish with which it is said to abound - At 6 AM the Westermost part of York Island bore SE1/2S. and the body of Georges Island E1/2S. Punished the two Marines, who attempted to desert from us at Georges Island, with 2 Dozn lashes each and then released them from confinement. At Noon the body of York Island bore EBS1/2S, Royal Bay So 70°. 45' Et distant 61 Miles and an Island, which we took to be Saunders Island discover'd by Capt. Wallice / call'd by the Natives Tapoamanau / bore SSWW, Latde Obd 17°.. 9' South. Saw land bearing NW1/2W which Tobiaupia calls the Island of Huaheine 

        Monday 17th Winds Southerly fine pleasent weather    At 3 PM Anchor'd in a small Harbour on the West side of the Island / call'd by the Native[s] Owharhe / in 18 fathom water clear ground and secure from all winds.   soon after, I went a Shore, accompined by Mr Banks, Dr Solander and Dr Munkhouse, Tobiaupia, the King of the Island and some other of the Natives who had been on board since the Morning. The Moment we landed Tobiaupia striped him self as low as his waist and disired Mr Munkhouse to do the same, he then sat down before a great number of the natives that were collected together in a large Shade or house, the rest of us by his own desire standing behind; he then begun a long speach or prayer which lasted near a 1/4 of an hour and in the course of this Speach presented to the people two handkerchiefs, a black silk neckcloth, some beads and two very small bunches of feathers, these things he had before provided for this purpose, at the same time two Chiefs spoke on the other side in answer to Tobiaupia as I suppose in behalf of the people and presented us with some young Plantains Plants and two small bunches of feathers   these were by Tobiaupia order'd to be carried on board the Ship, after the Peace was thus concluded and ratified every one was at Liberty to go where he pleased and the first thing Tobiaupia did was to go and pay his oblations at one of the Maries. This seem'd to be a common ceremony with this people and I suppose always perform'd upon landing on each others Territories in a peaceable manner; it farther appear'd that the things which Tobiaupia gave away was for the God of this people as they gave us a Hog and some Cocoa-nuts for our God, and thus they have certainly drawn us in to commit sacrilege for the Hog hath already received sentence of death and is to be dissected to morrow 
        AM I set about surveying the Island and Dr Munkhouse with some hands went a shore to trade with the Natives, while the Long-boat was employ'd compleating our water 
            
      

        18 July 1769
        Tuesday 18th Gentle breezes at S. and SSW. clear weather. The trading party had no success to day  the Natives pretend that they have not had time to collect their provisions from from the different parts of the Island, but that on the morrow we should have some and as I had not seen so much of the Island as I disired I resolved to stay one day longer to see if any thing was to be got 
            
      

        19 July 1769
        Wednesday 19thP.M. Variable light airs and clear weather, the trading party had better Success to day then yesterday. A.M. A Gentle breeze at SE. As it was known to the natives that we intended to sail to day, Oree the Chief and several more came on board to take their leave of us.   to the chief was given a small plate on which was stamp'd the following Inscription viz. His Britannick Maj. Ship Endeavour, Lieutt Cook Commander 16th July 1769. Huaheine. This was accompanied with some Medals or Counters of the English coine struck 1761.   together with some other presents, all these but more particularly the plate the Cheif promised never to part with; this we thought would prove as lasting a Testimony of our having first discover'd this Island as any we could leave behind.   after this was done they were dismiss'd and w[e] began to prepare to leave the place but as that falls out on the following day I shall conclude this with a discription of the Island which is situated in the Latitude of 16°..43' So and Longitude 150°..52' West from Greenwich and North 58° West distant 31 Leagues from King Georges Island or Otaheite. It is about 7 Leagues in compass and of a Hilly and uneven surface. it hath a safe and commodious Harbour which lies on the west side under the northermost high land and within the north end of the reef which lays along that side of the Island; into this Harbour are two inlets or openings in the reef about 11/2 Mile from each other, the southermost is the broadest on the So side of which is a very small sandy Island. This Harbour is called by the natives Ohwarhe 
        The produce of this Island is in all respects the same as King Georges Island and the manners and customs of the inhabitants much the same only that they are not addicted to stealing, and with respect to complexion Colour, they are rather fairer than the natives of Georges Island and the whole more uniformly of one Colour 

        Thursday 20th Moderate breeze andt at East and ENE fair weather, At 1/2 past 2 PM, weigh'd and made Sail for the Island of Ulietea which lies SWBW distant 7 or 8 leagues from Huaheine, at 1/2 past 6, we were within 3 Leagues of it, then shorten'd sail and Stood off and on all night, and at day light made sail in shore and soon after discover'd an opening in the reef that lies along this side of the Island within which Tobiaupia said was a good harbr   upon this I hoisted out the Pinnace and sent the Master in to examine it who soon made the signal for the ship to follow, accordingly we stood in and anchor'd in 22 fathom soft ground: soon after we anchor'd some of the Natives came on board the Ship with very little invatation 
            
      

        21 July 1769
        Friday 21st Winds Variable and dark clowdy weather with frequent Showers of rain. At 1 PM I landed in company with Mr Banks and the other Gentlemen.   the first thing done was the performing of Tobiaupia's ceremony in all respects as at Huaheine   I then hoisted an English Jack and took posession of the Island as & those adjacent in the name andfor the use of His Britk Majestys, calling them by the same names as the Natives do  AM. sent the Master in the Long-boat to examine the coast of the South part of the Island, and one of the Mates in the yawl to sound the harbour where the Ship lay, while I was employ'd in the Pinnace surveying the northern part of the Island: and Mr Munkhouse went a shore to trade with the Natives for such refreshments as was were to [be] got 

        24 July 1769
        Monday 24th Winds Variable from SSE to NE. At 8 AM got under sail and Ply'd to the northward within the reef in order to go out at the northern channell, it being the broadest, but being little wind and meeting with Shoals we had not before discover'd we turned down but slowly 
            
      

        25 July 1769
        Tuesday 25th First part little wind, at NE in the night calm, AM a fresh breeze at WNW fair weather   At 3 P.M. Anchor'd in 22 fathom water a Muddy bottom the North Cannol open bearing NE1/2E at 5 AM a breeze sprung up at NW weigh'd and put to Sea and hauled to the Northward in order to take a View of the Island of Otaha and Bola bola.   but before I proceed farther I shall describe the Harbour we have been in. This Harbour taken in its greatest extent is capable of holding any number of Shipping in perfect security as it extends almost the whole length of this side of the Island and is defended from the sea by a reef of Coral rocks; the southermost opening in this reef or Cannell into the Harbour, which is not more than a Cables length wide / is off the eastermost point of the Island and may be known by a small woody Island which lies a little to the SE of it; between three and 4 Miles N.W. from this Island, lies two other small Islands and in the same direction as the reef of which they are a part between these two Islands is another Cannol into the harbr that is a full 1/4 of a Mile broad; still further to the N.W are some other small Islands where I am inform'd is a nother inlet, but this I did not see, but as to the other two we enter'd the harbour by the one and came out by the other 
        The principal refreshments we have got here consists in Plantains, Cocoa-nuts, some Yams and a few Hogs and fouls   this side of the Island is neither populous nor rich in produce, if compaird to Georges Island, or even Huaheine. However here are no want of refreshments for a Ship who may put in here and stay but a short time and Wood and water may be got every w[h]ere. tho the latter is not very convenient to come at 
            
      

        26 July 1769
        Wednesday 26th Winds at WBN & WBS.  but very variable towards the latter part. At 4 P.M. the North end of Ulietea So 75° West dist. 2 Leagues and the So end of Otaha Nt 77° West - about a League to the Northward of the South end of Otaha on the East side of the Island, a mile or more from the Shore lies 2 small Islands; between these Islands Tobiaupia says there is a chanl into a very good harbour which lies within the reef and it had all the appearence of such.   kept plying to windward all night without geting any ground. at Noon the Peek on Bolabola WBS. Latd Obd 16°..26'.
            
      

        27 July 1769
        Thursday 27th Variable light Airs of wind in the SW quarter and fair weather. Seeing that there is a broad Channell between Otaha and Bolabola I intend to go thro' that way and not run to the northward of all; but as the wind is right on end and very Variable withall we got little or no ground - Between 5 and 6 oClock P.M as we were standing to the Northward we discover'd a Small low Island lying NBW or NNW distant 4 or 5 Leagues from Bolabola,   this Island is called Tubai. Tobiaupia says it produceth nothing but a few Cocoa-nuts; that there are only three Families live upon it, but that the people from these Islands resort thither to catch fish.   At Noon the Peak of Bolabola bore N. 25° West and the North end of Otaha N 80° West distant 3 Leagues    Latd Obd 16°..38' South 
            
      

        28 July 1769
        Friday 28th Little winds and Variable between the SW and NW. At 6 AM. being near the entrence of the Harbour which lies on the S East side of Otaha before mention'd, and finding that it might be examined without looseing time, I sent away the Master in the Long-boat with orders to sound the Harbour and if the wind did not shift in our favour to land upon the Island and to traffick with the Natives for such refreshments as was were to be got. Mr Banks and Dr Solander went along with him 
            
      

        29 July 1769
        Saturday 29th Little wind and Variable, kept plying on and off this day waiting for the return of the Long boat   at 1/2 past 5 not seeing any thing of her fired a gun for her to return and as soon as it was dark hoistid a light   At 1/2 past 8 heard the report of a Musquet which we answer'd with a gun and soon after the boat came on board with 3 small Hoggs, a few fouls and a large quantity of Plantains and some Yams; they found the Natives very Sociable and ready to part with any thing they had, and the Harbour safe and commodious with good Anchorage in 25, 20, and 16 fathom water clear ground. As soon as the boat was hoisted in we made sail to the Northward, and at 8 oClock AM was were close under the Peek of Bolabola, but as we could not weather the Island we Tack'd and stood off untill near Noon then tack'd again and stood to the SW. At Noon the Peek of Bola bola bore So 75° West we were then distant from the shore under it 2 or 3 Miles and from the Peek about 5 Miles - Latd Observ'd 16°.29' South 
            
      

        30 July 1769
        Sunday 30th Winds in the SE quarter at first a gentle breeze but afterwards freshen'd upon us   PM made several trips before we could weather the south end of Bolabola which at last we accomplished between 7 and 8 oClock and stoodd off SSW untill 12 at night then tack'd and stood in untill 4 AM then stood off again, but meeting with a large swell from the Southward againest which the Ship made little or no way. at 8 we tack'd and stood in shore again. At this time we discover'd an Island which bore from us N. 63° West distant about 8 Leagues at the same time the Peek of Bola bola bore N1/2E distant 3 or 4 leagues: this Island Tobiaupia calls Maurua and according to his account it is but small and surrounded by a reef of rocks and bath no harbour fit for shipping, it is inhabited and its produce is the same as the other Island we have touched at: it riseth pretty in a high round hill in the middle of the Islands which may be seen 10 Leagues  At Noon the Soend end of Otaha bore N 80° E distt 4 Leagues. Latd Obd 16°..39' So 

        Monday 31st. Fresh gales in the SE quarter and Close Clowdy weather. Plying to windward all this day on the SW side of Otaha without gaining little or any thing,  in the middle watch was oblig'd to double reef our Topsails but in the morn.g it fell moderate and we crowded all the sail we could - At Noon the South end of Otaha bore East distant 2 Leagues. Latd Obserd 16°.40' South   Tobiaupia told us there was a very good harbr within the reef which lies on this side of Otaha but this Harbour I shall discribe in a nother place 

        Augt
        Tuesday 1st A fresh gale at SE the most part of this day Kept plying to windward, all the after noon and night and in the morning found our selves nearly the length of the south end of Ulietea and to windward of some harbours that lay on this west side of the Island into one of them I intend'd to go with the Ship in order to stop a leak in the Powder room which could not be easily done at sea & to take in more ballast as I found her too light to carry sail upon a wind. At Noon plying off one of the Harbours mouth, the wind being right out 
            
      

        2 August 1769
        Wednesday 2nd Moderate  breeze at SE and East with some Showers of  rain. At 3 PM Anchor'd in the entrance of  the channoll leading into the Harbour in 14 fathom water - found a Tide seting  pretty strong out which was the reason that we could not work in: carried out  the kedge Anchor in order to warp into the harbour but after this was done we  could not trip the bower anchor with all the purchass we could make and was  therefore oblig'd to lay still all night   but in the morning we did  it with ease and warped the Ship into a proper birth and Moor'd in 28 fathom  a sandy bottom-   A great number of the Natives came off to us both  last night and this morning and brought with them Hoggs fouls, Plaintains &Ca  which they parted with at a very easy rate 
            
      

        3 August 1769
        Thursday 3rd Winds  from ESE to NE  Very hot weather. This after noon I went ashore to look for a place to get Stones  for Ballast and a watering place, both of which I found very convenient and  in the morning sent an Officer a shore to superintend the getting  off Ballast and water and I went in the Pinnace to the Eastward  Northward to  survey that part of the Island, accompined by Mr  Banks and Dr Solander, while the Carpenters  were Employd on board stoping the leakes of the Powder-room and fore sail room  and this was a nother reason why I put in here as  these things could not have been done at Sea 
            
      

        4 August 1769
        Friday 4th First and latter part moderate breeze at ENE   in the night calm hot and sultry. In our rout to the northward this after noon we wasere entertain'd at one place with Musick and danceing, the Musick consisted of twohree drums and the dancing was mostly perform'd by two young women and one man and this seem'd to be their profession, the dress of the women was such as we had not seen before, it was neat decent and well chose and in many respects not much unlike a European dressonly their arms neck and shoulders were bare and their headdress was the Tomou stuck with flowers. They made very little use of their feet and legs in dancing, but one part or a nother of their bodies were in continual motion and in various postures, as standing siting and upon their hands and knees, they would sometimes make wry and very odd faces,  makeing strange contorsions their Arms hands and fingers they move'd with great agillity and in a very extraordinary manner and altho they were very exact in observing the same motions and gestures in all their movements yet neither their Musick or dancing were att all calculated to please a European 
        There were likewise some men who acted a kind of a Farce but this was so short that we could gather nothing from it only that it shew'd that this People have a notion of Dramatick performances   and some of our gentlemen saw them act a Farce the next day wherein was four acts and it seem'd to them to represent a War between the Bolabola men and those of Ulietea wherein the former triumph'd over the latter - but what might help them to draw this conclusion was the knowing that such a thing has not long ago happen'd between these two people and that the Bolabola men at present posess most of the lands on this Island. This is their grand Dramatick Heiva and I beleive is occasionaly perform'd in all the Islands. Upon my return to the Ship in the evening I found that they had got on board 20 Tons of Ballast and this I thought would be sufficient; in the morning we sent all our water casks a shore and got them all off full by noon. This morning I received a present from Opoony the Arrii Earee dehi of Bolabola who at this time was upon this Island, it consisted of three Hogs, some peices of cloth, Plantains, Cocoa-nuts &Ca these were sent by his servants and I was told that he would come the next day himself 
            
      

        5 August 1769
        Saturday 5th This evening we bought as much fish as the whole Ships Compney could destroy while good   In the morning I sent the Master to the north end of the Island with the Long-boat to traffick with the Natives for Provisions as they did not bring it to the ship as they had hither to done, and my self, accompaned by Mr Banks and Dr Solander went in the Pinnace to the Southern part of the Island partly on the same account and partly to examine that part of the Island - In our rout we pass'd thro' two harbours equally as good as the one in which the ship lays.   but the country about them is poorer and but thinly inhabited, and we got no one thing worth bringing home with us, but the Master succeeded something better 
            
      

        6 August 1769
        Sunday 6th Variable light airs and fair weather. AM. I sent the Master again to the northward to procure refreshments, who return'd not unsuccessfull   Opoony the Chief sent some of his people this morning to me for to get something in return for the present he sent the other day.   he not chewsing as I suppose to trust himself on board or perhaps he thought the persons he sent / who were three very pretty young girls / would succeed better than he should do.   be this as it may they went away very well saitisfied with what they got.  altho I beleive that they were disapointed in some things 
            
      

        7 August 1769
        Monday 7th Variable light airs PM some showers of rain - Being desireous to see King Opoony we made a party this after noon and went ashore for that purpose, carrying along with us a small present: upon our landed he did not receive us siting as all the other cheifs had hitherto done or in any manner of form; this we attributed to his stupitity for such he appear'd to be.   however he gave me a Hog in return for the present I made him and this was paying us full as great a Compliment, before we took our leave we let him know that we should go to Otaha in the morning in our Boats and would be glad to have him along with us, and he accordingly promise'd to accompany us thither. Accordingly very early in the Morning I set out with both Pinnace and Long boat for Otaha and some of the gentlemen along with me and in our way called upon Opoony who was in his Canoe ready to set out along with us: as soon as we landed on Otaha I made him a present of a Ax, this I thought would induce him to incourage his subjects to bring us such provisions as we wanted, but I belive we had already got all they intended us  for after staying with him untill noon we was were obliged to go away without geting any one thing 
            
      

        8 August 1769
        Tuesday 8th After leaving Opoony we proceeded to wards the north point of the Island and in our way pick'd up half a dozn Hogs as many fouls and some Plantains and Yams, and I had an oppertunity to view and draw a sketch of the harbour which lies on this side of the Island and which was the only thing that induce'd me to make this excursion. After it was dark we met with the long boat which I had in the morning dispatched to a nother part of the Island, and we now made the best of our way to the Ship and got on board about 10 at night. The Carpenter having finished stoping the leakes about the Powder room and sail room, I now intend to sail as soon as ever the wind will permit us to get out of the harbour.
            
      

        9 August 1769
        Wednesday, 9th. P.M. had a light breeze of wind at north, in the night had a good deal of rain. AM, little wind and variable with some showers of rain - At 11 AM a breeze of wind sprung up at East which carried us out of the harbour and as soon as the boats were hoisted in made sail to the Southward 
        Sence we have been about these Islands we have expended but little of our sea provisions and have at this last place been very plentifully supply'd with Hogs Fouls Plantains and Yams, which will be of very great use to us in case we should not discover any lands in our rout to the Southward, the way I now intend to Steer 

Shortend sail and stood off and on all night   At 6 AM made sail and stood in for the land and run to leeward of the Island keeping close in shore all the time - saw several of the Natives as we run a long shore but in no great numbers. At 9 hoisted out the Pinnace and sent Lieutt Gore Mr Banks and Tobiaupia to endeavour to land upon the Island, and to speake with the natives, and to try if they could learn from them what lands lay to the southward of us.  and likewise to see if there was Anchorage in a Bay which appear'd to our veiw, not that I intended to anchor or make any stay here - -

        Fresh breeze and fair weather. At 2 P.M. the Pinnace return'd on board without landing, not but what it was practicable but they did not think it altogether safe with only one boat as it would have been attended with some danger on account of the surff and rocks upon the shore: and the natives were arm'd and shew'd no signs of either fear or friendship; some of them came off to the boat in a Canoe and had some nails & Beeds given them but with these they were not satisfied, thinking they had a right to every thing in the boat, and at last grew so troublesome that in order to get clear of them our people were obliged to fire some musquets, but with no intent to hurt any of them, however it so happen'd that one man was slitely slightly wounded in the head, the fireing had the desired effect and they thought fit to retire; after this as the boat lay near the shore some of them waded off to her and brought with them some trifles which they parted with for small nails &Ca they seem'd desireous that our people should land, but this was look'd upon as a peice of policey in them to get the whole Boats crew in their power, however, this was not attempted as I had given orders to run no risk. The bay they went into which lies on ye [W] side of the Id had in it 25 fathom water but the Bottom was very foul and rocky- We had now made the circuit of the Island / which did not appear to appear to the be[s]t advantage / and found that there was neither a Harbour or safe Anchorage about it, and therefore I thought the landing upon it would be attend[ed] with no advantage either to our selves or any future navigators and from the hostile and thievish disposission of the natives it appear'd to that we could have no friendly intercourse with them untill they had felt the smart of our fire arms a thing that would have been very unjustifiable in me at this time, we therefore hoisted in the boat and made sail to the southward 
        This Island is situated in the Latitude of 22°.. 27' So and in the Longitude of 150°.. 47' West from the Meridian of Greenwh. it is 13 miles in circuit and tollerable high, it appears to be neither populous nor firtile, its produce seem'd to be nearly the same as the other Islands we have touched at and likewise the Stature, Colour Habits and Arms of the Natives, only that some of them wore peices of Cloath like broad belts different both in shape and Colour to any thing to any thing of the kind we had seen before, and their arms and in general every thing they had about them much neater made and shew'd great proofs of an ingenious fancy 
        Tobia Tupia says that their are several Islands laying at different directions from this, that is from the south to the west and N.W and that 3 days sail to the NE is an Island called Mannua that is Bird Island and that it lies four days sail from Ulietea which is one day less then from Ulietea to Ohetiroa from this account I shall be able to find the situation of Mannua pretty well. Sence we have left Ulietea Tobia Tupia hath been very disireous for us to steer to the westward and tells us if we will but go that way we shall meet with plenty of Islands   the most of them he himself hath been at and from the description he gives of two of them they must be those discover'd by Captain Wallice and by him call'd Boscawen and Kepple Islands, and these do not lay less than 400 Leagues to the westward of Ulietea; he says that they are 10 or 12 days in going thither and 30 or more in coming back and that their Paheas, that is their large Proes sails much faster than this Ship; All this I beleive to be true and therefore they may with ease sail 40 Leagues a day or more 
        The farthest Island to the southward that Tobia Tupia hath been at or knows anything of lies but two days sail from Ohetiroa and is called Moutou but he says that his Father once told him that their were Islands to the southward of it, but we can not find that he either knows or ever heard of a Continent or large track of land. I have no reason to doubt Tobia's Tupia['s] information of these Islands, for when we left Ulietea and steer'd to the southward, he told us that if we would keep a little more to the East / which the wind would not permit us to do / we should see Mannua, but as we then steer'd we should see Ohetiroa which happend accordingly. If we meet with the Islands to the southward he speaks off it well   if not I shall spend no more time searching for them.   being now fully resolved to Stand directly to the Southward in search of the Continent 

To day we took up a small peice of stick but to all appearences it had been a long time at sea 

By noon we fetched in with the SW point, but not being able to weather it we tacked and stood off. We saw in the Bay several Canoes, People upon the shore and some houses in the country. The land on the Sea-Coast is high with steep clifts and back inland are very high mountains   the face of the Country is of a hilly surface and appeares to be cloathed with wood and Verdure 
            
      

        9  October 1769
        Monday 9th Gentle breezes and clear weather. PM stood into the Bay and anchored on the NE side before the entrance of a small river in 10 fathom water a fine sandy bottom; the NE point of the Bay bore EBS1/2S and the SW point south.  distant from the shore half a League. After this I went a shore with a party of men in the Pinnace and yawl accompaned by Mr Banks and Dr Solander. We land[ed] abreast of the Ship and on the east side of the river just mentioned.   but seeing some of the natives on the other side of the river whome I was desirous of speaking with and finding that we could not ford the river I order'd the yawl in to carry us over and the Pinnace to lay at the entrance,   In the mean time the Indians made off; however we went as far as their hutts which lay about 2 or 3 hundred yards from the water side leaving four boys to take care of the yawl, which we had no sooner left than four men came out of the woods on the other side the river and would certainly have cut her off the yawl had not the people in the pinnace discover'd them and called to her to drop down the stream which they did being closely pursued by the Indians; the Coxswain of the pinnace who had the charge of the Boats, seeing this fire'd two musquets over their heads, the first made them stop and look round them, but the 2d they took no notice off upon which a third was fired and killed one of them upon the spot just as he was going to dart his spear at the boat; at this the other three stood motionless for a minute or two, seemingly quite surprised wondering no doubt what it was that had thus killed their commorade: but as soon as they recover'd themselves they made off draging the dead body a little way and then left it. upon our hearing the report of the Musquets we immidiatly repair'd to the boats and after viewing the dead body we return'd on board. In the morning seeing a number of the natives at the same place where we saw them last night, I went a shore with the boats, man'd and arm'd and landed on the opposite side of the river; Mr Banks, Dr Solander, and my self at first only landed and went to the side of the river, the natives being got together on the opposite side. We call'd to them in the Georges Island Language, but they answered us by florishing their Weapons over their heads and danceing, as we suppos'd the war dance; upon this we retired untill the marines were landed which I order'd to be drawn up about 200 yards behind us. We went again to the river side having Tobiaupia, Mr Green, and Dr Munkhouse along with us. Tobiaupia spoke to them in his own language and it was an [a]greeable surprise to us to find that theywhich they perfectly understood him. after some little conversation had pass'd one of them swam'd over to us and after him 20 or 30 more, these last brought their arms with them which the first man did not, we made them every one presents but this did not satisfy them they wanted everything we had about us particularly our arms, and made several attempts to snatch them out of our hands. Tobiaupia told us several times as soon as they came over to take care of our selves for they were not our friends and this we very soon found for one of them snatched Mr Greens Hanger from him and would not give it up, this incourage'd the rest to be more insolent and seeing others comeing over to join them   I order'd the man who had taken the hanger to be fired at: which was accordingly done and he was wounded in such a manner that he died soon after; upon the first fire, which was only two musquets, the others retir'd to a rock which lay nearly in the middle of the river, but on seeing the man fall they return'd probably to carry him off or his arms the last of which they accomplished and this we could not prevent unless we had run our Bayonets into them for upon their returning from off the rock we had discharg'd of our peices which was were load with small shott and woundd three more. but these got over the river and were carried off by the others who now thought proper to retire 
        Finding that nothing was to be done with the people on this side and the water in the river being salt I embarked with an intent to row round the head of the Bay in search of fresh water; and if possible to surprise some of the natives and to take them on board and by good treatment and presents endeavour to gain their friendship; with this View on 
            
      

        10  October 1769
        Monday [Tuesday] 10thPM I rowed round the head of the Bay but could find no place to land, on account of the great surff which beat every where upon the shore; seeing two boats or Canoes coming in from Sea, I rowed to one of them in order to seize upon the people, and came so near before they took notice of us that Tobiaupia called to them to come along side and we would not hurt them, but instead of doingthat this they endeavoured to get away, upon which I order'd a Musquet to be fire'd over their heads thinking this would either make them surrender or jump over board   but here I was misstaken for they immediately took to thier arms and orand whatever they had in the boat and began to attack us, this obliged us to fire upon them.  and unfortunatly either two or three was were kill'd, and one wounded, and three jumped over board, these last we took up and brought on board, where they were clothed and treated with all immaginable kindness    and to the surprise of every body became at once as cheerful and as merry as if they had been with their own friends; they were all three young, the eldest not above 20 years of age and the youngest about 10 or 12 
        I am aware that most humane men who have not experienced things of this nature will cencure my conduct in fireing upon the people in this boat nor do I my self think that the reason I had for seizing upon her will att all justify me.   and had I thought that they would have made the least resistance I would not have come near them   but as they did I was not to stand still and suffer either my self or those that were with me to be knocked on the head.
        In the morning, as I intended to, put our three prisioners a shore and stay here the day to see what effect it might have upon the other natives; I sent an Officer aShore with the marines and a party of men to cut wood and soon after followed my self accompaned by Mr Banks Dr Soland[er] and Tobiaupia, takeing the three natives with us whome we landed on the west side of the river before mentioned; they were very unwilling to leave us pretending that they should fall into the hands of their enimies who would kill and eat them; however they at last of their own accords left us and hid themselves in some bushes. Soon after this we discover'd several bodies of the Natives marching towards us, upon which we retire'd a Cross the River and join'd the wooders and with us came the three natives we had just parted with, for we could not prevail upon them to go to their own people. We had no sooner got over the river than the others assembled on the other side to the number of 150 or 200 all arm'd. Tobia Tupia now began to parly with them and the three we had with us shew'd their every thing we had given them part of which they laid and left upon the body of the man that was killed the day before; these things seem'd t so far to convince them of our friendly intentions that one man came over to us while all the others sat down upon the sand: we every one made this man a present and the three natives that were with us likewise presented him with such things as they had got from us   with which, after a short stay he retired a cross the river. I now thought proper to take every body on board to prevent any more quarrels and with us came the [three] whome we could not prevail upon to stay behind and this appear'd the more strange as the Man who came over to us was uncle to one of them.   after we had return'd on board we saw them carry off the dead man but the one that was kill'd the first evening we landed remaind in the very spot they had left him 
            
      

        11 October 1769
        Wednesday 11th In the PM as I intended to sail in the morning we put the three youths a shore seemingly very much againest their inclination.   but whether this was owing to a desire they had to remain with us or the fear of falling into the hands of their eminies as they pretended I know not.   the latter however seem'd to be ill founded for we saw them carried aCross the river in a Catamaran and walk leasurely off with the other natives 
        At 6 AM we weigh'd and stood out of the Bay which I have named Poverty Bay because it afforded us no one thing we wanted / Latde 38°..42' S. Longde 181°..36' Wt / it is in the form of a Horse shoe and is known by an Isld lying close und[er] the NE point the two points which forms the entrance are high with steep white clifts and lay a league and a half or two leagues from each other NEBE and SWBW.  The depth of water in this Bay is from 12 to 6 and 5 fathoms a sandy bottom and good anchorage but you lay open to the winds between the South and East. Boats can go in and out of the river above mentioned at any time of tide in fine weather but as there is a bar at the entrance on which the sea some times runs so high that no boat can get either in [or] out which happen'd while we lay here     however I beleive that boats can generaly land on the NE side of the river     The shore of this bay from a little within each entrance is a low flat sand but this is only a narrow slip for the face of the Country appears with a variety of hills and vallies all cloathed with woods and Verdure and to all appearence well inhabeted especialy in the Vallies leading up from the bay where we dayly saw smooks at a great distance in land, and far back in the Country are very high mountains. At Noon the SW Point of Poverty Bay / which I have named Young Nicks head after the Boy who first saw this land / bore NBW distant 3 or 4 Leagues, being at this time a bout 3 Miles from the shore and had 25 fathom.   the Main land extending from NEBN to South. the southern xetremity seem'd to end in a point beind which we had seen no land My intention is to fowlow the direction of the Coast to the Southward as far as the Latitude of 40° or 41° and then to return to the northward in case we meet with nothing to incourage us to proceed farther 
            
      

        12 October 1769
        Thursday 12th Gentle breezes at NW and north with frequent calms. In the afternoon while we lay becalm'd several  canoes came off to the Ship but kept at a distance untill one who appear'd to come from a different part came off and put  along side at once and after him her all the rest.    the people in this boat had heard of the treatment those had met with we had had on board before and therefore came on board without hesitation.    they were all kindly treated and very soon enter'd into a traffick with our people for George Island Cloth &Ca giving in exchange their paddles / having little else to dispose of / and hardly left themselves a Sufficient number to paddle a shore nay the People in one Canoe after disposing of the Paddles offer'd to sell the Canoe   after a stay of about two hours they went away. but by some means or a nother three was were left on board and not one boat would put back to take them in and what was more surprising those on board did not seem at all uneasy with their situation    In the evening a light breeze springing up at NW we steer'd along shore under an easy sail untill midnight, then brought too   soon after it fell calm and continued so untill 8 oClock AM when a breeze sprung up at north with which we stood along shore SSW. At and after sun rise found the Variation to be 14°..46' East.   about this time two Canoes came off to the ship one of which was prevaild upon to come a long side to take in the three people we had had on board all night who now seem'd glad of the oppertunity to get a shore; as the people in the Canoe were a little shy at first it was observed that one arguement those on board made use on to intice the others along side, was in telling them that we did not eat men, from which it should seem that these people have such a Custom among them  At the time we made we sail we was were a breast of the point of land set yesterday at Noon from which the land trends SSW.   this point I have named cape Table on account of its shape and figure it lies 7 Leagues to the Southward of Poverty Bay in the Latitude of 39°..7' St Longde 181°..36'   it is of a moderate height makes in a sharp angle and appears to be quite flat at top. In steering along shore to the southward of the Cape at the distance of two or three miles off our soundings was were from 20 to 30 fathm having a chain of rocks that appear'd at different heights above water laying between us & the shore-  At Noon Cape Table bore N 20° East distant 4 Leagues and a small Island / being the Southermost land in sight / bore South 70° Wt distant 3 miles; this Island I have named Isle of Portland on account of its very great resemblance to Portland in the English Channell   it lies a bout a mile from a point on the main but there appears to be a ledge of rocks extending nearly if not quite a Cross from the one to the other- N 57° Et 2 Miles from the South point of Portland lies a sunken rock whereon the Sea breaks. We pass'd between this rock and the land having 17, 18 and 20 fathom water 
        We saw several a great number of the Natives assembled together on the Isle of Portland, we likewise saw some on the Main land and several places that were cultivated and laid out in square plantations 
            
      

        13 October 1769
        Friday 13th At 1 PM we discoverd land behind or to the Westward of Portland extending to the Southward as far as we could see. In hauling round the south end of Portland we fell into shoal water and broken ground which we however soon got clear of: at this time four Canoes came off to us full of people and kept for sometime under our stern threating of us all the while.  as I did not know but what I might be obliged to send our Boats a head to sound I thought these gentry would be as well out of the way   I order'd a musquet shott to be fired close to one of them, but this they took no notice of.   a four pounder was then fired a little wide of them.   at this they began to shake thier spears and Paddles at us, but notwithstanding this they thought fit to retire 
        Having got round Portland we hauled in for the Land NW having a gentle breeze at NE which died away at 5 oClock and obliged us to anchor in 21 fathom water a fine sandy bottom   the South point of Portland bore SE1/2S distant about 2 Leagues and a low point on the Main bore N1/2E     in this last direction there runs in a de[e]p bay behind the Land on which is Table Cape which makes this Land a peninsula joind to the Main by a low narrow neck of land.   the Cape is the North point of the peninsula and Portland the South-    while we lay at anchor two boats came off to us and so near as to take up some things we throw'd them out of the Ship but would not come a long side.   At 5 AM a breeze springing northerly we weigh'd and steer'd in for the land. The shore here forms a very large Bay of which Portland is the NE point and the bay above mentioned is an arm of it. I would gladly have examined this arm because there appear'd to be safe Anchorage in it but as I was not certain of this and the wind being right on end I did not care to spend time in turning up to it      At noon Portland bore So40° 50° East distant Leagues and the southermost land in sight bore SSW distant 10 or 12 Leagues, being about three miles from the shore and in this situation had 12 fathom water - 24 fathom have been the most water we have met with sence we have been within Portland, every where clear ground 
        The land near the shore is of a moderate height with white clifts and sandy beaches - inland are several pretty high mountains and the whole face of the country appears with a very hilly surface and for the most part covered with wood and hath all the appearences of a very pleasent and fertile country 
            
      

        14 October 1769
        Saturday 14thP.M. had gentle breezes between the NE and NW. Kept runing down along shore at the distance of two or 3 Miles off     our sounding was from 20 to 13 fathom an even sandy bottom. We saw some canoes or boats in shore and several houses upon the land, but no harbour or convenient watering place.    the main thing we were looking for. In the night had little wind and sometimes Calm with dirty rainy weather. AM had Variable light airs next to a Calm and fair weather. In the Morning being not above two Leagues from the SW. Cod of the great Bay we have been in for these 2 days past, the Pinnace and Long boat were hoisted out in order to search for fresh water; but just as they were ready to put off we observe'd several Boats full of People coming coming off from the shore and for that reason I did not think it prudent to send our own from the Ship; the first that came were five in number in that was them were between 80 and 90 Men.  every method was tried to gain their friend Ship and several things were thrown over board to them, but all we could do was to no purpose neither would they accept of any one thing from us but seem'd fully bent on attacking us    in order to prevent this and our being obliged to fire upon them. I order'd a 4 pounder load with Grape to be fire'd a little wide of them, leting them know at the same time by means of Tobia Tupia what we was were going to do, this had the desired effect and not one of these would afterwards trust themselves abreast of the Ship. soon after four more came off. one of these put what arms they had into a nother boat and then came along side so near as to take what things we gave them, and I believe might have been prevail'd upon to come on board had not some of the first 5 come up under our stern and begun again to t[h]reaten us at which the people in this one boat seem'd displeased    emmediatly after this they all went a Shore.
        At Noon Lat. In per Observation 39°..37' St Portland bore by our run from it EBN Dist. 14 Leagues, the southermost land in sight and which is the south point of the BaySEBS. distant 4 or 5 Leagues, and a bluff head lying in the S.W. Cod of the Bay, SBW. 2 or 3 Miles.   on each side of this bluf head is a low narrow sandy or stone beach, between these beaches and the main land is a pretty large lake of salt water as I suppose; on the SE side of this head is a very Large Flat, which seems to extend a good way in land to the westward, on this flat are several Groves of Streight, tall trees; but there seems to be a great probability that the lake above mention'd extends it self a good way into this flat country. Inland are a chain of pretty high mountains extending N. and St on the sumets and sides of these mountains are were many patches of snow, but between them and the Sea the Land is Cloathed with Wood 

Stood over for the Southermost land or South point of the Bay, having a light breeze at NE, our soundings from 12 to 8 fathom; not reaching this point before dark, we stood off an[d] on all night, having Variable Light airs next to a calm.    depth of water from 8 to 7 fathom- Variation 14°..10 Et At 8 AM being a breast of the SW Point of the Bay, some fishing boats came off to us and sold us some stinking fish, however it was such as the[y] had and we was were glad to enter into traffick with them upon any terms.    these people behaved at first very well untill a large arm'd canoe boat wherein was were 22 Men, came along side, We soon saw that this boat had nothing for traffic, yet as they came boldly along side we gave them two or three peices of Cloth, articles they seem'd the most fond off; one man in this boat had on him a black skin something like a bear skin which I was desireous of having that I might be a better judge what sort of an Animal the first owner was. I offer'd him for it a peice of Red Cloth which he seem'd to jump at by emmidiatly puting of the Skin and holding it up to us, but would not part with it untill he had the Cloth in his possession, and after that not atall but put of the boat and went away and with them all the rest but in a very short time they return'd again and one of the fishing boat came along side and offer'd us some more fish, the Indian Boy Tiata, Tobia Tupia's servant being over the side, they seized hold of him, pulld him into the boat and endeavourd to carry him off, this obliged us to fire upon them which gave the Boy an oppertunity to jump over board and we brought the Ship too, lower'd a boat into the Water and took him up unhurt Two or Three paid for this daring attempt with the loss of their lives and many more would have suffered had it been for fear of killing the boy. This affair occation'd my giveing this point of Land the name of Cape Kidnappers: it is remarkable on account of two white rocks in form of Hay Stacks Standing very near it: on each side of the Cape are tollerable high white steep clifts. Latd 39°..43' St, Longd. 182°..24' Wt It lies South W B 60° West distant 12 13 Leagues from the Isle of Portland, between them is a large Bay wherein we have been for these 3 Days past    this Bay I have name'd Hawke's Bay, in Honour of Sr Edward first Lord of the Admiralty. we found in it from 24 to 8 and 7 fathom every where good Anchoring
        From Cape Kidnappers the Island trends SSW, and in this direction we run along shore keeping about a League off, having a steady breeze and clear weather    At Noon the above Cape bore from us No 9° Et distant 2 Leagues and the Southermost land in sight So 25° West Latitude in per Observation 39°..50' South.
            
      

        16 October 1769
        Monday October 16th  First and latter part fresh breezes Northerly, in the night  Variable and sometimes calm. At 2 PM past  by a small, but a pretty high white Island lying close to the Shore, on this  Island we saw a good ma[n]y houses, Boats and some people, we concluded that  they must be fishers because the Island was quite barren. We like wise saw several  people upon the Shore in a small Bay on the Main within the Island. At 7 the  Southermost land in sight bore SWBS and Cape  Kidnappers N3/4E distant 8 Leagues being  then about 2 Leagues from the Shore and had 55 fathom water. At 11 brought too  untill day light then made sail along shore to the Southward; at 7 past a pretty  high point of Land which lies SSW 12 Leagues  from Cape Kidnappers, from this point the land trends 3/4 of a point more  to the Westward - At 10 saw more land oppen to the Southward at SWBS- At Noon  the Southermost land in sight bore S. 39° West distant. 8 or 10 Leagues,  and a high bluff head with yellowish clifts bore west distant 2 Miles, Latd  observe'd 40°..34' South, depth of water 32 fm.
            
      

        17 October 1769
        Tuesday 17thPM Winds at West a fresh breeze in the night    Variable light Airs and Calm, AM a gentle breeze between the NW and NE. Seeing no likelyhood of meeting with a harbour and the face of the Country Vissibly altering for the worse I thought that the standing farther to the South would not be attended with any Valuable discovery, but would be loosing of time which might be better employ'd and with a greater probabillity of Success in examining the Coast to the Northward    with this View at 1 PM we tacked and stood to the Southward Northward having the wind at west a fresh breeze, at this time we could see the land extending SWBS at least 10 or 12 Leagues 
        The Bluff head or high point of land we were abreast off yesterday at noon, I have calld Cape Turn again because here we returnd, it lies in the Latitude of 40°..34' So Longitude 182°..56' West and 18 Leagues SSW and SSW1/2W from Cape Kidnappers.   the land between them is of a very unequal height in some places it is high with White Clift[s] next the Sea, in others low with sandy beaches. The face of the Country is not nearly so well clothed with wood as it is about Hawkes Bay but for the most part looks like our high Downs in England, and to all appearences well inhabited, for we saw several Villages as we run along shore not only in the Vallies but on the Tops and Sides of the Hills, and smooks in other places. The ridge of Mountains before-mentioned extends to the Southward farther than we could see and are every where checquer'd with snow 
        This night saw 2 Large fires up in the inland Country, a sure sign that it must be inhabited. At Noon Cape Kidnappers bore No 56° West distant 7 Leagues. Latd. Obd. 39° 52' S.
            
      

        18 October 1769
        Wednesday 18th Variable light Wind and fine Weather. At 4 AM Cape Kidnappers bore No 32° West distant 2 Leagues, in this situation had 62 fm water, and when the said Cape bore WBN distant 3 or 4 Leagues had 45 fathom: Midway between the Isle of Portland and Cape Kidnappers had 65 fathom At Noon the Isle of Portland bore NE1/2E distant 4 Leagues- Latitude Observ'd 39°..34' So.
            
      

        19 October 1769
        Thursday, 19th The first part had gentle breezes at East and ENE. In the night fresh gales between the South and SW, dark Clowdy weather, with Lightning and rain. At 1/2 past 5 PM Tacked, and stood to the SE. the Isle of Portland bore SE distt 3 Leags Soon after we tacked a boat or Canoe came off from the Shore wherein was were five people,   they came on board without shewing the least sign of fear and insisted upon staying with us the whole night for indeed there was no geting them away without turning them out of the ship by force and that I did not care to do.    but to prevent them playing us any tricks I hoisted thier Canoe up along side: two appear'd to be chiefs, and the other three their servants, one of the chiefs appear'd seem'd to be of a free open and gentle disposission.   they both took great notice of every thing they saw and was very thankfull for what was given them; the two chiefs would neither eat nor drink with us, but the other three eat whatever was offer'd them. Notwithstanding that these people had heard of the treatment the others had met with who had been on board before. yet it appear'd a little strange that they should place so much confidence in us as to put themselves wholy in our power wether we would or no, especially as the others we had meet with in this Bay had upon every occation beheaved in a quite a different manner  At 11 brought too untill daylight / the night being dark and rainy / then made sail, at 7 AM brought too under Cape Table and set away the Indian Canoe; at this time some others were puting off from the shore, but we did not wait their coming but made sail to the Northward - At Noon the northermost land in sight No 20° Et, and Young Nicks head or the South point of Poverty Bay, West northerly near 4 Leags Lat. Observ'd 38°..44' 30' South 
            
      

        20 October 1769
        Friday, 20thP.M. a fresh breeze at SSW, in the night Variable light breezes with rain   AM, a fresh breeze at SW. At 3 PM pass'd by a remarkable head Land which I call'd Gable-end Foreland on account of the very great reseblence the white clift at the very point hath to the Gable end of a house    it is made still more remarkable by a spire'd rock standing a little distance from the point it. t This head land land lies from Cape Table Ea N 24° East distant 12 Leagues   between them the Shore forms a Bay wherein lies Poverty Bay, 4 Leagues from the former and 8 Leagues from the Latter. From Gable end Forland  the land trends NBE as far as we could see: the land betwe from Poverty Bay to this place is of a moderate but very unequal height distinguished by hills and Vallies that are cover'd with woods: we saw as we run along shore several Villages cultivated lands and some of the Natives, in the evening some Canoes came off to the Ship and one man came on board to whom we gave a few triffles and then sent him away. Stood off and on untill day light then made sail in shore in order to look into two Bays that appear'd to our View about 2 Leagues to the northward of the Foreland    the southermost we could not fetch, but in the other we anchor'd about 11 oClock in 7 fathom water a black sandy bottom; the North point bore NE1/2N distant 2 Miles and the So point SEBE distt 1 Mile and about 3/4 of a Mile from the Shore. This Bay is not so much shilterd from the sea as I at first thought it was. but as the Natives many of whom have came about us in their canoes, appear'd to be of a friendly disposission I am was willing to try if we can could not get a little water on board, and to see a little into the nature of the Country before we proceed'd farther to the northward 
            
      

        21 October 1769
        Saturday, 21st We had no sooner come to an Anchor as mentioned above, than preceiving 2 old men in the Canoes, who from their garbe appear'd to be chiefs. these I invited on board and they came without hesitation. to each I gave about 4 yards of Linnen and a Spike nail   the linnen they were very fond of, but the Nails they seem'd to set no Value upon. Tobiaupia explained to them the reasons of our comeing here and that we should neither hurt nor molest them if they did but behave in the same peaceable manner to us, and it is likely that they will keep their word a indeed we were under very little apprehension but what they would as they had heard of what hapned in Poverty Bay 
        Between 1 and 2 PM I put off with the Boats man'd and Arm'd in order to land to look for fresh water, having these 2 Men along with us, but, the surf runing very high and it begun to blow and rain at the same time I return'd back to the Ship having first put the 2 Chiefs into one of their Canoes. In the Evening it fell Moderate and we landed and found 2 small streams of fresh water and the natives to all appearences very friendly and peaceable and therefore I intend to stay here tomorrow on which account I resolved to stay one day at least to fill a little water and to give Mr Banks an oppertunity to Collect a little of the produce of the Country. In the Morning Lieutt Gore went ashore to superintend the watering with a strong party of men, but the geting the Casks off was so very difficult on account of the Sarff, that it was noon before one turn came on board 
            
      

        22 October 1769
        Sunday 22ndP.M. light breezes and Clowdy   About or a little after noon several of the natives came off to the Ship in their Canoes and began to traffic with us, our people giving them Georges Island Cloth for theirs, for they had little else to dispose of.   this kind of exchange they seemd at first very fond of and prefer'd the Cloth we had got at the Islands to English Cloth, but it fell in its Value above 500 per cent before night. I had some of them on board and shewed them the Ship with which they were well pleased 
        The same friendly disposission was observe'd by those on Shore and upon the whole they behaved as well or better than one could expect, But as the geting the Water from the shore proved so very tedious on account of the surf, preparing I resolved upon leaving this place in the morning and Accordingly at 5 AM. we weigh'd and put to Sea - This Bay is called by the Natives Tegadoo    it lies in the Latitude of 38°..16' but as it hath nothing to recommend it so I shall give no discription of it. there is plenty of wild sellery and we purchased of the natives 10 or 15 pounds of sweet Potatous    they have pretty large plantations of these.   but at present they are scarce it being too early in the season 
        At Noon, the Bay of Tegadoo bore W1/2 S distant 8 Leagues and a very high doubled peek'd Mountain some distance in land bore NWBW. Latd Observ'd 38°.13' - Winds at North a fresh gale 
            
      

        23 October 1769
        Monday 23rdPM fresh gales at North and Clowdy Weather    At 1 Tacked and stood in shore, at 6 sounded and had 56 fath. a fine sandy bottom, the Bay of Tegadoo bore SW1/2W distance 4 Leagues - At 8 Tacked in 36 fathom being then about two Leagues from land. Stood off and on all night having gentle breezes. At 8 AM being right before the Bay of Tegadoo and about a League from it, some of the Natives came off to us, these and inform'd us that in a Bay a little to the southward / being the same that we could not fetch the day we put into Tegadoo / was fresh water and easey geting at it - and as the wind was now against us and we got nothing by beating to windward, I thought the time would be better spent in this Bay in geting on board a little water and forming some connections with the natives than by keeping the sea With this View we bore up for it and sent two Boats in Man'd and Arm'd to examine the watering place who returnd about noon and conform'd the accot the Natives had given. We then anchord in 11 fathom water a fine sandy bottom - the North point of the Bay NBE and the south point SE      and the watering place which was in a small Cove a little within the South pt of the bay SBE distant 1 Le Mile 
            
      

        24 October 1769
        Tuesday, 24th Winds Westerly and fine weather. This afternoon, as soon as the Ship was moor'd, I went ashore to examine the Watering place, accompan'd by Mr Banks and Dr Solander. I found the water good and the place the pretty convenient, and plenty of Wood close to high water mark and the natives to all appearence not only very friendly, but ready to traffic with us for what little they had. Early in the Morning I sent Lieutenant Gore a Shore to superintend the Cuting Wood and filling of Water with a Sufficient number of men for both purposes and all the Marines as a guard,   after breakfast I went on shore my self and remain'd there the whole day, but before this Mr Green and I took several observations of the Sun and Moon, the mean result of them gave 180°..47' West Longd from the Meridian of Greenwich but as all the obserns made before exceeded these I have laid down this coast agreeable to the mean of the whole -  At noon I took the Suns Meridian Altd with the Astrol Quadt and found the Latitude to be 38°..22'..24" So
            
      

        25 October 1769
        Wednesday, 25th Winds and weather as yesterday. PM set up the Armourer's Forge to repair the Tiller braces they being broke; by night we had got on board 12 Ton of water and two or 3 boat loads of wood, and this I looked upon to be a good days work  the natives gave us not the least disturbance, but brought us now and then different sorts of fish, both to the Ship and watering place which we purchased of them with Cloth beeds &Ca 
            
      

        26 October 1769
        Octr Thursday. 26thPM had the winds from between the South and S.W. fair weather - the remainder rainy dirty weather, notwithstanding we continued geting on board Wood and Water 
            
      

        27 October 1769
        Friday, 27th Winds at S.W. first part rainy weather the remainder fair. AM sent the Pinnace to dridge but she met with no success, after this I went and soundd the Bay. I made a shift to land in two places, the first time in the bottom of the Bay where I went a little way into the Country but met with nothing extraordinaory the other place I landed at was at the north point of the Bay where I got as much Sellery and Scurvy grass as loaded the Boat. This day we compleated our water to 70 Tons, but not wood enough
            
      

        28 October 1769
        Saturday 28th Gentle breezes southerly and fine weather. Employ'd Wooding, cuting, of Broom stuff and maing of Brooms, there being a shrub here very fit for that purpose: and as I intendd to sail tomorrow in the morning some hands were employ'd picking of Sellery to take to sea with us, this is found here in great plenty and I have caused it to be boild with Portable Soup and Oatmeal every morning for the Peoples breakfast, and this I design to continue as long as it will last or any is to be got  because I look upon it to be very wholesome and a great Antiscorbutick.
            
      

        29 October 1769
        Sunday, 29thPM Gentle breezes at N.E with Thunder and Lightning up in the Country, in the night had light airs off the land and very Foggy: in the forenoon had a gentle breeze at NNE and Clear wear. At 4 AM Unmoor'd, and at 6 weigh'd and put to sea - At Noon the Bay saild from bore North 63° W: distant 4 Leagues -
        This bay is called by the Natives Tolaga. it is moderatly large and hath in it from 13 to 8 and 7 fathom a Clean sandy bottom and good Anchorage and is shelterd from all winds except those that blow from the NE quarter. It lies in the Latitude of 38°.22' So and 41/2 Leagues to the northward of Gable end Foreland     off the South point lies a small, but high Island so close near to the main as not to be distinguished from it the mainit close to the north end of this Island at the entrance into the Bay are two high rocks, the one is high and round like a corn stack but the other is long with holes thro' it like the arches of a bridge Within these rocks is the Cove where we cut wood and fill'd our water; off the north point of the Bay is a pretty high rocky Island and about a mile without it are some rocks and breakers. The Variation of the Compass is here 14°.31' East and the Tide flows at full and change of the Moon about 6 oClock and rises and falls upon a perpendicular 5 or 6 feet.   but wither the flood comes from the Southward or northward I have not been able to determine 
        During our stay in this Bay we had every day more or less trafffic with the Natives, they bringing us fish and now and then a few sweet Potatoes, and several trifles which we deem'd curiosities for these we gave them cloth, Beeds nails &Ca The Cloth we got at King Georges Island and Uliatea they Valued more than any thing we could give them and as every one in the Ship was were provided with some of this sort of Cloth.   I suffer'd every body to purchase what ever they pleased without limitation, for by this means I know'd knew that the natives would not only sell, but get a good price for every thing they brought.   this I thought would induce them to bring to market what ever the Country afforded and I have great reason to think that they did    yet it amounted to no more than what is above mention'd. We saw no four footed Animals either tame or wild or signs of any except Dogs and Ratts and these were very scarce especialy the latter the flesh of the former they eat and ornament their clothing with their skins as we do ours with furs &c. While we lay here I went upon some of the Hills in order to view the Country, but when I came there I could see but very little of it the sight being interrupted by still higher hills    the tops and ridges of the hills are for the most part barren, at least little grows on them - but fern. But the Vallies and sides of many of the Hills were luxuriously clothed with Woods and Verdure and little Plantations of the Natives lying dispers'd up and down the Country 
        We found in the woods Trees of above 20 different sorts specimens of each I took on board as all of them were unknown to any of us: the tree which we cut for fireing was something like Maple and yielded a whitish Gum,   there was another sort of a deep yallow which we imagined might prove usefull in dying - We likewise found one Cabbage tree which we cut down for the sake of the Cabbage. The Country abounds with a great number of Plants and the woods with as great a Variety of very beautifull Birds.  many of them unknown to us  The soil both of the hills and Vallies is light and sandy and very proper for produceing all kinds of Roots but we saw only sweet Potatous and Yamms among them - these they plant in little round hills, and have plantations of them containing several Acres neatly laid out and kept in good order and many of them are fence'd in with low pailing which can only serve for ornament.
            
      

        30 October 1769
        Monday 30thPM Little Wind and clowdy weather. At 1 Tack'd and stood in shore. At 7 oClock Tolaga Bay bore West North West distant one League    Tacked and lay her head off; had it Calm, untill 2 AM When a breeze sprung up at SW and we made sail to the northward - At 6 Gable end Foreland bore SSW and Tolaga bay SSW1/4W distance 3 Leagues - At 8 being about 2 Miles from the shore some Canoes that were out fishing came after the Ship, but we having a fresh of wind they could not come up with us and I did not chuse to wait for them - At Noon latitude pr observation 37°. 49' So a small Island lying off the Northernmost land in sight bore N 16° E distant 4 Miles. Course from Tolaga bay NBE1/2E distant 13 Leagues.    the Land from thence is is of a moderate but unequal height forming several small Bays wherein are sandy beaches. Hazey Clowdy weather prevented us from seeing much of the inland land country but near the Shore we could see several Villages and Plantations of the Natives  Soundings from 20 to 30 fathm
            
      

        31 October 1769
        Tuesday, 31st At half past one PM hauled round the Island above mentioned which lies East one mile from the NE Point of the land, the land from hence trends NWBW and WNW as far as we could see. This point of land I have called Cape East East Cape because I have great reason to think that it is the Eastermost land on this whole coast, and for the same reason I have called the Island which lays of[f] it East Island, it is but of a small circuit high and round and appears white and barren. The Cape is of a moderate height with white Clifts, and lies in the Latitude of 37°..42'..30" South and Longitude 181° 00' West from the Meridion of Greenwich 
        After we had rounded the East Cape we saw as we run along shore a great number of Villages and a great deal of Cultivated land and in general the Country appeard with more fertility that than what we had seen before, it was low near the sea but hilly inland. At 8 being 8 Leagues to the Westward of Cape East and 3 or 4 Miles from the shore shortend sail and brought too for the night having at this time a fresh gale atSSE and squally weather; but it soon fell Moderate and At 2 A.M. made sail again to the SW as the land now trended - At 8 saw land which made like an Island bearing west   at the same time the SWestermost part of the Main land bore SW. 
        At 9 Five Canoes came off to us, in one of which was were upwards of 40 Men all Arm'd with Pikes &Ca - from this and other circumstances it fully appear'd that they came with no friendly intention, and I at this Time being very busey and had no inclination to stay upon deck to watch their motions, I order'd a grape shot to be fired a little wide of them. This made them pull off a little and then they got together either to consult what to do or to look about them    upon this I order'd a fire round shot to be fired over their heads which frightend them to that degree that I believe they did not think them selves safe untill they got a shore,   this occasion'd our calling the point of land off which this Happen'd Cape Runaway / Latde 37°..32' Longde 181°..50 / and 17 or 18 Leagues to the westward of East Cape 
        Four Leagues to the westward of the East Cape is a Bay which I have named Hicks's Bay because Lieutenant Hicks was the first who discover'd it 
            
      

        1 November 1769
        Wednesday 1st November P.M. As we stood along shore, / having little wind and Variable / we saw a great deal of Cultivated land laid out in regular inclosures a sure sign that the Country is both fertile and well inhabited,   some Canoes came off from the Shore but would not come near the Ship. At 8 brought too 3 Miles from the shore   the Land seen yesterday bearing West and which we now saw was an Island bore SW. distant 8 Leagues I have named it white Island because as such it always appear'd to us 
        At 5 AM made sail along shore to the SW. having little wind at ESE and Clowdy weather. At 8 saw between 40 and 50 Canoes in shore several of them came off to the Ship and being about us some time they venterd along side and sold us some Lobsters Mussels and two Conger ells - After these were gone some others came off from a nother place with mussels only and but few of these they thought proper to part with, thinking that they had a right to every thing we handed them into their boats without makeing any return - At last the people in one Canoe took away some linnen that was towing over the side which they would not return for all that we could say to them. upon this I fire'd a Musquet ball thro' the boat, and after that a nother musquet load with with small shott.  neither of which they minded, only pull'd off a little and then shook their paddles at us, at which I fir'd a third musquet and the ball striking the water pretty near them, they immidiatly apply'd their paddles to a nother use.   but after they thought themselves out of reach they got all together and Shook again their paddles at us. I then gave the Ship a yaw and fir'd a four pounder this sent them quite off and we kept on our Course along shore having a light breeze at ESE At Noon was we were in the Latitude of 37°..545'  and the Island before mentioned, which is called by the Natives Noahhole bore White Island bearing N. 29° West distant 8 Leagues 
            
      

        2 November 1769
        Thursday 2nd Gentle breeze from NW. round northerly to ESE and fair weather - At 2 P.M saw a pretty high Island bearing west from us and at 5 Saw more Islands and Rocks to the westward of it; hauld our wind in order to go without them but finding that we could not weather them before dark, bore up and run between them and the main   At 7 was close under the first Island from whence a large double Canoe full of people came off to us   this was the first double Canoe we had seen in this Country. they stayd about the Ship untill it was dark then left us, but not before they had thrown a few stones: they told us the name of the Island which was Mowtohora    it is but of a small circuit but high and lies 6 - Miles from the Main, under the south side is anchorage in 14 fathom water    SWBS from this Island on the main land, seemingly at no great distance from the sea is a very high round mountain which I have named Mount Edgcomb    it standings in the middle of some low flat land a large plane which makes it the more conspicuous    Latitude 37°..59' Longd 183° 07-Under the south side of the Island is anchorage in 14 fm Water. In standing to the westward we shoalden'd our water from 17 to 130 fathom, and knowing that we were not far from some small Islands, and Rocks that that we had seen before dark, after passing of whichof these I intended to have brought too for the night, but now I thought it more prudent to tack and spend the night under the Island Mowtohora where I knowd there was no danger, and it was well we did for in the morning after we had made sail to the westward we discover'd ahead of us Rocks level with and under water; they lay 11/2 League from the Island Mowtohora and about 9 Miles from the Main. and NNE from Mount Edgcumbe. We pass'd between these rocks and the Main having from 7 to 10 fathom water. The Double Canoe which we saw last night follow'd us again to day under sail and kept abreast of the Ship near an houre talking to Tobupia but at last they began to pelt us with stones but upon fireing one Musquet they drop'd a stern and left us  At half past 10 pass'd between a low flat Island and the Main the distance from one to the other being 4 Miles depth of water 10, 12 and 15 fathom  At Noon the Flat Island bore from N.E to E1/2N distant 5 or 6 Miles, Course and distance run since yesterday at noon is        Leagues Latitude in per Observation 37°..39' SoLongd 183.30 The Main land between this and the Island of Mowtohara which is [10 - check this ] Leagues is of a Moderate height and all a level flat Country pritty clear of wood and full of Plantations and Villages; this these Villages are built upon eminences near the Sea. and are fortified on the land side with a Bank and a Ditch, and Pallisaded all round, besides this some of them appear'd to have out works 
        We have before now observed on several parts of the Coast small Villages inclosed with Pallisades, and Works of this kind built on eminences and ridges of hills, but Tobupia hath all along told us that they were Mories or places of Worship, but I rather think that they are places of retreat or Stronghold where they defend themselves againest the Attack of an Enimy as some of them seem'd not ill design'd for that purpose. We saw haled a shore under one of the Villages canoes which carried a small awning or little cabbin, a thing we have not seen before on this coast.
            
      

        3 November 1769
        Friday 3rdPM Fresh gales at NEBE and hazey weather. At 2 pass'd a small high Island lying 4 Miles from a high round head on the Main where there is a high round hill standing near the Sea upon a flat sandy beach. the land  from this hill head the land trends NW as far as we could see and appear'd to be very rugged and hilly. The weather being very hazey and the wind blowing fresh on Shore, we ha[u]led off Close upon a wind for the weathermost Island in sight which bore from us NNE distant 6 or 7 Leagues: Under this Island we spent the night having a fresh gale at NE & NEBE and hazey weather with rain: this Island I have called the Mayor
        At 7 AM it bore S. 47° East distant 6 Leagues and a Cluster of small Islands and Rocks bore N1/2E distant one League. At this time had a gentle breeze at ENE and clear weather. The cluster of Islands and Rocks just mention'd we named the Court of Aldermen, they lay in the compass of about half a league every way and 53 Leagues from the main between which and them lay other Islands the most of them are barren rocks and of these there is a very great Variety, some of them are of as small a compass as the Moniment in London and spire up to a much greater height; they lay in the Latitude of 36°..57' and some of them are inhabited  At Noon they bore So 60° East distant 3 or 4 Leagues and a Rock like a Castle lying not far from the main bore N. 40° West one League, Latd Observed 36°..58' So Course and distance sence yesterday at Noon is NNW1/2W. about 20 Legs. In this situation had 28 fathom water and a great many small Islands and Rocks on every side of us. The Main land appears here with a hilly, rugged, and barren surface, no Plantations to be seen and but few nor no other signs of its being well Inhabited 
            
      

        4 November 1769
        Saturday, 4th The first and Middle parts little wind at ENE and clear weather,  the Latter had a fresh breeze at NNW and hazey with rain. At 1 PM. three Canoes Came off from the Main to the Ship and after parading about us a little while they darted two pikes at us, the first was at one of our people men as he was going to give them a rope thinking that they were coming on board - but the second they throw'd into the Ship, the fireing of one Musquet sent them away. Each of these Canoes were made out of one large tree and were without any sort of ornament and the people in them were mostly quite naked 
        At 2 PM saw a large opening or inlet in the land which we bore up for with an intent to come to an Anchor.   at this time had 41 fathom water which gradually decreased to 9 fathom at which time we was were 11/2 Mile from a high tower'd rock lying near the South pt of the inlet, the Rock and the northermost of the Court of Aldermen being in one bearing So 61° Et At half past 7 Anchor'd in 7 fathom a little within the south entrance of the Bay or inlet. We were Accompaned in here by several Canoes, who stay'd about the Ship untill dark. but and before they went away they were so generous as to tell us that they would come and attack us in the morning, but some of them paid us a Veset in the night, thinking no doubt but what they should find all hands a sleep, but as soon as they found their mistake they went off  My reasons for puting in here were the hopesprospect here is of discovering a good Harbour and the disire I had of being in some convenient place to observe the Transit of Mercury which happens on the 9th Instant and will be wholy Visible here if the day is clear.   if we should be so fortunate as to Obtain this Observation the Longitude of this place and Country will thereby be very accuratly determined 
        Between 5 and 6 oClock in the Morning several Canoes came to us from all Parts of the Bay   in them were about 130 or 140 People, to all appearences their first design was to attack us being all compleatly Arm'd in their way.   however this they never attempted but after Parading about the Ship near three hours, some times trading with us and at other times tricking of us, they disperse'd but not before we had fired a few Musquets and one great gun, not with any design to hurt any of them, but to shew them what sort of Weaphons we had and that we could revenge any insult they offer'd to us. It was observable that they paid but little regard to the Musquets that were fire'd notwithstanding one ball was fired thro' one of their Canoes, but what effect the great gun had I know not for this was not fired untill they were going away 
        At 10 the weather clearing up a little I went with 2 boats to sound the Bay and to look for a more convenient Anchoring place, the Master being in one boat and I in the other,   We pull'd first over to the North Shore, where some some Canoes came out to meet us, but as we came near them they retired to the Shore and invited us to follow them but seeing that they were all arm'd I did not think fit to except of their invaitation, but after trading with them out of the boat for a few minutes.   we left them and went towards the head of they [the bay]. I observed on a high po[i]nt a fortified Village but I could only see a part of the woorks, and as I intend to see the whole shall say no more about it at this time. and After having fix'd upon an Anchoring place not far from where the Ship now lays I returnd on board 
            
      

        5 November 1769
        Sunday 5th Winds at NNW. Hazey weather with rain in the night. At 4 PM wieghd run in nearer the South shore and Anchord in 41/2 fathom water a Soft sandy bottom - the south point of the Bay bearing East distant 1 Mile and a River into which the Boats can go at low water SSE distant 11/2 Mile 
        In the Morning the Natives came off again to the Ship but their be havour was very different to what it was yestermorning and the little traffick we had with them was carried on very fair and friendly. Two came on board the Ship to each I gave a piece of English Cloth and some Spike nails 
        After the Natives were gone I went with the Pinnace and Long-boat into the River to haule the Sene.   and sent the Master to sound the Bay and dridge for fish in the yawl. We hauled the Sene in several places in the River but caught only a few Mullet, with which we return'd on board about noon 
            
      

        6 November 1769
        Monday 6th Moderate breezes at NNW and hazey and hazey weather with rain in the night - PM I went to a nother part of the Bay to haule the sene but met with as little success as before and the Master did not get above half a Bucket full of shells with the dridges 
        The Natives brought to the Ship and sold to our people, small Cockles, Clams and Mussels enough for all hands, these are found in great plenty upon the Sand banks of the River 
        In the morning I sent the Long-boat to Trawl in the Bay, and an officer with the Marines and a party of men to cut wood and hale the sene, but neither the sene nor the Trawl met with any success. but the natives in some measure made up for this by bringing several baskets of dry'd or ready dress'd fish,   Altho it was none of the best I order'd it all to be bought up in order to incourage them to trade - 
            
      

        7 November 1769
        Tuesday 7th The first part Moderate and fair, the remainder a fresh breeze northerly with dirty hazey rainy weather. PM got on board a Long-boat Load of water and caught a dish of fish in the Sene - found here great quantity of sellery which is boild every day for the Ships Compney as usual 
            
      

        8 November 1769
        Wednesday 8thPM Fresh breeze at NNW and hazey rainy weather, the remainder a Gentle breeze at WSW and Clear weather. AM heel'd and scrub'd both sides of the Ship and sent a party of men a Shore to Cut wood and fill water. The Natives brought of to the Ship and sold us for small peeces of Cloth - as much fish as served all hands, they were of the Mackarel kind and as good as ever was eat 
        At Noon I observed the Suns Meridian. Zenith distance by the Astronomical Quadrant which gave the Latitude 36°..47'..43" So this was in the River beformentioned, that lies within the So Entrce of ye Bay 
            
      

        9 November 1769
        By Mr Green Internal Contact at 0h  '    "      [12h 9' 55"] afternoon   External Contact  0 ..     ..   [12h 9' 55"]   By My self Internal Contact at 0  ..            [12h 8' 45"] Do   External Contact  0             [12h 9' 43"]         
        Latitude observed at Noon 36°..48'..28", the Mean of this and yesterday's observation gives 46° 48' 51/2" So the Latitude of the place of Observation and the Variation of the Compass was at this time found to be 11° 9' East - While we were making these observations two very Large five Canoes came along side the Ship, two large and three small ones   in the one were 47 people, but in the others not quite so many,   they were wholy strangers to us and to all appearence they came with a hostal intention, being both compleatly arm'd with Pikes, Darts, Stones, &Ca however they made no attempt and this was very probable owing to their being inform'd by some other Canoes / who at this time were along side selling fish / what sort of people they had to deal with. They Large Canoe At their first came [coming] along side they begun to sell our people some of their Arms and one Man offer'd to sale a Ha'ahow, that is a square pice of Cloth such as they wear. Lieutt Gore, who at this time was Commanding officer, sent in to the Canoe a peice of Cloth which the man had agreed to take in exchange for his, but as soon as he had got Mr Gore's Cloth in his posission he would not part with his own, but put off the Canoe from a long side and then shook their paddles at the People in the Ship. Upon this Mr Gore fired a Musquet at them and from what I can learn kill'd the man who tooke the Cloth - after this they soon went away. I have here inserted the account of this affair just as I had it from Mr Gore but I must own it did not meet with my approbation because I thought the punishment a little too severe for the Crime, and we had now been long enough acquainted with these People to know how to chastise trifling faults like this without taking away their Lives 
        Thursday 9th Variable light breezes and clear weather. As soon as it was day light the Natives began to bring off Mackarel and more then we well know'd what to do with, notwithstanding I orderd all they brought to be purchas'd in order to incourage them in this kind of traffick. At 8 Mr Green and I went on Shore with our Instruments to Observe the Transit of Mercury which came on at 7h [20]' [58]" Apparent time and was Observed by Mr Green only. I at this time was taking the Suns Altitude in order to Asertain the time - The Egress was observed as followes
            
      

        10 November 1769
        Friday 10thPM. Gentle breezes and Varble the remainder a Strong breeze at ENE and Hazey weather. AM I went with two Boats accompaned by Mr Banks and the other gentlemen into the River which empties itself into the head of this Bay in order to examine it - None of the Natives came off to the Ship this morning which we think is owing to the bad weather 
            
      

        11 November 1769
        Saturday 11th Fresh gales at ENE and and Clowdy hazey weather with rain. Between 7 and 8 oClock PM I returnd on board from out of the River having been about 4 or 5 Miles up it and could have gone much farther had the weather been favourable. I landed on the East side and went up on the hills from whence I saw or at least I thought I saw the head of the River    it here branched into several Channels and form'd a number of very low flat Islands all cover'd with a sort of Mangrove trees, and several places of the Shores of both sides of the River were cover'd with the same sort of wood: the sand banks were well store'd with Cockles, and clams and in many places were Rock Oysters. Here is likewise pretty plenty of wild Foul, such as Shags, Ducks, Curlews, and a Black Bird about as big as a Crow with a long sharp bill of a Colour between White Red and yellow. We also saw fish in the River but of what sort I know not. The Country particularly Especialy on the East side is barren and for the most part distitute of wood or any other signs of fertility, but the face of the country on the other side looked much better and is in many places cover'd with wood. We met with some of the natives and saw several more and smookes a long way inland.   but saw not the least sign of cultivation either here or in any other part about the Bay, so that the Inhabitents must live wholy on Shell and other Fish and Fern roots which they eat by way of bread  In the entrance of this River and for 2 or 3 Miles up it is very safe and commodious Anchoring in 3, 4, and 5 fathom water, and convenient places for laying a Vessel a shore where the Tide rises and falls about 7 feet and flows full and change
        I could not see whether or no any considerable fresh water stream came out of the Country into this River but there are a number of small Rivulets which come from the adjacent hills  A little with[in] the entrance of the River on the East side is a high point or peninsula juting out into the River on which are the remains of one of thier Fortified towns the Situation is such that the best Engineer in Europe could not have choose'd a better for a small number of men to defend themselves against against a greater.   it is strong by nature and made more so by Art     It is only accessible on the land side, and there have been cut a Ditch and a bank raised on the inside from the top of the bank to the bottom of the ditch was about 22 feet and depth of the ditch on the land side 14 feet; its breadth was in proportion to its depth and the whole seem'd to have been done with great judgment. There had been a row of Pickets on the top of the bank and a nother on the outside of the ditch.   these last had been set deep in the ground and sloaping with their upper ends hanging over the ditch; the whole had been burnt down, so that it is probable that this place has been taken and distroy'd by an Enimy. The people on this side of the Bay seem now to have no houses or fix'd habitations but sleep in the open air, under trees and in small temporary shades, but to all appearence they are better off on the other side but there we have not yet set foot - In the Morning being dirty rainy weather I did not expect any of the Natives off with fish, but thinking that they might have some a shore, I sent a boat with some trade, who returnd about noon load with oysters which they got in the River which is abreast of the Ship, but saw no fish among the Natives 
            
      

        12 November 1769
        Sunday 12thPM had strong gales at NE and hazey rainy weather.   AM a fresh breeze at NW and Clear weather. In the morning got on board a turn of water and after wards sent the Long-boat into the River for Oysters to take to sea with us.   and I went with the Pinnace and Yawl accompaned by Mr Banks and Dr Solander, over to the North side of the Bay in order to take a View of the Country and the Fortified Village which stands their; we landed about a Mile from it and was were met by the Inhabitants in our way thether who with a great deal of good nature and friendship conducted us into the place and shewed us every thing that was there 
        This village is built upon a high promontory or point on the north side and near the head of the Bay.   it is in some places quite inaccessible to man and in others very difficult except on that side which face'd the narrow ridge of the hill on which it stands    here it was is defended by a double ditch a bank and two rows of Picketing    the inner row was upon the bank but not so near the Crown but what there was good room for men to walk and handle their arms between the Picketing and the inner dich; the outer Picketing was between the two ditches and laid sloaping with their unper [upper] ends hanging over the inner ditch, the depth of this ditch from the bottom to the Crown of the bank was [24] feet. Close within the inner picketing was erreted, by strong posts, a stage [30] feet high and [40] in length and 6 feet broad, the use of this stage was to stand upon to throw darts at the Assailants, and a number of darts lay upon it for that purpose 
        At right angles to this stage and a few paces from it was a nother of the same construction and bigness, this stood likewise within the Picketing and was intended for the same use as the other. Viz. to stand upon to throw stones and darts upon upon the Enimy as they advanced up the side of the Hill where lay the main way into the place; it likewase might be inten[de]d to defend some little out woorks and hutts that lay at the skirt and on this side of the hill, these out woorks were not intended as advanced Posts but for such of the Inhabitents to live in as had not room in the main work but had taken shelter under it. Besides the works on the land side above described the whole Village was pallisaded round with a line of pretty strong picketing run round the edge of the hill   The ground within not having not been level at first but laid sloaping, they had divided it into little squares and leveled each of these; these squares lay in the form of an amphitheatre and were each of them pallisaded round and had a communication one with a nother by narrow lanes or little gate ways which could easily be stoped up, so that if any enimy had force'd the outer picketing he had several others to incounter before the place could be wholy reduced, supposing them to defend every one of the places one after a nother. The main way leading into this fortification was up a very steep part of the hill and thro' a narrow passage about 12 feet long, and under one of the Stages,    I saw no door or gate but it might very soon have been barricaded up. Upon the whole I looked up[on] it to be a very strong and well choose post and where a small number of resolute men might defend them selves a long time against a vast superior force, Arm'd in the manner as these people are - These seem'd to be prepared against a siege having laid up in store an immence quantity of firn roots and a good many dry'd fish, but we did not see that they had any fresh water nearer then a brook which runs close under the foot of the hill, from which I suppose they can at times get Water, tho besiged and keep it in Gourds untill they use it. Under the foot of the point on which this Village stands are 2 Rocks the one just broke off from the Main and other detatched a little from it, they are both very small and more fit for birds to inhabit than men yet there are house[s] and places of defence on bo each of them, and about a Mile to the Eastward of these is a nother of these small fortified Rocks which communicates with the Main by a narrow pathway where there is a small Village of the natives; many works of this kind we have seen upon small Islands and Rocks and Ridges of hills on all parts of the Coast besides a great number of fortified towns, to all appearences Vastly superior to this I have described 
        From this it should seem that this people must have long and frequent wars, and must have been long accustom'd to it otherwise they never would have invented such strong holds as these, the errecting of which must cost them immence labour considering the tools they have to work with which are only made of wood & stone - It is a little strange that among with such a warlike people as these undoubtedly are no Omissive weapons are found a mong them such as Bows and Arrows, Slings, &ca things in themselves so easily invented and are common in every other part of the world. The Arms they use are Long spears or lances, a Staff about 5 feet long, some of these are pointed at one end like a Serjeants Halbard others are round and sharp.   the other ends are broad something like the blade of an oar; they have a nother sort about 41/2 feet long   these are shaped at one end like an Axe and the other is made with a sharp point; they have short Truncheons about a foot long, which they call Pattoo Pattoos some made of wood some of bone and others of Stone, those made of wood are variously shaped, but those made of bone and stone are of one shape, which is with a round handle a broadish blade which is thickest in the middle and tapers to an edge all round, the use of these are to knock mens brains out and to kill them outright after they are wounded: and they are certainly well contrived things for this purpose   Besides these weapons they throw stones and darts, the darts are 10 or 12 feet long, are made of hard wood and are boarded barb'd at one end. They handle all their arms with great Agility particularly their long Pikes or Lances, againest which we have no weapon that is an equal match except a Loaded Musquet
            
      

        13 November 1769
        Monday 13thPM. Gentle breezes at NW. and clear weather. After taking a slight View of the Country and loading both boats with Sellery, which we found in great plenty near the sea beach, we return'd on board about 5 oClock, the Long-boat at the same time returnd out of the River loaded as deep as she could swim with oysters; and now I intended to put to sea in the morning if wind and weather will permit. In the night had the wind at SE with rainy dirty hazey weather which continued all day, so that I could not think of sailing, but thought myself very happy in being in a good port. Saml Jones, Seaman having been confined on Saturday last for refuseing to come upon deck when all hands were called and afterwards refuse'd to comply with the orders of the officer on deck, he was this morning punished with 12 lashes and remited back to confinement 
            
      

        14 November 1769
        Tuesday 14th Fresh gales. Easterly & rainy dirty weather -
            
      

        15 November 1769
        Wednesday, 15th In the evening I went in the Pinnace and landed upon one of the Island that lies off of the South head of the Bay, with a View to see if I could not discover any sunken rocks or other dangers lying before the entrence of the bay as there was a pretty large swell at this time. The Island we landed upon was very small yet there was were upon it a Village the Inhabitants of which received us with very friendly,    this little Village was laid out in small oblong squares and each pallisaded round, The Island afforded no fresh water and was only accessible on one side, from this I concluded that it was not choose for any conveniencey it could afford them but for its natural strength 
        At 7 AM weigh'd with a light breeze at West and clear weather, and made sail out of the Bay steering N.E. for the Northeastermost of a number of Islands lying off the North Point of the Bay, these Islands are of various extent and ly scattered to the N, NW in a parallel diriction with the Main as far as we could see. I was at first afraid to go within them thinking that there was no safe Passage.   but I afterwards thought that we might and I would have attempted it but the wind comeing to the NW prevented it; so that we was were obliged to Stand out to sea. At Noon was in the Latitude of 36°..46' So The northermost Island above mentioned bore North distant half a League, the Court of Aldermen SBE SEBS distt 6 Leagues and the Bay Saild from which I have named Mercury Bay, on accot of the observn be[ing] made thereSWBW distant 6 Miles. Great part of the land adjoining to the place where we lay is called by the Natives          others parts have distinct names to them selves but I have choose this for the whole Bay because of its more easy pronunciation but I have preserved all the others in the Plan of the Bay
        The Mercury Bay of                          lies in the Latitude of 36°..47' So and in the Longitude of 184°.. 4' Wt from the Meridion of Greenwich. but its Longitude will be more accurately determined from the Observation of the Transit of Mercury This Bay it lies in SW between 2 & 3 Leagues.    there are several Islands lying both to the Southward and northward of it and a small high Island or Rock in the Middle of the entrance    Within this Island the depth of water doth no where exceed 9 or 8 fathom - The best anchorage is in a sandy bay which lies just within the south head, in   4  5 and 4 fm bringing a high tower rock which lies without the head in one with the head, or just shut in behind it; here it is very convenient Wooding and watering, and in the River are an immence quantity of Oysters and other small shell fish, and this is the only thing it is remarkable fore and hath occasioned my giving it the name of Oyster River 
        But the Snugest and safest place for a Ship to lay in that wants to stay here any time is in the River at the head of the Bay and where there are every conveniency the place can afford. To sail up and into it keep the south shore all the way on board. As we did not learn that the Natives had any name for this River I have calld it the River of Man groves because of the great quantity of these trees that are found in it  The Country on the SE side of this River and Bay is very barren produceing little else but Fern and such other Plants as delight in a poor - soil. The land on the NW side is pretty well cover'd with Wood, the soil more fertile and would no doubt produce the necessarys of life was it cultivated    however thus much must be said againest it, that it is not near so rich and fertile as the lands we have seen to Southward, and the same may be said of its Inhabitants who altho pretty numerous are poor to the highest degree when compar'd to others we have seen.   they have no plantations but live wholy on Fern roots and fish,  their Canoes are mean and without ornament, and so are their houses or hutts    and in general every thing they have about them.   This may be owing to the frequent wars in which they are certainly ingaged, strong proofs of this we have seen, for the people who resided near the place where we wooded and who slept every night in the open air place'd themselves in such a manner when they laid down to sleep as plainly shewed that it was necessary for them to be always upon their guard. They do not own subjection to Teeratu the Arree Earee de hi: but say that he would kill them was he to come a mong them,   they confirm the custom of eating their enimies so that this is a thing no longer to be doubted. I have before observed that many of the people about this bay had no fix'd habitations and we thought so then, but have sence learnt that they have strong holds or Hippa's as they call them, which they retire to in time of danger 
        We found thrown upon the Shore in several places in this Bay quantities of Iron Sand which is brought down out of the Country by almost every little frish water brook.   this proves that there must be of that ore not far inland  Neither the Inhabitants of this place or any other where we have been know the use of Iron, or set the least Value upon it, prefering the most trifleing thing we could give them to a nail or any sort of Iron tools. Before we left this Bay we cut out upon one of the trees near the watering place, the Ships Name, date &Ca and after displaying the English Colours I took formal posession of the place in the name of His Majesty 
            
      

        16 November 1769
        Thursday 16th Fresh breezes between the NW and S.W. and fair weather. At 1 PM having got within the Group of Islands which lies of the North head of Mercury Bay, haul'd our wind to the northward and kept plying to windward all this day between these Islands and some others laying to the Northward of them, with a View to get under the Main land, the extreem N.W. point of which, that we could see at noon bore WBN. distant 6-8 Leagues. Latd in per observation 36°..33' So -
        Note, In speaking of Mercury Bay I had forgot to mention that the Mangrove trees found there produce a resinous substance very much like rosin - something of this kind I am told is found in both the East and West Indias. We found it at first in small lumps upon the Sea beach, but afterwards found it sticking to the Mangrove trees and by that means found out from whence it came 
            
      

        17 November 1769
        17th The fore and middle parts had fresh gales between the SW and WBS, and squally, kept plying to windward in order to get under the land - At 6 AM fetched close under the lee of the northernmost Island in sight, then tacked and stood to the Southward untill a 11 when at this time we tack'd and stood to the Nd   the North head of Mercury Bay or Point Mercury bore SEBE distant 3 Leagues, being at this time between 2 and 3 Leagues from the main land and a breast of a place where there appear'd to be a Harbour, but the heavy squales which we had from the land would not permit us to take a nearer view of it, but soon brought us under our close reef'd topsails - At Noon the North head of           Bay Point Mercury bore SE distant 4 Leagues and the Westermost point of the Main land in sight bore N 60° Wt distant 5 Leagues. Over the N.W side of Mercury Bay is a pretty high round hill, riseing sloaping from the Shore of the Bay: this hill is very conspicuous from where we now are 
            
      

        18 November 1769
        Saturday 18th First part Strong gales at SW and SSW with havy squales, in the Morning had gentle breezes at So and SE, towards noon had whifling light airs all round the Compass -
        Kept plying to windward under Close reef'd Topls untill day light AM, at which time we had got close under the Main.   and the wind coming at SE we made sail and steer'd NWBW as the land lays keeping close in shore - At 6 we pass a small Bay wherein there appear'd to Anchorage and pretty good shelter from the sea winds, at the entrence of which lies a Rock pretty high above water. 4 Miles farther to the west N. West is a very conspicuous promontory or Point of land which we got abreast of by 7 oClock It lies in the Latitude of 36°..26' So and N 48° West 9 Leagues from the north head of              Bay Point Mercury From this point the land trends W1/2 S, near one League then SSE as far as we could see. Besides the Islands laying without us we could see land round by the S.W. as far as NW. but wheather this was the Main or Islands was not possible for us at this time to determine.   the fear of looseing the Main land determined me to follow its diriction, with this View we hauled round the point and Steer'd to the Southward, but meeting with whifleing light airs all round the Compass we made but little progress untill noon, when we found our selves by observation in the Latd of 36°..29' So   A small Island which lies NW 4 Miles from the promontory above mentioned bore NBE distant 61/2 Miles.   being at this time about 2 Miles from the Shore. While we lay under the land two large Canoes came off to us, in one of them was were 62 people, they stay'd about us some time then began to throw stones into the Ship.   upon which I fired a Musquet ball thro' one of the boats, after this they retired ashore
            
      

        19 November 1769
        Sunday 19th At 1 PM a breeze sprung up at East which afterwards came to NE and with it we steer'd along shore SBE and SSE, having from 25 to 18 fathom water. At half past 7 having run 7 or 8 Leags sence noon we Anchor'd in 23 fm not chooseing to run any further in the dark, having the land on both sides of us, forming the entrence of a Streight, Bay or River laying in SBE for on that point of the Compass we could see no land. At Day light AM, the wind being still favourable, we weigh'd and run under an easy sail up the Inlet keeping nearest the East side. Soon after we had got under Sail three large canoes came off to the Ship and several of the People came on board upon the very first invitation; this was owing to their having heard of our being upon the Coast and the manner we had treated the Natives. I made each of those that came on board a small present and after about an hours stay they went away well satisfied. After having run five Leagues from the place where we anchor'd last night our depth of water gradually decreased to 6 fathom and into less I did not choose to go, and as the wind was right in blow'd right up the inlet and tide of flood we came too an Anchor nearly in the middle of the Channell which is here about 11 Miles over and after this sent two Boats to Sound the one on one side and the other on the other 
            
      

        20 November 1769
        Monday 20th Moderate breeze at SSE and fair weather. At 2 PM the Boats returnd from sounding not haveing found above 3 feet more water than where we now lay; upon this I resolved to go no farther with the Ship.   but to examine the head of the Bay in the boats for as it appeared to run a good way inland I thought this a good oportunity to see a little of the Interior parts of the Country and its produce: Accordingly at Day light in the morning I set out with the Pinnace and Long boat accompaned by Mr Banks, Dr Solander and Tobiaupia. We found the Bay inlet end in a fresh water River about 9 Miles above the Ship, Into which we enterd with the first of the flood and before we had gone 3 miles up it found the water quite fresh. We saw a number of the natives and landed at one of their Villages  the Inhabitants of which received us with open arms, we made but a short stay with them but proceeded up the River untill near Noon, when finding the face of the Country to continue pretty much the same and no alteration in the Course or stream of the River or the least probillity of seeing the end of it, we landed on the West side in order to take a View of the lofty Trees which adorne its banks, being at this time 12 or 14 Miles within the entrance and here the tide of flood run as strong as it doth in the River Thams below bridge
            
      

        21 November 1769
        Tuesday 21st After land as above-mentioned we had not gone a hundred yards into the Woods before we found a tree that girted 19 feet 8 Inches, 6 feet above the Ground, and having a quadrant with me I found its length from the root to the first branch to be 89 feet.   it was as streight as an arrow and taper'd but very little in proportion to its length.  so that I judged that there was 356 solid feet of timber in this tree clear of the branches. We saw many others of the same sort several of which was half as long again were taller than the one we measured and all of them very stout; there were likewise many other sorts of very stout timber trees all of them wholy unknown to any of us    we brought away a few specimans and at 3 oClock we embarqued in order to return on bioard with the very first of the Ebb  but not before we had named this River the Thames on account of its bearing some resemblence to that River in england. In our return down the River the inhabitants of the Village where we landed in going, seeing that we return'd by a nother Channell put off in their Canoes and met us and trafficked with us in the most friendly manner immaginable untill they had disposed of the few trifles they had -
        The Tide of Ebb just carried us out of the narrow part of the River into the Bay Sea reach as I may call it . where meeting with the flood and a strong breeze at NNW obliged us to come to a grappling and we did not reach the Ship untill 7 oClock in the AM 
        Intending to get under Sail at high water the Long boat was sent to take up the Kidge anchor but it blow'd so strong that she could not reach the Buoy and it begining to blow strong was the gale increasing soon obliged us to bear away more Cable and strike Topgallant yards 
            
      

        22 November 1769
        Wednesday 22nd Winds at NNW. The PM fresh gales and hazey with rain, the remainder Moderate and clear    At 3 PM the tide of Ebb. makeing we took up our Anchors and got under Sail and ply'd down the Bay River untill 8 oClock when we again came to an Anchor in 7 fathom a muddy bottom. At 3 AM weighd with the first of the Ebb and kept plying untill the flood obliged us to anchor again. After this I went in the Pinnace over to the western shore but found their neither inhabitants or any thing else worthy of note. At the time I left the Ship a good ma[n]y of the natives were along side and on board the Ship trafficking with our people for such trifles as they had and seem'd to behave as will as people could do.   but one of them took the half hour glass out of the Bitticle and was caught in the very fact and for which Mr Hick who was the Commanding officer, brought him to the gang way and gave him a Dozn lashes with a Catt of nine tails. The rest of the people seem'd not displeased at it when they came to know what it was for, and one old man beat the fellow after he had got into his Canoe    however soon after this they all went away. The punishing this Man in this manner might have had some good effect had we been going to stay any time in this place, but as we was going away it might as well have been let a lone 
            
      

        23 November 1769
        Thursday 23rdPM Gentle breezes at NNW and fair weather. Between 3 and 4 oClock got under sail with the first of the Ebb and ply'd to windward untill 9 when we anchor'd in 16 fathom over upon the East shore. In the night had light airs and Calm. At 3 AM weighd but had little or no wind untill near noon when a light breeze sprung up at NNW at this time we were close under the west shore in 7 fathom water Latde 36°..51' Soat a bout    Miles with the West entrance of the Bay or River, and where in is shleter from the Northerly and westerly winds, we stood into it with the ship in to 7 fm Lat. 36°.51' So 

        Thursday 23rdPM Gentle breezes at NNW and fair weather. Between 3 and 4 oClock got under sail with the first of the Ebb and ply'd to windward untill 9 when we anchor'd in 16 fathom over upon the East shore. In the night had light airs and Calm.

        25 November 1769
        Saturday 25thPM had fresh gales at S.W. and Squally weather. We kept standing a long shore to the NW. having the main land on the one side and Islands on the other, our soundings were from 26 to 12 fathom water. At half past 7 PM we Anchor'd in a bay in 14 fathom, in water a Sandy bottom. We had no sooner come to an Anchor then we caught between 90 and a hundred Breams, / a fish so called / this occationed my giveing this place the Name of Bream Bay   The two points which forms this Bay lie North and South 5 Leagues from each other. the bay is every where pretty broad and between 3 and 4 Leagues deep, at the bottom of it thier appears to be a fresh water River, the north head of the Bay called Bream head is high land and remarkable on account of several peeked rocks rainged in order upon the top of it. It lies in the Latitude of 35°..46' So and N 41° West distant 171/2 Leags from Cape Colvill. This Bay may likewise be known by some small Islands laying before it call'd the Hen & Chickens one of which is pretty high and terminates at top in two peeks -
        The land between Point Rodney and the north head Bream headBay, which is 10 Leagues, is low and wooded in tutfs, and between the Sea and the firm land are white sand banks. we saw no inhabitants, but saw fires in the night, a proof that the Country is not uninhabited. At day light AM we left this Bay and directed our Course along shore to the northward having a gentle breeze at SBW and Clear weather. A little after sun-rise found the Variation to be 12°..42' Easterly 
        At Noon our Latitude by observation was 36°..36' Sothe North Bream head of Bream Bay bore south distant 10 Miles, some small Islands / Poor Knights / at NEBN distant 3 Leags and the northermost land in sight bore NNW, being at this time 2 Miles from the shore and in this situation had 26 fathom water. The land hereabouts is rather low and pretty well cover'd with wood and seems not ill inhabited 
            
      

        26 November 1769
        Sunday 26thPM Gentle breezes between the ENE and North, kept rainging a long shore to the Northward at the distance of 4 or 5 Miles off, saw several Villages and some Cultivated lands    Towards evening several Canoes Came off to us and some of the Natives venter'd on board, to two who appeared to be Chiefs I gave presents    After these were gone out out of the Ship the others became so troublesome that in order to get rid of them we was were at the expence of 2 or 3 Musquet Balls and one 4 pound shot but as no harm was intended them none they received unless they hapend to over heat themselves in pulling a shore. In the night had Variable light airs, but towards morning had a light breeze at South and after wards at SE, with this we proceeded slowly to the Northward. At 6 AM several Canoes came off from the place where they landed last night and between this and Noon a good many more came from other parts; had at one time a good many of the people on board and about 170 along side, their behaviour was tollerable friendly but we could not prevale upon them to traffick with us. At Noon the Main land extending from SBE to NWBW - a remarkable point of land bore West distant 4 or 5 Miles, Latitude Observed 35°.11' St 
            
      

        27 November 1769
        Monday 27thPM Gentle breezes Easterly and clear weather. At 3 pass'd the point of land before Mentioned, which I have named Cape Brett in honour of Sr Percy. The land of this Cape is considerable higher than any part of the adjacent Coast: at the very point of the Cape is a high round hillock and NEBN near one Mile from this is a small high Island or Rock with a hole perced quite thro' it like the Arch of a Bridge and this was one reason why I gave the Cape the above name because Piercy seem'd very proper for that of the Island. This Cape or at least some part of it, is call'd by the Natives Motugogogo    Latd 35°..10'.. 30" S. Longitude. 185°..25' West. On the west side of Cape Brett is a large and pretty Deep Bay lying inSWBW in which there appear'd to be several small Islands - The point that forms the NW entrence I have named Point Pococke it lies W1/4N 3 or 4 Leags from Cape Brett. On the SW side of this Bay we saw several Villages situated both on Islands and on the Main land from whence came off to us several large Canoes full of people, but like those that had been along side before would not enter into a friendly traffick. with us, but would cheat when ever they had an oppertunity. The people in these Canoes made a very good appearence, being all stout well made men, having their hair which was black Comb'd up and tied upon the Crown of their heads and there stuck with white feathers, in each of the Canoes was were two or three Cheifs and the habits of these was were rather superior to any we have had yet seen.   the Cloth they were made on was of the best sort and cover'd on the out side with Dog skins put on in such a manner as to look agreeable enough to the Eye. Few of these people were tattow'd or mark'd in the face, like those we have seen farther to the south, but several had their Backsides tattou'd much in the same manner as the Inhabitants of the Islands within the Tropics 
        In the Course of this Day, that is this afternoon and yester forenoon, we reckoned that we had not less than four or five hundred of the Natives alongside and on board the ship, and in that time did not rainge above 6 or 8 Leagues of the Sea-Coast: a strong proff that this part of the Country must be well inhabited 
        In the Evening the wind came to the westward of north and we tacked and stood off NE until a 11 oClock when the wind coming more favourable we stood again to the westward. At 8 AM we were within a Mile of Group of small Islands lying close under the Main land and NWBW1/2W distant 22 Miles from Cape Bret.   here we lay for near two hours having little or no wind: dureing this time several Canoes came off to the Ship and 2 or 3 of them sold us some fish  Cavalles as they are called which occasioned my giving the Islands the same name after this, some others began to pelt us with stones and would not desist at the fireing of two Musquet Balls thro' one of their boats: at last I was obliged to pepper two or of the three fellows with small shott after which they retired, and the wind coming at NW we stood off to sea. At Noon the above Cavalle Islands bore SWBS distant 4 Miles, Cape Bret SE distant 7 Leags and the Westermost land in Sight making like Islands bore west and by north. Latd in per observation 34°.. 55' So
            
      

        28 November 1769
        Tuesday 28th A Fresh breeze from the Westward all this day which being right in our teeth we kept beating to wind ward with all the sail we could crowd but instead of gaining we lost ground. AM being close in with the land to the Westward of the Bay which lies on this side of Cape Bret we saw at some distance inland 2 pretty large Villages and pallisaded in, in the Same manner as others we have seen,   At Noon C. Bret SEBE1/2E. Dist 6 Leagues. Latd Obd 35° 0' So 
            
      

        29 November 1769
        Wednesday 29th Fresh Gales at NW and WNW. Kept plying to Windward untill 7 AM and finding that we lost ground every board we made, I thought I could not do better then to bear up for the Bay which lies the to the Westward of Cape Bret, it being at this time not above 2 Leagues to leeward of us, for by puting into that Bay there we shall should gain some knowlidge of it; on the Contrary by keeping the Sea with a Contrary wind, we are were sure of meeting with nothing new 
        These reasons induced me to bear away for the Bay and at 11 oClock we Anchor'd under the S.W. side of one of the many Islands that line the SE side of this Bay it in 41/2 fathom water; but as we fell into this shoal'd water all at once, we anchor'd sooner then was intended and sent the master with two boats to sound, who soon found that we had got upon a bank that speted off from the NW end of the Island and that on the outside of it was 8 and 10 fathom water 
            
      

        30 November 1769
        Thursday 30thPM had the winds Westerly with some very heavy Showers of rain. We had no sooner come to an Anchor than between 3 and 4 hundred of the Natives Assembled in their Canoes about the Ship, some few was were admited on board and to one of the Chiefs I gave a piece of Broad Cloth and distributed a few Nails &Ca a Mongest some Others of them. Many of these people had been off to the Ship when we was were at sea and seem'd to be very sencible of the use of fire arms, and in the little trade we had with them they behaved tollerable well, but continued not long before some of them wanted to take away the Buoy and would not desist at the fireing of several Musquets untill one of them was hurt by small shott, after which they withdrew a small distance from the Ship and this was thought a good oppertunity to try what effect a great Gun would have as they had paid so little respect to the Musquets, and accordingly one was fired over their heads, this I beleive would have sent them quite off, if it had not been for Tobiaupia who soon preavaild upon them to return to the Ship. when their behaver was such as gave us no room to susspect that they meant to give us any farther trouble 
        After the Ship was moved into deeper water I went with the Pinnace and Yawl Man'd and Arm'd and landed upon the Island accompan'd by Mr Banks and Dr Solander       We had scarce landed before all the Canoes left the Ship and landed at different parts of the Island, and before we could well look about us we was were surrounded by 2 or 3 hundred people and notwithstanding that they were all arm'd they came upon us in suchthat a confused Stragleing manner that we hardly suspected that the[y] meant us any harm - but in this we was were very soon undeceaved for upon our indeavouring to draw a line on the sand between us and them they set up the war dance and immediatly some of them attempted to seize the two Boats     being disappointed in this, they next attempted to break in upon us, upon which I fir'd a Musquet load with small shott at one of the forwardest of them, and Mr Banks and 2 of the men fired immediatly after; this made them retire back a little; but in less than a minute one of the Chiefs rallied them again, Dr Solander seeing this gave him a peppering with small shott which sent him off and made them retire a second time; they attempted to rally several times after a and only seem'd to want some one of resolution to head them; but they were at last intirely dispersed by the Ship fire a few shott over their heads and a Musquet now and then from us 
        In this skirmish only one or two of them was hurt with small Shott,  for I avoided killing any one of them as much as possible and for that reason withheld our people from fireing. We had observed that some had hid themselves in a Cave in one of the Rocks, and some time after the whole was over we went towards them, the Chief who I have mintiond to have been on board the Ship happen'd to be one of these, he his wife and a nother man came out to meet us but the rest made off; these three people came and set down by us and we gave them of such things as we had about us. After this we went to another part of the Island where some of the inhabitants came to us and were as meek as Lambs. Having taken a Veiw of the Bay from the Island and loaded both boats wth sellery, which we found here in great plenty, we returnd on board and at 4 AM hove up the Anchor in order to put to sea with a light breeze at East but it soon falling Calm obliged us to Come too again, and about Eight or 9. oClock seeing no probabillity of our geting to sea I sent the Master with two boats to sound the harbour, but before this I order'd Mathw Cox, Henry Stevens and Manl Paroyra to be punished with a dozn lashes each for leaving thier duty when a shore last night and diging up Potatoies out of one of the Plantations, the first of the three I remited back to confinement because he insisted that their was no harm in what he had done. All this fore noon had abundance of the Natives about the Ship and some few on board; we trafficked with them for a few trifles in which they dealt very fair and friendly 
            
      

        1 December 1769
        Friday 1st December. Winds at NNW a Gentle breeze. At 3 PM the Boats having returnd from sounding, I went with them over to the south side of the Harbour and landed upon the Main, accompaned by Mr Banks and Dr Solander   we met with nothing new or remarkable, the place where we landed was in a small sandy Cove where there are two small streams of fresh water and plenty of Wood for fuel, here was were likewise severl little plantations planted with Potatoes and Yams; the soil and natural produce of the Cuntry was much the same as what we have hitherto met with. The people we saw behaved to us with great marks of friendship. In the evening we had some very heavy showers of rain and this brought us on board sooner than we intended  AM the wind being still contrary I sent some people a shore upon the Island to cut Grass for our Sheep in the doing of which the inhabitants gave them no sort of disturbance and in the same friendly manner did those behave that were along side the Ship. Punished Mathw Cox with half a Dozn lashes and then dismissed him -
            
      

        2 December 1769
        Saturday 2nd Winds at NW and North. PM a Gentle breeze the remainder Strong gales and hazey, with much rain towards noon. Between 2 and 4 AM the gunner having the Charge of the watch, he together with Alexr Simpson, Richd Littleboy and                found means to take, took out of the Spirit Cask, on the qaurter deck between 10 and 12 Gallons of Rum being the whole that was in the Cask they were caught in the very fact and part of the Rum was found in the their possession        Gunner Collin. The three men I punished with 12 lashes each but as to the Gunner who really desserved the whole upon his back is from his Drunkeness become the only useless person on board the Ship  I not only punished them with 12 Lashes each but stoped their allowance until it amounts to the quantity stolen
        At 8 AM hoisted out the Long-boat and set her a Shore for water and the Pinnace to haul the Seine; but they had not got well a Shore before it began to blow and rain very hard; this occasioned them to return on board with one turn of water and but a very few fish 
            
      

        3 December 1769
        Sunday 3rdPM Strong gales at North with rain the remainder gentle breezes from the westward     AM sent two Boats to Sound the harbour and one to haul the Sain, the latter of which met with very little success 
            
      

        4 December 1769
        Monday 4th Gentle breezes at NW. WNW, and West, and fair weather.  PM Mr Banks, Dr Solander and my self landed upon one of the Islands on the north side of the one the Ship lays under, known by the name of                 this Island is about 3 Miles in circuit and hath upon it 40 or 50 Acres of land cultivated and planted with roots; here are likewise several small Streams of excellent water, at one of which I intend to fill our empty Casks, in case we should be detaind here to morrow. This Island as well as most others in this Bay seem to be well Inhabited. At 4 AM sent the Long boat to the above Idfor water and some hands to cut grass, and at 9 I went with the Pinnace and yawl over upon the Main - accompaned by Mr Banks and Dr Solander in our way we pass'd round a point of land on which stood a Heppa or fortified Village the inhabitents of which waved to us to come ashore and accordingly we land, which we had no sooner done then the peol people came about us, with quantities of various sorts of fish which we purchass'd of them for meer trifles. After this they shew'd us the Village which was a neat compact place and its situation well cloose [chose]; there were 2 or 3 more near unto this but these we did not go to: we afterwards went a little way into the Country and had some of the Natives along with us - We met with a good deal of Cult[i]vated land planted mostly with sweet Potatoies - the face of the Country appear'd Green and pleasent, and the soil seem'd to be pretty rich and proper for Cultivation    the land is every where about this Bay of a moderate height but full of small hills and Vallies and not very much Cover'd incumber'd with wood. We met with about half a Dozn Cloth Plants, being the same as the inhabitants of the Islands lying within the Tropicks make their finest Cloth on; this plant must be very scarce among them as the Cloth made from it is only worn in small peices by way of ornaments at their ears and even this we have seen but very seldom      their knowing the use of this sort of Cloth doth in some measure account for the extraordinary fondness they have shew'd for it above every other thing we had to give them - even a sheet of white paper is of more Value than so much English cloth of any sort what ever; but as we have been at few places where I have not given away more or less of the latter its more than probable that they will soon learn to set a Value upon it and likewise upon Iron a thing not one of them knows the use of or sets the least Value upon. But was European commodities in ever such esteem among them they have no one thing of equal Value to give in return    at least that we have seen 
            
      

        5 December 1769
        Tuesday 5thPM had the winds at SW and WSW a fresh breeze. At 3 oClock we returnd on board and after dinner viseted a nother part of the Bay, but met with nothing new: by the evening all our empty Casks were fill'd with water and had at the same time got on board a large quantity of Sellery which is found here in great plenty.   this I still continue to be boild every morning with Oatmeal and Portable Soup for the ships companies breakfast - At 4 AM weigh'd with a light breeze at SE, but had Variable light airs and sometimes calm untill near noon when a gentle breeze sprung up at North - at this time we had not got out of the Bay.    our Latitude by observation was 35°..9' St This Bay I have before observed, lies on the West side of Cape Brett. I have named it the Bay of Islands on account of the great number which line its shores and these help to form several safe and Commodious harbours where in is room and depth of water sufficient for any number of Shipping.     the one we lay in is on the SW side of the South westermost Island that lies on the SE side of the Bay. I have made no accurate survey of this Bay   the time it would have required to have done this discouraged me from attempting of it     besides I thought it quite sufficient to be able to affirm with certainty that it affords good anchorage, and every kind of refreshments for Shipping; but as this was not the season for roots, we got only fish some few we caught our selves with hook and line and in the Saine but by farr the greatest part we purchass'd of the Natives and these of Various sorts, such as Shirks, sting-rays, Breams, Mullet, Mackarel and several other sorts; their way of catching of them is are the same as ours, / viz / with hooks and lines and with saines, of these last they have some prodigious large made all of a Strong kind of grass. The Mackarel are in every respect the same as those we have in England only some of them are larger than any I ever saw in any other part of the world; altho this is the season for this fish we have never been able to catch one with hook and line 
        The Inhabitants of this Bay are far more numerous than at any other place we have yet been in and seem to live in friendship one with a nother altho it doth not att all appear that they are united under one head. they inhabited both the Islands and the main and have a number of Heppa's or strong holds, and these are all built upon such place as nature hath in a great part fortified and what she hath left undone the people themselves have finished 
        It is high-water in this Bay at full and Change of the Moon about 8 oClock and the tide at these times rises and falls upon a perpendicular, 6 or 8 feet. It appears from the few observations I have been able to make of the tides on the Sea Coast, that the flood comes from the southward; and I have lately had reasons to think that there is a Current which comes from the westward and sets along shore to the SE or SSE as the Land lays
            
      

        6 December 1769
        Wednesday, 6thPM had a gentle breeze at NNW, with which we kept turning out of the Bay but gain'd little or nothing, in the evening it fell little wind at 10 oClock it was Calm: at this time the tide or Current seting the Ship near one of the Islands where we was very near being a shore but by the help of our boat and a light air from the southward we got clear; about an hour after when we thought ourselves out of all danger the Ship struck upon a Sunken rock and went immediatly clear without receiving any perceptible damage; just before the man in the chains had 17 fathom water and immediatly after she struck 5 fathom, but very soon deepen'd to 20. This rock lies half a mile WNW off from the northermost or outermost Island that lies on the SE side of the Bay. Had light airs from the land and some times Calm untill 9 oClock AM, by this time we had got out of the Bay and a breeze springing up at NNW, we stood out to sea - At Noon Cape Brett bore SSE1/2E distant 10 Miles. Latd Observed 34°.59' St
            
      

        7 December 1769
        Thursday 7thPM A fresh breeze from the westward and Clear weather. At 3 oClock took several observations of the Sun and Moon the mean result of them gives 185°..36' West Longitude from the meridian of Greenwich  What winds we have had this 24 hours hath been againest us so that at Noon we had advanced but very little to the Westward 
            
      

        8 December 1769
        Friday 8th Fore part of PM had a Gentle breeze at NNW, with which we tracked stood in Shore and fetched close under the Cavalle Islands we was the length of before we bore up for the Bay of Islands, they are a Groupe of small Islands lying close under the Main land and 7 Leagues N. 60° West from Cape Brett and 31/2 Leagues from point Rodney.
        From these Islands and the Main land trends We stand WBN. We was were here Viseted by several Canoes, and the people in them seem'd desirous of trafficking with us but at this time a breeze of wind sprung up at South.   they could not keep up with the Ship and I would not wait for them. The wind did, not continue long at South before it veer'd to SW and West a light breeze. Found the Variation in the Evening to be 12°..42' Et and in the morning 13° East. Kept standing to the Westwardnorthwest and NW untill 10 AM at which time we tacked and stood in for the shore being about 5 Leagues off and in this situation had 118 fathom water - At Noon Cape Brett bore S.E. distant 13 Leagues and the westermost land in sight bore WBS; being at this time about 4 Leags from the Land - Latd in pr Observation, 34°..42' So
            
      

        9 December 1769
        Saturday 9thPM had a gentle breeze at West which in the evening came to south and continued so all night, this by day light in the Morning brought us pretty well in with the land 7 Leagues to the westward of the Cavalle Isles and where lies a deep Bay runing in SWBW and WSW, the bottom of which we could but just seeand there the land appear'd to be low and level; the two points which form the entrence lie WSW WNW and ENE ESE 5 Miles from each other. This Bay I have named Doubtless Bay
        The wind not permiting us to look into this Bay we steer'd for the westermost land we had in sight - which bore from us WNW distant 3 Leagues but before we got the length of it, it fell calm and continued so untill 10 oClock, when a breeze sprung up at West NW and with it we stood off North. While we lay becalm'd several of the Natives came off to the Ship in five Canoes, but were fearfull of ventering along side, after these were gone Six more more came off these last came boldly along side and sold us fish of different sorts sufficient to give all hands a little 
        At Noon the Cavalle Isles bore SEBE distant 8 Leagues and the Entrence of Doubtless Bay SBW distant 3 Leagues, and the nor-west extremity of the land in sight, which we judge to be the Main bore NWBW. Our Latitude by obsern was 34°..44' So 
            
      

        10 December 1769
        Sunday 10th Had the winds from the western board all this Day, a gentle breeze and clear weather. In the evening found the Variation to [be] 12°..41' Et pr Azth and 12°..40' by the Amplitude. In the Morning we stood close in with the land Six Seven Leagues to the westward of Doubtless Bay, here the shore forms a nother large open Bay lying in south about 3 or 4 Leagues.    the bottom of this Bay and that of Doubtless bay cannot be far from each other being to all appearence only seperated by a low neck of land from which juts out a peninsula or headland which I have named Knockle point. WBS Six Leagues from this point and about the middle of the bay is a high mountain or hill standing upon a disart shore on which account we call'd it Mount Camel  Latd 34°..51' - Longde 186°..50'. In the entrance of this Bay it we had 24 and 25 fathom Water and the bottom good for anchorage; but there seems to be nothing that can induce shipping to put into it for no Country upon Earth can looke more barren than the land about this Bay doth   it is in general low except the mountain just mentioned and the Soil to all appearence nothing but white sand thrown up in low irregular hills lying in narrow ridges parrallel with the Shore: this ocasioned Mr Banks to give it the name it Sandy bay   The first ride behind the sea beach is partly cover'd with shrubs Plants &Ca but the second ridge hath hardly any green thing upon it which induced me to think that it lies open to the western Sea. As barren as this land appears it is not without inhabitants.   we saw a Village on the West point of the Bay side of Mount Camel and a nother on the Eastern side, besides five Canoes that were pulling off to the Ship but did not come up with us - At 9 AM we tack'd and stood to the northward - At Noon Latitude in by Observation 34°..38' So The Cavalle Isles bore SEBE distant 13 Leagues the nothern extremity of the land in sight making like an Island bore NW1/4N Distant 9 Leagues and the West point of Mount Camel  bore SWBS distant 6 Leagues - Tack'd and stood in shore 
            
      

        11 December 1769
        Monday 11th Gentle breezes at N.W and pleasent weather- Kept plying all this day, but got very little to wind ward. At Noon was in the latitude of 34°..32' St the no[r]thermost point of land in sight set yesterday at noon bore NWBW Distce 6 or 7 Leagues 
            
      

        12 December 1769
        Tuesday 12th Moderate breezes of Winds between the North-west and north and smooth water, yet we gain'd very little in plying to windward - At Noon the West point of Mount Camel bore SBW1/4W distt 4 or 5 Leagues- Latd Obd 34°..34' So
            
      

        13 December 1769
        Wednesday 13th Fore part of PM Moderate breezes at NBW and fair weather. Stood in shore untill 5 oClock at which time we tack'd and stood to the NE; being 2 Leagues to the northward of Mount Camel and 11/2 Miles from shore and in this situation had 22 fathom water   At 10, it begun to blow and rain which brought us under double Reef'd topsails - At 12 Tackd and stood to the westward untill 7 AM when we tackd and stood again to the NE, being at this time about a Mile to windward of the place where we tack'd last night. Soon after we tack'd it came on to blow very hard at NNW with heavy squalls attended with rain, this brought us under our Courses and split the Main topsail in so much such a manner that it was necessary to unbend it and bring a nother to the yard - At 10 it fell more Moderate and we set the topsails double reef'd - At Noon had strong gales and hazey weather - tack'd and stood to the westwd No land in sight, for the first time sence we have been upon the Coast 
            
      

        14 December 1769
        Thursday 14th Strong gales at west and WSW with Squals at times attended with rain. At half past 3 PM Tackd and Stood to the northward a small Id lying off the East point Knockle point bore of          Bay S1/2W distant half a Leagues- In the evining [evening] brought the ship under her Courses, having first split the fore and Mizn Topsails At Mid night wore and stood to the southward untill 5 AM, then Tack'd and stood to the NW, at this time saw the land bearing South, distant 8 or 9 Leagues, by this we found that we had fell very much to Leeward sence yesterday morning. Set the Topsails close reef'd and the people to work to dry and repair the damaged sails  At Noon a Strong gale and clear weather, Latd obd 34°..6' So Saw land bearing S.W. being the same North- Westermost land we have seen before and which I take to be the northern extremity of this Country as we have now a large swell rowling in from the westward which could not well be was we covered by any land on that point of the compass 
            
      

        15 December 1769
        Friday 15th Fresh gales at S.W. and for the most part clear weather, with a large swell from the westward. At 8 PM tacked and stood to the S.E. until 8 AM then tack'd and stood to the westward with as much sail as the Ship could bear. At Noon was we were in the Latitude of 34°.10' St and Longd 185°..45' west and by estimation about 11 Leagues from the Land notwithstanding we use'd our utmost endeavours to keep in with it 
            
      

        16 December 1769
        Saturday 16th Fresh breeze between the SBW and S.W, Clear weather with a swell from the westward 
        At 6 AM Saw the land from the Mast Head bearing S.S.W. got topgt yards up and set the sails; unbent the foresail to repair and brought a nother to the yard 
        At Noon Latd Obd 33°..43' So Course made sence yesterday Noon N 60° West distant 56 Miles. The land in sight bearing SBW distant 14 Leagues 
            
      

        17 December 1769
        Sunday 17th A Gentle breeze between the SWBW and West, with Clear weather - In Standing inshore sounded several times but had no ground with 90 fathoms of line - At 8 AM tacked in 108 fathom 3 or 4 miles from the Shore, being the same point of land as we had to the N.W. of us before we was were blown off - At Noon it bore SW distant about 3 Miles, the West head of Mount Camel bore SBE distant 11 Leagues and the westermost land in sight bore So 75° Wt Latd observed 34°..20' S. The people at work repairing the Sails.    the most of them having been split in the late blowing weather 
            
      

        18 December 1769
        Monday 18th Moderate breezes at West and WNW and Clear weather. At 4 PM Tack'd and and stood inshore, in the doing of which we met with a strong rippling and the Ship fell fast to leeward occasioned as we thought by a Current seting to the Eastward, at 8 Tack'd and stood off north untill 8 AM when we tacked and stood in being about 10 Leagues from the land: At Noon the point of land we wasere near yesterday at noon bore SSW distt 5 Leagues, Latd Obd 34°..8' So -
            
      

        19 December 1769
        Tuesday 19th The Wind still continues at West. PM a moderate breeze and clear weather    At 7 Tacked in 35 fathom water, the point of land before mentioned bore NWBN distant 4 or 5 miles, having not gained one Inch to windward this last 24 hours which is a great proof that there must be a Current seting to the Eastward. The Point of land above mentioned I have call'd North Cape judgeing it to be the northern most extremity of this Country  it lies in the Latitude of 34°..22' So and Longd 186°..55' West from Greenwich and N 63°: West 31 Leagues from C. Brett   It forms the north point of Sandy Bay and is a Peninsula juting out NE about 2 Miles and terminates in a bluff head which is flat at top; the Isthmus which joins this head to the Main land is very low on which account the land of the Cape from several situations make like an Island. It appears still more remarkable when to the southward of it by the appearence of a high round Island at the SE point of the Cape.   but this is likewise a deception being a round hill join'd to the Cape by a low narrow neck of land. On the SE side of the Cape is a Bay wherein there appears to be Anchorage, and where ships must be coverd from S.W. and N.W. winds. We saw a Heppa or Village upon the Cape and some few inhabitants. In the night had some squalls attended with rain which obliged us to take a nother reef in our topsails. At 8 AM tack'd and stood in shore and being moderate loos'd a reef out of each topsail and set the small sails. At Noon was we were in the Latitude of 34°.. 2' So and being hazey over the land we did not see it 
            
      

        20 December 1769
        Wednesday 20thPM Fresh breeze at W.BN. and clear weather. At 6 Tack'd and stood off. North Cape bore South distant 3 or 4 Miles. At 4 AM tackd and stood in Wind at WNW a fresh breeze.    but at 9 it increased to a Strong gale with heavy squalls attended with Thunder and rain which brought us under our Courses. At a 11 it cleared up and the wind came to WSW, we set the topsails double reef'd and tackd and stood to the North-west 
        At Noon a Stiff gale and clear weather. Latd Obd 34°..14, North Cape SSW distant 3 Leagues 
            
      

        21 December 1769
        Thursday 21st Fresh breeze at SW, and clear weather with a heavy swell first from the West than from the SW. At 8 AM loose'd the 2nd reefs out of the topsails. At noon clear weather, no land in sight 
        The North Cape bore S 25° East distant 24 Leagues. Latde observed 33°..17' So 
            
      

        22 December 1769

        Saturday 23d Gentle breezes between the SBW S.B.W. and SW. and clear settled weather with a swell from the SW. Course and distance sail'd sence yesterday at Noon is So 60° East 30 Miles. Latitude observed 33°..17' So North Cape St 36' East distant 27 Leagues 
            
      

        24 December 1769
        Sunday 24th Light Airs next to a Calm all this 24 all this 24 hours. At 7 PM saw the land from the mast head bearing S1/2 E. At 11 AM saw it again bearing SSE distant 8 Leagues  At Noon Latde Obserd 33°..48' So 
            
      

        25 December 1769
        Monday 25th A Gentle breeze at SE the weather a little hazey. PM stood to the S.W. At 4 the land above mentioned bore SEBS distant 4 Leagues. It proves to be a small Island which we take to be the Three Kings discover'd by Tasman: there are several smaller Islands or Rocks lying off the SW. end and one at the NE end. It lies in the Latde of 34°..10' So and Longitude 187°..45' West 14° and west 14° North 14 or 15 Leags from the North Cape. At Midnight Tack'd and Stood to the NE untill 6 AM then tack'd and Stood to the Southward. At Noon the Island of the Three Kings bore East 8° north distant 5 or 6 Leagues. Latde Obsd 34°..12' So Longitude In 188°..5' West Variation pr Azths taken this morning 11°..25' Et -

        Tuesday 26th Moderate breezes Easterly and hazey weather. Standing to the southward close upon a wind at Noon was in the Latd of 35°..10' So and Longd 188°..20' Wt. The Island of the Three Kings N. 26° West distt 22 Leage. In this situation had no land in sight and yet by observation we are in the Latitude of the Bay of Islands and by my reckoning but 30 Leagues to the westward of the North Cape from whence it appears that the northern part of this Land must be very narrow otherwise we must have seen some part of the west side of it 
            
      

        27 December 1769
        Wednesday 27th Winds at East PM a fresh gale with which we stood to the Southward untill 12 at night then tack'd and Stood to the Northward. At 4 AM the wind began to freshen, and increased in such a manner that at 9 we was were obliged to bring the Ship too under her main sail; it blowing at this time excessive hard with heavy squalls attended with rain and at the same time thick hazey weather. Course made good sence yesterday at Noon SSW1/2W distance 11 Miles, Latd in 35°..19' So Longd in 188°..29' West. The Island of the Three Kings, N. 27° Et distt 77 Miles 
            
      

        28 December 1769
        Thursday 28th The gale continued without the least intermission untill 2 AM when the wind fell a little and began to veer to the Southward and to SW where it fix'd at 4, and we set the fore made sail and steer'd East in for the land under the Foresail and main-sail but was soon obliged to take in the latter as it began to blow very hard and increased in such a manner that by 8 oClock it was a meer hurricane attended with rain and the Sea run prodigious high, at this time we wore the Ship haul'd up the Fore-sail and brought her too with her head to the NW under a reef'd Main-sail, but this was scarce done before the Main tack gave way and we were glad to take in the Main sail and lay under the Mizen stay-sail and Ballance'd Mizen, after which we reef'd the Fore-sail and furl'd both it and the Main-sail. At Noon the gale was a little abated, but had still heavy squalls attended with rain - Our Course made good to day is North a little easterly 29 miles. Latde in pr Accot 34°. 50' So Longde in 188°..27' West. The Three Kings N. 41° E distant 52 Miles.
            
      

        29 December 1769
        Friday 29th Winds at SW and SWBW, A very hard gale with squalls, but mostly fair weather. At 7 PM wore and lay on the other tack. At 6 AM loose'd the reef out of the fore-sail and set it and the reef'd Main sail. At 11 unbent both Fore-sail and main-sail to repair and bent others and made sail under them. At Noon Latd Obd 34°..45' So Course & distance sail'd sence yesterday EBN. 29 Mi[les]
            
      

        30 December 1769
        Saturday 30th Winds at S.W. PM hard gales with some squalls attended with rain. AM More Modte and fair. At 8 PM wore and Stood to the N.W. untill 5 AM then wore and stood to the SE and being pretty moderate we set the Topsails close reef'd, but the SW Sea runs so high that the Ship goes boddily to leeward At 6 Saw the land bearing NE distant about 7 6 Leagues which we judge to be the same as Tasman calls Cape Maria Van Diemen. at Noon it bore NNE1/2E and we could see the land extend to the East and southward as far as SEBE.   our Latitude by Obser. 34°..55'
            
      

        31 December 1769
        Saturday 31st Fresh gales at SW and SWBS accompaned by a large sea from the same quarter   At 1 PM Tacked and stood to the NW untill 8 then stood to the SE. At this time the Island of the Three Kings bore NWBW distant 11 Leagues and Cape Maria Van Diemen NBE. At midnight wore and stood to the NW untill 4 AM then wore and stood to the SE. At Noon our Latitude by obsern was 34°..42' So the land of Cape Maria Van Diemen bore NEBN distant about 5 Leagues
            
      

        17701 January 1770
        Monday, 1st Janry 1770. PM fresh breeze and at SWBS and squally, the remainder moderate breezes at SWBS and SW clear weather. At 7 PM Tack'd and Stood to the Westward, the high land over the West point of           which lies on the Eastern side of the coast At this time Mount Camel bore N. 83° East and the northermost land or Cape Maria Van Diemen NBW, being distant from the nearest shore 3 Leagues; in this situation had 40 fathom water. Note, the high land above mentioned Mount Camel doth not appear to lay little more than a Mile from the sea on this side and about the same distance on the other, so that the land here cannot be above 2 or 3 Miles broad from sea to sea, which is what I conjecter'd when we wasere in Sandy bay on the other side of the coast.  At 6 AM tack'd and Stood to the Eastward the Island of the Three Kings NWBN - At Noon tack'd again and stood to the westward being in the latitude of 34°..37' So The Island of the 3 Kings bore NWBN distant 10 or 11 Leagues and a point of land      Leagues to the westward of the north Cape bore and Cape Maria Vandiemen N. 31° Et distant 41/2 Leagues, in this situation had 54 fathom water. I cannot help thinking but whatIt will appear a little strange that at this season of the year we should be three weeks in getting 10 Leagues to the westward and five weeks in geting 50 Leagues for so long it is sence we pass'd C. Brett -  but it will hardly be credited that in the midest of summer and in the Latitude of 35° such a gale of wind as we have had could have happen'd, which for its strength and continuence was such as I hardly was ever in before -  Fortunately at this time we were a good distance from land otherwise it would have proved fatal to us 
            
      

        2 January 1770
        Tuesday 2d Fresh breezes at SSW and West accompan'd with a rowling Sea from the SW    At 5 PM the wind veering to the westward we tack'd and stood to the Southward. at this time the North Cape bore E3/4N and was just open of a point that lies 3 Leagues west and by south from it and this is what I suppose Tasman calls Cape Maria Van Dieman a name I shall not continue in my map but shall comprehend under the name of the North Cape    the Whole of the point of this Peninsula; being now well assured that it is the Northermost extremity of this Country and is the East point of a Peninsula which stretches out NW and NWBN, 17 or 18 Leags and as I have before observe'd is for the most part low and narrow except its extremity where the land is tollerable high and extends 5 4 or 5 Leagues every way, the middle of it being in the Longitude of  way, Cape Maria Vandeimen is the west point of this peninsula and lies in the Latitude of 34° 30' Longde 187° 18' West from Greenwich and the most northermost point lies in the Latitude of 34° 22' South From this westermost part of the Cape the land trends away SEBS and SE to and behond Mount Camel    and is everywhere a barren shore affording no better a prospect than what ariseth from white sand banks. At 1/2 past 7 PM the Islands of the Three Kings bore NWBN and the west part of the North Cape Cape Maria Van diemenNEBE distt 4 Leagues. At 5 AM the North Cape C Maria Vandeemen bore NNE1/2E and Mount Camel  bore East - At Noon was in the Latd of 35°.17' and the north Cape Maria Van diemen by judgment bore North distant 16 Leagues having no land in sight not daring to go near it as the wind blow'd fresh right on Shore and a high rowling Sea from the same quarter, and knowing that there was no harbour that we could put into in case we were caught upon a lee shore 
            
      

        3 January 1770
        Wednesday 3rd Winds at WSW and SW   PM a fresh breeze and squally - the remainder Moderate with frequent squalls attended with rain. In the evening shorten'd sail and at Midnight Tackd and made a trip to the NW untill 2 AM then wore and stood to the Southward    At Day light made sail and edge'd away in order to make the land, at 10 saw it bearing NE, and appear'd to be high land, At Noon it extended from North to ENE distant by estimation 8 or 10 Leagues Our Latitude by observation was 36° 2' Soand the North Cape Maria Van diemen bore N 2° 30' West, Distt 33 Leagues - A high rowling swell from the S.W.
            
      

        4 January 1770
        Thursday 4th Winds at SW and SWBS mostly a fresh gale accompanied with a rowling sea from the same quarter. Being desirous of taking as near a View of the Coast as we could with safty, we kept edgeing in for it untill 7 oClock PM, being at this time 6 Leagues from the Land, we then haul'd our wind to S.E. and kept on that course close upon the wind all night sounding several times but had no ground with 100 and 110 fathoms 
        At 8 oClock AM was about 5 Leagues from the land and a place which lies in the Latd of 36° 25' that had the appearence of a Bay or inlet bore East. In order to see more of this place we kept on our Course untill a 11 oClock when we was were not above 3 Leagues from it and then found that it was neither a Bay nor inlet, but low land bounded on each side by higher lands which caused the deception. At this time we tack'd and stood to the N.W. At Noon was we were between 3 and 4 Leagues from the land and in the Latitude of 36°..31' and Longd 185°..50' West. the West part of the North Cape Maria Vandiemen bore N. 25° West Distant 441/2 Leags from this I form my judgment of the deriction of this Coast which is nearly SSE3/4E and NNW3/4W and mustand appears to be nearly a strait Shore, except to the southward of the northward of the north Cape where the land takes a more Easterly and westerly direction and by that means must form a bending in the length. In about the Latitude 35°..45' is some high land adjoining to the sea.   to the Southward of that the land is of a Moderate height and wears a most desolate and inhospitable aspect, nothing is to be seen but large Sand hills with hardly any green thing up[on] them and the great sea which the prevailing westerly winds impell upon the Shore must render this a very dangerous Coast, this I am so fully sencible of that was we once clear of it I am determined not to come so near again if I can possible avoide it unless we have a very favourable wind indeed 

        Monday 8th Gentle breezes at NE and pleasent weather. At 6 PM saw the land bearing East and some time after saw a Turtle upon the water - At Noon the land extending from North to East distant 5 or 6 Leagues being the high land before mentioned and which is intersected in two places, each having the appearence of a Bay or inlet but I beleive it is only low land.

        Wednesday 10th Winds at NNE and North, the first part a gentle breeze, the remainder a fresh breeze and Clowdy with rain towards Noon. Continued a SE Course until 8 oClock PM at which time we had run 7 Leags sence noon and were between 3 and 4 Leagues from the land which appear'd to be low and sandy such as I have before discribed. We then steer'd SEBE in a Parrallel direction with the Coast, our depth of water from 48 to 34 fathom a black sandy bottom. At day light found our selves between Three Two and 3 Leagues from the land which was of a moderate height and cloathed with wood and Verdure; at 7 oClock steerd SBE and afterwards SBW, the land laying in that deriction. At 9 was a breast of a point of land which rises sloaping from the Sea to a Considerable height. it lies in the latitude of 37°..43' South. I named it Woody head    SW1/2W 11 Miles from this Cape head is a very small Island which we named Gannet Island, on account of the great number of these Birds we saw upon it. At Noon a high Craggy point bore ENE EN distant 11/2 League; this point I have named Albetross point 
        It lies in the Latitude of 38°..4' So and Longde 184°..42' W and from Woody head So 17° Wt 7 Legs   On the North side of it the shore forms a Bay wherein there appears to be anchorage and shelter for Shipping againest Southerly winds.

        11 January 1770
        Thursday 11th At 1/2 past Noon the wind shifted at once from NNE to SSW, with which we stood to the westward untill 4 oClock PM than tack'd and stood in shore untill 7 when we gain Stood to the westward having but little wind,   at this time Albetross point bore NE distant near 2 Leagues and the southermost land in sight bore SSW1/2W, being a very high Mountain and made very much like the Peak of Tenerieff, in this situation had 30 fathom water    Had little wind all night, at 4 AM Tack'd and stood in shore, but it soon after fell Calm and being in 42 fathom water the people caught about 10 or a Dozn Bream, at 11 a light breeze sprung up from the westward and we made sail to the Southward   At Noon was by observation in the Latitude of 38°..4' St   Albetross point bore due East distant 5 or 6 Leagues
            
      

        12 January 1770
        Thursday 11Friday 12th Gentle breezes from between the NW and NNE, fore and middle parts Clear weather, the latter part dark and Clowdy. Steering along shoreSBW and SSW at the distance of 4 Leagues off. At 7 PM saw the top of the peaked Mountain to the southward above the Clowds bearing from us South and at the same time the southermost land we had in sight bore SBW. Took several azths both in the evening and the morning which gave the Variation 14°.15' Easterly - At Noon had the winds very Variable with dark clowdy weather attended with excessive heavy showers of rain, at this time we were about 3 Leagues from the shore which lies under the peaked Mountain before mentioned, this Peak we did not see it being hid in the Clowds but judged it to bear about SSE, and some very remarkable peaked Islands lying under the Shore call'd the Sugar loaves bore ESE distant 3 or 4 Leagues.
            
      

        13 January 1770
        Saturday 13th Winds Variable, PM Clowdy weather    At 7 oClock sounded and had 42 fathom water, being distant from the shore between 2 and 3 Leagues, and the peaked mountain as near as I could judge bore East. After it was dark saw a fire upon the shore a sure sign that the Country is inhabited. In the night had some Thunder Lightning, and rain. At 5 AM saw for a few Minutes the Top of the peaked Mountain above the Clowds, bearing NE; It is of a prodigious height and its top is cover'd with everlasting snow. It lies in the Latitude of 39°..16' St and in the Longitude of 185°..15' Wt I have named it Mount Egmont in honour of the Earl of Egmont 
        This mountain seems to have a pretty large base and to rise with a gradual assent to the peak and what makes it more conspicuous is, its being situated near the Sea, and in the middle of and a low flat Country in its neighbourhood which afforded a very good asspect   being cloathed with Wood and Verdure. The shore under the foot of this mountain forms a large Cape which I have named Cape Egmont   it lies SSW1/2W, 27 Leags from Albetross point. On the NE side of the Cape lay two small Islands or Rocks near to a very remarkable point on the Main that riseth to a good height in the very form of a Sugr Loafe: To the Southward of the Cape the land tends away SEBE and ESE and seems to be every where a bold shore. At Noon had variable light airs and clear weather. Latitude Observe'd 39°..32' St Cape Egmont bore about NE and we were about 4 Leagues from the Shore in that direction. in this situation had 40 fathoms water
            
      

        14 January 1770
        Sunday 14thPM had a gentle breeze at West which afterwards in the Even.g Came to NWBW and continued so all night and blowed a fresh breeze. We steer'd along shore ESE and SEBE, keeping between two and three Leagues off    At 1/2 past 7 PM saw for a few minutes Mount Egmont which bore from us N 17° Wt distant 10 Leagues. At 5 AM steer'd SEBS the land inclineing more southerly, but half an hour after we saw land bearing SWBS which we haule'd up for, at this time the weather was squally attended with showers of rain. At Noon had a steady fresh breeze at WBN and Clowdy weather; the SW extremity of the land in sight bore So 63° West and some high land which makes like an Island lying under the Main bore SSE distant 5 Leagues: The bottom of the Bay we are now in, and which bears from us south, we cannot see, altho it is very clear in that quarter. Our Latitude by observation is 40° 27' So Longitude 184°.. 39' West 
            
      

        15 January 1770
        Monday 15th Fore and middle parts fresh breezes between the West and NW and fair weather. At 8 PM we were within 2 Leagues of the land we discover'd in the morning - having run 10 Leagues sence Noon.   the land seen than bearing S 63° West bore now N. 59° West, distant 7 or 8 Miles Leags and makes like an Island, between this land or Island and Cape Egmont is a very broad and deep Bay or Inlet the SW side of which we are now upon, and here the land is of a considerable height distinguished by hills and Vallies and the shore seems to form several Bays into one of which I intend to go with the Ship in order to Careen her / she being very foul / and to repair some few defects, recrute our stock of Wood, Water, &Ca - with this View we kept plying on and off al[l] night having from 80 to 63° fathoms water, At day light stood in for an Inlet which runs in SW   at 8 AM was we were got within the entrance which may be known by a reef of rocks stretching off from the NW point and some rocky Island lying off the SE point - At 9 oClock being little wind and variable we were carried by the Tide or current within 2 Cable lengths of the NW shore where we had 54 fathoms water, but with the help of our Boats we got her Clear, At this time we saw rise up twice near the Ship a Sea lyon the head of which was exactly like the head of the male one described Lord Anson  We likewise saw a c Canoe with some of the Natives Cross the Bay and a Village situatid upon apoint of an Island which lies 7 or 8 Miles with the Entrence. At Noon was we were the length of this Island, and being little wind had the boats ahead towing 
            
      

        16 January 1770
        Tuesday 16th Variable light airs and clear settled weather. At 1 PM hauled close round the SW end of the Island on which stands the Village before mentioned the inhabitants of which were all in arms - At 2 oClock we Anchor'd in a very snug Cove which is on the NW side of the Bay faceing the So West end of the Island, in 11 fath. water soft ground and moor'd with the Stream anchor. By this time several of the Natives had come off to the Ship in their canoes and after heaving a few stones at us and having some conversation with Tobiaupia some of them venture'd on board where they made but a very short stay before they went into their boats again and soon after left us altogether. I then went a Shore in the bottom of the Cove accompanied by most of the Gentlemen, we found a fine stream of excellent water, and as to Wood the land is here one intire forest - having the Saine with us we made a few hauls and caught 300 pounds weight of different sorts of fish which was were equally distributd to the Ships Compney. AM Careend the Ship scrub'd and pay'd the Larboard side. Several of the Natives Visited us this morning and brought with them some stinking fish which how ever I order'd to be bought up in order to incourage them in this kind of trafick, but trade at this time seem'd [not] to be their object, but were more inclineable to quarrel and as the Ship was upon the careen I thought they might give us some trouble and perhaps hurt some of our people that were in the boats along side; for this reason I fire'd some small Shott at one of the first offenders     this made them keep at a proper distance while they stayd which was not long before they all went away. These people declared to us this morning that they never either saw or heard of a Ship like ours being upon this coast before. from this it appears that they have no Tradition among them of Tasman being here, for I beleive Murderers Bay the place where he Anchor'd not to be far from this place but this cannot be it from the Latitude for I find by an observation made this day at Noon that we are at an anchor in 41°.. 5'..32" S which is 15' to the southward of Murderers Bay
            
      

        17 January 1770
        Wednesday 17th Light airs Calm and pleasent weathr    PM righted the Ship and got ready for heeling out the other side, and in the evening hauled the Saine and caught a few fish, while this was doing some of us went in the Pinnace into a nother Cove not far from where the Ship lays; in going thether we meet with a Woman floating upon the water who to all appearence had not been dead many days,  Soon after we landed we meet with two or three of the natives who not long before must have been regailing themselves upon human flesh for I got from one of them the bone of the fore arm of a Man or a Woman which was quite fresh and the flesh had been but lately pick'd off which they told us they had eat    they gave us to understand that but a few days before they had taken and Kill'd and eat a Boats crew of their enemies, or strangers, for I beleive they look upon all strangers as enemies; from what we could learn the Woman we had seen floating upon the water was in this boat and had been drownded in the fray. There was not one of us that had the least doubt but what this people were Canabals but the finding this Bone with a small part of the sinews fresh upon it was a stronger proof than any we had yet met with, and in order to be fully satisfied of the truth of what they had told us, we told one of them that it was not the bone of a man but that of a Dog but he with great fervency took hold of his fore-arm and told us again that it was that bone and to convence us that they had eat the flesh he took hold of the flesh of his own arm with his teeth and made shew of eating  AM Careen'd scrub'd and pay'd the Starboard side of the Ship: while this was doing some of the natives came a long side seemingly only to look at us, there was a woman among them who had her arms, thighs and legs cut in several places, this was done by way of Mourning for her husband who had very lately been kill'd and eat by some of their enimies as they told us and pointed to the towards the place where it was done, which lay some where to the Eastward. Mr Banks got from one of them a bone of the fore arm much in the same state as the one before mention'd and to shew us that they eat the flesh they bit a[nd] naw'd the bone and draw'd it through their mouth and this in such a manner as plainly shew'd that the flesh to them was a dainty bit 
            
      

        18 January 1770
        Thursday 18th Winds mostly from the SW a gentle breeze and clear settled weather. PM righted the Ship and sent on Shore all or most of our empty Casks, and in the morning the Coopers went about triming them and the Carpenters went to work to black the bends, Caulk the sides and to repair other defects in the Ship, while the Seamen were employ'd in the hold, cutting Wood &Ca &Ca 
        I made a little excursion in the Pinnace in order to take a View of the Bay, accompanied by Mr Banks and Dr Solander, We met with nothing remarkable and as we were on the west side of the Bay where the land is so closely cover'd with Wood that we could not penetrate into the Country 
            
      

        19 January 1770
        Friday 19th Winds and weather as yesterday and the employment of the people the same. In the PM some of our people found in the skirts of the Wood three hip bones of Men,  they lay near to a hole or hoven, that is aplace where the natives dress their Victuals, this circumstance trifleing as it is, is still a further proff that this people eat human flesh 
        In the AM set up the Forge to repair the braces of the Tiller and such other Iron work as is was wanting. The natives came along side and sold us a quantity of large Mackerel for nails peices of Cloth and paper, and in this traffeck they never once attemptd to defraud us of any one thing, but dealt as fair as people could do 
            
      

        20 January 1770
        Saturday 20th Winds Southerly, fair and pleasant weather. Employ'd Wooding, Watering &Ca and in the AM sent part of the powder ashore to be air'd. Some of the Natives brought a long side in one of their Canoes four of the heads of the men they had lately kill'd, both the Hairy-scalps and skin of the faces were on: Mr Banks bought one of the four, but they would not part with any of the other on any account whatever   the one Mr Banks got had received a blow on the Temple that had broke the skull 
        This morning I set out in the Pinnace, accompanied by Mr Banks and Dr Solander, in order to survey the West Coast of the Bay, we took our rout towards the head of the Bay but it was near noon before we had got behon'd the place we had been before 
            
      

        21 January 1770
        Sunday 21stPM a gentle breeze of wind Southerly the remainder light airs and calms, with clear settled weather.  PM the People employed as usual and at 8 oClock we return'd on board with Pinnace from surveying the Bay in the doing of which I met with an excellent harbour but saw no Inhabitants or any Cultivated land 
        In the AM after hauling the Saine for fish I gave every body leave to go a Shore at the Watering place to amuse themselves as they thought proper 
            
      

        22 January 1770
        Monday 22dPM and in the night had Variable light airs and Calms, AM had a fresh breeze Southly and Clowdy weather. In the morning the people were set about the necessary business of the Ship and I set out in the Pinnace / accompanied by Mr Banks and Dr Solander / with a view of examining the head of the Inlet, but after rowing between 4. and 5 Leagues up it and finding no probability of reaching or even seeing the end of it and the wind being againest us and the day already half spent we landed at noon on the SE side in order to try to get upon some one of the hills to View the Inlet from thence 
            
      

        23 January 1770
        Tuesday 23rdPM. Winds Southerly a fresh breeze. Agreeable to what is mentioned above I took one man with me and climed up to the top of one of the hills but when I came there I was hindred from seeing up the inlet by higher hills which I could not come at for impenetrable woods, but I was abundantly recompence'd for the trouble I had in assending the hill, for from it I saw what I took to be the Eastern Sea and a strait or passage from it into the Western Sea a little to the Eastward of the entrance of the Inlet in which we now lay with the Ship, the main land which lies on the SE side of this inlet appeared to me to be a narrow ridge of very high hills and to form a part of the SW side of the Strait. The land on the opposite side seem'd to trend away East as far as the Eye could see, to the SE appear'd as oppen sea and this I took to be the Eastern. I likewise saw some Islands lying on the East side of the inlet which before I had taken to be a part of the Main land. As soon as I had decended the hill and we had refreshed our selves we set out in order to return to the Ship, and in our way pass'd through and examined the Harbours, Coves &Ca that lay behind the Islands above mentioned. In this rout we met with an old Village in which was were a good many houses but no body had lived in any of them lately, we likewise saw a nother that was inhabited, but the day being far spent so that we had not time to go to it but made the best our way to the Ship which we reached between 8 and 9 oClock 
        In the night had much rain with Clowdy hazey weather which continued by intervils untill noon -
            
      

        24 January 1770
        Wednesday 24thPM had a fresh breeze Southerly and Clowdy weather. After dinner I employ'd my self in carrying on the Survey of the place and upon one of the Islands where I landed was were a number of houses but no inhabitants neither had any been there lately. In the morning the Gunner was sent a shore with the remainder of the powder to dry, and the Long-boat was sent with a gang of hands to one of the Islands to cut grass for our sheep and the rest of the people were employ'd about the usual work of the Ship. This fore-noon some of us viseted the Hippa, which is situated on the point of the Island. mentioned on our first arrival. the In habitants of this place shew'd not the least dislike at our coming but on the contrary with a great deal of seeming good nature shew'd us all over the place     we found a mong them some human bones the flesh of which they told us they had eat, they likewise inform'd us that there was no passage into the Sea thro' this inlet as I had immagined their might because above where I was in the Boat it turn'd away to the west ward. Leaving these people we travel'd to the other end of the Island and there took water and cross'd over upon the Main where we met with several houses that were at present or had very lately been inhabited but we saw but very few of the Inhabitents and these were in there boats fishing. After viewing this place we returnd on board to dinner 
            
      

        25 January 1770
        Thursday 25th Winds at NW a gentle breeze and fair weather. PM The Long-boat having returnd with a load of grass she was employ'd bringing on board Wood and water and the Caulkers having finish'd caulking the Ship sides / a thing they have been employ'd upon ever sence we came here / they were pay'd with tar. Early in the AM the Long boat was sent again for grass, and return'd at Noon with a Load 
            
      

        26 January 1770
        Friday 26th Gentle breezes and pleasent weather. In the PM I made a little excursion in the Pinnace along shore towards the mouth of the inlet, accompanied by Mr Banks and Dr Solander; we found in a small cove several of the Natives of whome we purchas'd a quantity of fresh fish, and upon our return to the Ship found that the Saine had been equally as successfull. which we generally haul mornings & evenings, and seldom fail of geting fish sufficient to serve all hands. In the AM I made an excursion into one of the Bays which lie on the East side of the Inlet accompanied by Mr Banks and Dr Solander     upon our landing we ascended a very high hill from which we had a full View of the passage I had before descover'd and the land on the opposite shore which appear'd to be about 4 Leagues from us, but as it was hazey near the horizon we could not see far to the SE. However I had now seen enough of this passage to convence me that there was the greatest probabillty in the world of its runing into the Eastern Sea as the distance from one of that Sea to the other at from this place cannot exceed 20 Leagues even to where we were, upon this I resolv'd after puting to seaand therefore after leaving the place we are in I intend to search this passage with the Ship. We found on the top of the hill a parcel of loose Stones of which we built a Pyrmid and left in it some Musquet balls, small Shott Beeds and what ever we had about us that was likely to stand the test of time: after this we descen descended the hill and found along with Tobia Tupia and the boats crew several of the natives, seting in the most free and friendly manner imaginable. Tobupia always accompanies us in every excursion we make and proves of infinate service to us. In our return to the ship we Visited the Hippa we had seen on Tuesday last which is situated on a small Island or rather a Rock, the Inhabitants of this place invited us a shore with their usual marks of friendship and shew'd us all over the place which indeed was soon done, for it was very small yet it contain'd a good number of people and they had in it split & hanging up to dry a prodigious quantity of various sorts of small fish a part of which they sold to us for such trifles as we had about us 
            
      

        27 January 1770
        Saturday 27th Fresh gales Westerly    This day we got the Tiller properly secure'd which hath been the employment of the Armourers and part of the Carpenters sence we anchor'd at this place, the former in repairing and making new Iron work and the latter in fixing a Transom for the want of which the Tiller has often been in danger of being broke, the Iron braces that supply'd the want of a transom have broke every time they have been repair'd. Coopers still imploy'd repairing the Casks, some hands with the Long-boat geting on board Stones to put into the bottom of the bread room to bring the Ship more by the stern while others were employ'd cuting wood, repairing the rigging and fishing 
            
      

        28 January 1770
        Sunday 28th Strong gales westerly. PM fair and Clowdy, the remainder thick hazey weather with much rain
            
      

        29 January 1770
        Monday 29th Winds as yesterday. PM rainy weather the remainder fair and Clowdy Pretty early in the AM an old man who had made us several Visits upon our first arival here, came on board and told us that one of our boats had fire'd upon and wounded two of their people one of which was dead of his wounds   this affair happen'd on Sunday was a week and never before now came to my Knowlidge. On that day the Master and five Petty officers desired to have a small boat to go a fishing, but instead of keeping within the Usual boands and under the protection of the Ship they went over to the Hippa on the Island from which some of the inhabitents put off in two Canoes, as they thought to attack them, this caused the Master to fire and according to the report of the old man wounded two of one of which is sence dead: but this last circumstance was soon after contradicted by another of the natives who Mr Green and Tupia saw a Shore, and I wish this last report may be true / which I very much doubt / because I find the reasons for fireing upon them are not very justifiable 
        This morning I went out to the mouth of the Inlet and landed upon the West point and from the top of a pretty high hill which is there I had a view of the Coast to the NW, the farthest land I could see in that quarter was an Island about 10 Leagues off and lying pretty near the main and is the same as hath been before mentiond   between this Island and the place where I was lay some other Islands close under the Shore which forms several Bays, wherein there appears to be safe anchorage for Shipping - one of these Bays I take to be murders Bay descover'd by Tasman 
        After I had set the different points &Ca we errected upon the Top of the Hill a tower or pile of stones in which we left a peice of Silver Coin, some Musquet Balls, Beeds &Ca and left flying upon it a peice of an old pendant: after this we return'd to the boat and in our way to the Ship visited some of the natives we had met with a long shore and purchas'd of them a small quantity of fish 
            
      

        30 January 1770
        Tuesday 30th Winds at N.W. gentle breezes and fair weather. Early in the AM a boat was sent to one of the Islands to get sellery to boil for the peoples breakfasts whilest our people were gathering it near some empty hutts a bout 20 of the Natives landed there, men women and children   they had no sooner got out of their Canoes than 5 or 6 women set down together and cut and scarified their legs, thighs, Arms and faces some with shells and others with peices of jasper. so far as our people could understand them this was done on account of their husbands having been lately kill'd and devoured by their enimies; while the women was were performing this ceremony the men went about repairing the hutts without showing the least concern 
        The Carpenter went into the woods with part of his crew to cut and square some timber to saw into boards for the use of the Ship and to prepare two posts to be set up as marks  with Inscriptions upon them 
            
      

        31 January 1770
        Wednesday 31st Little wind and variable. In the PM the Carpenter having prepared the two Posts with inscriptions upon them seting forth the Ships name month and year, one of them was set up at the watering place on which was hoisted the Union flag and in the morning I took the other over to the Island which is known by the name of Motu-ouru and is the one that lies nearest to the Sea but before I attempted to set up the post I went first to the Hippa having along with me Dr Munkhouse and Tobupia   we here met with the old man I have before spoke of. The first thing I did was to inquire after the man said to be killd by our people and the one that was wounded at the same time, when it did not appear to me that any such accidents had happend. I next, by means of Tobupia, explained to the old man and several others that we were come to set up a mark upon the Island in order to shew to any ship that might put into this place that we had been here before.   they not only gave their free consent to set it up, but promise'd never to pull it down. I then gave every one present one thing or a nother, to the old men I gave silver, threepenny peices dated 1763 and spike nails with the Kings broad P Allow cut deep in them things that I thought was were most likely to remain long among them 
        After I had thus prepare'd the way for seting up the post we took it up to the highest part of the Island and after fixing it fast in the ground hoisted thereon the Union flag and I dignified this Inlet with the name of Queen Charlottes Sound and took formal posession of it and the adjacent lands in the name and for the use of his Majesty.   we then drank Her Majestys hilth in a Bottle of wine and gave the empty bottle to the old man / who had attended us up the hill / with which he was highly pleased. Whilest the post was seting up we asked the old man about the Strait or passage into the Eastern Sea and he very plainly told us there was a passage and as I had some conjectors that the lands to the SW of this strait / which we are now at / was an Island and not part of a continent we questioned the old man about it who said it consisted of two Wannuaes, that is two lands or Islands that might be circumnavigated in a few days, even in four  This man spoke of three lands, the two above mentioned which he call'd Tovy-poenammu which signifies green Talk or stone such as the[y] make their tools on, oramints &Ca and for the third he pointed to the land on the East side of the Strait this he said was a large land and that it would take up a great many moons to sail round it. or some thing to the same purpose this he calld Aeheino mouwe a name m[an]y others before had call'd it by, that part which borders on the strait he calld Teira whitte -  After we had done our business upon the Island we return'd on board bringing the old man a long with us who after dinner went a shore in a canoe that came to attend upon him 
            
      

        1 February 1770
        Thursday Febry 1stPM having compleated the Ship with wood and fill'd all our water the Boatswain was set a Shore with a party of men to cut and make brooms while others were employd about the rigging fishing &Ca In the night and the remainder of the day had a Strong gale from the NW attended with very much rain 
            
      

        2 February 1770
        Friday 2d In the PM the gale increased to a storm attended with rain and squalls which came down in excessive heavy gusts from off the high land, in one of which the hawser we had fast to the Shore brok  this obliged us to let go another anchor. Towards midnight the gale moderated and in the morning it fell calm and we took up the Sheet anchor look'd at the best bower and moor'd the Ship again to the shore. The heavy rains which hath fell and still continues to fall hath the caused the brook we water'd at to over flow its banks and carry away ten small Casks we had standing there full of water and not withstanding we searched the whole Cove we could not find one of them.
            
      

        3 February 1770
        Saturday 3rd Winds Northerly mostly fair weather. Very early in the AM sent the Long-boat for sellery to boil for the Ships compneys breakfasts and as I intended sailing the first oppertunity I went over to the Hippa which is on the East side of the Sound and purchas'd of the Inhabitants a quantaty of split and half dry'd fish and such as I could get. While we were at this hippa Tobia Tupia made farther enquirey about the lands and strait and these people confirm'd every thing the old man had before told us. About noon we took our leave of them, which some seem'd not sorry for, for notwithstanding they sold us their fish very freely, there were some few among them who shew'd evident signs of disaprobation.
            
      

        4 February 1770
        Sunday 4th Winds northerly a fresh breeze and fair weather. In the PM after returning from the hippa some of us made an excursion along shore to the Northward in order to traffick with the Natives for fish in which we had no great success. In the evening got every thing off from the shore designing to sail in the morning but the wind not permiting we amuse'd our selves in fishing collecting shells, seeds &Ca &Ca 
            
      

        5 February 1770
        Monday 5th Winds and weather as yesterday     In the AM cast off the Hawser, hove short on the bower and carried out the Kedge out in order to warp the Ship out of the Cove. All the dry fish we have been able to procure from the Natives sence we came here was were this day divided amongest the Ship's compney
            
      

        6 February 1770
        Tuesday 6th At 2 PM hove up the Anchor warp'd the Ship out of the Cove and got under sail, but it soon after falling little wind and that very variable we came again to an anchor a little above Motu-ouru - The old man, seeing us under sail came on board to take his leave of us, amongest other conversation which pass'd betwixt him a[nd] Tobia Tupia he was asked if either he or any of his ancestors had ever seen or heard of any Ship like this being in these parts, to which question he answer'd in the negative, but said that his Ancestors had told him that there came once to this place a small Vessel from a distant part land call'd Olhemaroa, wherein was were four men that were all kill'd upon their landing and being asked where this distant land lay he pointed to the North intimated that it would take up a great many days to go thether. Something of this land was mentioned by the people of the Bay of Islands, who said that some of their Ancestors had been there. But it is very clear to us that there knowlidge of this land is only traditionary 
        Had it calm all night untill 6 oClock in the morning when a light breeze sprung up at north and we got again under sail, but as the wind proved very unsteady we got no farther than just without Motu-ouru by noon - but had a fair prospect of geting clear out of the Sound which I shall next describe 
        Description of Queen Charlottes Sound 
        The entrence of this Sound is situated in the Latitude of 41° 0 South and in the Longitude 184°..45' West, and at the S.W. entrance of near the middle of the SW side of the Strait which separates the Land of            from that of before mentioned, The land of the SE head of the Sound call'd by the Natives Koamaroo / off which lies two small Islands and some rocks / makes the narrowest part of the Strait. There stretcheth out two miles NEBN from the NW head a reef of rocks a part of which is above water. This account of the two heads will be found sufficient guide to know this Sound, which is three Leagues b[r]oad at the entrence and lies inSWBS, SW and WSW at least 10 Leagues and is a Collection of some of the finest harbours in the world and this as will evidently appear from the Plan which was taken with all the accuracy that time and circumstance would admit The one harbour or Cove in which we lay call'd Ship Cove is not inferior to any in the Sound both in point of Securety and other conven conveniences; it lies on the west side of the Sound and is the southermost of the three coves lying within Motu-oura, which Island bears due East from it. You may sail into this Cove either between this last mentioned Island and the Isle Hamote or between Motu-oura and the West shore    in this last channell are two ledges of rocks 3 fathom under water but they may be known by the Sea weed which grows upon them. In sailing in or out of this Sound with little wind attention must be had to the Tides which flows 9 or 10 oClock at the full and change of the Moon and rises and falls upon a perpendicular 7 or 8 feet. The flood comes in through the Strait from the SE and sets strong over upon the NW head and the reef laying off it, the Ebb sets with great rapidity to the SE over upon the Islands and rocks lying off the SE head. The Variation of the Compass we found from good observations to be 13°. 5' East. The land about this sound is of such height that we first saw it at the distance of 20 Leagues   it consists wholy of high hills and deep Vallies well stored with a variety of excellent Timber fit for all purposes excepting Ships Masts for which use it is too hard and heavy. The sea abounds with a variety of fish and in such plenty that without going out of the Cove where we lay, we caught daily what with the Saine and hook and line quite sufficient for all hands, and upon our first arrival we found plenty of shags and some few other wild fowls which to people in our situation was fresh food not to be dispised 
        The number of Inhabitants hardly exceeds 3 or 400 hundreds people, they leive desperse'd along the Shore in search of their daly bread which is fish and firn roots for they cultivate not no part of the lands. Upon the appearence of danger they retire to their Hippa's or strong holds for in this situation we found them and they remaind so for some days after. This people are poor when compared to many we have seen and their Canoes are mean and without orament, the little traffick we had with them was wholy for fish for we saw nothing little else they had to dispose of,   they seem'd to have some knowlidge of Iron for they very readily took Nails in exchange for fish and some times prefer'd them to any thing else which was more than the people of any other place would do, they were at first fond of paper but when they found it spoild by being wet they would not take it, nor did they set much Value upon the cloth we got at Georges Island, but shew'd an extraordinary fondness for English broad Cloth and Red Kersey, which shew'd them to be a more sensible people than Ma[n]y of their Neighbours 
        Besides the common dress some of these people wore on their heads round Caps made of birds feathers which were far from being unbecoming 
            
      

        7 February 1770
        Wednesday 7th In the PM had a light breeze at NBW with which we got out of the Sound and stood over to the eastward in ord[er] to get the Strait well open before the tide of ebb made. At 7 the two small Island which lies off Cape Koamaroo or the SE head of Queen Charlottes Sound bore East distant 4 miles.   at this time we had it nearly calm and the tide of Ebb makeing out we were carried by the rapiddity of the stream in a very short time close upon one of the Islands where we narrowly escaped being dashed againest the rocks by bringing the Ship to an Anchor in 75 fathom water with 150 fathoms of Cable out; even this would not have save'd us had not the tide, which first set SBE, by meeting with the Island changed its diretion to SE and carried us past the first point.  when the Ship was brought up she was about two Cables lengths of the rocks and in the strength of the stream which set SE at least 4 or 5 Knotts or miles an hour. A little before 12 oClock the tide abated and we began to heave, by 3 the anchor was at the bows and having a light breeze at NW we made sail over for the eastern shore but having the tide againest us we made but little way. The wind afterwards freshend and came to north and NE with which and the tide of ebb we were in a short time hurried thro' the narrowest part of the strait and than stood away for the southermost land we had in sight which bore from us SBW. Over this land appear'd a prodegious high mountain the summit of which was coverd with snow 
        The narrowest part of the strait we have pass'd lies between Cape Koamaroo on Tovy-poenammu and Cape Teerawhitte on Aeheinomouwe   the distance from the one to the other I judged to be between 4 and 5 Leagues and notwithstanding the strength of the tides, now that is known, there is no great danger in passing it.  in the doing of which I am of opinion that the NE shore is the safest to keep upon for on that side there appear'd to be danger whereas on the other shore there are not only the Islands and Rocks lying off Cape Koamaroo   for I discover'd from the hill from which I had the second View of the Strait a Reef of Rocks stretching from these Islands Six or 7 Miles to the Southward and lay about 2 or 3 Miles off from the shore. I shall not pretend here to assign limets to the length of this strait a view of the Chart will best ellusterate that. About North 9 Leagues from Cape Teerawhitte under the same shore is a high remarkable Island that may be distinctly seen from Queen Charlottes Sound from which it lies NEBE1/2E distant four Six or five seven Leagues, I have called it Entry Isle and was taken notice of when we first past it on Sunday 14thof last Month. On the East side of Cape Teerawhitte the Land trends away SEBE about eight leagues where it ends in a point and is the southermost land of Aeheinomouwe which I have named Cape Pallisser in honour of my worthy friend Capt Pallisser / Latitude 41°..34', So Longitude. 183°..58' Wt /  it bore from us this day at Noon So 79° Et distant 12 or 13 Leagues being than in the latitude of 41°..27' So at the same time Cape Koamaroo bore N1/2E distant 7 or 8 Leagues.   the southermost point of land in sight bore So 16° Wt and the Snowey Mountain SW being about three leagues from the shore and a breast of a deep Bay or Inlet, call'd Clowdy bay in the bottom of which appear'd low land cover'd with tall trees 
            
      

        8 February 1770
        Thursday 8th In the PM had a fresh breeze at NNE and Clowdy weather. At 3 oClock we were abreast of the Southermost point of land set at noon which I named Cape Campbel / Latde 41°..42' So Longde 184°..47' Wt / it lies SBW distt 12 or 13 Leagues from Cape Koamaroo and together with Cape Pallisser forms the Southern entrance of the Straits, the distce of the one to the other is 13 or 14 Leagues WBS & EBN
        From this Cape we steer'd along shore SWBS until 8 oClock when the wind died away, but an hour after a fresh breeze sprung up at SW and we put the Ship right before it. The reasons of my doing this was owing to a notion which some of the officers had just started that Aeheinomouwe was not an Island founding their opinion on a suppotision that the land might extend away to the SE from between Cape Turn-again and the point we saw at noon Cape Pallisser  there being a space of about 12 or 15 Leagues which we had not seen. For my own part I had seen so far into this Sea the first time I discover'd the Strait, together with many other concurrent testimonies of its being an Island that no such supposition ever enter'd my thoughts  but being resolved to clear up every doubt that might arise on so important an object I took the oppertunity of the shifting of the winds to stand to the Eastward and accordingly steer'd NEBE all night. At 9 oClock AM we was were abreast of the Southermost point of  Cape Pallisser where we found the Land trend away NE towards Cape Turn-again which I reckoned to be distant from us about 26 Leagues: but as the weather was hazey so that we could not see above 4 or 5 Leagues ahead we still kept standing to the NE with a light breeze at South. A Noon Cape Pallisser bore N.72° West distant 3 Leagues, our Latd by account is 41°..30' South 
            
      

        9 February 1770
        Friday 9th Gentle breezes at South and S.S.E Hazey Clowdy weather. In the PM three Canoes came off to the Ship wherein were between 30 & 40 of the Natives who had been pulling after us some time; it appear'd from the behaver of these people that they had heard of us our being upon the coast, for they came along side and some of them on board the Ship without shewing the least signs of fear: they were no sooner on board than they asked for nails but when nails was were given them they asked Tobia Tupia what they were which was plain that they had never seen any before   yet they not only knowed how to ask for them but knowed what use to apply them to and therefore must have heard of nails which they call Whow      the name of a tool among them made generally of bone which they use as a chissel in makeing holes &Ca   These people asking so readily for nails proves that their connections must extend as far North as Cape Kidnappers which is 45 Leagues, for that was the southerm:st place on this side of the coast we had a any traffick with the natives, and it is most probable that the Inhabitants of Queen Charlottes Sound got the little knowlidge they seem'd to have of Iron by the connections they may have with the Terawhetteans bordering upon them for we have no reason to think that the inhabitants of any part of this land had the least knowlidge of Iron before we came amongst them 
        After a short stay these people were dismiss'd with proper presents and we continued our Course along shore to the NE untill 11 oClock AM when the weather clearing up we saw Cape Turn-again bearing NBE 1/4E distant 7 Leagues, I then called the officers upon deck, and asked them if they were now satisfied that this land was an Island to which they answer'd in the affirmative and we hauled our wind to the Eastward. At Noon our Latitude by observation was 40°..55' So which is 21 Miles to the Southward of Cape Turn-again it bearing NBE and Cape Pallisser by this days run bears S 43°.W. 19 or 20 Leagues 
            
      

        10 February 1770
        Saturday 10th Gentle breezes at SE and Clowdy weather. At 4 PM Tacked and Stood SW untill 8 AM when being not above 3 or 4 Miles from the shore we tacked at [and] stood off two hours, then stood again to the SW untill noon when being in the Latitude of 41°..13' So and about two miles from the shore, the land of Cape Pallisser bearing So 53° West had 26 fathom water 
            
      

        11 February 1770
        Sunday 11thPM had light breeze from the S.E. in the night it was Calm untill 9 AM when a gentle breeze sprung up at ENE with which we made sail to the Southward, having a large swell rowling in from that quarter    At Noon was we were in the Latitude of 41°..6' So and distant from the Shore 11/2 League, a remarkable hillock which stands close to the Sea bore N1/2E distance 4 Leagues. At this time two Canoes came along side the Ship with whom we had some little trafick and then dismiss'd them 
            
      

        12 February 1770
        Monday 12th Most part of PM had a fresh breeze at N, E, which by sun set carried us the length of C. Pallisser and as the weather was clear I had an oppertunity of Viewing the land of this Cape which is of a height sufficient to be seen in clear weather 12 or 14 Leagues off and is of a broken and hilly surface; between the foot of the high land and the Sea is a border of low flat land off which lies some rocks that appear above water. Between this Cape and Cape Turnagain which is       Leagues N         and        the land near the shore is in many places low and flat and appear'd green and pleasent, but inland are many hills. From Cape Pallisser to Cape Teera-whitte the Course is NW1/2 and NW distant        Leagues, the land between them the land the land is tollerable high makeing in Table points and the Shore forms two Bays, at least it appear'd so for we were always too far off this part of the Coast to be particular 
        The wind continued at NE untill 12 at night when it died away and veer'd round to the West and afterwards to South and SSE little wind so that by noon we had advanced no farther than 41°..52' South Latitude Cape Pallisser bearing North distant 5 Leagues and the snowey mountain bore So 83° West 
            
      

        13 February 1770
        Tuesday 13thPM light Airs at SE the remainder Calm  At Noon found our selves in the Latitude of 42°.2' So Cape Pallisser bearing N 20° Et distant 8 Leagues 
            
      

        14 February 1770
        Wednesday 14thPM a fresh breeze sprung up at NE and we steer'd SWBW for the Southermost land we had in sight which bore from us at sun set So 74° West     At this time we found the Variation to be 15°..4' East. At 8 AM it fell Calm, at d a this time we had run 21 Leagues So.58° Wt sence yesterday at noon which brought us abreast of the high Snowey Mountain seen the day we pass'd the Strait it bearing from us NW, in this direction it lay behind a mountainous ridge of nearly the same height which riseth derectly from the Sea and runs parallel with the shore which lies NE1/2N and SW1/2S. The NE end of the ridge lies takes its rise but a little way inland from Cape Campbel.    These mountains are distinctly seen from both from Cape Koamaroo and Cape Pallisser  being distant from the former SW1/2S 22 Leagues and from the latter WSW 30  Leagues, but they are of a height sufficient to be seen at a much greater distance; by some on board they are thought to be much higher than the Pico of Teneriff which I cannot agree to, neither do I think them so high as Mount Egmont on the SW Coast of Aehei-no-mouwe founding my opinion on the sumit of the latter being almost wholy cover'd with Snow, where as it only lies upon these in patches 
        At noon was we were in the Latitude of 42°..34' So the Southermost land we had in sight bore SW1/2W, and some low land that made like an Island lying close under the foot of the Ridge, bore NWBN, distant about 5 or 6 Leagues 
            
      

        15 February 1770
        Thursday 15th In the PM Four double Canoes wherein were 57 Men Came off to the Ship, they kept at the distance of about a Stones throw from us and would not be prevail'd upon to put along side by all that Tobia could say to them, from this we concluded that they never had heard any thing of our being upon the coast.  At 8 oClock PM a breeze sprung up at SSW with which we stretched off SE, because some on board thought they saw land in that quarter, we continued on this course untill 6 oClock AM at which time we had run a Eleven Leagues, but saw no land but that which we had left. soon after this it fell calm and continued so for about an hour, than a light breeze sprung up at west which afterwards Veer'd to the north and we stood to the westward. At Noon our Latitude by observation was 42°..56' So and the high land we were a breast of yesterday at noon NNW1/2W 
         After looking at for some time She pull'd in for the land like an Island above mentioned on which account I call'd it Lookers on.
            
      

        16 February 1770
        Friday 16th In the PM had a light breeze NE with which we steer'd West, edging in for the land which was distant from us about 8 Leagues; at 7 oClock the Southermost extreme of the land in sight bore WSW, being about 6 Leagues from the shore. Soon after this it fell calm and continued so most part of the nigh[t] with sometimes light airs from the land. At day light we discover'd land bearing SBW and seemingly detached from the coast we was were upon. About 8 oClock a breeze sprung up at NBE and we steer'd dirictly for it. At Noon was we were in the Latitude of 43°..19' So the Peack on the snowey Mountain bore N 20° East distt 27 Leagues   the Southern extremity we could see of that land bore West and the Land discover'd in the morn.g makeing like an Island extending from SSW to SWBW 1/2W distant about 8 Leagues. Our Course and distance sail'd sence yesterday at Noon SWBW 43 Miles. Variation by this morning Amplitude 14°..39' E.
            
      

        17 February 1770
        Saturday 17thPM stood to the Southward for the land above mentioned, with the wind at north a fresh breeze and clear weather. At 8 oClock we had run a 11 Leagues sence noon when the land extended from SWBW to NBW being distant from the nearest shore about 3 or 4 Leagues, in this situation had 50 fathom water a fine sandy bottom. Soon after this it fell little wind with calms and continued so until 6 oClock AM when a light breeze sprung up at NW which afterwards Veer'd to NE. At sun rise, being very clear, we plainly discoverd that the last mentioned land was an Island by seeing part of the Land of Tovy-poenammu open to the westward of it extending as far as WBS -
        At 8 oClock the extremes of the Island bore N 76° Wt and NNE1/2E and an opening that had the appearence of a Bay or Harbour, lying near the South point, N 20° West distant 3 or 4 Leagues, being in 38 fathom water a brown sandy bottom. This Island which I have named after Mr Banks lies about 4 5 Leagues from the Coast of Tovy-poenammu, the south point bears So 21° West from the highest peek on the Snowey mountains of that land so often mentioned and lies in the Latitude of 43°..52' South and in the Longitude of 186°.30 West by observations made of the Sun and Moon this morning. It is of a circular figure and may be about 24 Leags in compass, the land is of a height sufficient to be seen 12 or 15 Leagues and of a very broken uneven surface, and hath more the appearence of barrenness than fertillity. Last night we saw smook upon it and this morning some people and therefore must be inhabited  __________________________________________________________________________________________
        Yesterday Lieutenant Gore having the morning watch at the time we first saw this Island, thought he saw land bearing SSE and SEBE but I who was upon deck at the same time was very certain that it was only Clowds which dissipated as the Sun rose, but neither this nor the runing 14 Leagues to the South, nor the seeing no land to the Eastward of us in the Evening, could satisfy Mr Gore but what he saw in the morning was land or might be land altho there was hardly a possibillity of its being so because we must have been more than double the distance from it yester morning at that time to what we was were either last night or this morning at both of which times the weather was exceeding clear and yet we could see no land either to the Eastward or Southward of us. Notwithstanding all this Mr Gore was of the same opinion this morning; Upon this I order'd the Ship to be wore and to be steer'd ESE by Compass on the other Tack, the point on which he said the land bore at this time from us. At Noon was we were in the Latitude of 44°.7' So the South point of the Banks's Island bore North distant 5 Leagues
            
      

        18 February 1770
        Sunday 18th Gentle breezes at North and fair weather. PM stood ESE in search of Mr Gores imaginary land untill 7 oClock at which time we had run 28 Miles sence noon, but seeing no land but that we had left, or signs of any, we bore away SBW and continued upon that Course untill noon, when we found our Selves in the Latitude of 45°..16', our course and distance saild sence yesterday is So 8° East 70 Miles. the South point of Banks's Island N 6°..30' Wt distant 28 Leagues. Variation pr Ampd this morning 15°.30' E   Seeing no signs of land, I thought it to no purpose standing any farther to the Southward, and therefore hauled to the Westward in order to prove whether the land we had left was an island or no thinking that we were far enough to the Southward to weather all the land we had left, but this opinion was only founded on the information we had had from the natives of Queen Charlottes Sound which we soon to be false
            
      

        19 February 1770
        Monday 19thPM had a moderate breeze at NNW and North untill 8 oClock, when it fell little wind and was very unsettled untill 10 at which time it fixed at South and freshend in such a manner that before the morning it brought us under our close reef'd topsails. At 8 AM having run 28 Leags upon a WBN1/2N Course and now judgeing our selves to be to the westward of the Land of Tovy-poenammu, we bore away NW with a fresh gale at South.  At 10 oClock, having run 11 Miles upon this Course, we saw land extending from the SW to the NW at the distance of a bout 10 Leagues from us which we hauled up for. At Noon our Latitude by Observation was 44°..38', the South East point of the Island Banks Isld bore N 59°..30' East Distant 30 Leags and the Main body of the land in sight WBN. Course and distance sail'd sence Yesterday at noon is N 66°..45' W. 96 Miles 
            
      

        20 February 1770
        Tuesday 20th All PM had little wind which Veer'd round from South, by the East to NNE - Steer'd SSW, but got very little to the Southward on account of a head Sea. At 2 oClock sounddand in 35 fathom water fine Sandy bottom, being about Six Leagues from the land. At 7 oClock the extremes of the land extending from SWBS to NBW distant from the nearest shore 6 Leagues depth of water 32 fathom. At 12 oClock it fell Calm and continued so untill 4 AM when a fresh breeze sprung up at SBW, with which we stood in shore WBS 4 Leagues, our depth of water from 32 to 13 fathom; in this last depth we tacked and Stood off, being about 3 Miles from the shore which lies nearly north & south and is here very low and flat and continues so up to the skirts of the Hills which are at least 4 or 5 Miles in Land. The whole face of the Country appears barren, nor did we see any signs of inhabitants. Latitude at Noon 44°..44' So Longd made from the Banks's Island to this land 2°.. 22' West 
            
      

        21 February 1770
        Wednesday 21st Wind at South a fresh gale. At 2 P.M. being in 50 fathom water and 12 Leagues from the land, we tacked and stood in shore until 8 oClock when we tacked and Stood off untill 4 AM. then tack'd and stood in. At 8 oClock being 10 Leagues from the land had 57 fathom. At noon being in the Latitude 44°..35 and 5 or 6 Leagues from the land had 36 fathom.   notwithstanding we have carried as much sail as the Ship could bear it is apparent from the Obserd Latitude that we have been drove 3 Leagues to leeward sence yesterday 
            
      

        22 February 1770
        Thursday 22d Moderate breezes between the SE and SBW and dark gloomy weather with a Swell from the SE. Plying to wind ward keeping between 4 and 12 Leagues from the land, depth of water from 35 to 53 fathom a fine sandy bottom. A great many Sea fowl and Grampusses about the Ship- In the AM condemed 60 fathoms of the best bower Cable and converted it into Junk. At Noon had no observation, but by the land judged our selves to be about 3 Leagues farther north than yesterday 
            
      

        23 February 1770
        Friday 23d Winds southerly a gentle breeze and for the most part Clowdy weather. At sun set, the weather clearing up presented to our View a high peaked mountain bearing NWBN; and at the same time we saw the land more distincter than we had at any time before, extending from North to SWBS, the inland parts of which appear'd to be high and mountainous. We cannot tell yet whether or no this land joins to or makes a part of the land w[e] have left    from the accounts recieved of the Natives of Queen Charlottes Sound it ought not because if it did it must have been impossible for us to have sail'd round it in four days; besides, the mountains in land and the Soundings off the Coast seem to indicate this Country to be more extensive than any they spoke of lying to the southward 
        Having a large hollow swell from the south East which made me expect the wind from the same quarter, we kept plying from 7 to 15 Leagues from the land, depth of water from 44 to 70 fathoms. At Noon our Latitude by observation was 44°..40' So Longitude made from Banks's Island 1°..31' West 
            
      

        24 February 1770
        Saturday 24th Calm untill 6 PM at which time a light breeze sprung up at ENE. with which we steer'd SSE all night edgeing off from the land because of a hollow swell which we had from the SE. depth of water from 60 to 75 fathom. At day light the wind began to freshen and before noon blowed a fresh gale and veer'd to NNE. At 8 AM saw the land extending as far as SWBS which we steer'd directly for and at Noon was we were in the Latitude of 45°..22' So the land in sight extending from SW1/2S to NNW, makeing high and hilly. Course and distance run sence yesterday at noon is S. 25°.Wt 47 Miles. In the PM while we lay becalm'd Mr Banks in a small boat, shott two Port Egmont Hens which were in every respect the same sort of Birds as are found in great numbers upon the Islands of Faro: they are of a very dark brown plumage with a little white upon about the under side of their wings and are as large as a moscovy duck; these were the first that we have seen sence we arrived upon the Coast of this Country, but we saw of them for some days before we made land 
            
      

        25 February 1770
        Sunday 25th In the PM steerd SWBS and SW edging in for the land having the advantage of a fresh gale at north which I was over desirious of makeing the most of and by that means carried away the Main Top gt mast and Fore topmast studding sail boom, but these were soon replaced by others. Altho we kept at no great distance from the shore yet the weather was so hazey that we could see nothing destinct upon the land only that there were a ridge of pretty high hills lying parallel with and but a little way from the sea-coast which lies SBW and NBE and seem'd to end in a high bluff point to the Southward which we run the length of by 8 oClock, when being dark and not knowing which way the Land trended we brought too for the night having run 15 Leagues upon a SW1/2S Course sence noon,   the point bore at this time West distant about 5 Miles, depth of water 37 fathom the bottom small pebble stones. At 4 AM we made sail, but by this time the northerly wind was gone and was succeeded by one from the southward which proved very variable and unsteady 
        At day light the point above mention'd bore north distant 3 Leagues and we found that the land trended away from it SWBW as far as we could see. This point of land I have named Cape Saunders in Honour of Sr Charles, it lies in  the / Latitude 45°..55' So Longitude 189°..4' West. / it requres no description to know it by, the Latitude and the Angle made here by the Coast will be found quite sufficient however there is a remarkable Saddle hill laying near the shore 3 or 4 Leagues SW of the Cape *. From one to four Leagues north of the Cape the shore seem'd to form two or three Bays wherein there appeared to be anchorage and Shelter from SW, westerly and NW winds. I had some thoughts of bearing up for one of these places in the morning when the wind came to SW, but the fear of looseing time and the desire Ihave had of pushing to the southward in order to see as much of the coast as possible, or if this land s[h]ould prov[e] to be an Island to get round it, prevented me. Being not far from the shore all this morning we had an oppertunity of viewing the land pretty distinctly.   it is of a moderate height, full of hills which appear'd green and woody, but we saw not the least signs of Inhabitants  At Noon Cape Saunders bore N 30° Wt distant 4 Leagues   Latde per Log, for we had no Observation, 46°..0' So
        * by which it may always be known when on that side of it.
            
      

        26 February 1770
        Monday 26th In the PM had the wind whifling [sic] all round the Compass, sometimes blowing a fresh gale and at other times almost calm. At 5 oClock it fixed at WSW and soon blowed so hard as to put us past our topsails, and to split the fore sail all to pieces: after geting another to the yard we continued standing to the southward under two Courses. At I AM the wind moderating set the topsails with one reef out; but soon after day light the Gale increased to a Storm with heavy squalls attended with rain  this brought us again under our courses, and the Main topsail being split we unbent it and brought another to the yard. At 6 oClock the souther most land in sight bore WBN and Cape Saunders bore NBW distant six eight Leagues  At Noon it bore N 20° Wt distant 14 Leagues; Latde Obd 46°.. 356'
            
      

        27 February 1770
        Tuesday 27th A very hard gale at SWBW and WSW with heavy squalls attended with showers of rain and a large hollow sea without the least intermission the whole of this 24 hours. We continued under our Courses from noon untill 7 PM when we handed the Main sail and lay too under the fore sail with her head to the southward - Lat. at Noon 46°.54' - Longd made from Cape Saunders 1°..24' East.
            
      

        28 February 1770
        Wednesday 28th Strong gales and SW. with a large sea from the same quarter. At 7 PM made sail under the Courses and at 8 AM set the Topsails close reef'd. At Noon being in the Latitude of 47°..43' South and Longde East from Cape Saunders 2°..10' wore and stood to the Northward 
            
      

        1 March 1770
        Thursday 1st Winds between the SW and NNW a fresh gale. In the PM found the Variation to be 16°..34' East - At 8 Tack'd and stood to the Southward with the wind at west which before the morning veer'd to NW accompan'd with hazey weather and drizling rain - at day light loosed a reef out of each topsail and set some of the small sails - At Noon our Latde by account was 47°..52' So and Longitude made from Cape Saunders 1°..8' East  The New Moon made her appears last night and Tupia told us that this is New Years day at the Island, on which account we paid him the proper compt.
            
      

        2 March 1770
        Friday 2nd. Strong gales from the Westwd with heavy squals attended with showers of rain    In the PM stood to the Southward untill 1/2 past 3 when being in the Latitude of 48°..0 South and Longde 188° 43 0' Wt and seeing no vissible signs of land we tack'd and stood to the northward, having a very large SW ell from the SWBW. soon after we tack'd we close reef'd the Topsails and in the night was were obliged to hand them, but at day light set them again - At Noon our Latitude by obsern was 46°..42' So Cape Saunders bearing No 46° Wt Distant 68 Miles
            
      

        3 March 1770
        Saturday 3d In the PM The winds and wear were the same as as yesterday, in the AM quite moderate yet the SW SW ell still continued which makes me conjector that their is no land near it in that quarter - At Noon our Latde was 46°..42' So being east of Cape Saunders 1° 30' 
            
      

        4 March 1770
        Sunday 4th At 4 PM the wind coming to the northward we stood to the west ward with all the sail we could make. In the morning got up Top gallant yards and set the sails, found the Varn to 16°..16' East. Saw several whales, seals, and one Penguin, this bird was but small of the sort but seem'd to be such a one as we had never seen before     We have seen several seals sence we pass'd the Strait, but never saw one upon the whole Coast of Aehei no mouwe     We sounded both in the night and this morning but found no bottom with 150 fathoms of line. At Noon we saw Cape Saunders bearing N1/2W our Latitude by observation was 46°..31' South
            
      

        5 March 1770
        Monday 5th Most part of PM had a fresh breeze at NBE. At 1/2 past 1 saw land bearing WBS which we steer'd for; before dark we was were within 3 or 4 Leagues of it and seeing no land farther to the south we were in hopes this would prove the southern point     At 7 oClock shortend sail and kept under an easy sail all night standing to the WSW having the wind at NW and NNW untill 2 AM when it fell calm and soon after a breeze sprung up at SEBS and day light coming on we made sail. Dureing the whole night we saw a large fire upon the land a certain sign of its being inhabited. At 7 oClock the extremes of the land bore from N 38° East to West 6° South being distant from the Shore about 3 Leagues. The land appears of a moderate height and not hilly - At 1/2 past 10 oClock the westermost land in sight bore W1/2N distant 7 Leagues - At Noon had fresh gales at SSE and thick hazey weather with rain - our Latitude by account was 46°..50' St and Longitude made from Cape Saunders 1° 56' West 
            
      

        6 March 1770
        Tuesday 6thPM winds at South by East and South thick hazey weather untill 3 oClock when it cleared up and we saw the land extending from NEBN to NW1/2N and soon after, low land makeing like an Island bearing W1/2S   keeping on our Course to the WBS we in two hours time saw high land over the low land extending to the southward as far as SWBS. We could not see this land join to that to the northward of us, there either being a total seperation, a deep bay or low land between them. At 8 oClock we was being within 3 Leagues of the low land / which we now took to be an Island / we tack'd and stood to the Eastward having the wind at south and which proved very unsettled all night   by which means and a little bad management I found the Ship in the morning considerably farther to the eastward than I expected, and the wind afterwards coming to SW and WSW so that at noon we found our selves much about the same place as we were yesterday - our Latitude by observation being 46°..50' S. The land extending from NEBE to WBN 1/2N, the nearest part bearing North distant 3 Leagues - the land to the SW just in sight 
            
      

        7 March 1770
        Wednesday 7th Light airs in the SW quarter    PM clear weather the remainder dark and Clowdy. In the PM found the Variation per several Azths and the Ampde to 15°..10' Et and by the Ampde in the morning to be 15°..56' East. Stood to the SE untill 8 AM then tack'd and stood to the NW.   but it soon after fell calm and continued so untill noon when by our account we were in the Latitude of 47°..6' South and had made 12 Miles Easting sence yesterday at Noon 
            
      

        8 March 1770
        Thursday 8th Light airs next to a Calm from SSE to NE with which we kept stearing to the SW, but made but little way because of a swell which took us right ahead. At day light AM we saw, or thought we saw from the mast head the land which we have left to the northward of us join to that to the SW of us, and at the same time we immagined we saw the land extend to the Southward as far as SSW, but after steering this Course untill noon we discover'd our mistake for there was no land to be seen to the Southward of West which course we now steer'd; being by observation in the Latitude of 47°..12' So Longitude made from Cape Saunders West 2° 2' 
            
      

        9 March 1770
        Friday 9thPM winds at North a gentle breeze and clear weather. Stood to the westward untill sun set at which time the extremes of the land bore from NBE to West distant about 7 or 8 Leagues depth of water 55 fm. Variation by the Ampd 16°.29' Et The wind now veer'd to the westward and as the weather was fine and Moon light we kept standing close upon a wind to the SW all night: at 4 AM sounded and had 60 fm At day light we discover'd under our lee bow a ledge of rocks / on which the sea broke very high / extend from SBW to WBS and not above 3/4 of a Mile from us, yet upon sounding we had 45 fm water a rocky bottom. The wind being at N.W. we could not weather the Ledge and as I did not care to run to Leeward we tacked and made a trip to the Eastward, but the wind soon after coming to north inabled us to go clear of all     our soundings in passing within the Ledge was from 35 to 47 fm a rocky bottom - This Ledge lies SE Six Leagues from the southermost part of the land and SEBS from some remarkable hills which stand near the Shore. These rocks are not the only dangers that lay here for about three leagues to the northward of them is a nother ledge of rocks laying full three Leagues from the land whereon the sea broke very high, as we pass'd these rocks in the night at no great distance and discover'd the others close under our lee at day light it is apparent that we had a very fortunate escape I have named them the Traps because they lay as such to catch unweary strangers  At Noon our Latitude by Observation was 47°..26' So Longde made from Cape Saunders 3°..4' Wt The land in sight / which has very much the appearence of an Island / extending from NEBN to NWBW distant from the shore about 4 or 5 Leagues - the eastermost Ledge of rocks bore SSE distant 11/2 Leagues and Northermost  NE 1/2E 3 Leagues. This land is of a moderate height and hath avery barren Aspect, not a tree to be seen upon it only a few small shrubs. There were several white patches on which the Suns rays reflected very strongly which I take to be a kind of Marble such as we have seen in many places of this country, particularly to the northward 
            
      

        10 March 1770
        Saturday 10thPM Moderate breeze at NWBN and north with which we stood close upon a Wind to the westward     At sunset the Southermost point of land which I have afterwards named South Cape and which lies in the Latde of 47°..19' S, Longd 192°..12 West from Greenwich bore N 38° Et distant 4 Leagues and the westermost land in sight bore No 2° East: this last was a small Isld lying off the point of the Main. I began now to think that this was the southermost land and that we should be able to get round it by the west, for we have had a large hollow SW ell from the SW ever sence we had the last gale of wind from that quarter which makes me think that there is no land in that direction 
        In the night it began to blow in so much that at or before day light we were brought under our two Courses, but at 8 AM it fell moderate and we set the topsails close reef'd and the Mizn and Mizn staysail being split we unbent them and bent others. At Noon the wind coming to west we tack'd and stood to the northward. having no land in sight - our Latitude by Observation was 47°..33' So Longde west from the South Cape 0°..59' 
            
      

        11 March 1770
        Sunday 11th Winds between the West and N.W. a fresh gale and clear weather. Stood away NNE close upon a wind without seeing any land untill 2 AM when we discover'd an Island bearing NWBN distant 4 or 5 Leagues. two hours after this we saw the land a head upon which we tack'd and stood off untill 7 6 oClock then Stood in in order to take a nearer View of the land it At 11 oClock being about 3 Leagues from the land and and the wind seem'd to incline on shore, we tack'd and Stood off to the southward and now we thought that the land to the southward or that we have been sailing round these two days past was an Island, because there appeared an open Channel between the North part of that land and the south part of the other in which we thought we saw the small Island we were in with on the 6th instant, but when I came to lay this land down upon paper from the several bearings I had taken it appear'd that there was but little reason to suppose it an Id   on the Contrary, I hardly have a doubt but what it joins to and makes a part of the main land the western extremety of which bore from at Noon N 59° West and the Island seen in the morning So 59° West distant 5 Leagues - Latd Obsd 46°.24' So This Island I have named after Dr Solander / Latde 46°.31' So Longde 192°..49' Wt / it is nothing but a barren rock of about a Mile in circuit remar[k]ably high and lies full 5 Legues from the Main. The shore of the main lies nearest EBS and WBN and forms a large open Bay in which there is no appearence of a harbour or other place of safety for shipping against SW and southerly winds. The face of the Country bears a very ruged asspeckt being full of high craggy hills on the summits of which were several patches of snow, however the land is not wholy barren we could see wood not only in the Vallies but on several of the hills, but we saw no signs of inhabitants 
            
      

        12 March 1770
        Monday 12th Fresh Gales between the West and NW, latter part Squally with rain: Stood to the SWBS untill 11AM at which time the wind Shifted to the SWBW, we wore and Stood to the NNW, being then in the Latitude of 47°..40' So and in the Longitude 193°..50' - West haveing a hollow sea from the South westward 
            
      

        13 March 1770
        Tuesday 13th Strong gales between the SWBW and SSW with a large hollow sea from the same quarter. In the PM had frequent squals with showers of rain, in the night had several very heavy squalls attended with showers of hail which obliged us to take in our topsails during the night. Steer'd NNW untill 6 AM when seeing no land we steer'd NBE and set the main topsail close reef'd - At 8 oClock Set the fore topsail single reef'd, loosed all the reefs out of the Main topsail and steer'd NEBE1/2E in order to make the land - At 10 saw it bearing ENE and appear'd to be very high but being hazey over it we could see nothing distinct neither now nor at noon when by Obsern we were in the Latitude of 46°.0' So Course and distance sail'd sence yesterday N 5° Wt 96 Miles and Longitude made from the South Cape 1°..40' West 
            
      

        14 March 1770
        Wednesday 14th In the PM had a fresh gale from the Southward attended with squals. at 2 oClock it clear'd up over the land which appear'd high and Mountainous. At half past 3 double reef'd the Topsails and haul'd in for a Bay wherein there appear'd to be good anchorage and into which I had thoughts of going with the Ship   but after standing in an hour we found the distance too great to run before dark and it blowed too hard to attempt it in the night or even to keep to windward     for these reasons we gave it up and bore away aLong shore. This Bay I have named duskey Bay it lies in in the Latitude of 45°..47' So   it is about 3 or 4 Miles broad at the entrance and seems to be full as deep, in which there it are several Islands behind which there must be shelter from all winds provided there is a sufficient depth of water. The north point of this bay when it bears SEBS is very remarkable there being off it five high peaked rocks standing up like the four fingers and thum of a mans hand on which account I have named it Point five fingers          the land of this point is farther remarkableand by being the only level land near it and extend near two leagues to the northward   it is pretty high, wholy cover'd with wood and hath very much the appearence of an Island by its aspect being so very different from the land behind it which is nothing but barren rocky mountains 
        At sun set the Southermost land in sight bore due south distant 5 or 6 Leagues and as this is the westermost point of land upon the whole Coast I have call'd it West Cape   it lies about three leagues to the southward of the Bay above mentioned in the Latitude of 45°..54' So and in the Longitude 193°..17' West -   the land of this Cape seems to be of a moderate height next the sea and hath nothing remarkable about it that we could see except a very white Clift two or three leagues to the southward of it.    the land to the southward of Cape West trends away towards the SE, to the northward of it it trends NNE and NE - At 7 oClock brought the Ship too under the fore sail with her head off shore having a fresh gale at SBE - At Midnight it moderated and we wore and lay her head in shore untill 4 AM then made sail and steerd along shore NE 1/2N having a moderate breeze at SSE. At Noon was we were by obsern in the Latde 45°..13' So Course and distance saild since yesterday N. 41° Et 62 Miles, Longde made from Cape West 0°..29' East being at this time about 11/2 league from shore   sounded but had no ground with 70 fms of line. A little before noon we pass'd a small narrow opening in the land where there appear'd to be a very snug harbour form'd by an Island lying in the middle of the opening at least such was the appearences - it lies in the Latde of 45°.. 16' So  In land behind this opening were mountains the summits of which were cover'd with snow that seem'd to have fallen lately and this is not to be wonder'd at for we have found it very cold for these 2 days past 
        The Land on each side of the entrance of this harbour riseth almost perpendicular from the Sea to a very considerable height and this was the reason why I did not attempt to go in with the Ship because I saw clearly that no winds could b[l]ow there but what was either right in or right out.   this is Westerly or Easterly, and it certainly would have been highly imprudent in me to have put into aplace where we could not have got out but with a wind that we have lately found does not blow one day in amonth: I mention this because there were some on board that wanted me to harbour at any rate without in the least considering either the present or futurethe concequences 
            
      

        15 March 1770
        Thursday 16th [15th] Clear weather winds at SW and SWBS a gentle breeze except in the night when we had variable light airs and calms. In the evening being about 2 Leagues from the land we sounded but had no ground with 103 fathom of line - Variation pr Azth 14°..   ' East, pr Ampde 15°..2' East    With what wind we had we made the best of our way along shore to the NE keeping at the distance of 2 or 3 Leagues from the land - At noon was we were in the Latitude of 44°..47', haveing run only 12 leagues upon a NE1/4N Course sence yesterday at noon - Longitude made from Cape West 1°..3' East 
            
      

        16 March 1770
        Friday 16th Winds at SW a fresh breeze and clear weather - Steer'd along shore NE1/4E untill Six oClock PM when we shortend sail and brought too for the night - Variation pr Azths 13°..48' East - At 4 AM made sail and stood in for the land - At day light saw the appearence of an Inlet into the land but upon a nearer approach found that it was only a deep Vally bounded on each side by high lands upon which we bore away NE1/4E along shore, keeping about 4 or 5 Miles off - At Noon the Northeastermost point of land in sight bore N 60° East Distant 10 Miles, our Latitude by observation was 44°.. 5' and Longde made from Cape West 2°..8' East 
            
      

        17 March 1770
        Saturday 17th Continued our course along shore having in the PM the advantage of a fresh gale at SW. At 2 oClock past by the point above mentioned which is of a moderate height with steep red clifts down which falls four small streams of water on which account it is named Cascades Point  Latde 44°..0' So Longitude 2°..20' East from Cape West. From this point the land at first trends N 76° E but afterwards more to the northward,    ENE 8 Leagues from the point and near the shore lies a small low Island which I have named bore from us SBE distant 11/2 Leage    at 7 oClock, at which time we shortend sail & brought too under the topsails with her head off shore having 33 fath. water a fine sandy bottom - At 10 had 50 fathom and at 12 were in 65 fathom haveing drove about 5 Miles NNW sence we brought too -    two hours after this had no ground with 140 fathom which shews that the soundings extend but a little way from the land.    from 2 to 8 AM had it calm and hazey with drizling rain, at which time a breeze sprung up at SW with which we steer'd along shore NEBE1/4E keeping about 3 Leagues from the land - At noon had no observation being hazey weather with rain -    our run sence yesterday at noon is NEBE 55 Miles. Longitude from Cape West 3°..12' East 

        Sunday 18th In the PM had a fresh breeze at SWBW attended with drizling rain. At 8 oClock being about 3 Leagues from the land shortend sail and brought too having run 10 Leagues NEBE sence noon. at this time had 44 fathom water and 2 hours before had 17 fathom a fine sandy bottom being than about 1 League from the shore - had it calm the most part of the night and untill 10 oClock AM when a light breeze sprung up at SWBW and we made sail along shore NEBN having a large swell from the WSW which had risen in the night - At Noon Latitude in per Obsern 43°..4' So Course and distance saild sence yesterday is No 54° East 54 Miles - Longitude made from Cape West 4°..12' East. The Mountains and some of the Vallies we observed this morning were wholy coverd with snow, part of which we suppos'd to have fallen in the PM and fore part of the night at the time that we had rain, and yet the weather is not cold.

        Monday 19th In the PM had a fresh breeze at SWBW and WSW which we made the most of untill 6 oClock when we shortend sail and at 10 brought too and sounded and had 115 fathom water judging our selves to be about 5 Leagues from the land. At midnight it fell little wind on which accout we made sail    at 8AM the wind veer'd to the NWBN with which we stood to the NE close upon a wind untill noon at which time we tack'd beingwere about 3 Leagues from the land and by observation in the Latitude of 42°..8' and Longitude from Cape West 5°..5' Et   Course and distance run sence yesterday at Noon No 35° Et 68 Ms depth of Water 65 fathoms, the land extending from NEBN to SSW.

        22 March 1770
        Thursday 22d In the PM had a gentle breeze from the S.SW with which we steerd along shoreNE untill 8 oClock when being about 2 or 3 Leagues from shore we sounded and had but 34 fathom upon which we hauld off NWBN untill 11 then brought too, having at this time 64 fathom - At 4 AM made sail to the NE, wind at S.S.W a light breeze    At 8 oClock the wind Veer'd to the westward and soon after fell Calm    at this time we was were about 3 or 4 Miles from the Shore and in 54 fathom water, having a large swell from the WSW rowling Obliquely upon the shore, which put me under a good deal of apprehension that we should be oblige'd to anchor, but by the help of a light air now and then from the SW quarter we were enabled to keep the Ship from driving much nearer the shore - At Noon the northermost land in sight which we took to be the point which lies N W           Leagues from the entrance of Queen Charlottes Sound / bore NEBE1/4E distant 7 8 or 10 Leagues - our Latitude by account was 40°..55' So Longitude from Cape West 6°..35' Et     Course and distance saild sence yesterday N 36° E - 42 Miles Very foggy over the land 
            
      

        23 March 1770
        Friday 23rd Light airs from the southward, at intervals Calm, the fore part hazey, the remainder clear pleasent weather. At Noon our Latitude by observation was 40°..36'..30" So Longitude from Cape West 6°..52'' East - the Eastermost point of land in sightwhich lies to the West of Queen Charlottes Sound bore Et 10° North distant 7 Leagues and a bluff head or point, we was were abreast off yesterday at noon, off which lay some rocks above water, bore So 18° West distant 6 Leagues; this point I have named Rocks point       Latitude 40°..55' South 
        Having now nearly run down the whole of this NW Coast Tovy poenammu it is time I should describe the face of the Country as it hath at different times appeard to us. I have mentioned on the 11 Instant at which time we were off the Southern part of the Island, that the land seen then was Ruged and Mountainous and there is great reason to beleive that the same ridge of Mountains extends nearly the whole length of the Island - From between the Westermost land seen that day and the Eastermost seen on the 13th there is a space of about 6 or 8 Leagues of the Sea Coast unexplored but the mountains inland were Visible enough. The land near the Shore about Cape West is rather low and riseth with a gradual assent up to the foot of the mountains and appear'd to be mostly cover'd with Wood - from Point five fingers down to the Latitude of 44°..20' there is a narrow ridge of hills rising diri[c]tly from the sea which were are cloathed with wood. Close behind these hills lies the ridge of Mountains which are of a prodigious height and appear to consist of nothing but barren rocks, cover'd in many places with large patches of snow which perhaps have lain their sence the creation      no country upon earth can appear with a more ruged and barren aspect than this doth from the sea for as far inland as the eye can reach nothing is to be seen but the sumits of these rocky mountains which seem to lay so near one another as not to admit any Vallies between them 
        From the Latitude of 44°..20' to the Latitude 42° 8' these mountains lay farther inland,    the Country between them and the Sea consists of woody hills and Vallies and of various extent both for height and depth and hath much the appearance of fertility     many of the Vallies are large low and flat and appeard to be wholy cover'd with Wood but it is very probable that great part of the land is taken up in Laks Ponds &Ca as is very common in such like places      From the last mentioned Latitude to Cape Farewell, / afterwards so call'd / the Land is not distinguished by anything remarkable     it riseth into hills directly from the sea and is cover'd with wood. While we was were upon this part of the coast the weather was foggy in so much that we could see but a very little way in land.   however we sometimes saw the summits of the Mountains above the fogg and clowds which plainly shew'd that the inland parts were high and Mountainous and gave me great reason to think that thier is a continued chain of Mountains from the one End of the Island to the other 
            
      

        24 March 1770
        Saturday 24th In the PM had a gentle breeze at SW which by dark run us the length of the Eastren point set at noon, and not knowing what course the land took on the other side we brought too in 34 fathom water about one league from the land. At 8 oClock it fell falling little wind we fill'd and stood on untill 12 at which time we brought too untill 4 AM than made sail - At day light we saw the low land extending from the above point to the ESE as far as the eye could reach, the Eastern extremity of which appeared in round hillocks.   by this time the wind had veer'd to the Eastward which obliged us to ply to wind ward - At Noon the point above mentioned bore SWBS distant 16 Miles - Latde obserd 40°..19' So This point I afterward named Cape Fare-well, for reasons which will be given in their proper place 
            
      

        25 March 1770
        Sunday 25th Winds Easterly, towards noon had little wind and hazey with rain - made several trips but gain'd nothing to windward so that at noon our situation was nearly the same as yesterday 
            
      

        26 March 1770
        Monday 26th At 3 PM the wind came to north and we steer'd ESE with all the sail we could set untill dark when we shortend sail untill the morning having thick misty weather all night     we kept the lead going continualy and had from 37 to 42 fathoms At day light we saw the land bearing SEBE and an Island laying near it bearing ESE distant 5 Leagues, This I knew to be the Island seen from the Entrance of Queen Charlotte's Sound from which it bears NWBN distant 9 Leagues - At Noon it bore SE distant 4 or 5 miles, and the NW head of Queen Charlottes Sound bore SEBS distant 101/2 Leagues    Latitude Observed 43°.. 33' SoLongitude made from                 0°.. 43' East  
            
      

        27 March 1770
        Tuesday 27th Fresh breeze of wind westerly and hazey misty weather with drizling rain. As we have now circumnavigated the whole of this Country it is time for me to think of quiting of it, but before I do this it will be necessary first to compleat our water especialy as we have on board above 30 Tuns of Casks empty and knowing that there is a bay between the above mentioned Island and Queen Charlottes Sound wherein, no doubt there is anchorage and convenient watering places, for accordingly in the PM we hauled round the Island and into the bay, leaving three more Islands on our Starboard hand which lay close under the west shore 3 or 4 Miles within the entrance,    as we run in we kept the lead going and had from 40 to 12 fathom - At 6 oClock we anchord in a 11 fathom water a Muddy bottom under the west shore   in the second Cove within the fore mentioned Islands 
        At day light AM I took a boat and went to look for a watering place and a proper birth to moor the Ship in both of which I found convenient enough     after the Ship was Moor'd I sent an officer a shore to superintend the watering and the Carpenter with his crew to cut wood while the long-boat was employ'd carrying a shore empty casks 
            
      

        28 March 1770
        Wednesday 28th Winds Westerly which in the AM blowed a fresh gale attend with rain. Employ'd geting on board Wood and water and fishing in the latter of which we were pretty successfull
            
      

        29 March 1770
        Thursday 29th In the PM had a strong gale from the westward, in the AM variable light airs from the eastward and hazey rainy weather the whole day which however did not prevent us from geting on board wood and water
            
      

        30 March 1770
        Friday 30th Winds at SE a moderate breeze, the first and middle parts dark hazey weather with rain the latter fair. In the AM as the wind seem'd to be settled at SE and having nearly compleated our water we warp'd the Ship out of the Cove in order to have room to get under sail, before this was done it was Noon at which time I went away in the Pinnace in order to examine the Bay and to explore as much of it as the little time I had would admit 
            
      

        31 March 1770
        Saturday 31st. In the PM after rowing a League and a half or two Leagues up the Bay I landed on the [sic] upon a point of land on the west side where from an eminency I could see this western arm of the Bay run in SWBW about 5 Leagues farther yet did not see the head of it. there appear'd to be several other inlets or at least small bays, between this and Cape the the NW head of Queen Charlottes sound in every one of which I make no doubt but what there is anchorage and shelter for ship as they are partly cover'd from the sea wind by the Islands which lay without them. The land about this bay at least what I could see of it is of a very hilly uneven surface and appears to be mostly cover'd with wood, shrubs, Firns &Ca which renders traveling both difficult and fatigueing. I saw no inhabitants neither have we seen any sence we have been in the bay, but met with several of there hutts all of which appear'd to have been at least twelve months deserted. Upon my return to the Ship in the evening I found the Water &Ca all on board and the Ship ready for sea and being now resolv'd to quit this country altogether and to bend my thoughts towards returning home by such a rout as might conduce most to the advantage of the service I am upon I consulted with the officers upon the most eligible way of putting this in execution. To return by the way of Cape Horn was what I most wish'd because by this rout we should have been able to prove the existence or non existence of a Southern Continent which yet remains doubtfull, but in order to ascertain this we must have kept in a high latitude in the very depth of winter but the condition of the ship in every respect was not thought sufficient for such an undertaking.   for the same reason the thoughts of proceeding directly to the Cape of Good Hope was laid a side especialy as no discovery of any moment could be hoped for in that rout     it was therefore resolved to return by way of the East Indies, but as the state of the Ships provisions was thought more than sufficient to carry us thither it was agree'd by the following rout -  upon leaving this coast to steer to the westward untill we fall in with the East Coast of New Holland and than to follow the deriction of that Coast to the northward or what other direction it might take untill we arrive at its northern extremityand if this should be found impractical than to endeavour to fall in with the lands or Islands discover'd by Quiros. With this View at day light in the morning we got under sail and put to sea having the advantage of a fresh gale at SE and clear weather - At Noon the Island which lies off the NW point of the Bay bore E 9° So distant 10 Miles - our Latitude by observation was 40°.35' So This bay I have named Admiralty Bay the NW point Cape Stephens and the SE point Point Jackson after the 2 Secretaries     it may always be know by the Island above Mentioned which is pretty high and lies NE 2 Miles from Cape Stephens Latde 40°..37' S, Longitude 185° 6' West
        Between this Island and Cape Farewell which is WBN and EBS distant 14 or 15 Leagues from each other the Shore forms a large deep bay the bottom of which we could hardly see in sailing in a straight line from the one Cape to the other: but it is not attall improbable but what it is all low land next the sea as we have met with less water here than on any other part of the Coast at the same distance from land - however a Bay there is and is known the Chart by the name of Blind Bay  but I have reason to believe it to be Tasmans Murderers Bay .

Last night we saw a Port Egmont Hen and this morning two more, a Pintado bird several Albetrosses and black sheer-waters. The first of these birds are certain signs of the nearness of land, indeed we cannot be far from it for by our Longitude we are a degree to the westward of the East side of Vandieman Land according to Tasmans the first discoverers Longitude of it who could not err much in so short a run as from this land to NewZzeland and by our Latitude we could not be above 50 or 55 Leagues to the northward of the place where he took his departure from.

        Thursday 19th In the PM had fresh gales at SSW and Clowdy Squaly weather with a large Southerly Sea - At 6 took in the Topsails and at 1 AM brought too and sounded but had no ground with 130 fathoms of line - At 5 Set the Topsails Close reef'd and 6 saw land extending from NE to West at the distance of 5 or 6 Leagues having 80 fathom water a fine sandy bottom    We continued Standing to the westward with the wind at SSW untill 8 oClock at which time we got topgt yards aCross made all sail, and bore away along shore NE for the Eastermost land we had in sight, being at this time in the Latitude of 37°..58' So and Longd of 210°..39' West. the Southermost Point of land we had in sight which bore from us W1/4S I judged to lay in the Latitude of 38°..0' So and in the Longitude of 211°..07' Wt from the Meridion of Greenwich. I have named it Point Hicks, because Leuitt Hicks was the first who discover'd this land 
        To the Southward of this point we could see no land and yet it was very clear in that quarter and by our Longitude compared with that of  Tasmans the body of Vandiemens land ought to lay have been due south from us and from the soon falling of the Sea after the wind abated I had reason to think it did.  but as we did not see it and finding this coast to trend NE  and SW or rather more to the westward makes me doubtfull whether they are land or no: however every one who compares this Journal with that of Tasman will be as good a judge  I am but it is  necessary to observe that I do not take the situation of Vandiemens from the printed charts but from the extract of Tasman's Journal published by Dirk Rembrantse 
        At Noon we were in the Latd of 37° 50' and Longd of 210..29Wt the extremes of the land extending from NW to ENE are markerable point

        Friday 20th In the PM and most part of the night had a fresh gale westerly with squals attended with showers of rain    In the AM had the wind at SW with serene weather. At 1 PM saw three water spouts at once, two were between us and the shore and one at some distance upon our Larboard quarter - At 6 oClock shortned sail and brought too for the night having 56 fathom a fine sandy bottom, the Northermost land in sight bore NBE1/2E and a small Island Iying close to a point on the Main bore west distant 2 Leagues - this point I have named Cape Howe, it may be known by the Trending of the Coast which is north on the one side and SW on the other / Latitude 37°..28' So Longde 210°..3' West / it may likewise be known by some round hills upon the Main just within it. Having brought too with her head off shore we at 10 oClock wore and lay her head in untill 4 AM at which time we made sail along Shore to the Northward - At 6 oClock the northermost land in sight bore North being at this time about 4 Leagues from the land. At Noon we were in the Latitude of 36°..51' So and Longitude of 209°..53' West and 3 Leagues from ye land Courses saild along shore sence yesterday at noon was first No 52° East 30 Miles than NBE and NBW 41 Miles The weather being clear gave us an oppertunity to View the Country which had a very agreeable and promising Aspect the land is of moderate height diversified with hills, ridges, planes and Vallies with some few small lawns, but for the most part the whole was cover'd with wood, the hills and ridges rise with a gentle slope, they are not high neither are there many off them -
            
      

        21 April 1770
        Saturday 21st Winds Southerly a gentle breeze and clear weather with which we coasted along shore to the northward. In the PM we saw the smook of fire in several places a certain sign that the Country is inhabited - At 6 oClock being about 2 or 3 Leagues from the land we shortned sail and sounded and found 44 fathom water a sandy bottom; stood on under an easy sail untill 12 oClock at which time we brought too untill 4 AM when we made sail again having than 90 fathom water 5 Leagues from the land At 6 oClock we were a breast of a pretty high mountain laying near the shore which on account of its figure I named Mount Dromedary Latde 36°..18' So Longde 209°..55' Wt / The shore under the foot of this Mountain forms a point which I have named Cape Dromedary over which is a peaked hillick    At this time found the Variation to be 10°.42' Et Between 10 and 11 oClock Mr Green and I took several observations of the Sun and Moon the mean result of which gave 209°..17' West Longitude from the Meridion of Greenwich. By observations made yesterday we were in the Longitude 210°..9' - 20' gives 209°..49' the Longitude of the Ship to day at noon per yesterdays observations, the mean of which and to days gives 209°..33' Wt by which I fix the Longitude of this Coast - our Latitude at Noon was 35°..49' So Cape Dromedary bore So 30° Wt distt 12 Leagues - an open Bay wherein lay three or 4 small Islands bore NWBW distant 4 5 or 6 Leagues   this Bay seem'd to be but very little shelterd from the sea winds and yet it is the only likely anchoring place I have yet seen upon the Coast
            
      

        22 April 1770
        Sunday 22d In the PM had a gentle breeze at SBW with which we steerd along shore NBE and NNE at the distance of about 3 Leagues; saw the smook of fire in several places near the Sea beach. At 5 oClock we were abreast of a Point of land which on account of its perpendicular clifts I call'd Point Upright / Latde 35°..35'/ it bore from us due west distant 2 Leagues and in this situation had 31 fm water a Sandy bottom - At 6 oClock falling little wind we hauld off ENE   at this time the Northermost land in sight bore NNE1/2E - At midnight being in 70 fathom water we brougt too untill 4 AM    at which time we made sail in for the land and at day light found our selves nearly in the same place we we was were at 5 oClock in the evening by which it was apparent that we had been drove between about 3 Leagues to the Southward by a Tide or Current in the night, after this we steerd along shore NNE having a gentle breeze at SW. and were so near the Shore as to distinguish several people upon the Sea beach   they appear'd to be of a very dark or black Colour but whether this was the real colour of their skins or the C[l]othes they might have on I know not - At Noon we were by observation in the Latitude of 35°..27' and Longde 209°..23'. Cape Dromedary bore So 28° West distt 19 Leags    a remarkable peaked hill laying inland the top of which look'd like a Pigeon house and occasioned my giving it that name, bore N 32°..30' Wt and a small low Island laying close under the shore bore NW distt 2 or 3 Leagues, Variation of the Compass 9°..50' Et When we first discover'd this Island in the morning I was in hopes from its appearence that we should have found shelter for the Ship behind it but when we came to approach it near I did not think that there was even security for a boat to land, but this I believe I should have attempted had not the wind come on shore  after which I did not think it safe to send a boat from the ship as we had a large hollow sea from ye SE rowling in from the SE upon the land which beat every were very high upon the Shore and this we have had ever sence we came upon the Coast. The land near the Sea coast still continues of a moderate hieght forming alternatly rocky points and Sandy beaches, but inland between Mount Dromedary and the Pigeon house are several pretty high Mountains two only of which we saw but what were coverd with trees and these lay inland behindnear to the Pigeon house and are remarkably flat atop with steep rocky clifts all round them as far as we could see - the trees in this Country hath all the appearence of being stout and lofty - For these two days past the observe'd Latitude hath been 12 or 14 Miles to the Southward of the Ships account given by the Log which can be owing to nothing but a Curre[n]t set to the Southward 
            
      

        23 April 1770
        Monday 23rd In the PM had a gentle breeze at North East East which in the night Veer'd to NE and North- At 1/2 past past 4 PM being [a]bout 5 Miles from the land we tack'd and stood off SE and East untill 4 AM at which time we tackd and stood in, being than about 9 or 10 Leagues from the land - At 8 oClock it fell little wind and soon after Calm - At Noon we were by observation in the Latitude of 35°..38' and about Six Leagues from the land - Mount Dromedary bearing So 37° West distt 17 Leagues and the Pidgeon house N 40° west in this situation had 74 fathom water
            
      

        24 April 1770
        Tuesday 24th In the PM had variable Light airs and calms untill 6 oClock at which time a breeze sprung up at NBW. at this time we had 70 fathom water being about 4 or 5 Leagues from the land the Pigeon house bearing N. 40° West. and Mount Dromedary So 30° West and the northermost land in sight No 19° East - Stood to the NE untill noon haveing a gentle breeze at NW. at which time we tack'd and stood to the westward being than by obsern in the Latde of 35° 10' So and Longde 208° 51' [48 in pencil] Wt A point of land which I named Cape St George we having discover'd it on that Saints day, bore West distant 19 Miles and the Pigeon house So 75° West,  the Latitude and Longitude of which I found to be 35°..19' S and 209° 42' West. In the morning we found the Variation to be by the Ampde 7°..50 East by several Azimuths 7°..54' East
            
      

        25 April 1770
        Wednesday 25th In the PM had a fresh breeze at NW untill 3 oClock at which time it came to WSWwest and we tack'd and stood to the Northward. At 5 oClock being about 5 or 6 Leags from the land. the Pigeon house bearing WSW distant 9 Leagues   Sounded and had 86 fathom water, At 8 oClock being very squaly with lightning we Close reef'd the topsails and brought too being then in 120 fathom water. At 3 AM we made sail again to the northward having the advantage of a fresh gale at SW. At Noon we were about 3 or 4 Leagues from the land and in the Latde of 34°..22' and Longitude 208°.. 49' 36' West. Course and distance Saild sence yesterday noon is NBE 49 Miles. In the Course of this days run we saw the smook of fire in severl places near the sea beach. About 2 Leagues to the northward of Cape StGeorge       the Shore seems to form a bay which appeard to be shelterd from the NE winds but as we had the wind it was not in my power to look into it and the appearence was not favourable enough to induce me to loose time in beating up to it. the north point of this bay on account of its figure I named Long Nose, Latitude 35°..4' So 8 Leagues to the northward of this is a point which I calld rRed point, some part of the land about it appeared of that colour / Latitude 34°..29' Longde 208°..49' / a little way in land to the NW of this point is a round hill the top of which look'd like the Crown of a hatt 
            
      

        26 April 1770
        Thursday 26th Clear Serene weather. In the PM had a light breeze at NNW untill 5 oClock at which time it fell calm we being then about 3 or 4 Leags from the land and in 48 fathom water. Variation pr Azimuth 8..48 East the extremes of the land from NEBN to SWBS  Saw several smooks along shore before dark and two or 3 times afire in the night. we lay becalm'd driving in before the Sea untill 1 oClock AM at which time we got a breeze from the land with which we steer'd NE being then in 38 fathom water - At Noon it fell little wind and Veerd to NEBN, we being than in the Latitude of 34°..10' and Longitude 208°.27' Wt and about 5 Leags from the land which extended from S-37° Wt to N1/2E. In this Latitude are some white clifts which rise perpendicularly from the sea to a moderate height
            
      

        27 April 1770
        Friday 27th Variable light airs between the NE and NW clear pleasent weather. In the PM stood off shore untill 2 oClock than tack'd and stood in untill 6 at which time we tack'd and stood off being then in 54 fathoms water and about 4 or 5 Miles from the land  the extremes of which bore from So 28° West to N. 25°.30' East. At 12 oClock we tackd and stood in untill 4 AM than made a trip off untill day light after which we stood in for the land, in all this time we lost ground owing a good deal to the Variableness of the winds for at Noon we were by observation in the Latitude of 34°..21', Red Point bearing So 27 Wt distant 3 Leagues. in this situation we were about 4 or 5 Miles from the land which extended from So 19°..30' West to North 29° East 
            
      

        28 April 1770
        Saturday 28th In the PM hoisted out the Pinnace and yawl in order to attempt a landing but the Pinnace took in the water so fast that she was obliged to be hoisted in again to stop her leakes - At this time we saw several people a shore four of whome where carrying a small boat or Canoe which we imagined they were going to but into the water in order to come off to us but in this we were mistaken    Being now not above two Miles from the Shore Mr Banks Dr Solander Tupia and myself put off in the yawl and pull'd in for the land to a place where we saw four or five of the natives who took to the woods as we approachd the Shore which disapointed us in our the expectation we had of getting a near view of them if not to speak to them but our disapointment was heighten'd when we found that we no where could effect a landing by reason of the great surff which beat every where upon the shore - we saw hauld up upon the beach 3 or 4 small Canoes which to us appear'd not much unlike the small ones of New Zeland, in the woods were several trees of the Palm kind and no under wood and this was all we were able to observe of the country from the boat after which we returnd to the Ship about 5 in the evening. at this time it fell calm and we were not above a mile and a half from shore in a 11 fathom water and within some breakers that lay to the southward of us    but luckily a light breeze came off from the land which carried us out of danger and with which we stood to the northward    At day light in the morning we discover'd a Bay which appeard to be tollerably well shelterd from all winds into which I resoloved to go with the Ship and with this view sent the Master in the Pinnace to sound the entrance while we kept turning up with the Ship haveing the wind right out   At Noon the entran[c]e bore NNW distance 1 Mile 
            
      

        29 April 1770
        Sunday 29th In the PM winds southerly and clear weather with which we stood into the bay and Anchor'd under the South shore about 2 Mile within the entrence in 6 fathoms water, the south point bearing SE          and the north point East, Saw as we came in on both points of the bay Several of the natives and afew hutts, Men women and children on the south shore abreast of the Ship to which place I went in the boats in hopes of speaking with them accompaned by Mr Banks Dr Solander and Tupia- as we approached the shore they all made off except two Men who seem'd resolved to oppose our landing - as soon as I saw this I orderd the boats to lay upon their oars in order to speake to them but this was to little purpose for neither us nor Tupia could understand one word they said.   we then threw them some nails beeds &Ca a shore which they took up and seem'd not ill pleased with in so much that I thout that they beckon'd to us to come a shore but in this we were mistaken for as soon as we put the boat in they again came to oppose us    upon which I fired a musket between the two which had no other effect than to make them retire back where bundles of thier darts lay and one of them took up a stone and threw at us which caused my fireing a second Musquet load with small shott and altho' some of the shott struck the man yet it had no other effect than to make him lay hold of a Shield or target to defend himself    emmediatly after this we landed which we had no sooner done than they throw'd two darts at us  this obliged me to fire a third shott soon after which they both made off, but not in such haste but what we might have taken one, but Mr Banks being of opinion that the darts were poisoned made me cautious how I advanced into the woods - We found here a few Small hutts made of the bark of trees in one of which were four or five small children with whome we left some strings of beeds &Ca    a quantity of darts lay about the hutts these we took away with us - three Canoes lay upon the bea[c]h the worst I think I ever saw   they were about 10 12 or 14 feet long made of one peice of the bark of a tree drawn or tied up at each end and the middle kept open by means of peices of sticks by way of Thwarts 
        After searching for fresh water without success except a little in a small hole dug in the sand, we embarqued and went over to the north point of the bay were in coming in we saw several people   but when we landed now there were no body to be seen - we found here some fresh water which came trinkling down and stood in pools among the rocks: but as this was troblesome to come at I sent a party of men a shore in the morning to the place where we first landed to dig holes in the sand by which means and a small stream they found fresh water sufficient to water the ship - the strings of beeds &Ca we had left with the children last night were found laying in the hut this morning probably the natives were afraid to take them away - after breakfast we sent some empty casks a shore and a party of men to cut wood and I went my self in the Pinnace to sound and explore the Bay - in the doing of which I saw severl of the natives but they all fled at my approach - I landed in two places one of which the people had but just left as there were small fires and fresh muscles broiling upon them - here likewise lay vast heaps of the largest oyster shells I ever saw. I likewise saw of the oysters themselves as I rowed over ths shoals but being highwater I could not get any having nothing we me to take them up  
            
      

        30 April 1770
        Monday, 30th As soon as the wooders and wateres were come on board to dinner 10 or 12 of the natives came to the watering place and took away their canoes that lay there but did not offer to touch any one of our Casks that had been left ashore and in the after noon 16 or 18 of them came boldly up to within 100 yards of our people at the watering place and there made a stand - Mr Hicks who was the officer ashore did all in his power to entice them to him by offering them presents &Ca but it was to no purpose  all they seem'd to want was for us to be gone - after staying a short time they went away   they were all arm'd with darts and wooden swords, the darts have each four prongs and pointed with fish bones and those we have seen seem to be intend more for strikeing fish than offensive weapons neither are they poisoned as we at first thought  After I had returnd from sounding the bay I went over to a Cove on the south north side of the bay where in 3 or 4 hauls with the Saine we caught about 300 pounds weight of fish which I caused to be equally divided among the Ships Company  In the AM I went in the Pinnace to sound and explore the North side of the bay where I neither met with inhabitants or any thing remarkable  Mr Green took the Suns Meridion Altitude a little with the south entrence of the bay which gave the Latitude 34°..0' So
            
      

        1 May 1770
        Tuesday, May 1st Gentle breezes northerly. In the PM ten of the Natives again Viseted the watering place. I being on board at this time went emmediatly aShore, but before I got there they were going away, I follow'd them alone and unarm'd some distance along shore but they would not stop untill they got farther off than I thought choose to trust myself     these were arm'd in the same manner as those that came yesterday. In the evening I sent some hands to haul the Saine but they caught but a very few fish. A little after sun rise I found the Variation to be 11°..3' East. Last night Torby Sutherland seaman departed this life and in the AM his body was buried a shore at the watering place which occasioned my calling the south point of this Bay after his name. This morning a party of us went aShore to some hutts not far from the watering place where some of the natives are daily seen, here we left several articles such as Cloth, Looking glasses, Combs, Beeds, Nails &Ca   after this we made an excursion into the country which we found deversified with woods, Lawns and Marshes; the woods are free from under wood of every kind and the trees are at such a distance from one a nother that the whole Country or at least great part of it might be cultivated without being oblig'd to cut down a single tree,    we found the soil every where except in the Marshes to be a light white sand and produceth a quanty of good grass which grows in little tufts about as big as one can hold in ones hand and pretty close to one another, in this manner the surface of the ground is coated in the woods between the trees. Dr Solander had a bad sight of a small Animal some thing like a rabbit and we found the dung of an Animal which must feed upon grass and which we judge could not be less than a deer   we also saw the track of a dog or some such like Animal. we met with some hutts or and places where the natives had been and at our first seting out one of them was seen  the others I suppose had fled upon our approach. I saw some trees that had been cut down by the natives with some sort of a blunt instrument and several trees that were barked the bark of which had been cut by the same Instrument, in many of the trees, especialy the palms, were cut steps about 3 or 4 feet asunder for the conveniency of Climeing them - We found 2 sorts of Gum one sort of which is like Gum Dragon and is the same as what I suppose Tasman took for Gum lac and it is extracted from the largest tree in the woods.
            
      

        2 May 1770
        Wednesday 2d Between 3 and 4 oClock in the PM we returnd out of the Country and after dinner went a shore to the watering place where we had not been long before 17 or 18 of the natives appear'd in sight, in the morning I had sent Mr Gore with a boat up to the head of the bay to dridge for oysters    in his return to the ship he and a nother person came by land and met with these people who follow'd him at the distance of 10 or 20 yards   when ever Mr Gore made a Stand and face'd them they s[t]ood also and not withstanding they were all arm'd they never offerd to attack him but after he had parted from them and they were met by Dr Munkhouse and one or two more who upon makeing a sham retreat they throw'd 3 darts after them, after which the[y] began to retire      Dr Solander, I, and Tupia made all the haste we could after them but could by neither words nor actions prevail upon them to come near us. Mr Gore saw some up the bay who by signs invited him a shore which he prudantly declined 
        In the AM had the wind at SE with rain which prevented me from makeing an excursion up the head of the bay as I intended
            
      

        3 May 1770
        Thursday 3rd Winds at SE a gentle breeze and fair weather. In the PM I made a little excursion along the Sea Coast to the southward accompaned by Mr Banks and Dr Solander. At our first entering the woods we saw 3 of the natives who made off as soon as they saw us - more of them were seen by others of our people but who likewise made off as soon as they found they were discover'd. In the AM I went in the Pinnace to the head of the Bay accompan'd by Drs Soland [sic] and Munkhouse in order to examine the Country and to try to form some Connections with the natives: in our way thither we met with 10 or 12 of them fishing each in a Small Canoe who retired in to shoald water upon our approach, others again we saw at the first place we landed at who took to their Canoes and fled before we came near them: after this we took water and went almost to the head of the inlet where we landed and travel'd some distance inland. We found the face of the Country much the same as I have before described but the soil land much richer being for instead of sand I found in many places a deep black Soil which we thought was capable of produceing any kind of grain at present it produceth besides timber as fine meadow as ever was seen    However we found it not all like this     some few places were very rocky but this I beleive to be uncommon. the stone is sandy and very proper for building &Ca After we had sufficiently examined this part we return'd to the boat and seeing some smook and Canoes at a nother part we went theither in hopes of meeting with the people but they made off as we approached - there were Six Canoes and Six small fires near the shore and Muscles roasting upon thim and a few Oysters laying near, from this we conjecturd that there had been just Six people who had been out each in his Canoe picking up Muscles & oysters the Shell fish and come a shore to eat them where each had made his fire to dress them by - we taisted of their cheer and left them in return Strings of beeds &Canear to this place at the foot of a tree was a small well or Spring of [check MS] w[ate]r The day being now far spent we set out on our return to the Ship 
            
      

        4 May 1770
        Friday 4th - - - Winds Northerly serene weather   Upon my return to the Ship in the evening I found that none of the natives had appear'd near the watering place but about 20 Canoes of them had been fishing in their Canoes at no great distance from us. In the AM as the wind would not permit us to sail I sent out some parties into the Country to try to form some Connections with the natives.   one of the Midshipmen met with a very old man and woman and two small Children   they were close to the water side where several more were in their canoes gathering shell fish and he being alone was afraid to make any stay with the two old people least he should be discoverd by those in the Canoes - he gave them a bird he had shott which they would not touch neither did they speak one word but seem'd to be much frightn'd, they were quite naked even the woman had nothing to cover her nuditie. Dr Munkhouse and a nother man being in the woods not far from the watering place discoverd Six more of the natives who at first seem'd to wait his coming but as he was going upon to them he had a dart thrown at him out of a tree which narrowly escaped him, as soon as the fellow had thrown the dart he desended the tree and made off and with him all the rest and these were all that were met with in the Course of this day
            
      

        5 May 1770
        Saturday 5th In the PM I went with a party of Men over to the North shore and while some hands were hauling the Saine a party of us made an excursion of 3 or 4 Miles into the Country or rather along the Sea Coast. we met with nothing remarkable.   great part of the Country for some distance in land from the sea Coast is mostly a barren heath diversified with marshes and Morasses - Upon our return to the Boat we found they had caught a great number of small fish which the sailors call Leather Jackets on account of their having a very thick skin.   they are known in the West Indias. I had sent the yawl in the morning to fish for Sting rays who return'd in the evening with upwards of 4 hundred weight - one single one weigh'd 240 Ib exclusive of the entrails 
        In the AM as the wind still continued northerly I sent the yawl again afishing and I went with a party of Men into the Country but met with nothing extraordinary 
            
      

        6 May 1770
        Sunday 6th In the evening the yawl return'd from fishing having caught two Sting rays weighing near 600 poundsthe one weigh'd          pounds and the other exclusive of the entrails. The great quantity of New Plants &Ca Mr Banks & Dr Solander collected of this sort of fish found in this place occasioned my giveing it the name of Sting-Ray Harbour Botanyist Bay   it is situated in the Latitude of 34°..0' So Longitude 20 8°..37' West it is Capacious safe and commodious - it may be known by the land on the Sea-coast which is of a pretty even and moderate heightis level and rather higher than it is farther inland with steep rocky clifts next the Sea and looks like a long Island lying close under the Shore: the entrance of the harbour lies about the Middle of this land - in coming from the Southward you will it is discover'dthe entrance before you are abreast of it which you cannot do in coming from the northward. the entrance is little more than a quarter of Mile broad and lies in WNW. To sail into it keep the south shore on board untill within a small bare Island which lies close under the north shore being within that Island the deepest water is on that side 7, 6 and five fathom a good way up. there is shoal'd water a good way off from the South Shore from the inner South point qu[i]te to the head of the harbour but over to wards the north and NW shore is a channell of 12 or 14 feet water at low water 3 or 4 leagues up to a place where there is 3 & 4 fmbut there but here I found very little fresh water      we anchord near the south shore about a Mile within the entrance for the conveniency of sailing with a Southerly wind and the geting of fresh water but I afterwards found a very fine stream of fresh water on the north shore in the first sandy cove within the Island before which a Ship might lay almost land lock'd and wood for fual may be got every where: altho wood is here in great plenty yet there is very little variety   the largest trees are as large or larger than our oaks in England and grows a good deal like them and yeilds a redish gum    the wood itself is heavy, hard and black like Lignum Vitae    another sort that grows tall and strait some thing like Pines     the wood of this is like wise hard and heavy Ponderous and something of the nature of American live oak, these two are all the timber trees worth mentioning I met with, there are a few sorts of Shrubs and several Palm trees, and Mangroves about the head of the harbour - the Country is woody low and flat as far inland as we could see and I believe that the soil is in general sandy, in the wood are a variety of very boutifull birds such as Cocatoo's, Lorry quets Parrots &Ca and Crows exactly like those we have in England - Water fowl are no less plenty about the head of the harbour where there are large flats of sand and Mud on which they seek their food.   the most of these were unknown to us, one sort especialy which was black and white and as large as a goose but most like a pelican. On the Sand and Mud banks are Oysters, Muscles, Cockles &Ca which I beleive are the cheif support of the inhabitants who go into shoald water with their little canoes and pick them out of the sand and Mud with their hands and sometimes roast and eat them in the Canoe, having often a fire for that purpose as I suppose for I know no other it can be for. The Natives do not appear to be numerous neither do they seem to live in large bodies but dispers'd in small parties along by the water side. they are those I saw were about as tall as Europeans   of a very dark brown colour but not black [check MS] nor had they wooly frizled hair, but black and lank much like ours - no sort of cloathing or ornaments was were ever seen by any of us upon any one of them or in or about any of their hutts from which I conclude that they never wear any - some that we saw had their faces and bodies painted with a sort of white paint or Pigmentsomething that look'd white. Altho I have said that shell fish is their chief support yet they catch other sorts of fish, some of which we found roasting on the fire the first time we landed, some of these they strike with gigs and others they catch with hook and line we have seen them strike fish with gigs & hooks and lines were found in their hutts - Sting rays I believe they do not eat because I never saw the least remains of one near any of their hutts or fire places, neither were any of their darts or offensive weapons arm'd with the Stings of Sting rays the use I think they would apply'd them to did they make use of the fish. none of us ever saw any provisions laid up in store so that I beleive that they depend upon the present day for their subsistence, hHowever we could know but very little of their customs as we never were able to form any connections with them, they had not so much as touch'd the things we had left in their hutts on purpose for them to take away. The one we saw among them were darts / as some of which were bounded barb'd with fish bones stuck on with gum / and wooden swords - their defensive weapon is a Target made of the bark of the Gum tree During our stay in this Harbour I caused the English Colours to be display'd a shore every day and an inscription to be cut out upon one of the trees near the watering place seting forth the Ships name, date &Ca - Having seen every thing this place afforded we at daylight in the Morning weigh'd with a light breeze at NW and put to sea and the wind soon after coming to the Southward we steer'd along shore NNE and at Noon we were by observation in the Latitude of 33°.50' So about 2 or 3 Miles from the land and abreast of a Bay or Harbour wherein there apperd to be safe anchorage which I call'd Port Jackson. it lies 3 leags to the northward of Sting Ray's Harbour Botanyist Bay, I had almost forgot to mention that the tide in it is high water in this Harbour Bayflowes at the full and change of the Moon about 8 o' Clock and rises and falls upon a perpendicular about 4 or 5 feet
            
      

        7 May 1770
        Monday 7th Little wind southerly and serene pleasent weather. In the PM found the Variation by Several Azimuths to be 8° East - At sun set the Northermost land in sight bore N. 26° East, and some broken land that appear'd to form a Bay boare N. 40° West distant 4 Leagues. this Bay I named Broken Bay Latitude 33°..36' So We steerd along shore NNE all night at the distance of about 3 Leagues from the land having from 32 to 36 fathom a hard sandy bottom A little after Sun rise I tooke several Azimuths with four Needles belonging to the Azimuth Compass the mean result of which gave the Variation of 7°..56' East At Noon we were by observation in the Latitude of 33°..22' So and about 3 Leagues from the land, the northermost part of which in sight bore N 19° East Some pritty high land which projected out in two three bluff points and occasioned my calling it Cape Three Points / Latde 33° 33' / bore SW distant 5 Leagues - Longitude made from Sting ray Harbour Botany Bay 0°..19' East
            
      

        8 May 1770
        Tuesday 8th Variable Light winds and clear weather    In the PM saw some smooks upon the shore and in the evening found the Variation to be 8°..25' East.   at this time we were about 2 or 3 Miles from the land and had 28 fathom water. Our situation at Noon was nearly the same as yesterday. having advance'd not one step to the northward.
            
      

        9 May 1770
        Wednesday 9th Winds Northerly most part a fresh breeze with which we stood off shore untill 12 at night, at the distance of 5 Leagues from the land had 70 fathom, at the distance of 6 Leagues 80 fathom which is the extent of the Soundings for at the distance of 10 Leagues off we had no ground with 150 fathom - Stood in shore untill 8 oClock AM and hardly fetched the C. Three Points - Having little wind at NWBN we tack'd and stood off untill Noon at which time we tackd with the wind at NNE, being than in the Latde of 33°..37' So Cape Three Points bearing NWBW distant four Leagues 
            
      

        10 May 1770
        Thursday 10th In the PM had the wind at NEBN with which we stood in shore untill near 4 oClock when we tack'd in 23 fathom water being about a Mile from the land and as much to the Southward of Cape Three Points In the night the wind veer'd to NW and West and in the morning to SW.   having the advantage of a light Moon we made the best of our way along shore to the northward   At Noon we were by observation in the Latitude of 32°..53' So Longde 208°..00' West and about 2 Leagues from the Land which extended from N 41°. Et to S 41°.Wt   A small round rock or Island laying close under the land bore So 82° West distt 3 or 4 Leagues. At sun rise in the Morning found the variation to be 8° East. In the Latitude of 33°.. 2' So a little way inland is a remarkable hill that is shaped like the Crown of a hatt which we past about 9 oClock in the forenoon
            
      

        11 May 1770
        Friday 11th Winds southerly in the day and in the night Westerly a gentle breeze and clear weather. At 4 PM past at the distance of 1 Mile a low rocky point which I named Point Stephens / Latde 32° 45 a little to on the northward side of this point is an inlet which I calld Port Stephens / Lat. 32° 40, Logde 207° 51' / that appear'd to me from the mast head to be shelterd from all winds, before at the entrance lay 3 small Islands two of which are of a tolerable height and on the Main near the shore are some high round hills that make at a distance like Islands, in passing this bay at the distance of 2 or 3 miles from the shore our soundings were from 33 to 27 fathoms from which I conjector'd that there must be a sufficient depth of water for shipping in the Bay. We saw several smooks alittle way in the Country upon rise up from the flat land  by this I did suppose that there were Lagoons which afforded subsistance for the natives such as shell fish &Ca for we as yet know nothing else they live upon     At 1/2 past 5 the Northermost land in sight bore N. 36° Et and Point Point StephensKepple South-west distant 4 Leagues    at this time we took in our studding sails and run under an easey sail all night untill 4 oClock AM when we made all sail - our soundings in the night was from 48 to 62 fathom at the distance of between 3 and 4 Leagues from the land - At 8 oClock we were abreast of a high point of land which made in two hillocks - this point I called Cape Hawke Latde 32°..14' So Longde 207°..30 West; it bore from us at this time west distt 8 Miles and the same time the northermost land in sight bore N 6° East and appear'd high and like an Island - at Noon this land bore N. 8° East the northermost land in sight N. 13° East and Cape Morton Hawke So 37° West - Latde in pr Observation 32°..2' So which was 12 Miles to the southward of that given by the Logg - which I do suppose to be owing to a current setting that way. Course and distance saild sence yesterday at Noon was first NEBE. 27 Miles than N. 10° E 37 Miles - Longde in 207° 20' West Variation pr Morning Ampde and Azimuths 9°..10' East.
            
      

        12 May 1770
        Saturday 12th Winds southerly a gentle breeze. In the PM as we run along shore we saw several smooks a little way in land from the Sea and one upon the top of a hill which was the first we have seen upon elivated ground sence we have been upon the coast. At sun set we were in 23 fathom water and about a League and a half from the land, the northermost part of which we had in sight bore N 13° East and three remarkable large high hills lying continguous to each other and not far from the shore  NW bore NNW   As these hills bore some resemblence to each other we call'd them the Three Brothers   they lay in the Latitude of 31°- 40' So and are of a hieght sufficent to be seen 14 or 16 Leags    We steerd NEBN all night having from 27 to 67 fathom water from 2 to 5 or 6 Leagues from the land - At day light we steer'd north for the northermost land we had in sight. at noon we were 4 Leagues from the Land and by observation in the Latitude of 31° 128' So which was 15 miles to the southrd of that given by the Log.   our Course and distance made good sence yesterday noon was N 24° Et 48 Miles. Longde in 206° 58' West  Several smooks seen a little way in land 
            
      

        13 May 1770
        Sunday 13th In the PM stood in shore with the wind at NE untill 6 oClock at which time we tack'd being about 3 or 4 Miles from the land and in 24 fathom water  Stood off shore with a fresh breeze at North and NNW untill Midnightat night then tackd being in 118 fathom water and 8 Leagues from the Land - At 3 AM the wind veer'd to the westward and we tack'd and stood to the northward - At Noon we were by observation in the Latitude of 30°..43' So and Longde 206°..45' west and about 3 or 4 Leagues from the Land  the northermost part of which bore from us N. 13° West and a point or head land on which were fires that caused a great quantity of smook which occasioned my giving it the name of smooky Cape, bore SW distant 4 Leagues.   it is moderatly high land, over the pitch of the point is a round hillock    within it two others much higher and largers [sic] and within them very low land - Latitude 30°..51' So Longitude 206° 54' West,   besides the smook we saw seen upon this Cape we saw more in several places along the Coast  Variation pr Azths The observed Latitude was only 5 Miles to the southrd of the Log 
            
      

        14 May 1770
        Monday 14th At 1 PM it fell calm and continued so about an hour when a breeze sprung up at NE with which we stood in shore untill 6 oClock when being in 30 fathom water and 3 or 4 Miles from the land we tackd having the wind at NNW. at this time Smooky Cape bore So3/4W distant about 5 Leags and the northermost land in sight N1/4E. At 8 oClock we made a trip in shore for an hour    after this the wind came cross off shore with which we stood along shore to the northward having from 30 to 21 fm water at the distance of 4 or 5 Miles from the land,  At 5 AM the wind veer'd to north and blow'd a fresh breeze attended with squals and dark clowdy weather   At 8 oClock it began to Thunder and rain which lasted about an hour and then fell calm which gave us an oppertunity to sound and found 86 fm water being about 4 or 5 Leagues from the Land
        After this we got the wind southerly a fresh breeze and fair weather and we steerd NBW for the northermost land we had in sight. At Noon we were about 4 Leagues from the land and by observation in the Latitude of 30°..22' So which was 9 Miles to the southward of that given by the Log. Longitude in 206°..39' Wt and course and distance made good sence yesterday noon No 16° East 22 Miles - Some tolerable high land near the shore bore west - As I have not mentiond the aspect of the Country sence we left Botanist Bottany Bay Harbour Bay I shall now discribe it as it hath at different times appeard to us. As we have advanced to the northward the land hath increased in height in so much that in this latitude it may be call'd a hilly country but between this and Sting BotanyRay harbour Bay it is diversified with an agreeable variety of hils ridges Vallies and large planes all cloathed with wood which to all appearence is the same as I have before mentiond   as we could discover no Visible alteration in the soil near the shore the land is in general low and sandy except the points which are rocky and over many of them are pretty high hills which at first rising out of the water appear like Islands
            
      

        15 May 1770
        Tuesday 15th Fresh gales at SW, WSW and SSW   in the PM had some heavy squals attended with Rain and hail which oblig'd us to close reef our Topsails. Between 2 and 4 we had some small rocky Islands between us and the land   the southermost lies in the Latitude of 30°.. 210' and the northermost in 29°..58' and about 2 Leagues or more from the land
        we sounded and had 33 fathom water about 2 Miles without this last Island. At 8 oClock we brought too untill 10 at which time we made sail under our topsails having the advantage of the Moon   we steerd along shore North and. NBE keeping at the distance of about 3 Leagues from the land having from 30 to 25 fathom water,  as soon as it was day light we made all the sail we could having the advantage of a fresh gale and fine weather. At 9 oClock being about a League from the land we saw upon it People and smook in several places. At Noon we were by observation in the Latitude of 28°..39' So and Longitude 206°..27'. Course and distance saild sence yesterday at noon North 6°..45' East 104 Miles - A tolerable high point of land bore NWBW distant 3 Miles - this point I named Cape Byron / Latitude 28°..37'..30" So Longitude 206°..30' West / it may be known by a remar[k]able sharp peaked Mountain Iying inland NWBW from it.   from this point the land trends N. 13° Wt inland it is pretty high and hilly but near the shore it is low - to the southward of the point the land is low and tolerable level 
            
      

        16 May 1770
        Wednesday 16th Winds southerly a fresh gale with which we steerd North along shore untill sun-set at which time we discoverd breakers ahead and on our larboard bow, being at this time in 20 fathom water and about 5 Miles from the land, hauld off east untill 8 oClock at which time we had run 8 Miles and had increased our depth of water to 44 fathoms   we than brought too with her head to the Eastward and lay on this tack untill 10 o'Clock when having increased our soundings to 78 fathoms we wore and lay with her head in shore untill 5 oClock AM when we made sail,   At day light we were surprised by finding ourselves farther to the southward than we were in the evening and yetas it had blowen strong Southerly all night. We now saw the breakers again within us which we past at the distance of 1 League, they lay in the Latde of 38°..8' &lay stretch offEast two Leagues from a point under which is a small low Island, there situation may always be found by the peaked mountain before mentioned which bears SWBW from them this mountain or hill and on this account I have named Mount Warning   it lies 7 or 8 Leagues inland in the latitude of 28°..22' So the land is high and hilly about it but it is conspicuous enough to be distinguished from everything else. The point off which these shoals lay I have named Point Danger   to the northward of it the land which is low trends NWBN but we soon found that it did not keep that direction long before it turnd again to the northward. At Noon we were about 2 Leagues from the land and by observation in the Latitude of 27° 46' Sowhich was 17 Miles to the Southward of the Log Longitude 206°..26' Wt Mount Warning bore So 20° West distant 14 Leagues, the northermost land in sight bore North - our Course and distance made good sence yester N. 1°..45' West 53 Miles 
            
      

        17 May 1770
        Thursday 17th Winds southerly mostly a fresh breeze with which in the PM we steer'd along shore N3/4E at the distance of about 2 Leagues off. Between 4 and 5 we discoverd breakers on our larboord bow   our depth of water at this time was 37 fathom - At sun set the northermost land in sight bore NBW, the breakers NWBW distant 4 Miles and the northermost land set at noon   which form'd a point which I nam'd Point lookout bore west distant 5 or 6 Miles / Latitude 278° 6' / Longitude 20°  '      to On the northward side of this point the shore forms a wide open Bay which I have named Morton bay in the bottom of which the land is so low that I could but just see it from the top mast head.   the breakers I have mentioned lies about 3 or 4 Miles from Point Lookout,  at this time we had a great sea from the south ward which broke prodigious high upon them. Stood on NNE untill 8 oClock when being past the breakers and having depen'd our water to 52 fathom we brought too untill 12 oClock than made sail again to the NNE at 4 in the AM we sounded and 135 fm At day light I found that we had in the night got much farther to the northward and from the shore than I expected from the Course we steerd for we were at least 6 or 7 Leagues offfrom the land and therefore haul'd in NWBW having the advantage of a Fresh Gale at SSW, the northermost land seen last night bore from us at this time SSW distant 6 Leagues This land I named C. Morton it being the N Point of the Bay of the Bay of the of the Bay of the the same name / Latde 26° 56' / Longd 206° 28' / From C. Morton the Land trends away west farther than we could see for there is a small space where we could see no land some on board was of opinion that there is a River there because the Sea lookd paler than usual, upon sounding we found but 34 fathom water a fine white sandy bottom which a lone is sufficeint [to] change the apparant colour of sea water without the assistance of Rivers   the land need only have to be a[s] low here as it is in a thousand other places upon the coast to have made it impossible for us to have seen it at the distance we were off.   be this as it may it was a point that could not be clear'd up as we had the wind, but should any one be desirous of do[ing] it that may come after me this place may always be found by three hills which lay to the northward of it in the Latitude of 26°..53' So   these hills lay but a little way inland and not far from each other, they are very remarkable on account of there singlar form of elivation which very much resemble glass houses which occasioned my giving them that name,   the northermost of the three is the highest and largest, there are likewise several other peaked hills inland to the northward of these but they are not near so remarkable  At Noon we were by Obsn in the Latitude of 26°..28' So which was 10 Miles to the northward of the log a circumstance that hath not hapend sence we have been upon the coast before   our course and distance run sence yesterday noon was NBW, 80 Miles which brought us into the Longde of 206°..46   At this time we were about 2 or 3 Leagues from the land and in 24 fathom water - A low bluff point which was the south point of an open sandy bay bore N 62° Wt distant 3 Leagues and the northermost point of land in sight bore N1/4E  Several smooks Seen today and some pretty far inland 
            
      

        18 May 1770
        Friday 18th In steering along shore at the distance of two leagues off our soundings was from 24 to 32 fathom a sandy bottom. At 6 oClock PM the northern point of land set bore N1/4 West distant 4 Leagues. At 10 oClock it bore NWBW1/2W and as we could had seen no land to the northward of it we brought too not knowing which way to steer, having at this time but little wind and continued so for the most part of the night - At 2 AM we made sail with the wind at SW and at day light saw the land extending as far as N3/4E - the point set last night bore SWBW distant 3 or 4 Leagues, I have named it Fiddle Head Double Island Pointon account from its figure / Latde 25°..58' So Longde 206°..48' West / the land about within this cape Head Point is of a moderate Point and pretty equal height but that but the Cape Head Point it self is of such an unequal height that it looks like two small Islands laying under the land it likewise may be known by known by the white clifts on the north side of it, here the land trends to the NW and forms alarge opin bay in the bottom of which the land appear'd to be very low in so much that we could but just see it from the deck - in crosing the mouth of this Bay our depth of water was from 30 to 22 fathom a white sandy bottom 
        At Noon we were about 3 Leagues from the land and in the Latitude of 25°..34' So Longde 206°..45 West. Double Isld Point bore So3/4W and the northermost land in sight N3/4E. The land here abouts which is of a moderate height appears more barren than any we have yet seen on this coast and the soil more sandy there being several large places where nothing else is to be seen   in other places the wood looks to be low and shrubby, nor did we see many signs of inhabitants
            
      

        19 May 1770
        Saturday 19th  In  the PM had variable light Airs and Calms, in  the night had a light breeze from the land which in the AM  veerd to SW and SSW,    in the evening found the variation to be 8°..36' East and in  the Morning 8°..20'. As we had but little wind we kept to  on th to the northward all night having from  23 to 27 fathom a fine sandy bottom at the distance of two or three leagues  from the land  At Noon we were about 4 Miles from it and by observation  in the Latitude of 25°..4' and in this situation had but 13 fathom water  - the northermost land in sight bore N 21° West distant 8 Miles, our Course  and distance saild sence yesterday noon was No  13°.15' East 31 Ms
            
      


        20 May 1770

        Sunday 20th Winds southerly  gentle breezes, At 1 oClock in the PM we pass'd  at the distance of 4  Miles having 17 fm water a  black bluf head or point of land on which a number of the natives were assembled,  which occasioned my nameing it Indian Head /  Latde 25° 0' / NBW. 4 Miles from this head  the is a nother much like it, from this last  the land trends a little more to the westward and low and sandy next the Sea,  for what may be behind it we know not    if land it must be all  very low for we could see no part of it from the mast head. We saw people in  other places besides the one I have mentioned, some smooks in the day and fires  in the night. Having but little wind all night we kept on to the northward -  haveing from 17 to 34 fathom water from 4 Miles to 4 Leagues from the land.   the northermost part of which bore from us at day light WSW  and seem'd to End in a point from which we discover'd a reef stretching out  to the northward  as far as we could see, being at this time in 18 fathom water    for  we had before it was light hauld our wind to the westward and this course we  continued untill we had plainly discoverd breakers a long way upon our lee bow  which saweemd to stretch quite home to the  land, we than edge'd away NW and NNW  along the East side of the shoal from 2 to 1 Mile off having regular even soundings  from 13 to 7 fathom a fine sandy bottom - At Noon we were by observation in  the Latitude of 24°..26' So which was 9  13 Miles to the northward of that given by the  Log. the extreme point of the reef Shoal  we judged to bear about NW from us and the  point of land above mentioned bore S3/4W  distant 20 Miles, this point I have named Sandy Cape on accou[n]t of two very  large white patches of Sand upon it, it is of a height sufficient to be seen  12 Leagues in clear weather / Latde 24°..46',  Longde 206 °.51' / from it the Land trended  away WSW  and SW as far as we could see 






            




      

        21 May 1770
        Monday 21st. In the PM we kept along the East side of the shoal untill 2 oClock when judging that there was water for us over I sent a boat a head to sound and upon her making the signal for more than 5 fathoms we hauld our wind and stood over the tail of it in 6 fathom.   at this time we were in the Latitude of 24°..22' and Sandy Cape bore S1/2E distant 8 Leagues. but the diretion of the Shoal is nearest NNW and SSE. At the time we had 6 fathom the boat which was not above a quarter of a mile to the southd of us had little more than 5 fathom - from 6 fathom we had the next cast 13 and then 20 emmediatly as fast as the men could heave the lead from this I did suppose that the west side of the shoal is pretty steep too whereas on the other side we had gradual sounding from 13 to 7 fathom. This Shoal I call'd Break Sea Spit, be cause now we had smooth water whereas upon the whole Coast to the Southrd of it we had allways a high sea or swell from yeSE.
        At 6 oClock the Land of Sandy Cape extending from South 17° East to South 27° East distance 8 Leagues, depth of water 23 fathom which depth we kept all night as we stood to the westward with light airs from the southward - but between 12 and 4 AM we had it calm after which a gentle breeze sprung up at South with which we still kept on upon a wind to the westward. At 7 oClock we saw from the Mast head the Land of Sandy Cape      bearing SE1/2E distant 12 or 13 Leagues - At 9 we discovered from ye Mast head land to the westward and soon after saw smooks upon it    our depth of water was now decreased to 17 fathom and by Noon to 13, at which time we were by observation in the Latitude of 24°..28' and about 7 Leagues from the land which extended from SBW to WNW distant off the nearest part      Leagues Longitude made from Sandy Cape 0°..45' West 
        For these few days past we have seen at times a sort of Sea fowl we have no where seen before that I remember, they are of that sort called Boobies 
        before to day we seldom saw more than 2 or 3 at a time and only when we was were near the land.   last night a small flock of these birds pass'd the Ship and went away to the NW and this morning from half an hour before sun rise to half an hour after flights of them were continualy coming from the NNW and flying to the SSE and not one was seen to fly in any other dire[c]tion   from this we did suppose that there was a Lagoon, River or Inlet of shallow water to the southward of us where these birds resorted to in the day to feed and that not very far to the northward lay some Island where they retired to in the night 
            
      

        22 May 1770
        Tuesday 22d In the PM had a gentle breeze at SE with which we stood in for the land SW untill 4 oClock when being in the Latde of 24°. 36' Soand about 2 Leagues from land in 9 fathom water we bore away along shore NWBW At the same time we could see the land extending to the South South East about 8 Leagues. Near the Sea the land is very low but in land are some moderatly high hills and the whole appear'd to be thickly cloathed with wood    In runing along shore we shoald in our water from 9 to 7 fathom and at one time had but 6 fathm which determined me to anchor for the night and accordingly at 8 oClock we came too in 8 fathom water a fine gravely bottom about 5 Miles from the land. this evening we saw a water snake and 2 or 3 evenings ago one lay under the Ships stern some time    this was about a yard and a half in length and was the first we had seen 
        At 6 oClock in the AM we wieg'd with a gentle breeze southerly and steerd NW1/4W edgeing in for the land untill w[e] got within 2 Miles of it having from 7 to 11 fathom water, we then steer'd NNW as the land laid, At Noon we were by observation in the Latitude of 24°.19' So Longitude made from Sandy Cape 1°..14' West 
            
      

        23 May 1770
        Wednesday 23rd Continued our Course a long shore at the distance of about 2 Miles off having from 12 to 9, 8 and 7 fathom water untill .5 oClock at which time we were abreast of the South point of a large open bay where in I intended to anchor.   accordingly we hauld in close upon a wind and sent a boat a head to sound.   after making some trips we anchor'd at 8 oClock in 5 fathom water a Sandy bottom   the South point of the Bay bore E3/4 South distance 2 Miles and the north point NW1/4 N and about 2 Miles from the shore in the bottom of the bay. Last night some time in the Middle Watch a very extraordinary affair happend to Mr Orton my Clerk, he having been drinking in the Evening, some Malicious person or persons in the Ship took the advantage of his being drunk and cut off all the cloaths from off his back, not being satisfied with this they some time after went into his Cabbin and cut off a part of both his Ears as he lay asleep in his bed, the person whome he suspected to have done this was Mr Magra one of the Midshipmen, but this did not appear to me upon inquirey, however as I know'd Magra had once or twice before this in their drunken frolicks cut off his Cloaths and had been heard to say / as I was told / that if it was not for the Law he would Murder him, these things consider'd induce'd me to think that Magra was not altogether innocent,   I therefore, for the present dismiss'd him the quarter deck and susspended him from doing any duty in the Ship, he being one of those gentlemen, frequently found on board Kings Ships, that can very well be spared, or to speake more planer good for nothing.   Besides it was necessary in me to show my immedate resentment againest the person on whome the suspicion fell least they should not have stop'd here. With respect to Mr Orton he is a man not without faults, yet from all the enquiry I could make, it evidently appear'd to me that so far from deserving such treatment he had not designedly injured any person in the Ship, so that I do and shall all ways look upon him as an enjure'd man. Some reasons might however be given why this misfortune came upon him in which he himself was in some measure to blame, but as this is only conjector and would tend to fix it up some people in the Ship whome I would fain believe would hardly be guilty of such an acton, I shall say nothing about it unless I shall hereafter discover the Offenders which I shall take every method in my power to do, for I look upon such proceedings as highly dangerous in such Voyages as this and the greatest insult that could be offer'd to my authority in this Ship, as I have always been ready to hear and redress every complaint that have been made against any Person in the Ship.
        In the AM I went a shore with a party of men in order to examine the Country accompaned by Mr Banks and the other gentlemen.   we landed alittle within the South point of the Bay where there is a channel leading into a large Lagoon,   the first thing that I did was to sound and examine this channel in which I found 3 fathom water untill I got about a Mile up it where I met with a Shoal whereon was little more than one fathom    being over this I had 3 fathom again.  the entrance into this channel lies close to the South point of the Bay being form'd on the East by the shore and on the West by a large spit of sand    it is about a quarter of a Mile broad and lies in SBW here is room for a few Ships to lay very secure and a small Stream of fresh water. After this I made a little excursion into the woods while some hands made 3 or 4 hauls with the Sain but caught not above a dozen very small fish, by this time the flood was made, and I embarqued in the boat in order to row up the Lagoon but in this I was hindred by meeting every where with shoal water,   as yet we had seen no people but saw a great deal of smook up and on the west side of the Lagoon which was all too far off for us to go by land excepting one   this we went to and found 10 small fires in a very small compass and some cockle shells laying by them but the people were gone    On the windward or South Side of one fire was stuck up a little bark about a foot and a half high and some few peices lay about in other places, these we concluded were all the covering they had in the night and many of them I firmly believe have not this but naked as they are Sleeplay in the open air,   Tupia who was with us observed that they were Taata Eno's that is bad or poor people. The Country is vissibly worse than at the last place we was were at, the Soil is dry and Sandy and the woods are free from under wood of every kind. here are of the same sort of trees as we found in Sting Ray Harbour Botany Bay with a few other sorts. one sort which is by far the most numerous of any in the woods grow something like birch   the bark at first sight looks like birch bark but upon examination I found it to be of a very different and so I believe is the wood but this I could not examine as having no ax or any thing with me to cut down a tree - about the skirts of the Lagoon grows the true Mangrove such as are found in the West Indias and which we have not seen during the Voyage before - here is likewise a sort of a Palm tree which grows on low barren and sandy places in the South Sea Islands and calld by the natives of these Islands  All or most of the same sorts of land and sea water fowl as we saw at Sting Botanist Botany Bay Ray harbour we saw here  besides these Black & White Ducks, andwe saw some Bustards such as we have in England one of which we kill'd that weigh'd 17 1/2 pounds and which occasioned my giving this place the name of Bustard Bay/Latd 24.4. Longd 208.22/likewise saw some black and white ducks, Here are plenty of small oysters sticking to the Rocks, stones and some to the Mangrove trees and some few other shell fish such as large Musels, Pearl oysters, Cockels &Ca I measured the perpendicular height of the last tide and found that it to be 8 foot above low-water mark and from the time of low-water to day I found that it must be high water at the full and change of the Moon at 8 oClock, and from observnI have made of the tides upon the Coast I find that the flood comes from the northward 
            
      

        24 May 1770
        Thursday 24th In the PM I was empd a Shore in the transactions before related. At 4 in the AM we weighd with a gentle breezes and South and made sail out of the Bay which I call'd                              the north point  of which I call'd             and the South point            the distance from the one to the other is NW1/2N and SE1/2S      Miles. In standing out of the Bay our soundings were from 5 to 15 fm when in this last depth we was were abreast of the north point and being day light we discoverd breakers stretching out from it about NNE 2 or 3 Miles    at the outermost part of them iswas a rock just above water.   in passing these rocks at the distance of half a Mile we had from 15 to 20 fathom, being past them we hauld away long shoreWNW for the far farthest land we had in sight. At Noon we were by observation in the Latitude of 23°..52' So the north pt of Bustard Bay bore So 62° East distant 10 Leagues Miles and the northermost land in sight N. 60° Wt Longde in 208°..37' Wt distant from the nearest shore 6 Miles in this situation had 14 fathom water 
            
      

        25 May 1770
        Friday 25th In the PM had it calm untill 5 oClock when a light breeze sprung up at SE and we steer'd NW as the land lay untill 10 oClock then brought too having had all along 14 and 15 fathom water. At 5 in the AM we made sail, at day light the northermost point of the Main bore N 70° West and soon after we saw more land making like Islands bearing NWBN. At 9 oClock we was were abreast of the point distant from it 1 Mile depth of water 14 fathom. I found this point to lay directly under the Tropick of Capricorn and for that reason call'd it by that Name    Longde 209°..0' West    it is of a moderate height and looks white and barren and may be known by some Islands which layes to the NW of it and some small rocks one League SE from it. On the west side of the Cape there appear'd to be a Lagoon, on the two spits which form'd the entrance were a great number of Pelicans at least so I call them. The most northermost land we could see bore from C. Capricorn N. 24° West and appear'd to be an Island, but the Main land trended WBN1/2N which Course we steer'd - having from 15 to 6 fathom and from 6 to 9 a hard sandy bottom   At noon our Latitude by observation was 23°..24' So C. Capricorn bore So 60°- East distant 2 Leagues a small Island NBE 2 Miles.   in this situation had 9 fm water at the distance of 4 Miles from the Main land which is here low and Sandy next the Sea except the points which are moderatly high and rocky    in land the Country is hilly and affords but a very indifferent prospect
            
      

        26 May 1770
        Saturday 26th In the PM had a light breeze at ESE untill 4 oClock with which we stood to the NW untill 4 o'Clock when it fell calm and soon after we Anchor'd in 12 fathom water    Cape Capricorn bearing So 54° East distant 4 Leagues having the Main land and Islands in a manner allround us - in the night we found the tide to rise and fall near 7 feet and the flood to set to the west ward and Ebb to the Eastward, which is the very reverse to what we found it when at Anchor to the Eastward of Bustard BayI expected At 6 in the AM we weigh'd with the wind at South a gentle breeze and stood away to the NW between the outermost raing of Islands and the Main land, leaving several small Island between us and the latter which we passd close by - our soundings was a little erregular from 12 to 4 fathom which caused me to send a boat a head to sound. At Noon we were about 3 Miles from the Main, about the same distance from the Islands without us, our Latitude by obsn was 23°.7' So and Longitude made from Cape Capricorn 18 Miles west - The Main land in this Latitude is tolerable high and Mountainious and the Islands which lay off it are the most of them pretty high and of a small circuit and have more the appearence of barrenness than fertillity -
        We saw smooks a good way inland which makes me think there must be a River Lagoon or Inlet into the Country and we pass'd two places that had the appearence of such this morning, but our depth of water at that time was too little to haul in for them where I might expect to meet with less -
            
      

        27 May 1770
        Sunday 27th We had not stood on to the northward quite an hour before we fell into 3 fathom water upon which I anchor'd and sent away the Master with two boats to sound the Channell which lay to leeward of us between the Northermost Island and the Mainland which appeard to me to be pretty broad but I susspected that it was shoald and so it was found for the Master reported to me the upon his return that he found in many places only 21/2 fathoms and where we lay at Anchor we had only 16 feet which was not 2 feet more then the Ship draw'd. In the evening the wind veer'd to ENE which gave us an oppertunity to stretch 3 or 4 miles back the way we came before the wind shifted to South and oblige'd us again to anchor in 6 fathom 
        At 5 oClock in the AM I sent away the Master with two boats to search for a passage out between the Islands while we got the Ship under sail. As soon as it was light the Signal was made by the boats of thier having found a passage upon which we followd with the Ship, After we had got out and into deep water we hoisted in the boats and made Sail to the Northward as the land lay, soundings from 9 to 15 fathom, having still some small Islands without us
        At Noon we were about 2 Leagues from the Mainland and by observation in the Latitude of 22°..53' So Longitude made from Cape Capricorn     20 Miles west, At this time the northermost point of land we had in sight bore NNW distant 10 Miles    this point I named C. Manyfold from the number of high hills over it Latitude 22°..43' So it lies N 26° West distant 171/3 Leagues from C. Capricorn   between them the shore forms a large bay which I call'd Keppel Bay and the Islands which lay in and off it are in known by the same name. In this Bay isit Lay are a great number of Islands and good anchorage every where where there is a sufficient depth of water What refreshments it may afford for shipping I know not we caught no fish here not withstanding we was were the le at anchor - It can hardly be doubted but what it affords fresh water in more several place as both main land and Islands are inhabited, we saw smooks by day and fires in the night upon the Main and people upon one of the Islands 
            
      

        28 May 1770
        Monday 28th Winds at SSE afresh breezes   At 3 oClock in the PM we pass'd Cape Manifold from which the Land trends NNW, the land of this Cape is tolerable high and riseth in hills directly from the Sea. it may be known by three Islands laying off it, one near the shore and the other two 8 Miles out at sea the one of these is low and flat and the other high and round - At 6 oClock we shortend sail and brought too, the northermost part of the Main we had in sight bore NW and some Islands laying off it bore N. 31° west - our soundings sence noon were from 20 to 25 fathoms and in the night 30 and 34 fathom - At day light in the Morning we made sail Cape Manifold bearing SBE distant 8 Leagues and the Islands set last night in the same direction distant from us 4 Miles, and the farthest point of the Main bore N 67° Wt distant 22 Miles    but we could see several Islands to the northward of this direction. At 9 oClock we were abreast of the above point which I named Cape Townshend / Latitude 22°..13', Longde 209°..48' West / the land of this Cape is of a moderate and pretty even height and is more barren than woody. Several Islands lay to the northward of it 4 or 5 Leagues out at Sea - 3 or 4 Leagues to the SE the shore forms a bay in the bottom of which there appear'd to be an inlet or harbour. To the westward of the Cape the land trends SW1/2S and there forms a very large bay which turns away to the Eastward and probably comun[i]cates with the inlet to the SE of the Cape above mentioned and by that means makes the land of the Cape an Island. As soon as we got round this Cape we hauld our wind to the westward in order to get within the Islands which lay scaterd upon and down in this bay in great number and extend out to sea as far as we could see from the Mast-head how much farther will hardly be in my power to determine    they are as various both in their height and circuit as they are numerous . We had not stood long upon awind before we met with shoal water and was obliged to tack at once to avoide it, after which I sent aboat ahead and we bore away WBN leaving many small Islands, Rocks & Shoals between us and the Main and a number of larger Islands without us   aSoundings from 14 to 17 fathom sandy bottom   A little before noon the boat made the Signal for meeting with Shoal water   upon this we hauld close upon a wind to the Eastward but suddenly fell into 31/4 fathom water - upon which we immidiatly let go an Anchor and brought the Ship up with all sails standing and had then 4 fathom course sandy bottom    we found here a Strong tide seting to the NWBW1/2W at the rate of between 2 and 3 Miles an hour which was what carried us so quickly upon the Shoal - Our Latitude by observation was 22°..8' So Cape Townshend bore East 16° South distant 13 Miles and the westermost part of the Main land in sight W3/4N 
        having a number of Islands in sight all round us 
            
      

        29 May 1770
        Tuesday 29th Fresh gales between the SSE and ESE, Hazey wer. with some showers of rain in the PM. Having sounded about the Ship and found that there was sufficient water for her over the Shoal we at 3 oClock weigh'd and came to sail and stood to the westward as the land lay having first sent a boat a head to sound - At 6 o'Clock we Anchord in 10 fathom a sandy bottom about 2 Miles from the Main land, the westermost part of which bore WNW having still a number of Islands in sight a long way without us 
        At 5 oClock in the AM I sent away the Master with two boats to sound the entrance of an inlet which bore from us west distant about one League into which I intended to go with the Ship to wait a few days untill the Moon increased and in the meantime to examine the Country    by such time as we had got the Ship under Sail the boats made the signal for Anchorge upon which we stood in with the Ship and Anchord in 5 fathom water about a League within the entrance of the inlet which we judged to be a River runing a good way in land. As I observed the tides to flow and Ebb something considerable I had some thoughts of laying the Ship a shore to clean her bottom.   with this View both the Master and I went to look for a convinient place for that purpose and at the same time to look for fresh water not one drop of which we could find but met with several places where a Ship might be laid a shore with safety 
            
      

        30 May 1770
        Wednesday 30th In the PM I went again in search of fresh water but had no better success than before wherefore I gave over all thoughts of laying the Ship a shore being resolved on spending as little time as possible in a place that was likely to afford us no sort of refreshment   but as I had observed from the hills the Inlet to run a good way in land I thought this a good time to penetrate into the Country to see a little of the inland parts   Accordingly I prepar'd for makeing that excursion in the morning, but the first thing I did in the was to get upon a pritty high hill which is at the NW entrance of the inlet before sunrise in order to take a view of the Sea coast and Islands &Ca that lay off it and to take their bearings, having the Azimuth compass with me for that that purpose the needle of which differd from its true posission some thing very considerable even above 30° in some places more and in others less   for I try'd it in several. I found it differ in from it self above 2 points in the space of 14 feet, the loose stones which lay upon the ground had no effect upon the needle   I therefore concluded that it must be owing to Iron ore in the hill visible signs of which appear'd not only here but in several other places - As soon as I had done here I proceeded up the Inlet  I set out with the first of the flood and long before high-water got about 8 Leagues up it, its breadth thus far was from 2 to 4 or 5 Miles upon a SWBS diretion, but here it spread every way and formd a large lake which communcates with the Sea to the NW.   I not only saw the Sea in this direction but found the tide of flood coming Strong in from the NW. I likewise observed an arm of this lake extending to the eastward and it is not att all improbable but what it communicates with the sea in the bottom of the bay which lies to the westward of C. Townshend   on the south side of the lake is a ridge of pretty high hills which I was desireous of going upon, but as the day was far spent and high-water I was afraid of being bewilderd among the Shoals in the night, which promised to be none of the best being already rainy dirty weather, and therefore I made the best of my way to the Ship.   in this little excursion I saw only two people and those at a distance and are all that we have seen in this place but we have met with several fire places and seen smooks at a distance - This inlet which I have named Thirsty Sound by reason we could find no fresh water lies in the Latitude of 22°..05' So and Longitude of 210°..24' West. It may be known by a Group of small Islands laying under the shore from 2 to 5 Leagues NW from it.   there is likewise a nother Group of Islands laying right before it between 3 and 4 Leagues out at Sea - over each of the points that form the entrance is a pretty high round hill that on the NW is a peninsula surrounded by the Sea at high-water, the distance from the one to the other is about two Miles bold to both shores. Here is good anchorage in 7, 6, 5, & 4 fathom water and very convenient places for laying a Ship aShore where at Spring tides the tides doth not flow rise less then 16 or 18 feet and flowes at full and change of the Moon about 11 oClock. We met with no fresh water or any other kind of refreshments whatever, we saw two turtle but caught none nor not [sic] sort of fish or wild fowl except a few small land birds    here are the same sort of water fowl as we saw in BotSting RayanyHarbour Bay and like them so Shy that it is hardly possible to get within shott of them - No signs of fertillity is to be seen upon the land the Soil of the uplands is mostly a hard redish Clay and produceth several sorts of trees such as we have seen before and some others and clear of all under wood     all the low lands are mostly over run with Man groves and at spring tides I beleive over flowed by the Sea, and I beleive in the rainy seasons here are large land floods   as we saw in many places gullies which seem'd to have been made by torrents of water coming from the adjacent hills     besides other vissible signs of the water having been a considerable height above the common spring tides - Dr Solander and I was upon a rising ground up the Inlet which we thought had at one time or a nother been over flowed by the Sea  and if so great part of the Country must at that time been laid under water - Up in the lakes or Lagoons I suppose are shell fish on which the few natives subsist   We found oysters sticking to most of the rocks upon the Shore which were so small as not to be worth the picking off 
            
      

        31 May 1770
        Thursday, 31st. Winds southerly and SE dark hazey weather with rain in the PM. finding no one inducement to stay longer in this place we at 6 in the AM weighd and put to Sea and stood to the NW having the advantage of a fresh breeze at SSE. We kept without the Group of Islands which lay in shore & to the NW of Thirsty Sound, as there appear'd to be no safe passage between them and the Main; at the same time we had a number of Islands without us extending out to sea as far as we could see. As we run in this diretion our depth of water was 10, 8 and 9 fathom. At Noon the NW point of Thirsty Sound which I have named Pier head bore S 36° E distant 5 Leagues, the East point of the other inlet, which communicates with the former as I have before mention, bore South by west distant 21/2 Leagues, the groupe of Islands above mentioned laying between us and the point; the farthest part of the Main in sight on the other side of the Inlet bore NW. Our Latitude by Observation was 21° 53'.
            
      

        1 June 1770
        Friday June 1st At 1/2 an hour after noon upon the boat, which we had ahead sounding; makeing the Signal for Shoal water we hauld our wind to the NE having at that time 7 fathom, the next cast 5 and than 3 upon which we let go an Anchor and brought the Ship up. the NW point of Thirsty Sound or Pier head   bore SE distant 6 Leagues being mid way between the the Islands which lies off the East point of the western Inlet and three Small Islands laying directly without them - it being now the first of the flood which we found to SetSEBE1/2E   NWBW1/2W After having sounded about the Shoal on which we found not quite 3 fathom but without it deep water we got under sail and hauld round the three Islands just mentioned and came too an Anchor under the lee of them in 15 fathom water having at this time dark hazy rainy weather which continued untill 7 o'Clock AM   At which time we got again under sail and Stood to the NW with a fresh breeze at SSE and fair weather having the Main land in sight and a number of Islands all round us some of which lay out at Sea as far as we could see - the Western Inlet before mentioned we had now all open known in the Chart by the name of Broad Sound _______ _____ we had now all open,    it is at least 9 or 10 Leagues wide at the Entrance with several Islands laying in and before it and I beleive shoals also for we had very erregular soundings from 10 to 5 and 4 fathom  At Noon we were by observation in the Latitude of 21°..29' So and Longitude made from C. Townshend 59' West. A Point of Land which forms the NW entrance into Broad Sound bore from us at this time North west by North dist 3 Leagues. This Point I have nam'd Cape Palmerston / Latitude 21°..27' Longde 210°..57' / Between this Cape and C. Townshend lies the Bay of Inlets,  so named from the Number of Inlets Creeks &Ca in it 
            
      

        2 June 1770
        Saturday 2nd Winds at SSE and SE a gentle breeze, with which we stood to the NW and NWBN as the land lay under an easy sail having a boat ahead sounding; our soundings at first wasere very erregular from 9 to 4 fathoms, but afterwards regular from 9 to 11 fathom  At 8 oClock being about two Leagues from the Main Land we anchor'd in 11 fathom sandy bottom - soon after this we found a Slow motion of a tide seting to the westward - At 1 oClock it was Slack or low water and at 1/2 past 2 oClock the Ship tended to the Eastward and and rode so untill 6 at which time we anchor'd the tide had risen 11 feet, We now got under Sail and Stood away NNW as the land lay. From the observations made on the tides last night it is plain that the flood comes from the NW- whereas yesterday and for several days before we found it to come always from the SE.   this is neither the first nor second time that we have observed the same thing and in my opinion easy accounted for but this I shall do in another place - At Sun rise we found the Variation to be 6°..45' East. In steaering along shore between the Island and the Main at the distance of 2 Leagues from the latter and 3 or 4 from the former - our sounding were regular from 12 to 9 fathom but about a 11 oClock we wasere again embarrased with Shoal water but got clear without leting go an Anchor, we had at one time not quite 3 fathom. At Noon we were about 2 Leagues from the Main land and about 4 from the Islands without us - our Latitude by observation was 20°..56' Longitude made from Cape Palmerston 16° West    A pretty high Promontary which I named Cape Hillsborough bore W1/2N distant 7 Miles - the Mainland is here pretty much deversified with Mountains, Hills plains and Vallies and seems to be tolerably cloathed with wood and Verdure   the Islands which lay parallel with the Coast and from 5 to 8 or 9 Leagues off are of Various extent both for height and circuit, hardly any exceeds 5 Leagues in circuit and many again are very small besides this chain of Islands which lay at a distance from the coast there are other small ones laying scatterd under the land. Some few smooks were seen on the Mainland 

        Sunday 3rd Winds between the SBE and SE A gentle breeze and clear weather - In the PM we steer'd along shore NW1/2W at the distance of two Leagues from the Main having 9 and 10 fathom water regular soundings - At sun set the farthest point of the Main land that we could distinguish as such bore N 48° West, to the northward of this lay some high land which I took to be an Island the NW point of which bore N 41° West, but as I was not sure that there was a passage this way we at 8 oClock came too an Anchor in 10 fathom a muddy bottom - Two hours after this we had a tide seting to the nortward and at 2 oClock it had fell fallen 7 9 feet and a half sence the time we anchor'd     After this the tide begun to rise and the flood came from the northward which was from the Islands out at Sea and planly indicated that there was no passage to the NW. But as this did not appear at day light when we got under sail we stood away to the NW untill 8 oClock, at this time we discoverd low land quite aCross what we took for an opening upon which we hauld to the Eastward between the Main and the Islands which proved to be a Bay about 5 or 6 Leagues deep - upon this we hauld our wind to the Eastward round the north point of the Bay which bore from us at this time NEBN distant 4 Leagues - From this point we found the Main land trend away NBW1/2W and a strait or passage between it and a large Island or Islands laying in a parrallel direction without; which passage we stood into having the tide of Ebb in our favour - At Noon we were just within the entrance and by observation in the Latde of 20°..26' So Cape Hillsborough  bore SBE distant 10 Leagues and the North point of the bay before mentiond bore So 19° West distant 4 Miles. This point I have named Cape Conway / Latde 20°..30' Longde 211°..28'/  and the Bay Repulse Bay which it is form'd by these Two Capes on the north and  on the South the greatest and least depth of water we found in it was 13 and 8 fathom every where safe anchorage and I believe that was it properly examined there would be found some good harbours in it especialy on the north side within Cape Conway, for just within this Cape lay two or three small Islands which alone would shelter that side of the Bay from the SE and Southerly winds which seem to be the prevailing or trade winds. Among the many Islands that lay upon this coast there is one more remarkable than the rest being of a small very high and peaked and lies EBS. 10 Miles from Cape Conway at the South end of the Passage above mentioned 
            
      

        4 June 1770
        Monday 4th Winds at SSE and SE a gentle breeze and clear weather. In the PM steer'd thro' the passage which we found from 3 to 6 or 7 Miles broad and 8 or 9 Leagues in length NBW1/2W and SBE1/2E. It is form'd by the Main on the west and by Islands on the East one of which is at least 5 Leagues in length    our depth of water in runing through was between 25 and 20 fathom every where good anchorage.    indeed the whole passage is one continued safe harbour, besides a number of small Bays and Coves on each side where to all appearances Ships might lay as it were in a Bason, at least so they appeard to me for I did not wait to examine them as having been in Port so lately and being unwilling to loose the benefit of a light Moon   The land both on the Main and Islands especialy on the former is tolerable high and distinguished by hills and Vallies which are deversified with woods and Lawns that look'd green and pleasent - On a Sandy beach upon one of the Islands we saw two people and a Canoe with an outrigger that appeard to be both larger and differently built to any we have seen upon the Coast - At 6 oClock we were nearly the length of the north end of the passage the NWermost point of the Main in sight bore N. 54° West and the north end of the Islands NNE having an open sea between these two points wWe kept under an easey Sail and the lead going all night having 21, 22 and 23 fm at the distance of 3 Leagues from the land - At day light in the Morning we were abreast of the point above mentioned which is a Lofty promontary that I named Cape Gloucester / Latitude 19°..57' So Longde 211°..54' Wt / it may be known by an Island which lies out at Sea NBW1/2W 5 or 6 Leagues from it this I calld Holburn Isle - There are also Islands Laying under the Land between it and Whitsundays Passage,   on the west side of the Cape the land trends away SW and SSW and forms a deep bay, the land in the bottom of this bay we I could but just see from the Mast head it is very low and is a Continuation of the same low land as is at the bottom of Repulse Bay  wWithout waiting to look into this Bay which I call'd Edgcumbe Bay we continued our Course to the westward for the wester most land we had in sight which bore from us WBN1/2N and appeard very high - At Noon we were about 3 Leagues from the land and by observation in the Latitude of 19°..47' So Cape Gloucester  bearing S 63° East distant 71/2 Leagues 
        [] This passage I have named Whitsunday's Passage, as it was discoverd on the day the Church commemorates that Festival and the Isles which form it Cumberland Isles  in honour of His Royl Highness the Duke of Cumberland 
            
      

        5 June 1770
        Tuesday 5th Winds between the South and East a very gentle breeze and serene weather   At 6 oClock AM we were abreast of the western point of land above mentioned / distant from it 3 Miles / which I have named Cape Upstart because being surrounded with low land it starts or riseth up singley at the first making of it / Latitude 19°..39' Longde 212°..32' Wt / it lies west-north-west 14 Leagues from Cape Gloucester - - - and is of a height sufficent to be seen 112 Leagues, but it is not so much of a Promontory as it appears to be because on each side of it near the Sea is very low land which is not to be seen unless you are pretty well in with the shore,     inland are some tolerable high hills or Mountains which like the Cape afford but a very different barren prospect - Having past this Cape we continued standing to the westward and north-west as the land lay under an easy sail untill having from 16 to 10 fath water untill 2 oClock in the A.M. when we fell into 7 fathom   upon which we hauled our wind to the northward judging our selves to be very near the land as so we found for at day light we were little more than 2 Leagues off  what decived us was the lowness of the land which is but very little higher than the surface of the Sea but in theislow Country were some hills - At Noon we were in 15 fathom water and about 4 Leagues from the land- our Latitude by observation was 19°..12' So Cape Cape Upstart bore So 38° 30' East distant 12 Leagues, Course and distance saild sence yesterday noon N. 48°..45' - 53 Miles - At and before noon some very large smooks were seen rise up out of the Lowland - At sun rise in I found the Variation to be 5°..35' Easterly - at sun set last night the same needle gave near 9°, this being close under Cape Upstart I judged that it was owing to Iron ore or other Magnetical matter lodged in the earth 
            
      

        6 June 1770
        Wednesday 6th Light airs at ESE with which we steer'd WNW as the Land now lay depth of water 12 & 14 fathoms At Noon we were by Observation in the Latitude of 19°..1' Longitude made from Cape Gloucester 1°..30' west Course and distant saild sence yesterday noon WNW 28 Miles.   in this situation we had the mouth of a bay all open extending from the S1/2E to SW1/2S distant 2 Leagues This bay which I named Cleveland Bay appear'd to be about 5 or 6 Miles in extent every way. the East point I named Cape Cleveland and the West Barren Head. Magnetical head or Isle as it had had much the appearence of an Island and the Compass did not travis well when near it. they are both tolerable high and so is the Mainland within them and the whole appear'd to have the most ruged, rocky and barren Surface of any we have yet seen    however it is not without inhabitants as we saw smooks in several place in the bottom of the Bay  The most northermost land we had in sight at this time bore NW, this we took to be an Island or Islands for we could not trace the Main land farther than WBN  Notwithstanding we have been long in soundings, have had it frequently calm and been often at an Anchor   We have caught no fish worth mentioning sence we left Sting-Ray Harbour 
            
      

        7 June 1770
        Thursday 7th Light Airs between the South and East with which we steerd WNW. keeping the Main land on board the outermost part of which at sun set bore from us WBN, but without this lay high land which we took to be Islands   At day light in the Morning we were the length of the Southern Eastern part of this land which we found to consist of a group of small Islands laying about 5 Leagues from the Main we being at this time between the two, we continued advanceing slowly to the NW untill Noon at which time we were by observation in the Latitude of 18°..49' and about 5 Leagues from the Main land  the North west part of which bore from us NBW1/2W the Island extending from North to East distant off the nearest 2 Miles and Cape Cleveland bore So 50° East distant 18 Leagues - our soundings in the Course of this days sail was were from 14 to 11 fathom.
            
      

        8 June 1770
        Friday 8th Winds at SSE and South first part light airs the remainder a gentle breeze     In the PM we saw several large smooks upon the main, some people Canoes, and as we thought Cocoa-nutt Trees upon one of the Islands, and as a few of these nutts would have been very acceptable to us at this Time I sent Lieutt Hicks a Shore with whome went Mr Banks and Dr Solander to see what was to be got, in the mean time we kep standing in for the Island with the Ship - At 7 oClock they returnd on board having met with nothing worth observing  the trees we saw were a small kind of Cabbage Palms, they heard some of the Natives as they were puting off from the shore but saw none.  After the boats were hoisted in we made sail stood away NBW for the northermost land we had in sight which we were abreast off at 3 oClock in the Morning having passed all the Islands 3 or 4 hours before; this point I have named Point Hillick on accout of its Figure 
        The Land of this Point is tolerable high and may be known  by a round hillick or rock that appears to be detatched  from the Point but I beleive it joins to it. Between  this Cape and Cape Iron Head the Shore forms a large  Bay which I named Rockingham Bay    before it lay  the group of Islands before mentioned and some  others nearer the shore. These Islands cover shelter the bay in  a manner from all winds, in which is good anchorage  the land near the shore in the bottom of this bay is  very low and woody, but a little way in land back in the Country is a continued  ridge of high land which appear'd to be barren and  rocky. Having passed Point Hillick we continued  standing to the NNW as the land trended having the  advantage of a light moon - At 6 oClock in the AM we  were a breast of a point of Land which lies NBW1/2W11 Miles from Point Hillick   the Land between them is  very high and of a craggy barren surface   this point  I named Cape Sandwich Honour ye Earl of that name It it may not only be known  by the high craggy land over it but by a small Island  which lies East one mile from it and some others about  two leagues to the northward of it - From Cape Sandwich  the land trends west and afterwards north and forms  a fine large Bay which I call'd Halifax Bay it  is well shelterd and affords  good anchorage, at least so it appeard to me, for having  hitherto met with so little incouragement by goin a Shore  that I would not wait to land or examine it faurther  but continued rainging along shore to the northward for a parcel of small Islands laying off the northern point of the Bay and finding a channel of a Mile broad between the three outermost and those nearer the shore we pushed through - while we did this we saw on one of the nearest Islands a number of the natives collicted together who seem'd to look very attentively upon the ship. they were quite naked and of a very dark Colour with short curled or frizled hair  At noon we were by observation in the Latde of 17°..59' and a breast of the north point of point of Halifax Bay which bore from us west 2 Miles,  this boundry of the bay is form'd by a tolerable high Island known in the Chart by the name of Dunk Isle    it lays so near the shore as not to be distinguished from it unless you are well in with the land - at this time we were in the Longitude of 213°..57' Wt Cape Sandwich bore SBE1/2E distant 19 Miles and the northermost land in sight N 1/2W  our depth of water in the Course of this days sail was not more then 16 nor less then 7 fathom
            
      

        9 June 1770
        Saturday 9th Winds between the South and SE a gentle breeze and clear weather, with which we steer'd NBW as the land lay the northern extreme of which at sun set bore N. 25° West. We kept on our Course under an easy sail all night having from 12 to 15 fathom water at the distant of about 3 or 4 Leagues from the land. At 6 oClock in the AM we were abreast of some small Islands which we called Frankland Isles that lay about 2 Leagues from the main land the northern point of which in sight bore NBW1/2W but this we afterwards found to be an Island tolerable high and about 4 Miles in circuit,   it lies about 2 Miles from the point on the Main, between which we went with the Ship and wasere in the Middle of the Channel at Noon and by observation in the Latitude of 16°..55', where we had 20 fathoms water Course and distance Saild since Yesterday at Noon is N       West dist Miles. The point of land we were now abreast off I call'd Cape Grafton / Latde 16°..55' So Longde 214° 11' west / it is tolerable high land and so is the whole coast for 20 Leagues to the southward and hath a very rocky surface which is thinly cover'd with wood - In the night we saw several fires along shore and a little before noon some people
            
      

        10 June 1770
        Sunday 10th After hauling round Cape Grafton we found the land trend away NWBW. Three Miles to the Westward of the Cape is a Bay wherein we anchord about 2 Miles from the shore in 4 fathom water an owsey bottom.   the East point of the bay bore So 74° East and the west point So 83° West and a low green woody Island laying in the offing bore N 35° East-   this Island lies NBE1/2E distant 3 or 4 Legs from Cape Grafton  and is known in the Chart by the name of Green Island   As soon as the Ship was brought to an Anchor I went ashore accompaned by Mr Banks and Dr Solander, the first thing I did was to look for fresh water and with that View rowed out to wards the Cape because in the bottom of the Bay was low mangrove land and little probability of meeting with any there: but the way I went I found two small streames which wasere difficult to get at on account of the surff and and rocks upon the shore. As we came round the Cape we saw in a Sandy Cove a small stream of water run over the beach; but here I did not go in the boat because I found that it would not be easy to land. We hardly had time to advance any thing into the Country, it being here hilly and the which were steep and rocky and we had not time to viset the low lands and therefore met with nothing remarkable: My intention was to have stay'd here at least one day to have looked into the Country had we met with fresh water convenient or any other refreshment but as we did not I thought it would be only spending time and looseing so much of a light moon to little purpose and therefore at 12 oClock at night we weigh'd and stood away to the NW having at this time but little wind attended with showers of rain - At 4 oClock the breeze freshend at SBE with fair weather - We continued steering TO NNW1/2W as the land lay haveing 10, 12 and 14 fathom at the distance of 3 Leagues from the land - At 10 oClock we hauld off north in order to get without a small low Island which lay about 2 Leagues from the Main, it being about high water at the time we passd it great part of it lay under water 
        About 3 Leagues to the north westward of this Island it close under the Main land is a nother Island tolerable high which bore from us at Noon N. 55° west distant 7 or 8 Miles, we being at this time in the latitude of 16°..20' So Cape Grafton bore S 29° East distant 40 Miles and the northermost point of land in sight N 20° Wt and in this situation had 15 fathom water- The shore between Cape Grafton and the above northern point forms a large bay but not very deep Bay which I named Trinity Bay after the day on which it was discoverd - the north point Cape Tribulation, because here begun all our troubles. Latitude 16°..6' So Longde 214°..39' Wt. 
            
      

        11 June 1770
        Monday 11th Wind at ESE with which we steer'd along shore NBW at the distance of 3 or 4 Leagues off having from 14 to 10 & 12 fm water - and saw two small Islands in the offing which lay in the latitude of 16° 0' So and about 6 or 7 Leagues from the Main - At 6 oClock the northermost land in sight bore NB1/2W and two low woody Islands which we some took to be rocks above water bore N1/2W - At this time we shortend sail and hauld off shore ENE and NEBE close upon a wind. my intention was to stretch off all night as well to avoid the dangers we saw ahead as to see if any Islands lay in the offing, especialy as we now begun to draw near the Latitude of those discover'd by Quiros which some geographers, for what reason I know not have thought proper to tack to this land, having the advantage of a fine breeze of wind and a clear moon light night in standing off from 6 untill near 9 oClock we deepen'd our water from 14 to 21 fathom when all at once we fell into 12, 10 and 8 fathom   At this time I had every body at their stations to put about and come too an anchor but in this I was not so fortunate for meeting again with deep water I thought it [check MS] there could be no danger in stand.g on - before 10 oClock we had 20 and 21 fathom and continued in that depth untill a few Minutes before a 11 when we had 17 and before the Man at the lead could heave another cast the Ship Struck and stuck fast - Emmediatly upon this we took in all our sails hoisted out the boats and sounded round the Ship and found that we had got upon the SE edge of a reef of Coral rocks having in some places round the Ship 3 and 4 fathom water and in other places not quite as many feet - and about a Ships length from us on our Starboard side / the Ship laying with her head to the NE / were 8, 120 and 12 fathom, the next thing we did was to   as soon as the long boat was out we struck yards and Topm:ts and carried out the stream Anchor upon the starboard bow.  got the Casting anchor and cable into the boat and were going to carry it out the same way, but upon my sounding the second time round the Ship I found the most water a stern and therefore had this anchor carried out upon the Starboard quarter and hove upon it a very great strean which was to no purpose the Ship being quite fast upon which we went to work to lighten her as fast as possible which seem'd to be the only means we had left to get her off as we went a Shore about the top of High-water - we not only started water but threw'd over board our guns Iron and stone ballast, Casks, Hoops staves oyle Jars, decay'd stores &Ca many of these last articles lay in the way at coming at heavyer - all this time the Ship made little or no water. At a 11 oClock in the AM being high-water as we thought we try'd to heave her off without success she not being a float by a foot or more notwithstanding by this time we had thrown over board 40 or 50 Tun weight, as this was not found sufficient we continued to Lighten her by every method we could think off   As the water began to Tide faell the ship began to make water as much as two Pumps could free     At Noon she lay with 3 or 4 Strakes heel to Starboard - Latitude Observed 15°..45' South 
            
      

        12 June 1770
        Tuesday 12th Fortunatly we had little wind fine weather and a smooth Sea all these 24 hours, which in the PM gave us an oppertunity to carry out the two bower Anchors  the one on the Starboard quarter and the other right a stern- got blocks and tackles upon the Cables and brought the falls in a baft and hove taught-  by this time it was 5 oClock in the PM, the tide we observed now begun to rise, and the leak increased upon us which obliged us to set the 3rd Pump to work as we should have done the 4th also but could not make it work 
        At 9 oClock the Ship righted and the leak gaind upon the Pumps considerably  however I resolv'd to resk all and heave her off in case it was  practical and accordingly turnd as many hands to the Capstan & windlass as could be spared from the Pumps and about 20' past 10 oClock the Ship floated and we hove her into deep water having at this time 3 feet 9 Inches water in the hold - This done I sent the Long boat to weigh take up the stream anchor - got the Anchor but lost the Cable among the rocks, after this turn'd all hands to the Pumps the leak increasing upon us. but before 8 oClock in the  AM Morning theythe pumps gain'd considerably upon the leak. In the Morning We now hove up the best bower but found it impossible to save the small bower so cut it away at a whole Cable - got up the fore topmast and fore yard warped the Ship to the SE and at a 11 got under Sail and Stood in for the land with a light breeze at ESE some hands employ'd sewing ockam wool &Ca into a lower Studding sail to fother the Ship. others emplo'd at the Pumps which still gain'd upon the leak 
        This was an alarming and I may dsay terrible, circumstance and threatend immidiate destruction to us as soon as the Ship was afloat
         A Mistake soon after happened which for the first time caused fear to operate upon every man in the Ship, the man which attend the well took ye depth of water above the ceiling, he being relieved by another who did not know in what manner the former had sounded, took the depth of water from the out side plank the difference being 16 or 18 Inches and made it appear that the leak had gain'd this upon the pumps in a short time; this mistake was no sooner clear'd up than acted upon every man like a charm, they redoubled their Vigour in so much that
         
            
      

        13 June 1770
        Wednesday 13th In the PM had light airs at ESE with which we kept edgeing in for the land, having got the got up the Main topmast and Main yard and having got the sail ready for fothering the Ship we put it over under the Starboard fore chains where we suspected the Ship had sufferd most and soon after the leak decreased so as to be kept clear with one Pump with ease, this fortunate circumstance gave new life to every one on board 
        It is much easier to conceive than to discribe the satisfaction felt by every one on board body on this occasion, but a few minutes before our utmost wishes were to get hold of some place upon the Main or an Island to run the Ship ashore where out of her Materials we might build a vessel to carry us to the East Indias.  no sooner were we made sensible that the outward application to the Ships bottom had taken effect thatn the feild of every mans hopes inlarged so that we now thought of nothing but rainging along shore in search of a harbour where we could repair the Ship damages we had susstaind 
        In justice to the Ships Company I must say that no men ever behaved better than they have done on this occasion animated by the beheavour of every gentleman on board every man seem'd to have a just sence of the danger we were in and exerted himself self to the very utmost 
        The Ledge of rocks or Shoal we have been upon lies in the Latde of 15°.45' and about 6 or 7 Leagues from the Main land, but this is not the only shoal that lay upon this part of the Coast especialy to the northward and one which we now saw to the Southward the tail of which we passed over when we had the uneven soundings two hours before we Struck   apart of this shoal is always above water and looks to be white sand - part of the one were upon was drys at low-water and in that place consists of Sand and stones but every where else coral rocks 
        At 6 oClock we Anchor'd in 17 fathom water about 5 or 6 Leagues from the land and one from the Shoal, At this time the Ship made about 15 Inches water pr hour  At 6 oClock in the AM we weigh'd and stood to the NW edging in for the land having a gentle breeze at SSE - At 9 oClock we past close without two small low Islands laying in the latitude of 15°.41' and about 4 Leagues from the Main   I have named them Hope Islands because we were always in hopes of being able to reach these Islands 
        At Noon we were about 3 Leagues from the land and in the latitude of 15°.37' South the northermost part of the Main in sight bore N. 30° west and the above Islands extending from So 30° E to South 40° Et in this situation had 12 fathoms water and severl Sand Banks without us - The leak now decreaseth upon but for fear it should break out again we gave got the Sail ready fill'd for fothering    the manner this is done is thus, we take Mix ockam & wool together, / but okam alone would do / and chop it up small and then stick it loosly by hand fulls to the sail all over the sail and throw over it sheeps dung or other filth. Horse dung for this purpose is the best; the sail thus prepared is put hauld under the Ships bottom by ropes and if the place of the leak is uncertain it must be hauld from one part of her bottom to a nother untill one find the place is found where it takes effect; while the sail is under the Ship the ockam &Ca is washed off and part of it carried along with the water into the leak and in part stops up the hole- Mr Munkhouse one of my Midshipmen was once in a Merchant Sh  Ship which sprung a leak and made 48 Inches water per hour but by this means was brought home from Virginia to London with only her proper crew, to him I gave the deriction of this, who exicuted it very much to my satisfaction
            
      

        14 June 1770
        [note check MS uncorrected] Thursday 14th In the PM had a gentle breeze at SEBE   Sent the Master with two boats as well to sound ahead of the Ship as to look out for a harbour where we could repair our defects and put the Ship into a proper trim both of which she now very much wanted - At 3 oClock saw an opening that had the appearance of a harbour  Stood off and on while the boats were examining it who found that there was not a sufficient depth of water for the Ship,  by this time it was almost sunt set and seeing many shoals about us, we anchor'd in 4 fathom water about 32 Miles from the shore the Mainland extending from N1/2E to SBE1/2E - At 8 oClock the Pinnace in which was one of the Mates return'd on board and reported that they had found a good harbour about 2 Leagues to leeward    In consequence of this information we at 6 in the AM weighd and run down to it first sending two boats ahead to lay upon the Shoals that lay in our way and notwithstanding this precaution we wasere once in 3 fathom water with the Ship; having pass'd these shoals the boats went were sent to lay in the Cannel leading into the harbour.  by this time it begun to blow in so much that the Ship would not work having miss'd stays twice, and being entangled among shoals I was afraid of being drove to leeward before the boats could place themselves, and therefore Anchor'd in 4 fathom about a Mile from the shore and than made the signal for the boats to come on board, after which I went my self and buoy'd the Channel which I found very narrow and the harbour much smaller than I had been told but very convenient for our purpose. At Noon Latitude observed 15° 26' South
            
      

        15 June 1770
        [check MS] Friday 15th A fresh gale at SE and Clowdy weather attended with showers of rain in the night. As it blowed too fresh to break the Ship loose to run into the harbour we got down topgallant yards, unbent the Main sail and some of the small Sails, got down the Fore topgt Mast and the Jibb boom and spritsail yard in, intending to lighten the Ship forward as much as possible in order to lay her ashore to come at the leak.
            
      

        16 June 1770
        [check MS] Saturday 16th Strong gales at SE and Clowdy hazey weather with showers of rain. At 6 oClock in the AM it moderated a little and we hove short intending to get under sail, but was obliged to desist and bear away again. Some People were seen ashore to day.
            
      

        17 June 1770
        [check MS] Sunday 17th Most part strong gales at SE with some heavy showers of rain in the PM. At 6 in the AM being pretty moderate we weigh'd and run in to the Harbour in doing of which we run the Ship a shore twice   the first time she went off without any trouble but the second time She stuck fast, but this was of no concequence any farther then giving us a little trouble and was no no more than what I expected as we had the wind - While the Ship lay fast we got down the fore yard Fore topmast booms &Ca over board and made a raft of them along side 
            
      

        18 June 1770
        Monday 18th Fresh gales and clowdy with showers of rain. At 1 PM the Ship floated and we warped her into the harbour and moor'd her along side of a Steep beach on the south side. Got the anchors Cables and All the Hawsers a shore - In the AM made a stage from the Ship to the shore - errected two tents one for the Sick and the other for the Stores and Provisions - landed all the empty casks and part of the Provisions - and sent a boat to haul the sene who return'd without success 

        Tuesday 19th Fresh gales at SE and clowdy weather with frequent showers of rain. In the PM landed all the provisions and part of the stores - got the sick a Shore which amounted at this time to 8 or 9 afflicted with different disorders but none very dangerously ill 
        This afternoon I went upon one of the highest hill over the harbour from which I had a perfect View of the inlet or River and adjacent country which afforded but a very indifferent prospect - the low lands near the harbour River is all over run with mangroves among which the salt water flowes every tide and the high land appear'd to be barren and stoney  In the AM got the 4 remaining guns out of the hold and Mounted them on the quarter deck - got a spare anchor and anchor stock a shore and the remaining part of the stores and ballast that were in the hold - Set up the smiths forge and set the Armourer and his mate to work to make nails &Ca to repair the Ship 
            
      

        20 June 1770
        Wednesday 20th Winds at SE a fresh breeze. fore & Middle parts rainy, the latter fair - This day got out all the officers stores and the ground tier of water having now nothing in the Fore and Main hold but the Coals and a little stone ballast 
            
      

        21 June 1770
        Thursday 21st In the PM landed the Powder, got out the stone ballast wood, &Ca which brought the Ships draught of water to 8F..10I forward and 13 feet abaft   this I thought by triming the Coals aft wou'd be sufficient as I find the tides will rise and fall upon a perpendicular 8 feet at spring tides, but after the coals was trim'd away from over the leak we could hear the water come gushing in a little abaft the fore mast & about 3 feet from her keel   this determined me to clear the hold intirely    Accordingly very early in the morning we went to work to get out the Coals which was employment for all hands
            
      

        22 June 1770
        Friday 22nd. Winds at SE fair weather. At 4 In the PM having got out most of the Coals, cast loose the moorings and warped the Ship a little higher up the harbour to a place I had pitched upon to lay a Shore for stoping the leak, her draught of Water forward 7 feet 9 Inches and abaft 13 feet 6 Inches   At 8 being high water hauld her bow close a shore but kept her stern a float because I was afraid of neeping her and yet it was necessary to lay the whole of her as near the ground as possible - At 2 oClock in the AM the tide left her which gave us an oppertunity to examine the leak which we found to be at her floor heads a little before the Starboard fore chains - here the rocks had made their way thro' four Planks, quite to and even into the timbers and wound'd three more.   the manner these planks were damaged or cut out as I may say is hardly credable - scarce a splinter was to be seen, but the whole was cut away as if it had been done by the hands of Man with a blunt edge tool - fortunately for us the timbers in this place were very close other wise it would have been impossible to have saved the ship and even as it was it appear'd very extraordinary that she did not made no more water than what she did - A large piece of Coral rock was sticking in one hole and several pieces of the fothering, small stones, sand &Ca had made its way in and lodged between the timbers which had stoped the water from forceing its way in in great quantities 
        Part of the sheathing was gone from under the larboard bow  part of the false keel was gone and the remainder in such a shatter'd condition that we should be much better of, was was it gone also - her fore foot and some part of her Main keel was also damaged but not materialy   what damage she may have received abaft we could not see but beleive not much as the Ship makes no but little water while the Tide keeps below the leak forward - At 9 oClock the Carpenters went to work upon the Ship while the Smiths were busy makeing bolts nails &Ca 
            
      

        23 June 1770
        Saturday 23rd Winds south easterly a fresh gale and fair weather - Carpenters empd shifting the damaged Planks as long as the tide would permit them to work - At low water in the PM we examined her starboard side the Ships bottom under the starboard side she being dry as far aft as the after part of the fore chains   We could not find that she had received any other damage on this side but what has been mentioned - In the morning I sent 3 Men into the Country to shoot Pigeons, as some few of these birds had been seen flying about, in the evening they returnd with about 1/2 a dozen; one of the men saw an Animal of the Deer kind something less than a grey hound. it was of a Mouse Colour very slender made and swift of foot    In the AM I sent a boat to haul the saine who return'd at Noon having made three hauls and caught only three fish, and yet we see them plenty of jumping about the harbour but can find no method of catching them
            
      

        24 June 1770
        Sunday 24th Winds and weather as yesterday 
        In the PM the Carpenters finish'd the Starboard side and at 9 oClock heel'd the Ship the other way and hauld her off about 2 feet for fear of neeping   In the AM they went to work upon repairing the sheathing under the larboard bow - where we found two planks cut about half thro' - early in the morning I sent a party of men into the Country under the direction of Mr Gore to seek for refreshments   they returnd about noon with a few Palm Cabbages and a Bunch or 2 of wild Plantains.  these last were much smaller than any I had ever seen and the Pulp full of small stones otherwise they were well taisted. I saw my self this morning a little way from the ship one of the Animals before spoke off, it was of a light Mouse colour and the full size of a grey hound and shaped in every respect like one with a long tail which it carried like a grey hound in short I should have taken it for a wolf or wild dog, but for its walking or runing in which it jump'd like a Hare or a dear   another of them was seen to day by some of our people who saw the first, they describe them as having very small legs and the print of the foot like that of a goat but this I could not see my self because the ground the one I saw was upon was too hard and the length of the grass hinderd my seeing its legs 
            
      

        25 June 1770
        Monday 25th At low-water in the PM while the Carpenters were busey in repairing the sheathing and plank under the larboard bow I got people to go under the ships bottom to examine all her larboard side   she only being dry forward but abaft were 9 feet water, they found part of the sheathing off under the abreast of the Main mast about her floor heads and a part of one plank a little damaged.   there were three people who went down who all agree'd in the same story, the master was one who was positive that she had received no material damage besides the loss of the sheathing, this alone will be sufficient to let the worm into her bottom which may prove of bad concequence - however, we must run all resk for I know of no method to remedy this but by heaving the Ship her down which would be a work of emince labour & time, if not impractical in our present situation 
        The Carpenters continued hard at work under her bottom untill put off by the tide in the eveng and the morning tide did not ebb out far enough to permit them to work for here we have only one tolerable low and high tide in 24 hours 
        In the AM a party of men were empd ashore filling water while others were employ'd in overhauling the rigging 
            
      

        26 June 1770
        Tuesday 26th Fair weather winds a SE a fresh gale - At low-water in the PM the Carpenters finished under the larboard bow and every other place the tide would permit them to come at  Lashed some Casks under the Ships bows in order to help to float her and at High-water in the night Attempted to heave her off but could not she not being afloat partly owing to some of the Casks not holding that were lash'd under her - In the AM employ'd geting more Casks ready for the same purpose - but I am much afraid that we shall not be able to float her now the tides are Takeing off 
            
      

        27 June 1770
        Wednesday 27th Winds at SE a fresh breeze and Clowdy weather. In the PM lashed 38 empty Butts under the ships bottom in order to float her off which proved ineffectual and therefore gave over all hopes of geting her off untill the next spring tides - At day light got a consider weight of sundry articles from aft forward to ease the ship - the Armourers at work at the Forge repairing Iron work &Ca Carpenters caulking the Ship and stocking one of the spare anchors, Seamen employd filling water and overhauling the riging and I went in the Pinnace up the harbour and made several hauls with the Sain but caught only between 20 and 30 lb of fish which were given to the sick and such as were weak and ailing.

        29 June 1770
        Friday 29th Wind and weather as yesterday and the Employment of the people the same   Lieutenant Gore having been 4 or 5 Miles in the Country where he met with nothing remarkable.   he saw the foot steps of Men and likewise those of 3 or 4 sorts of wild beasts but saw neither man nor beast.   some others of our people who were out yesterday on the north side of the harbour River met with a place where the natives had just been as there fires we still burning, but they saw no body nor have we seen one sence we have been in Port  In these excursions we found some Wild Yamms or Coccos growing in the swampy grounds and this afternoon I sent a party of men to gather some   the tops we found made good greens and eat exceeding well when boild but the roots were so bad Acrid that few besides myself could eat them - This night Mr Green and I observed an Emersion of Jupiter  first Satellite which happen'd at 2h 58'.53" in the AM, the same Emersion happend at Greenwich according to calculation on the 30th at 5h..17'..43" in the PM; the difference is 14h..18'..50" equal to 1214°..42'..30" of Longitude which this place is west of Greenwich and its Latitude 15° 26' South. In the AM I sent some hands up with a boat up the harbour River to haul the sain while the rest were employ'd about the rigging and sundry other duties 
            
      

        30 June 1770
        Saturday 30th Moderate breezes at SE and clear serene weather. In the PM the Boat returnd from hauling the sain having caught as many fish as came to a pound and a half a man. In the AM I sent her again to haul the Sain and some hands to gather greens while others were employ'd about the rigging, &Ca &Ca    I likewise sent some of the young gentlemen to take a Plan of the harbour and went my self upon the hill which is over the south point to take a view of the Sea - at this time it was low-water and I saw what gave me no small uneasiness which were a Number of Sand banks or shoals laying all along the coast, the innermost lay about 3 or 4hardly a Miles from the Shore and the outermost extend off to sea as far as I could see with my glass. some just appeard above water - The only hopes I have of getting clear of them is to the northward where there seems to be a passage for as the winds blowes constantly from the SE we shall find it difficult if not impractical, to return back to the southward besides the shoals to the Southward lay so near this shore that it is a wonder to me how we escaped them in coming here 
            
      

        1 July 1770
        Sunday 1st Gentle breezes at SE and clowdy weather with some gentle showers in the morning - In the PM the People returnd from hauling the Sain having caught as much fish as came to 21/2 pound a Man - no one on board having more than a nother, the few greens we got I cause[d] to be boild a mong the Pease and makes a very good mess which together with the fish is a great refreshment to the people - In the AM a party of men /one from each mess / went again afishing and all the rest I gave leave to go into the Country knowing that there was no danger from the natives. To day at noon the Thermometer in the shade ris to 87 which is two or three degrees higher then it has been on any day before 
            
      

        2 July 1770
        Monday 2d Do Weather. In the PM the fishing party caught as much fish as came to 2 pound a man   those that were in the Country met with nothing new    Early in the AM I sent the Master in the Pinnace out of the Harbour to Sound about the Shoals in the offening and to look for a Channel to the northward.   at this time we had a breeze of wind from the land which continued till about 9 oClock, what makes me mention this is because it is the first land breeze we have had sence we have been in this harbour River  At low-water lashed some empty Casks under the Ships bows being in some hopes of floating her the next high-water and sent some hands afishing while others were employ'd in refiting the Ship 
            
      

        3 July 1770
        Tuesday 3rd Winds at SE. fore and middle parts a fresh gentle breeze the remainder a fresh gale. In the evening the fishing party returnd having got as much fish as came to 2 lb a man; at High-water Attempted to heave the Ship off but did not succeed - At Noon the Master returnd and reported that he had found a passage out to sea between the shoals which passage lies out ENE or EBN from the harbours Rivers mouth - he found these shoals to consist of Coral rocks, he landed upon one which drys at low-water where he found very large cockles and a variety of other shell fish a quantity of which he brought away with him. He told me that he was 5 Leagues out at Sea having at that distance of 21 fathom water and judged him self to be without all the shoals which I very much doubted, after this he came in shore and and stood to the northward where he met with a number of shoals laying a little distant from the shore - about 9 oClock in the evening he landed in a bay about 3 Leagues to the northward of this place where he disturbed some of the natives whome he supposed to be at supper; they all fled upon his approach and left him some fresh Sea Eggs and a fire ready lighted behind them but there was neither house nor hut near  Altho these Shoals lay within sight of the coast and abound very much with shell fish and other small fish which are to be caught at low-water in holes in the rocks - yet the natives never visit them for if they did we must have seen of these large shells on shore about their fire places, the reson I do suppose is, for fish that pa that they have no boats that they dare venture so far out at Sea in 
            
      

        4 July 1770
        Wednesday 4th Stong gales at SE and fair weather - In the PM the fishing party returnd with the usual success - At High-water hove the Ship a float - In the AM Employ'd triming her upon an even Keel intending to lay her ashore once more to come at her bottom under the larboard Main chains 
            
      

        5 July 1770
        Thursday 5th Strong breezes at SE and fair weather. In the PM warped the ship over and at high-water laid her a shore on the sand bank on the south side of the Harbour River for I was afraid to lay her broad side to the shore where she lay before because the ground lies with too great a decent and she hath already received some damage by laying there these last neep tides, at least she still makes water 
            
      

        6 July 1770
        Friday 6th Do Weather. At low water in the PM had hardly 4 feet water under the ship yet could not repair the sheathing that was beat off the place being all under water,   one of the Carpenters crew, a Man I could trust, went down and examined it and found three streaks of the sheathing gone about 7 or 8 feet long and the Main plank a little rub'd, this accout agrees with the report of the Master and others that were under her bottom before. The Carpenter who I look upon to be well skilld in his profission and a good judge of these matters was of opinion that this was of little concequence and as I found that it would be difficult if not impractical for us to get under her bottom to repair it, I resolved to spend no more time about it accordingly at High-water hove her off and Moor'd her along side the beach where the stores &Ca lay and in the AM got everything in readiness for takeing them on board and at the same time got on board 8 tuns of water and stowed in the ground tier in the after hold. In the Morning Mr Banks and Lieutt Gore with three men went in a small boat up the harbour River with a view to stay two or 3 days to try to kill some of the animals we have seen about this place
            
      

        7 July 1770
        Saturday 7th Fresh breezes at SE and fair weather   Employ'd geting on board Coals ballast, &Ca and caulking the Ship   a work that could not be done while she lay aground. The Armourer and his mate are still at work at the forge making and repairing sundry articles in the Iron way 
            
      

        8 July 1770
        Sunday 8th Gentle breezes at SE and clear weather. Early I sent the Master in a boat out to sea to sound again about the shoals because the account he had given of the Channell before mentioned was to me by no means satisfactory like wise sent some hands to haul the sain who caught near 80 pound of fish, the rest of the people I gave leave to go into the country 
            
      

        9 July 1770
        Monday 9th Gentle breezes in the day at SE in the night calm - In the PM Mr Gore and Mr Banks returnd having met with nothing remarkable   they were about 3 or 4 Leagsup in the country without finding hardly any Variation either in the soil or produce: In the evening the Master returnd having been seven Leagues out at sea and at that distance off saw shoals without him and was of opinion that there was no geting out to sea that way,  in his return he touched upon one of the shoals the same as he was upon the first time he was out.   here he saw a great number of turtle three of which he caught weighing 791 pounds. this occasiond my sending him out again this morning provided with proper geer for Strikeing them he having before nothing but a boat hook  Carpenters smiths and Coopers at their respective employments and the seamn employ'd geting on board stone ballast. This day all hands feasted upon turtle for the first time 
            
      

        10 July 1770
        Tuesday 10th Winds and weather as yesterday. Employ'd hoisting on board and stowing away the ground tier of water. in the PM saw Seven or eight of the Natives on the South side of the Harbour River and two of them came down upon the sandy point opposite the ship but as soon as I put off in a boat in order to speak with them they run away as hard fast as they could. At 11 oClock Mr Banks, who had gone out to sea with Mr Molineux the Master, returnd in his own small boat and gave but a very bad account of our turtle catchers, at the time he left them which was about 6 oClock, they had not got one nor were they likely to get any and yet the Master was so obstinate that he would not return which obliged me to send Mr Gore out in the yawl this moring to order the boat and people in in case they could not be imploy'd there to some advantage 
        In the AM 4 of the Natives came down to the sandy point on the north side of the harbour, having along with them a small wooden Canoe with outriggers in which they seemd to be employ'd striking fish &Ca   some were for going over in a boat to them but this I would not suffer but let them alone without seeming to take any notice of them, at length 2 of them came in the Canoe so near the Ship as to take some things we throw'd them, after this they went away and brought over the other two and came again along side nearer then they had done before and took such trifles as we gave them. after this they landed close to the Ship and all 4 came went a shore carrying their arms with them, but Tupia soon prevaild upon them to lay down their arms and come and set down by him after which most of us went to them and made them again some presents and stay'd by them untill dinner time when we made them understand that we wasere going to eat and ask'd them by signs to go with us but this they declined and as soon as we left them they went away in their canoe.   one of these men was something above the Middle age, the other three were young, none of them were above 51/2 feet high and all their features limbs proportionately small, they were wholy naked their skins the Colour of wood soot or a dark chocolate colour and this seem'd to be their natural colour, their hair was black, lank and crope'd short and neither wooly nor frizled nor did they want any of their fore teeth as Dampier has mentioned those did he saw on the western side of this Country, Some part of their bodies had been painted with red and one of them had his uper lip and breast paint with streakes of white which he called Carbanda: their features were far from being disagreeable, the Voices were soft and tunable and they could easily repeat many words after us, but neither us nor Tupia could understand one word they said 
            
      

        11 July 1770
        Wednesday 11th Gentle land and sea breezes, Employ'd airing the bread stowing away water stores &Ca In the night Mr Gore and the Master returnd with the long-boat and brought with them one turtle and a few shell fish the Yawl Mr Gore left upon the shoal with Six men to endeavour to Strike more turtle. In the morning four of the natives made us a nother short visit 3 of them had been with us the preceeding day and the other was a stranger - one of these men had a hole through the Bridge of his nose in which he stuck a peice of bone as thick as my finger, seeing this we examined all their noses and found that they had all holes for the same purpose, they had likewise holes in their ears but no ornaments hanging to them, they had bracelets upon their arms made of hair and like hoops of small cord; they some times must wear a kind of fillet about their heads for one of them had applied some part of an Old shirt which I had given them to this use 
            
      

        12 July 1770
        Thursday 12th Winds and weather as yesterday and the employment of the people the same. At 2 oClock in the AM the Yawl came on board and brought 3 turtle and a large skeat and as their was a probability of succeeding in this kind of fishery I sent her out again after breakfast    about this time 5 of the natives came over and stay'd with us all the forenoon there were 7 in the whole 5 Men a woman and a boy, these two last stay'd on the point of sand on the other side of the harbour River about 200 Yards from us, we could very clearly see with our glasses that the woman was as naked as ever she was born even those parts which I allways before now thought Nature would have taught a woman to conceal were uncover'd 

In the AM employd geting on board stone ballast and airing the Spare sails - Mr Gore being in the Country shott one of the Animals before spoke of it was a small one of the sort weighing only 28 pound clear of the entrails. its body was        length the head neck and shoulders of this Animal was very small in proportion to the other parts - it was hare lip'd but the head and ears and teeth were most like a Hares of any animal I know the tail was nearly as long as the body, thick next the rump and tapering towards the end - the fore legs were 8 Inch long and the hind 22. its progression is by hoping or Jumping 7 or 8 feet at each hop upon its hind legs only for in this it makes no use of the fore, which seem to be only design'd for scratching in the ground &Ca, the Skin is cover'd with a short hairy fur of a dark Mouse or Grey Colour  Excepting the head and ears which I thought was something like a Hare's, it bears no sort of resemblance to any European animal I ever saw, it is said to bear much resemblance to the Gerbua excepting in size the Gerbua being no larger than a common rat 
            
      

        15 July 1770
        Sunday 15th Gentle breezes andt SE and East    In the PM got on board the spare sails and sundry other Articles - In the AM as the people did not work upon the Ship one of the Petty officers was disireous of going out to catch turtle   I let him have the Pinnace for that purpose and sent the long boat to haul the Sain who caught about 60 pounds of fish 
        Today we din'd of the animal shott yesterday & thought it excellent food

        At the same time I went upon one of the high hill on the north side of the harbour River from which I had an extensive view of the inland country which consisted of hills vallies and large plains, agreeably deversified with woods and lawns 

At 7h..41'..17" PM Observ'd the first Satillite of Jupiter to Emerge; the same Emersion happen'd at Greenwich at 10h..5200'..52" in the AM the difference is 14..19'..35" = to 214..53'..45" of Longitude the observation made on the 29th of last Month gave 214..42'..30" the mean is 214..48'..71/2" which this place is west of Greenwich 
            
      

        18 July 1770
        Wednesday 18th Winds at ESE a gentle breeze    In the PM I sent the Master and one of the mates in the Pinnace to the northward to look for a Channell that way clear of the shoals. Mr Banks, Dr Solander and my self took a turn into the woods on the other side of the water where we met with five of the natives and altho we had not seen any of them before they came to us without showing the least signs of fear, two of these wore necklaces made of shells which they seem'd to Value as they would not part with them - In the evening the Yawl came in with three turtle and early in the AM she went out again - about 8 oClock we was were viseted by several of the natives who now became more familiar than ever, soon after this Mr Banks and I went over to the south side of the harbour River and travel'd six or 8 miles along shore to the northward where we assended a high hill from whence I we had an extensive view of the Sea Coast to leewardwhich was cover'd with shoals as far as the eye could see afforded us a Meloncholy prospect of the difficultys we are incounter, for in what ever direction we turn'd our eys Shoals inumberable were to be seen    after this we return'd to the Ship without meeting with any thing remarkable and found several of the natives on board, at this time we had 12 Tortoise Turtle Turtle upon our decks which they took more notice of then any thing else in the ship as I was told by the officers for their curiosity was satisfied before I got on board and they went away soon after

        In the AM we were viseted by 10 or 11 of the natives   the most of them came from the other side of the harbour River where we saw six or seven more the most of them women and like the men quite naked; those that came on board were very desirous of having some of our turtle and took the liberty to haul two to the gang way to put over the side but being disapointed in it this they grew a little troublesome, and was were for throwing every thing overboard they could lay their hands upon; as we had no victuals dress'd at this time I offer'd them some bread to eat, which they rejected with scorn as I believe they would have done any thing else excepting turtle - soon after this they all went a shore   Mr Banks my self and five or six more of our people being a shore at the same time, emmediatly upon their landing one of them took a handfull of dry grass and lighted it at a fire we had a shore and before we well know'd what he was going about he made a large circuit round about us and set fire to the grass on the ground in his way which and in an Instant burst like wild fire the whole place was in flames, luckily at this time we had hardly any thing ashore besides the forge and a sow with a Litter of young pigs one of which was scorched to death in the fire 
        as soon as they had done this they all went to a place where some of our people were washing and where all our nets and a good deal of linnen were laid out to dry, here with the greatest obstinacy they again set fire to the grass which I and some others who were present could not prevent untill I was obliged to fire a musquet load with small shott at one of the rig leaders which sent them off. as we were apprised of this last attempt of theirs we got the fire out before it got head, but the first spread like wild fire in the woods and grass.nNotwithstanding my fireing in which one must have been a little hurt because we saw some a few drops of blood on some of the linnen he had cross'd gone over, they did not go far from us for we soon after heard their voices in the woods upon which Mr Banks and I and 3 or 4 More went to look for them and very soon met them comeing toward us as they had each 4 or 5 darts a piece and not knowing their intention we seized upon six or seven of the first darts we met with, this alarmed them so much that they all made off and we followd them for near half a Mile and than set down and call'd to them and they stop'd also; after some little unintelligible conversation had pass'd between us they lay down their darts and came to us in a very friendly manner   we now return'd them the darts we had taken from them which reconciled every thing. We now found  there were 4 strangers among them that we had not seen before and these were interduce'd to us by name by the others: the man which we suppos'd to have been wounded struck with small shott was gone off, but he could not be much hurt as he was at a great distance when I fired. They all came along with us abreast of the ship where they stay'd a short time and then went away and soon after set the woods on fire about a Mile and a half and two miles from us 
            
      

        20 July 1770
        Friday 290th Fresh breezes at SE and fair weather. In the PM got every thing on board the Ship, new berth'd her and let her swing with the tide. In the night the Master return'd with the Pinnace and reported that there was no safe passage for the Ship to the northward - At low water in the AM I went and sounded and buoy'd the bar, being now ready to put to sea the first oppertunity 
            
      

        21 July 1770
        Saturday 201st Strong breezes at SE and Clowdy weather. In the PM sent a boat to haul the sain which return'd with as much fish as came to 13/4lb a man. The yawl return'd with only one turtle which was caught in the nett for it blew too hard for the boat to strike any. In the morning I sent her out again but she was obliged to return not being able to get to windward - Carpenters employ'd in repairingoverhauling the boats and overhauling the pumps and as the wind would not permit us to sail I sent the boatswain with some hands a shore makeing rope and a petty officer with two men to gather greens for the Ships company 
            
      

        22 July 1770
        Sunday 22d Fresh breezes at SE and ESE. Employ'd as yesterday. In the AM as the wind would not permit us to sail I sent the yawl out to catch turtle in opening of one to day we found sticking thro' both shoulder bones a woodon harpoon or turtle peg 15 Inches long bearbed at the end such as we have seen among the natives, this proves to a demonstration that they strike turtle I suppose at the time they come aShore to lay their Eggs for they certainly have no boat fit to do this at sea or that will carry a turtle and this harpoon must have been a good while in as the wound was quite heald up 
            
      

        23 July 1770
        Monday 223th Fresh breezes in the SE quarter which so long as it continues will confine us in port - Yesterday in the AM I sent some people into the Country to gather greens on[e] of which Straggle'd from the rest and met with four of the natives by a fire on which they were broiling a fowl and the hind leg of one of the animals before spoke of, he had the prescience of mind not to run from them / being unarm'd / least they should pursue him, but went and sit down by them and after he had sit a little while and they had felt his hands and other parts of his body they suffer'd him to go away without offering the least insult and perceiving that he did not go right for the ship they directed him which way to go
            
      

        24 July 1770
        Tuesday 24th Winds and weather continues the same - Employ'd makeing rope, caulking the Ship, fishing &Ca 
            
      

        25 July 1770
        Wednesday 25th Fresh gales at SE and fair weather. In the evening the yawl came in having not been able to strike one turtle on account of the blowing weather nor can we catch much fish with the sain in the harbour.
            
      

        26 July 1770
        Thursday 26th Winds and weather as yesterday   Such people as can be spared from the necessary duties of the Ship are empd fishing and gatering greens and other refreshments 
            
      

        27 July 1770
        Friday 27th Very fresh Gales at SEBS and fair weather   In the AM caught as much fish as came to 3/4 Ib a man and Mr Gore shott one of the Animals before spoke off which weighed 80 lb and 54 exclusive of the entrails, skin and head, this was as large as the most we have seen .
            
      

        28 July 1770
        Saturday 28th Winds and weather as above without the least variation the whole of the 24 hours. The Carpenters finished caulking the Ship 
            
      

        29 July 1770
        Sunday 29th Winds at SE a fresh breeze untill 5 AM at which time it fell Calm and soon after had a light breeze from the land, upon this I sent a boat to see what water was upon the bar / it being 2 hours ebb / and hove up the Anchor in order to put to sea, but upon the return of the boat came too again as there were only 13 feet water upon the bar which was 6 Inches less water then what the Ship draw'd. after this I sent the Yawl to look for turtle as those we had got before were nearly all expended, about 8 oClock the sea breeze set in again which put an end to our sailing this day after which I sent the Pinnace to haul the Sain who returnd with only 20 pounds of fish 
            
      

        30 July 1770
        Monday 30th Winds at SE a fresh gale and fair weather in the PM, the remainder hazey with rain, but the winds tho more moderate kept in the SE quarter.
            
      

        31 July 1770
        Tuesday 31st Fresh Gales at SE and hazy with rain in all PM and most part of the night - At 2 oClock in the AM I had thoughts of trying to warp the ship out of the harbour but upon my going first out in a boat I found it blow'd too fresh for such an attempt 
            
      

        1 August 1770
        Wednesday 1st Strong gales from the SE with Squals attended with rain. In the PM the Yawl came in with two rays which together weigh'd 265 lb   it blowed too hard all the time they were out for strikeing turtle. Carpenters employ'd overhauling the Pumps all of which we find in a state of decay and this the Carpenter says is owing to the sap having been left on which in time has decay'd the sound wood. one of them is quite useless and was so rotten when hoisted up as to drop to pieces, however I cannot complain of a leaky ship for the most water she makes is not quite an Inch an hour 
            
      

        2 August 1770
        Thursday 2nd Winds and weather as yesterday or rather more stormy. We have now no success in the Sain fishing hardly geting above 20 or 30 pound the day 
            
      

        3 August 1770
        Friday 3rdIn the PM the weather being more moderate we carried the coasting anchor and Cable out and laid it without the barr in order to be ready to warp out by that we may not loose the least opportunity that may offer Strong breezes and hazy untill 6 oClock in the AM when it Moderated and we unmoord hove up the anchor and began to warp out but the Ship tailing upon the sand on the north side of the harbour River, the Tide of Ebb makeing out and a fresh breeze seting in we were obliged to desist and Moor the Ship again just within the barr 
            
      

        4 August 1770
        Saturday 4th In the PM having pritty Moderate weather I order'd the Coasting anchor and Cable to be laid without the barr to be ready to warp out by, that we might not loose the least oppertunity that might offer for I am very Anxious of geting to Sea laying in Port spends time to no purpose, consumes our provisions of which we are very Short in many articles, and we have yet a long Passage to make to the East Indias through an unknown and perhaps dangerous Sea, these circumstances considerd, makes me very anxious of geting to sea. The wind continued moderate all night untill and at 5 oClock in the morning when it fell calm this gave us an oppertunity to warp out. about 7 we got under sail having a light air from the land which soon died away and was succeeded by the Sea breeze from SEBS with which we stood off to Sea EBN having the Pinnace ahead sounding, the Yawl I sent to the Turtle bank to take up the net that was left there but as the wind freshen'd we got out before her, and a little after noon anchor'd in 15 fathom water Sandy bottom, for I did not think it safe to run in among the Shoals untill I had well View'd them at low-water from the Mast head, that I might be better able to judge which way to steer for as yet I had not resolved whether I should beat back to the Southward round all the shoals or seek a passage to the Eastward or to the northrd all of which appear'd to be equally difficult and dangerous When at Anchor the harbour sail'd from bore St 70° West distant 41/2 or 5 Leagues, the northermost point of the Main land we had in sight which I name'd Cape Bedford / Latde 15°..1715' St Longitude 1214°..45' Wt / bore N. 20° West distant 31/2 Leagues, but we could see land to the NE of this Cape which made like two high Islands, the Turtle banks bore East distant 1 Mile, Latitude by observation 15°..23' St our depth of water in standing off from the land was from 31/2 to 15 fathom. I shall now give a Short decription of the harbour or River we have been in which I named after the Ship. Endeavour River 
        it is only a small bar Harbour or Creek which runs in about winding 3 or 4 Leagues in land at the head of which is a small fresh water brook as I was told for I was not so high myself, but there is not water for shiping above a Mile within the bar and this is on the north side where the bank is so steep for nearly a quarter of a mile that ships may lay a float at low-water so near the shore as to reach it with a stage and is extreamly convineint for heaving a ship down and this is all this harbour River hath to recommend it especially for large shipping for there is no more than 9 or 10 feet water upon the bar at low-water and 17 or 18 feet at high, the tides riseing and falling about 9 feet at spring tides and is high-water on the days of the new and full Moon between 9 and 10 oClock    besides this part of the Coast is so barricaded with shoals as to make this harbour still more difficult of access, the safest way I know off to come at it is from the Southward keeping the Mainland close on board all the way, its situation may always be found by the Latitude which hath been before mentioned,    over the South point is some high land but the north point is forme'd by a low sandy beach which extends about 3 Miles to the northward then the land is again high. The refreshments we got here were chiefly Turtle, but as we had to go five Leagues out to Sea for them and had much blowing weather we were not over stock'd with this article, however what with these and the fish we caught in the Sain we had not much reason to complain considering the Country we were in,    whatever refreshment we got that would bear a division I caused to be equally divided amongest the whole compney generally by weight, the meanest person in the Ship had an equal share with my self or any one on board and this method every commander of a Ship on such a Voyage as this ought ever to observe    We found in several places on the sandy beaches and sand Hills near the Sea Purslain and beans which growes on a creeping kind of a Vine,   the first we found very good when boild and the latter not to be despised and were at first very servicable to the sick, but the best greens we found here was the Tarra or Cocco tops called in the West Indias Indian Kale which grow in most Boggy places, these eat as well as or better than spinnage, the roots for want of being transplanted and properly cultivated were not good yet we could have dispenced with them could we have got them in any tolerable plenty   but having a good way to go for them it took up too much time and too many hands to gather both root and branch: the few Cabbage Palms we found here were in general so small and yeilded so little Cabbage that they were not worth the looking after and this was the case with most of the fruits &Ca we found in the woods. Besides the Animal which I have before mentioned called by the natives Kangooroo or Kanguru here are Wolves, Possums, an Animal like a ratt and snakes both of the Venomous and other sorts    Tame Animals here are none except Dogs and of these we never saw but one who frequently came about our tents to pick up bones &Ca   The Kangura are in the greatest number for we seldom went into the Country without seeing some. The Land fowls we met with here which far from being numerous were Crows, Kites, Hawks, Cockadores of two sorts the one white and the other brown, very beautifull Lorryquets of two or three sorts, Pidgions, Doves and a few other sorts of small birds. The Sea or water fowl are Herns, Whisling Ducks which pearch and I beleive roost on trees, Curlews &Ca and not many of these neither    some of our Gentlemen who were in the Country heard the noise of Wild Geese and saw them flying in the night and saw wild Geese in the Night 
        The Country as far as I could see is deversified with Hills and Plains and these with Woods and Lawns   the soil of the Hills is hard dry and very stoney yet it produ[c]eth a thin Course grass and some wood: the soil of the Plains and Vallies is sandy and in some places Clay and in many places it is parts very Rocky and stoney as well as the hills, but in general the land is pretty well clothed with long grass, wood, shrubs &Ca The whole country abounds with an immence number of Aunt hills some of which are 6 or 8 feet high and more than double that in circuit   Here are but few sorts of trees besides the Gum tree which is the most numerous and is the same as we found on the Southern part of the Coast only here they do not grow near so large. On each side of the Harbour Riverand all the way up the creek it are Mangroves which extend in some places a Mile from its banks 
        the Country in general is not badly water'd there being several fine Rivulets at no very great distance from one another, but none near to the place where we lay, at least not in the Dry season which is at this time, however we were very well supply'd with water by Springs which were not far off 
            
      

        5 August 1770
        Sunday 5th In the PM had a gentle breeze at SE and clear weather, As I did not intend to weigh untill the Morning I sent all the boats to the reef to get what Turtle and shell fish they could. At Low-water from the Mast head I took a view of the shoals and could see several laying a long way without this one   apart of several of them appearing above water, but as it appear'd pretty clear of Shoalsaway to the NE of the turtle reef, I came to a resolution to stretch out that way close upon a wind, because if we found no passage we could always return back the way we went. In the evening the boats returnd with one turtle a sting-ray and as many large Clams as came to one and a half pound a man, in each of these Clams were about two pounds of meat added to this we caught in the night several Sharks. Early in the morning I sent the Pinnace and Yawl again to the reef as I did not intend to wiegh untill half Ebb at which time the Shoals began to appear, before 8 oClock it came on to blow and I made the signal for the boats to come on board which they did and brought with them one turtle. We afterwards attempted began to heave, but the wind freshing obliged us to bear away again and lay fast 
            
      

        6 August 1770
        Monday 6th Winds at SE   at 2 oClock in the PM it fell pretty moderate and we got under sail and stood out upon a wind NEBE having the Turtle Reef to windward having the Pinnace ahead sounding, we had not stood out long before we discover'd shoals ahead and on both bows,   at half past 4 oClock having run off 8 Miles the Pinnace made the Signal for shoal water in a place where we little expected it, upon this we tack'd and stood on and off while the Pinnace stretched farther to the Eastward, but as night was approaching I thought it safest to anchor which we accordingly did in 20 fathom water a muddy bottom, Endeavour River bore St 52° West   Cape Bedford  WBN1/2N distant 5 Leagues, the northermost land in sight which made like an Island North and a shoal, a small sandy part of which appear'd above water bore NE distant 2 or 3 Miles. In standing off from the Turtle Reef to this place our soundings were from 14 to 20 fathoms, but where the Pinnace was about a Mile farther to the ENE were no more then 4 or 5 feet of water rocky ground and yet this did not appear to us in the Ship. In the morning we had a strong gale from the SE that instead of weighing as we intended we were obliged to bear away more Cable and to strike topgallant yards
            
      

        7 August 1770
        Tuesday 7th Strong gales at SE, SEBS & SSE with clowdy weather, At Low-water in the PM I and several of the officers kept a look out at the Mast head to see for a passage between the Shoals but we could see nothing but breakers all the way from the South round by the East as far as NW, extending out to sea as far as we could see, it did not appear to be one one continued shoal but several laying detach'd from each other, on the Eastermost that we could see the Sea broke very high which made me judge it to be the outermost, for on many of those within, the sea did not break high attall, and from about half flood to half Ebb they are not to be seen which makes the Sailing among them the more dangerous and requires great care & circumspection for like all other shoals or reefs of Coral Rocks they are quite steep too; altho the most of these shoals consist of Coral Rocks yet a part of some of them is sand, the Turtle Reef and some others have a small patch of sand generaly at the north end that is only cover'd at High-water,  these generaly discover themselves before we come near them Altho I speak of this as the Turtle Reef yet. It is not to be doubted but what there are Turtle upon the most of these reefs them as well as this one we fished upon. After having well View'd our situation from the mast head and I saw that we were surrounded on every side with dangers Shoalsand no such thing as a passage to Sea but through the winding channels between them dangerous to the highest degree in so much that I was  quite at a loss which way to steer when the weather will would permit us to get under sail, for to beat back to the SE the way we came as the Master would have had me done would be an endless peice of work now on the other hand if we do not find a passge to the northward we shall have to come back at least as the winds blow now constantly strong from that quarter without hardly any intermission - on the other hand if we do not find a passage to the northd we shall have to come at last 
        At 11 oClock the Ship drove and obliged us to bear away to a Cable and one third which brought us up again, but in the Morning the Gale increaseing she drove again this made us let go the Small Bower anchor and to bear away a whole cable on it and two on the other and even after this she still kept driving slowly untill we had got down Topgallant Mast, struck Yards and Topmasts close down and made all Snug than she rid fast C. Bedford  bearing WSW  distant 31/2 Leagues in this situation we had shoals to the eastward of us extending from the SEBS to the NNW distant from the nearest part of them about two miles
            
      

        8 August 1770
        Wednesday 8th Strong gales at SSE all this day in so much that I dirst not get up yards and Topmasts
            
      

        9 August 1770
        Thursday 9th In the PM the weather being something moderater we got up the Topmast, but kept the Lower Yards down. A 6 oClock in the Morning we began to heave in the Cable thinking to get under sail, but it blowed so fresh together with a head sea that we could hardly heave the Ship ahead and at last was oblig'd to desist 
            
      

        10 August 1770
        Friday 10th Fresh gales at SSE and SEBS. In the PM the wind fell so as we got up the small bower Anchor and hove in to a whole Cable on the best bower. At 3 oClock in the morning we got up the lower yards and at 7 weigh'd and stood in for the land / intending to seek a passage along shore to the northward / having a Boat ahead sounding, depth of water as we run in from 19 to 12 fathom: after standing in an hour we edge'd away for 3 small Island that lay NNE1/2E 3 Leagues from Cape Bedford, to these Islands the Master had been in the Pinnace when the Ship was in Port; At 9 oClock we were abreast of them and between them and the Main having another low Island between us and the latter which lies WNW, 4 Miles from the Three Island in this Channell had 14 fathom water: the northermost Point of the Main we had in sight bore from us NNW1/2W distant 2 Leagues. Four or 5 Leagues to the NE of this head lad land appear'd three high Islands with some smaller ones near them and the Shoals and reefs without us we could see extending to the northward as far as these Islands: we directed our Course between them and the above headland leaving a small Id to the Eastwd of us which lies NBE 4 M. from ye 3 Ids having all the while a boat ahead sounding. At Noon we were got betwixt the headland and the 3 High Islands distant from the former 2 and from the latter 4 Leagues, our Latitude by observation was 14°..51' St We now judged our selves to be clear of all danger having as we thought a clear open sea before us, but this we soon found otherwise and occasiond my calling the headland above mentioned Cape Flattery  / Latitude 14°..55' St Longd 214° 43' West / it is a lofty Promontary makeing in two hills next the Sea and a third behind them with low sandy land on each side, but it is better known by the Three high Islands out at sea the northermost which is the largest and lies from the Cape NNE distant 5 Leagues - From this Cape the Mainland trends away NW & NWBW 
            
      

        11 August 1770
        Saturday 11th Fresh breezes at SSE and SEBS with which we steerd along shore NWBW untill one oClock, when the Petty officer at the mast head call'd out that he saw land ahead extending quite round to the Islands without us and a large Reef between us and themIslands  upon this I went to the mast head my self, the Reef I saw very plain which was now so far to wind ward of us that we could not weather it, but what he took for main land ahead were only small Islands, for such they appear'd to me but before I had well got from mast head the Master and some others went up who all asserted that it was a continuation of the main land and to make it still more alarming they said they saw breakers in a manner all round us. We emmediatly hauld the upon a wind in for the land and made the Signal for the boat which was ahead sounding to come on board, but as she was well to leeward, we were obliged to edge away to take her up and soon after came too an Anchor under a point of the Main in 1/4 less 5 fathom about a Mile from the Shore Cape Flattery      bearing SE  distant 31/2 Leagues    After this I landed and went upon the point which is pretty high from which I had a view of the sea-Coast which trended away NWBW 8 or 10 Leagues which was as far as I could see, the weather not being very clear. I likewise saw 9 or 10 small low Islands and some shoals laying of the Coast and some large shoals between the Main and the three high Islands without, which I was now well assured were Islands and not a part of the Main land as some had taken them to be, Excepting Cape Flattery and the Point I am now upon which I have named Point Lookout the Mainland next the Sea to the Northward of Cape Bedford  is low and Chequer'd with White Sand and Green Bushes &Ca for 10 or 12 Miles in land behond which is high lands. To the northward of Point Lookout the shore appeard to be shoald and flat some distance off, which was not no good sign of meeting with a channel in with the land as we have hitherto done   We saw the foot steps of People upon the Sand and smook and fire up in the Country and in the evening return'd on board where I came to a resolution to Visit one of the high Islands in the offing in my Boat as they lay at least 5 Leagues out to sea and seem'd to be of such a hieght that from the top of one of them I hoped to see and find a Passage out to sea clear of the shoals; accordingly in the morning I set out in the Pinnace for the northermost and largest of the three accompaned by Mr Banks, at the same time I sent the Master in the Yawl to lee-ward to sound between the low Islands and the Main. In my way to the Island I pass'd over a large Reef of Coral Rocks and sand which lies about two Leagues from the Island   I left a nother to lee ward which lays about 3 Miles from the Island on the North part of this is a low sandy Isle with trees upon it. on the reef we pas'd over in the boat we saw several turtle and chased one or two but caught none it blowing too hard and I had not time to spare being otherways employ'd. I did not reach the Island untill half an hour after one oClock in the PM on
            
      

        12 August 1770
        Sunday 12thwhen I immediatly went upon the highest hill on the Island where to my mortification I discoverd a reef of Rocks laying about 2 or 3 Leagues without the Island, extending in a line NW and SE farther than I could see on which the Sea broke very high   this however gave me great hopes that they were the outermost shoals, as I did not doubt but what I should be able to get without them for there appear'd to be several breaks or Partitions in the reef and deep water between it and the Islands   I stay'd upon this hill untill near sun set but the weather continued so hazy all the time that I could not see above 4 or 5 Leagues round me so that I came down much disap disapointed in the prospect I expected to have had. but being in hopes the morning might prove clearer and give me a better View of the Shoals. with this view I stay'd all night upon the Island, and at 3 in the Morning sent the Pinnace with one of the Mates I had with me to sound between the Island and the reefs and to examine one of the breaks or Channells and in the mean time I went again upon the hill where I arrived by sun rise but found it much hazier than in the evening 
        About noon the Pinnace return'd haveing been out as far as the reef and found from 15 to 28 fathoms water. it blowed so hard that they durst not venture into one of the Channells which the Mate said seem'd to him to be very narrow but this did not discourage me for I thought from the place he was at he must have seen it at a disadvantage. Before I quit this Island I shall desirablecribe it. It lies as I have before observed observed about 5 Leagues from the Main, it is about 8 Miles in circuit and of a height sufficient to be seen 10 or 12 Leagues it is mostly high land very rocky and barren except on the NW side where there are some Sandy bays and low land which last is cover'd with thin long grass Trees, &Ca the same as upon the Main here is also fresh water in two places the one is a runing stream the water a little brackish where I tasted it which was close to the sea, the other is a standing Pool close behind the sandy beach of good sweet water as I dare say the other is a little higher up way from the Sea beach: The only land-animals we saw here were Guanoes or Lizards and these seem'd to be pretty plenty whenceich occasioned my nameing the Island Lizard Island The inhabitants of the Main Visit this Island at some seasons of the year for we saw the ruens of several of their hutts and heaps of Shells &Ca
        SE 4 or 5 Miles from this Island lay the other two high Islands which are very small compared to this and near them lay three other yet smaller and lower Islands and several Shoals or Reefs especially to the SE. There is however a clear passage from Cape Flattery to these Islands and even quite out to the outer Reefs leaving the above Islands to the SE and Lizard Island to the NW 

        Monday 13th At 2 oClock in the PM we left Lizard Isld in order to return to the Ship and in our way landed upon the low sandy Isle mentioned in coming out   We found on this Island a great number of birds the Most of them Sea fowl, except Eagles, we likewise saw some Turtle but caught none for the reasons before assigned. We found that the Natives resort to this Island as we saw several Turtle Shells piled one upon another   After leaving Eagle Island we stood SW directly for the Ship, sounding all the way, and had not less than 8 fm nor more than 14 fm   I found the same depth of water between Lizard and Eagle Island. After we got on board the Master informed me that he had been down to the Islands   I had directed him to go to which he judged to lay about 3 Leagues from the Main, he found 10, 12 & 14 fathom water without them and 7 between them & Main, this last channell was narrow because from the run off a flat above 2 Leagues. He found upon the Islands piles of Turtle shells and some fins that were so fresh that both the boats crew eat of them, this shew'd that the Natives la must have been there lately 
        After well considering both what I had seen my self and the report of the Master, who was of opinion that the Passage to Leeward would prove dangers; this I was pretty well convince'd of my self that by keeping in with the main land we should be in continual danger besides the risk we should run in being locke'd in within the Main reef at last and have to return back to seek a passage out, an accident of this kind or any other that might happen to the Ship would infallibly loose our passage to the East Indias this season and might prove the ruin of the Voyage as we have now little more than 3 Months provisions on board and that at short allowance in many Arti[c]les. These reasons had the weight with all the officers. I therefore resolved to weigh in the morning and endeavour to quet the coast altogether untill we could approach it with less danger, With this View we got under sail at day light and stood out NE for the NW end of Eagle Lizard Island, leaving Eagle Island to windward of us and some other Islands & Shoals to leward having the Pinnace a head sounding in this channell we had from 9 to 14 fathom   At Noon the NW end of Lizard Island bore ESE distant one mile  Latde observed 14°..38' St depth of water 14 fathom   We now took the Pinnace in tow knowing that there was no danger till we got out to the Reefs without the Island -
            
      

        14 August 1770
        Tuesday 14th Winds at SE a steady fresh gale   By 2 oClock we just fetched to windward of one of the Channels in the <deleted word unclear> outer Reef I had seen from the Island, we now tacked and made a short trip to the SW while the Master in the Pinnace examine'd the channell, he soon made the Signal for the Ship to follow which we accordingly did and in a short time got safe out, we had no sooner got without the breakers than we had no ground with 150 fathom of line and found a well growen Sea rowling in from the SE certain signs that nither land nor shoals were in our neighbourhood in that direction which made us quite easy at being free'd from fears of Shoals &Ca  after having been intangled among them more or less ever sence the 26th of May, in which time we have saild 360 Leagues without ever having a Man out of the cheans heaving the Lead when the Ship was under way, a circumstance that I dare say never happen'd to any ship before and yet it was absolutely necessary. It was with great regret I was obliged to quit this coast unexplored to its Nothern extremity which I think we were not far off, for I firmly believe that it doth not join to New Guinea, however this I hope yet to clear up being resolved to get in with the land again as soon as I can do it with safety and the reasons I have before assigned will I presume be thought sufficient for my haveing left it at this time 
        The Passage or Channell we now came out by lies in the Latitude of 14°..32', it may always be found and known by the three high Islands within it which I have called the Islands of direction because by them a safe passage may be found, even by Strangers, in within the reef and quite up in to the Main; the Channell lies from Lizard Island NE1/2N distant 3 Leagues and is about one third of a Mile broad and not more in length.   Lizard Island which is the northermost and largest of the three affords snug Anchorage under the NW side, fresh water and wood for fuel and the low Islands and Shoals which lay between it and the Main abound I am well-assured, with Turtle and other fish which may be caught at all seasons of the year except in such blusterous weather as we have lately had; these things considered, there is not perhaps a better place on this whole coast for a Ship to refresh at than this Island. I had forgot to mention in its proper place that not only of these Islands but in severl places on the Sea beach in and about Endeavour River we found Bamboos, Cocoa-nutts, the Seeds of Plants, and Pummick Stones which were not the produce of this Country from all the discoveries we have been able to make oin it. it is reasonable to suppose that they are the produce of some Country lying to the Eastward and brought here by the Easterly Trade winds. The Islands discover'd by Quiros call'd by Astralia del Espiritu Santo lays in this parrallel but how far to the East is hard to say, most charts place them as far to the west as this Country, but we are morally certain that he never was upon any part of this coast. The published account of the Voyage, which we must depend upon untill we have better authority, places his discoveries about 22° to the East of the Coast of New Holland 
        As soon as we were without the reef we brought too and hoisted in the boats, than stood off an upon a wind all night as I did not care to run to leeward untill we had a whole day before us. We now began to find that the Ship had received more damage than we immagined and soon felt the effect the high rowling sea had upon her by increasing her leaks consideably so that it was as much as one Pump could keep her free kept continualy at work; however this was looked upon as trifleing to the danger we had lately made our escape from 
        At Day light in the Morning Lizard Island bore S. 15° Et Distant 10 Leagues, we now made sail and stood away NNW1/2W and at 9 oClock NW1/2N, having the advantage of a fresh gale at SE. At Noon we were by observation in the Latitude of 13°..46' St having at this time no land in sight 
            
      

        15 August 1770
        Wednesday 15th Fresh Trade at SE and clear weather   At 6 oClock in the evening shortned sail and brought too with her head to the NE. At 6 oClock in the AM made sail and steer'd West in order to make the land being feerful of over shooting the Passage supposeing there to be one between this land and New Guinea - At Noon we had no land in sight our latitude by observation was 13°..2' South Longitude 216°..0' West which was 1°..23' to the West of Lizard Island 
            
      

        16 August 1770
        Thursday 16   By one oClock in the PM or before we saw high land from ye Masthead bearing WSW and at 2 oClock saw more land to the NW of the former makeing in hills like Islands but we judged it to be the continuation of the Main land. An hour after this we saw breakers between us and the land extending away to the Southward farther than we could see, but we thought we saw them terminate to the northward abreast of us, this however proved only any opening for soon after we saw the Reef or breakers extend away to the northward as far as we could see, upon this we hauld close upon awind which was now at ESE   we had hardly trimed our sails before the wind came to N EBEN which was right upon the Reef and of course made our clearing of it doubtfull, the northernmost of it that we could see at sun set bore from us NBE distant about 2 or 3 Leagues -  hHowever this being the best tack to clear it we kept standing to the northward with all the Sail we could set untill 12 oClock at night when fearing to Stand too far up this tack we tacked and stood to the Southward having run 6 Leagues North and NBE sence Sun set. We had not stood above 2 Miles to the SSE before it fell quite Calm, we both sounded now and several times in the night but had no ground with 140 fathoms of line. A little after 4 oClock the roaring of the Surf was plainly heard and at day break the vast foaming breakers presented were too plainly to be seen not a Mile from us towards which we found the Ship was carried by the waves surprisingly fast. We had at this time not an air of wind and the depth of water was unfathomable so that there was not a possibility of Anchoring, in this distressed situation we had nothing but Providence and our the small Assistance our boats could give us to trust to, the Pinnace was under a repair and could not immediatly be hoisted out, the Yawl was put into the water and the Long-boat hoisted out and both sent ahead to tow which together with the help of our sweeps abaft got the Ships head round to the northward which seem'd to be the only way to yet keep her off the reef or at least to delay time, before this was effected it was 6 oClock and we were not above 80 or 100 Yards from the breakers, the same Sea that washed the sides of the Ship rose in a breaker prodigiously high the very next time it did rise so that between us and distruction was only a dismal Vally the breadth of one wave - and even now no ground could be felt with 120 fathoms   the Pinnace was by this time patched up and hoisted out and sent ahead to tow; still we had hardly any hopes of saving the Ship and full as little our lives as we were full 10 Leagues from the nearest Land and the boats not sufficient to carry the whole of us yet in this truly terrible situation not one man ceased to do his utmost and that with as much calmness as if no danger had been near. All the dangers we had escaped were nothing little in comparison of being thrown upon this Reef where the Ship must be dashed to peices in a Moment, a Reef such a one as is here spoke of is scarcely known in Europe it is a wall of Coral Rock rising all most perpendicular out of the unfathomable Ocean always overflowen at high-water generally 7 or 8 feet and dry in places at Low-water, the large waves of the vast Ocean meeting with so sudden a resistance makes a most terrible surf breaking mountains high especially as in our case when the general trade wind blowes directly upon it. At this critical juncture when all our endeavours seem'd too little a small air of wind sprung up, but so small that at any other time in a Calm we should not have observed it, with this and the assistance of our boats we could observe the Ship to move off from the Reef in a slanting direction, but in less than 10 Minutes we had as flat a Calm as ever when our fears were again renewed for as yet we were not above 200 Yards from the breakers - soon after our friendly breeze Viseted us again and lasted about as long as before. A small opening was see now   seen in the Reef about a quarter of a Mile from us which I sent one of the Mates to examine, its breadth was not more than the length of the Ship but within was smooth water, into this place it was resolved to push her if possible haveing no other probable means Views to save her for we were still in the very jaws of distruction and it was a doubt whether or no we could reach this opening, however we soon got off it when to our surprise we found the Tide of Ebb gushing out like a Mill stream so that it was impossible to get in, we however took all the advantage possible of it and it carried us out about a 1/4 of a Mile from the breakers, but it was too narrow for us to keep in long, how ever what with the help of Ebb and our boats we by noon had got an offing of one and a half or two Miles yet we could hardly flater our selves with hopes of geting clear even if a breeze should spring up as we were by this time imbayed by the Reef and the Ship in spite of our endeavours driving before the Sea into the bight, the Ebb had been in our favour and we had reason to suppose the flood which was now making would be againest us  the only hopes we had was another opening we saw a bout a Mile to the Westward of us which I sent Lieutant Hick in the Small boat to examine   Latitude Observed 12°..37 St the Main land in sight distant about 10 Leagues 
            
      

        17 August 1770
        Friday 17th While Mr Hicks was examining the opening we strugled hard with the flood some time gaining a little and at other times looseing. At 2 oClock Mr Hicks returned with a favourable account of the opening.  it was immidiately resolved to try to secure the Ship in it, narrow and dangerous as it was it seem'd to be the only means we had of saving her as well as our selves. Abo a light breeze soon after sprung up at ENE which with the help of our boats and a flood tide we soon enter'd the opening and was hurried thro' in a short time by a rappid tide like a Mill race which kept us from driving againest either side tho the cannel was not more than a quarter of a Mile broad, we had however two boats ahead of us to direct us through, our depth of water in the Channell was from 30 to 7 fathom very erregular soundings and foul ground untill we had got quite within the Reef where we anchor'd in 19 fathom a Corally & Shelly bottom happy once more to incounter those shoals which but two days ago our utmost wishes were crowned by getting clear of, such are the vicissitudes attending this kind of service and must always attend an unknown Navigation: Was it not from the pleasure which naturly results to a Man from being the first discoverer, even was it nothing more than sands and Shoals, this service would be insuportable, especialy in far distant parts, like this, short of Provisions and almost also every other necessary. The world will hardly admit of an excuse for a man leaving a Coast he has unexplored he has once discover'd, if dangers are his excuse he is than charged with Timorousness and want of Perseverance and at once pronounced the unfitest man in the world to be employ'd as a discoverer   if on the other hand he boldly incounters all the dangers and obstacles he meets and his unfortunate enough not to succeed he is than charged with Temerity and want of conduct. The former of these aspersins cannot with Justice be laid to my charge and if I am fortunate enough to surmount all the dangers we may meet the latter will never be brought in question. I must own I have ingaged more among the Islands and shoals upon this Coast than may be thought with prudence I ought to have done with a single Ship and every other thing considered, but if I had not I should not have been able to give any better account of the one half of it than if we had never seen it, that is we should not have been able to say wether it consisted of main land or Islands and as to its produce, that we shouldmust have been totally ignorant of as being inseparable with the other I now came to a fix'd resolution to keep the Main land on board in our rout to the norward let the consequence be what it will, indeed now it was not adviseable to go without the reef, for by it we might be carried so far from the land Coast as not to be able to determine whether or no New Guinea joins to or makes a part of this land; this doubtfull point I had from my first coming upon the Coast determined if possible to clear up, but as I had lately experienced the ilconveniency of a boat under repair I intend to laying fast with the Ship tomorrow untill to have the Pinnace repaired and as I had no employ'd for the other boats I sent them all out in the morning to the reef to get such refreshments as they could find - Found the Variation by the Ampd and Azth to be 4°..9' East   At noon Latitude observed 12°-38' St Longitude in 216°..45' Wt the Main land extending from N 66° West to SWBS, distant off the nearest part 8 or 9 Leagues, the opening we came in by, which I have named Provdential Channell, bore ENE distant 10 or 12 Miles - On the Main land within us was a pretty high Promontory which I call'd Cape Weymouth, on the north side of the Cape is a Bay known by the same name / Latitude 12°..42', Longitude 217°.. 15' Wt / 
            
      

        18 August 1770
        Saturday 18th Gentle breezes at East and ESE - At 4 oClock in the PM the boats return'd from the reef with about 240 pounds of the meat of shell fish most of Cockles, some of which are as large as 2 Men can move and contain about 20 lbs of good meat   At 6 oClock in the Morning we got under sail and Stood away to the NW having two boats to derict us - our soundings were very erregular from 10 to 27 fathom varying 5 or 6 fathom almost every cast of the lead - A little before noon we passed a low small Sandy Isle which we left on our starboard side at the distance of 2 Miles, Mr Banks landed upon it and shott several small birds, call'd Nodies - At Noon our Latitude was 12°..28 being about 4 or 5 Leagues from the Main which extended from SBW to N 71° Wt and some Small Islands extending from N. 40° Wt to 54° Wt between us and the Main or outer Reef seen from the Mast head a way to the NE 
            
      

        19 August 1770
        Sunday 19th Gentle breezes at SEBE and clear weather   At 2 oClock in the PM as we were steering NWBN saw a large shoal right ahead extending 3 or 4 Points on each bow upon which we hauld up NNE and NEBN in order to get round the North Point of it which we reached by 4 oClock and than edged away to the westward and run between the north end of this shoals and a nother which lays 2 miles to the northward of it having a boat all the time ahead of the Ship sound.g our depth of water was very erregular from 22 to 8 fathoms  At 1/2 past 6 oClock we Anchor'd in 13 fathom, the northermost of the small Islands mentioned at Noon bore W1/2S distant 3 Miles, these Islands, which are known in the Chart by the name of Forbes's Isles, lay about 5 Leagues from the Main which here forms a moderatly high Point which we call'd Bolt head from which the land trends more westerly and is all low lSandy land but to the southward it is high and hilly even near the Sea. At 6 oClock in the AM we got again under sail and directed our Course for an Island which lay but a little way from the Main and bore from us at this time N.40° Wt distant 5 Leagues, but we were soon interrupted in our course by meeting with Shoals, but by the help of two Boats ahead and a good lookout at the Mast head we got at last into a fair Channel which lead us down to the Island having a very large shoal on our starboard side and several smaller ones betwixt us and the Main land, in this Channell we had from 20 to 30 fathom water - Between a 11 and 12 oClock we hauld round the NE side of the Island leaving it between us and the Main from which it is distant 7 or 8 Miles, this Island is about a League in circuit and of a Moderate height and is Inhabited; to the NW of it are several small low Islands and Keys which lay not far from the Main and to the northward and Eastward lay several other Islands and shoals so that we were now incompass'd on every side by one or the other, but so much does great danger Swallow up lesser ones that these once so much dreaded Shoals were now looke'd upon at with less concearn   The Boats being out of their stations we brought too to wait for them. At Noon our Latitude by observation was 12°.0' St Longitude in 217°..25 West depth of Water 14 fathom Course and distant saild reduce'd to a strait line sence yesterday Noon is N 29° West 32 Miles. 
         The Main land within the above Islands forms a point which I call Cape Grenville / Latde 11°..58', Longde 217°.38' / between this Cape and the Bolt head is a Bay which I named Temple Bay. E1/2N 9 Leagues from Cape Granvill lay some tolerable high Islands which I call'd Sr Charles Hardys Isles, those which lay off the Cape I named Cockburns Isles 
            
      

        20 August 1770
        Monday 20th Fresh breezes and ESE,   about one oClock the Pinnace having got ahead and the Yawl we took in tow, we fill'd and Steerd NBW for some small Islands we had in that direction, after aproaching them a little nearer we found them joind or connected together by a large Reef upon this we Edge'd away NW and left them a starboard steering between them and the Islands laying off the Main, having a fair and clear passage depth of water from 15 to 23 fm   At 4 oClock we discover'd some low Islands and Rocks bearing WNW which we stood directly for. At half past 6 oClock we Anchord on the NE side of the northermost in 16 fathom water distant from the Island one mile The Isles lay NW 4 Leagues from C. Granville, on these Isles we saw a good many Birds which occasioned my calling them Bird Isles
        Before and at sun set we could see the Main land which appear'd all very low and sandy extend as far to the Northward asNWBN, and some Shoals, Keys and low sandy Isles away to the NE of us -
        At 6 oClock in the Morning we got again under sail with a fresh breeze at East and stood away NNW for an some low Islands we saw in that diretion, but we had not stood on long upon this Course before we were obliged to haul close upon a wind in order to weather a Shoal which we discover'd on our Larboard bow, having at the same time two large others to the Eastward of us, By such time as we had weather'd the Shoal to Leeward we had brought the Islands well upon our Lee-bow, but seeing some shoals spit off from them and some Rocks on our starboard bow which we did not discover untill we were very near them, made me afraid to go to windward of the Islands, wherefore we brought too, and made the Signal for the Pinnace, which was a head to come on board, which done I sent her to leeward of the Islands with orders to keep along the Edge of the Shoal which spited off from the South side of the Southermost Island. The Yawl I sent to run over the Shoal to look for Turtle and appointed them a Signal to make in case they saw many, if not she was to meet us on the other side of the Island. As soon as the Pinnace had got a proper distance from us we wore and stood after her and run to Leeward of the Island where we took the Yawl in tow - she having seen only one small Turtle and therefore made no stay upon the Shoal   Upon this Island which is only a small spot of Sand with some trees upon it, we saw a good many hutts or habitations of the Natives which we supposed comes over from the Main to these Islds / from which they are distant about 5 Leagues / to Catch Turtle at the time these Animals come a Shore to lay their Eggs. Having got the yawl in tow we stood away after the Pinnace NNE and NBE to two other low Islands, having two shoals which we could see without us and one between us and the Main. At Noon we were about 4 Leagues from the Main Land which we could see extending to the Northward as far as NWBN all low flat and sandy, our Latitude by observation was 11° 23' St Longitude in 217°..46' West and Course and distance saild sence yesterday at Noon North 22° West 40 Miles - Soundings from 14 to 23 fathom, but these are best seen upon the Chart as likewise the Islands shoals &Ca which are too numerous to be mentioned singly 
            
      

        21 August 1770
        Tuesday 21st. Winds at EBS and ESE a fresh breeze. By one oClock we had run nearly the length of the southermost of the two Islands before mentioned and finding that we could not well go to windward of them without carrying us too far from the Main land we bore up and run to Leeward of them where we found a fair open passage this done we steer'd NBW in a Parallel direction with the Main land leaving a small Island between us and it and some low sandy Isles and shoals without us all of which we lost sight of by 4 oClock, neither did we see any more before the sun went down at which time the farthest part of the Main in sight bore NNW1/2W   soon after this we Anchord in 13 fathom soft ground about 5 Leagues from the land where we lay untill day light when we got again under sail, having first sent the Yawl ahead to sound, we steerd NNW by Compass from the northermost land in sight Variation 3°..6' East: Seeing no danger in our way we took the Yawl in tow and made all the Sail we could untill 8 oClock at which time we discoverd Shoals ahead and on our Larboard bow and saw that the Land northermost land which we had taken to be a part of the Main was an Island or Islands between which and the Main their appeared to be a good passage thro' which we might pass by runing to Leeward of the Shoals on our Larboard bow which was now pretty near us. whereupon we wore and brought too and sent away the Pinnace and yawl to direct us clear of the shoals and then stood after them. after having got round the SE point of the Shoal we steerd NW along the SW or inside of it keeping a good look out at the Mast head having another shoal on our Larboard side, but we found a good channell of a Mile broad between them wherein were from 10 to 14 fathoms water   At 11 oClock being nearly the Length of the Islands above mentioned and designing to pass between them and the Main, the Yawl being thrown a Stern by falling in upon a part of the shoal she could not get over we brought the Ship too and sent away the Long-boat / which we had a stern and rigg'd / to keep in shore upon our larboard bow and the Pinnace on the Starboard for all tho there appear'd to be nothing in the Passage yet I thought it necessary to take this method be cause we had a strong flood which carried us an end very fast, and it did not want much of high-water   As soon as the boats were ahead we stood after them and got through by noon at which time we were by observation in the Latitude of 10°..36'..30" St the nearest part of the Main, and which we soon after found to be the Northermost bore due west a little 2° southerly distand 3 or 4 Miles, the Islands which form'd the Passage before mentioned extending from North to N. 75° East distant 2 or 3 Miles - At the same time we saw Islands at a good distance off extending from NBW to WNW and behind them another chain of high land which we like wise Judge'd to be Islands, the Main land we thought extended as far as N 71° west but this we found to be Islands. The point of the Main which forms one side of the M Passage before mentioned and which we found is the Northern Promontary of this Country I have named York Cape in honour of His late Royal Highness the Duke of York. It lies in the Longitude of 218°..24' Wt the North point in ye Latde of 10°.37' S. & the Et point in 10°..41' S. The land over and to the Southward of this last point is rather low and very flat as far in land as the eye could rach and looks barren to the southward of the Cape the Shore forms a large open Bay which I called New Castle Bay wherein are some small low Islands and shoals and all the land about it is very low flat and sandy. The Land of the northern part of the Cape the land is rather more hilly and the shore forms some small Bays wherein there appear'd to be good anchorage, and the Vallies appear'd to be tolerably well Cloathed with wood; close to the East point of the Cape are Three small Islands and a small ledge of rocks spiting off from one of them there is also an Island lay close to the north Pt  the other Islands before spoke off forming the passage lay about 4 Miles without these, only Tow of them are of any extent, the Southermost is the largist and much higher than any part of the Main land, on the NW side of this Island seem'd to be good anchorage and Vallies that to all appearence would afford both wood and fresh water   These Isles are known in the Chart by the name of York Isles 
        to the Southward and SE of them and even to the Eastward and northward are several low Islands   Rocks and shoals - our depth of water in sailing between them and the Main was 12 . 13 & 14 fathoms 
            
      

        22 August 1770
        Wednesday 22d Gentle breezes at EBS and clear weather. We had not stood above 3 or 4 Miles along shore to the westward . before we discover'd the Land ahead to be Islands detach'd by several channells from the Main land, upon this we brought too to wait for the yawl and called the other boats on board, and after giving them proper Instructions sent them away again to lead us through the Channell next the Main, and as soon as the yawl was on board made sail with the Ship after them; soon after we discoverd Rocks, & shoals in this Channell upon which I made the Signal for the boats to lead through the next Channel to the Northward laying between the Islands which they accordingly did we following with the Ship and had not less than 5 fathom water and this was in the narrowest part of the Channell which was about a Mile and a half broad from Island to Island.   At 4 oClock we anchor'd about a Mile and a half or 2 Miles within the entrance in 61/2 fathom clear ground distant from the Islands on each side of us one mile, the Maind land extending away to the SW, the farthest point of which that we could see bore from us St 48° West and the South-wester-most point of the Islands on the NW side of the Passage bore St 76° West   between these two points we could see no land so that we were in great hopes that we had at last found out a Passage into the into the Indian seas, but in order to be better informd I landed with a party of Men accompan'd by Mr Banks and Dr Solander and land upon the Island which lies at the SE point of the Passage: before and after we landed Anchor'd we saw a number of People upon this Island arm'd in the same - manner as all the others we have seen except one man who had a bow and a bundle of Arrows   the first we have seen on this coast. from the appearence of these People we expected they would have opposed our landing but as we approached the Shore they all made off and left us in peaceable posession of as much of the Island as served our purpose. After landing I went upon the highest hill which however was of no great height, yet not less than twice or thrice the height of the Ships Mast heads but I could see from it no land between SW and WSW so that I did not doubt but there was a passage, I could see plainly that the Lands laying to the NW of this passage were composed of a number of Island of various extent both for height and circuit rainged one be hind a nother as far to the Northward and Westward as I could see which could not be less than 12 or 14 Leagues. Having satisfied myself of the great Probabillity of a Passage, thro' which I intend going with the Ship and therefor may land no more upon this Western Eastern coast of New Holland   and on the Western side I can make no new discovery the honour of which belongs to the Dutch Navigators and as such they may lay claim to it as their property but the Eastern Coast from the Latitude of 38° South down to this place I am confident was never seen or viseted by any European before us andtherefore by the same Rule belongs to great Brittan Notwithstand I had in the Name of his Majesty taken posession of several places upon this coast I now once more hoisted English Coulers and in the Name of His Majesty King George the Third took posession of the whole Eastern Coast from the above Latitude down to this place by the Name of New South Wales together with all the Bays, Harbours Rivers and Islands situate upon the same said coast   after which we fired three Volleys of small Arms which were Answerd by the like number by from the Ship   this done we set out for the Ship but were some time in geting on board on accout of a very rappid Ebb Tide which set NE out of the Passage away to the NE   ever sence we came in among the Shoals this last time we have found a Moderate Tide the Flood seting to the NW and Ebb to the SE. at this place it is High-water at the Full and Change of the Moon about 1 or 2 o'Clock and riseth and falls upon a perpendicular about 10 or 12 feet. We saw on all the Adjacent Lands and Islands a great number of smooks a certain sign that they are Inhabited and we have dayly seen smooks on every part of the coast we have lately been upon 

        Between 7 and 8 oClock in the Morning we saw several naked people, all or most of them women, down upon the beach picking up Shells, &Ca they had not a single rag of any kind of Cloathing upon them and both these and those we saw yesterday were in every respect the Same sort of people we have seen every where upon the Coast; two or three of the Men we saw Yesterday had on pretty large breast plates which we supposed were made of Pearl Oysters Shells this was a thing as well as the Bow and Arrows we had not seen before 

        At Low-water which happend about 10 oClock we got under sail and stood to the SW with a light breeze at East which afterwards veerd to NBE, having the Pinnace a head, depth of water from 6 to 10 fathom except in one place where we pass'd over a bank of 5 fathom 

        At Noon Posession Island at the SE entrance of the Passage bore N 53° East distant 4 Miles Leagues   the western extreme of the Main land in sight bore St 43° West distant 4 or 5 Leagues, being all exceeding low,  The SW point of the largest Island on the NW side of the Passage bore No 71° West distant 8 Miles this point I named Cape Cornwell / Latd 10°..43' S: Longde 219°..0 and some Low Islands laying about the Middle of the Passage which I call'd Wallice's Isles  bore WBS1/2S distt about 2 Leagues, our Latitude by Observation was 10°.46' South 

            

      

        23 August 1770
        Thursday 23d In the PM had little wind and variable with which and the Tide of Flood we Kept advancing to the WNW depth of Water 8, 7, 6 and 5 fathom At half an hour past one oClock the Pinnace which was ahead made the Signal for shoal water upon which we Tack'd and sent away the Yawl to sound also and then Tack'd again and stood after them with the Ship: Two hours after this they both at once made the Signal for having shoal water and it being now near High water I was afraid to stand on for fear of runing a ground at that time of the Tide - and therefore came to an Anchor in 1/4 less 7 fathom sandy ground. Wallice's Islands set at Noon bore SBW1/2W distant 5 or 6 Miles the Islands to the northward extending from St 73° East to N. 10° Et and a small Island just in sight bearing NW1/2W; here we found the flood Tide set to the westward and Ebb the Contrary   After we had come to anchor I sent away the Master with the Long boat to sound who upon his return in the evening reported that there was a bank stretching north and south upon which were 3 fathom water and behond it 7 fathom. We had it calm all night and untill 9 oClock in the Morning at which time we weigh'd with a light breeze at SSE and steer'd NWBW for the small Island above Mentioned having first sent the Boats ahead to sound; depth of water 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, and 3 fm when upon the Bank, it being now the last quarter Ebb, at this time the Most northermost Island we had in sight bore N 9° East, the SW point of the largest Island on the NW side of the passage , which point I nam'd Cape Cornwell bore East distant  two 3 Leagues and Wallace's  Isles bore So 3° East distant 3 Leagues; this bank at least so much as we sounded extends nearly North and South how far I cannot say, its breadth however is not more than a quarter or at most half a mile; being over the bank we deepen'd our water to a 1/4 less 7 fathom which depth we carried all the way to the small Island a head which we reached by Noon, at which time it bore South distant near half a Mile, depth of water 5 fathom, the most Northermost land we had in sight / being part of the same chain of Islands we have had to the northward of us sence we enterd the passage / bore N 71° East - Latd by in by observation 10°..33' St Longitude 219°..22' Wt In this situation we had no part of the Main Land in sight. Being now near the Island and having but little wind Mr Banks and I landed upon it and found it to be mostly a barren Rock frequented by birds such as Boobies a few of which we Shott and occasioned my giving it the Name of Booby Island. I made but avery short stay at this Island before I returnd to the Ship. in the mean time the wind had got to the SW and altho it blowed but very faint yet it was accompaned with a swell from the same quarter this together with other concuring circumstances left me no room to doubt but we were got to the NW of Car Westward of Carpentaria or the Northern extremety of New-Holland and had now an open Sea to the westward, which gave me no small satisfaction not only because the danger and fatigues of the Voyage was drawing near to and end, but by being able to prove that New-Holland and New-Guinea are 2 Seperate Lands or Islands, which to untill this day hath been a doubtful point with Geographers  The N.E. entrance of this Passage or Strait lies in the Latitude of 10°..27' So and in the Longitude of 218°..36  West from the Meridian of Greenwich. It is form'd by the Main of New-Holland, or the Northern extremety of New-Holland on the SE and by a Congeries of Islands to the NW which I Named Prince of Wales's Islandswhich last It is very Probable that these Islands extend quite to New-Guinea they are of Various extend both for height and circuit and many of them seem'd to be indifferently well cloathed with wood &Ca and from the smooks we saw upon some if not all of them must be inhabited. It is also very probable that among these Islands are as good if not better passages than the one we have come thro', altho one need hardly wish for a better was the Access to it from the Eastward less dangerous, but this difficulty will remain untill some better way is found out than the one we came, which no doubt by may be done was it ever to become an object to be look'd for; the Northern extent of the Main or outer Reef which limets or bounds the Shoals to the Eastward seems to be the only thing wanting to clear up this point, and this was a thing I had neither time nor inclination to go about having been already sufficiently harrass'd with dangers without going to look for more 
        This passage, which I have named Endeavours Straights after the name of the Ship. It  is in length NE and SW 7 l0 Leagues and about 45 leagues broad, except at the NE and entrance where it is only 2 Miles broad by reason of several small Islands which lay there, one of which call'd Posession Island which is of a moderate height and circuit this we left between us and the Main, passing between it and two small round Islands which lay NW 2 Miles from it, there are also two small low Islands call'd Wallice's Isles - laying in the Middle of the S.W. entrance which we left to the Southward, the depth of water we found in the Straight was from 4 to 9 fathom every where good anchorage; only about 2 Leagues to the northward of the I Wallice's Islands above mentioned is a Bank whereon is not more than three fathom at low-water, but probably there might be found more was it sought for  I have not been particular in discribing this Strait no more than I have been in pointing out the respective situations of the Islands Shoals &Caon the eastern coast of New Wales of New Holland, for these I refer to the Chart, where they are delineated with all the Accuracy that circumstances would admit of; with respect to the Shoals that lay upon this Coast I must observe for the benifit of those who may come after me, that I do not beleive the one half of them are laid down in my chart, for it would be obsurd to suppose that we could see or find all all the above one half them all, and the same thing may in some measure be said of the Islands especially about between the Latitude of 20° & 22° - where we saw Islands out at Sea as far as we could distinguish any thing. However take the Chart in general and I beleive it will be found to contain as few errors as most Sea Charts which have not undergone a thorough correction, the Latitude and Longitude of all or most of the principal head lands. Bays &Ca may be relied on, for we seldom faild of geting an Observation every day to correct our Latitude by and the observation for fixing Settleing the Longitude were no less numberous and made as often as the Sun and Moon came in play, so that it was impossible for any material error to creep into our reckoning in the intermidiate times. In justice to Mr Green I must say that he was Indefatigable in making and calculating these observations which otherwise must have taken up a great deal of my time, which I could not at all times very well spare. Not only this, but by his Instructions several of the Petty officers can make and Calculate these observations almost as well as himself: it is only by such means that this method of finding the Longitude at Sea can be put into universal practice, a method that we have generally found may be depended upon to within half a degree; which is a degree of accuracy more than Sufficient for all Nautical purposes. Would Sea officers once apply themselves to the makeing and calculating these observations they would not find them so very difficult as they at first imagine, especially with the help assistance of the Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris by the help of which the calculations for finding the Longde takes up but little more time than that of an Azimuth for find the Varin of the compass but unless this Ephemeris is publishd for some time to come more than either one or two Years it can never be of general use in long Voyages, and in short Voyages its not so much wanting; without it the Calculations are laborious and discouraging to beginers and such as are not well Vers'd in these kind of calculations 

        24 August 1770
        Friday 24th In the PM had light Airs from the SSW with which, after leaving Booby Island as before mentioned, we Steer'd WNW untill 5 oClock when it fell calm and the Tide of Ebb which sets to the NE soon after makeing we Anchor'd in 8 fathom soft sandy bottom, Booby Island bearing So 50° East distant 5 Miles, the Islands to the Northward of Prince of Wales Isles, extending from NEBN to So 55° East; there appeard to be an open clear Passage between these Islands extending from N 64° Et to EBN. At half an hour past 5 in the Morning, in purchasing the Anchor the Cable parted about 8 or 10 fathoms from the Anchor. I emmediately order'd another Anchor to be let go which brought the Ship up before she had drove a Cables length from the Buoy, after this we carried out a Kedge and warped the ship nearer it and than endeavour'd to sweep the Anchor with a Hawser but miss'd it and broke away the Buoy rope; we made several Attempts afterwards but did not succeed, while the Boats were thus employd we hove up the Kedge Anchor it being of no more use  At Noon Latitude obserd 10°..30' St Winds at NE a fresh breeze, the Flood Tide here come from the same quarter 
            
      

        25 August 1770
        Saturday 25th Winds at NE and ENE a gentle breeze   Being resolve'd not the to leave the Anchor behind while there remaind the least probabillity of geting of it; After dinner I sent the Boats again to sweep for it first with a small line which succeeded, and now we know'd where it lay we found it no very hard matter to sweep it with a hawser,   this done we hove the Ship up to it by the same hawser but just as it was allmost up and down the Hawser slip'd and left us all to do over again   by this time it was dark and obliged us to leave of untill day light in the Morning when we Sweep'd it again and hove it up to the bows, and by 8 oClock weigh'd the other Anchor, got under sail and stood away NW having a fresh breeze at ENE. At Noon we were by observation in the Latitude of 10°..18' St Longde 219°..39' Wt having no land in sight but about 2 Miles to the Southward of us lay a Shoal on which the Sea broke and I beleive a part of it drys at Low-water it extended NW and SE and might be about 4 or 5 Leagues in circuit - depth of water at this time and sence we weigh'd 9 fathom 
            
      

        26 August 1770
        Sunday 26th Fresh breezes at East. In standing to the NW we began to Shoalden our water from 9 to 7 fathom, and at half past one o'Clock having run 11 Miles sence noon the boat which was ahead made the signal for shoal water, immediatly upon which we let go an Anchor and brought the Ship up with the sails standing as the boat was but a little way having but just releived the crew and at the same time we saw from the Ship shoal water in a manner all round us and both wind and Tide seting upon it   we lay in 6 fathom with the Ship but upon sounding about the Ship we her found hardly 2 fathom water avery rocky bottom not much above half a Cables length from us from the East round by the North and West as far as SW, so that there was no way to get clear but the way we came: This was one of the many fortunate escapes we have had from Ship wreck for it was near high-water and there run on he a short cockling sea that would soon have beat bulged the Ship to had she struck, these shoals that lay a fathom or 2 fathm under water are the most dangerous of any for they do not shew themselves untill you are close upon them and than the water upon them looks brown like ye refection of dark Clowds   Between 3 and 4 oClock the Ebb began to make when I sent the Master to sound to the South ward and SW ward and in the Mean time as the Ship tended hove up the anchor and with a little sail stood to the southward and afterwards edged away to the west ward and got once more out of danger where at sun set we anchord in a 10 fm water sandy bottom having a fresh of wind at ESE At 6 oClock in the Morning we weighd and Stood west with a fresh of wind at East, having first sent a boat ahead to sound. I did intend to have steer'd NW untill we had made the South Coast of New Guinea, designing if Possible to touch upon that Coast, but the meeting with these Shoals last night made me alter the Course to west in hopes of meeting with fewer dangers and deeper water and this we found for by Noon we had deepen'd our water gradually from 10 to 17 fathom and this time we were by observation in the Latitude of 10° 10' South, Longde 220°..192' West Course and distance sail'd sence yesterday at Noon N.76° Wt a 11 Leagues - No land in sight 
            
      

        27 August 1770
        Monday 27th Fresh breezes between the EBN and ESE with which we steerd west untill sun set, depth of water from 27 to 23 fathom. We now reef'd the Topsails shortend sail and hoisted in the Pinnace and Long-boat up along side and afterwards kept upon awind all night under our Topsails, 4 hours on one tack and 4 on the other depth of water 25 fathom very even Soundings. At Day light made all the Sail we could and Steerd WNW, untill 8 o'Clok than NW. At Noon we were by Observation in the Latitude of 9°..56' St Longitude 221°..00' West. Variation 2°..30' East - Course and Distance saild sence yesterday at Noon, N. 73°..30' West 49 Miles 
            
      

        28 August 1770
        Tuesday 28th Fresh breezes at Et and EBS and fair weather Continued a NW Course untill sun Set at which time we had L Shortend sail and hauld close upon a wind to the Northward, depth of water at this time 21 fathom  At 8 Tack'd and Stood to the Southward untill 12, than Stood to the Northward under little sail untill day light - Sounding from 25 to 17 fathom, Shoaldening as we stood to the northward,   At this time we made sail and steer'd North in order to make the land of New-Guinea; from the time of our makeing sail untill Noon the depth of water gradually decreased from 17 to 12 fathom a stoney and shelly bottom; We were now by observation in the Latitude of 8°..52' St which is in the same Parallell as the southern parts of New-Guinea as it is laid down in the Charts but there are only two points so far to the South and I reckon that we are a Degree to the westward of both and for that reason do not see the land which trends more to the northward. Our Course and distance saild sence Yesterday is NNW, 69 Miles Longitude in 221°..27' West. The Sea in many places is here cover'd with a kind of a brown scum, such as Sa[i]lors generally call spawn, upon our first seeing it, it alarm'd us thinking that we were among Shoals, but we found the same depth of Water where it was as in other places. Neither Mr Banks nor Dr Solander could tell what it was altho they had of it to examine 
            
      

        29 August 1770
        Wednesday 29th Continued standing to the northward with a fresh gale at EBS, and SE untill 6 oClock having Very errigular and uncertain soundings from 24 to 7 fathom - At 4 oClock we made the Land from the Mast head bearing NWBN and which appeard to be very low - at 6 it extended from WNW to NNE distant 4 or 5 Leagues, at this time hauld close upon awind to the Eastward untill 7 oClock than Tack'd and stood to the southward untill 12 at which time we wore and stood to the Northward untill 4 than lay her head off untill day-light when we again saw the land and stood in NNW directly for it haveing a fresh gale at EBS. Our Soundings in the night were from 17 to 5 fathom very erregular without any sort of rule with respect to the Land to our distance from the land - At 1/2 an hour past 6 oClock a small low Island laying about a League from the Main bore NBW distant 5 Miles, this Island lies in the Latitude of 8°.13' St Longde 221°..25' West. I find it laid down in the Charts by the name of St Bartholomeo or Wleermoysen. We now steer'd NWBW, WNW, WBN, WBS and SWBW as we found the land to lay, having a boat ahead of the Ship sounding depth of water from 5 to 9 fathom - when in 7, 8 and 9 fathom we could but just see the land from the deck, but I did not think we were at Most above 4 Leagues off because the land is exceeding low and level and appear'd to be well cover'd with wood, one sort appear'd to us to be Cocoa-nutt trees. By the Smooks we saw in different parts as we run along shore we were assured that the Country is in habited - At Noon we were about 3 Leagues from the land, the westermost part of which that we could see bore St 79° Wt.   our Latitude by observation was 8°..19' St Longitude 221°..44' West. The Island St Bartholmeo bore Nt 74° East distant 20 Mile 
            
      

        30 August 1770
        Thursday 30th Fresh breezes at SE, ESE and EBS.   after steering SWBW 6 Miles we discoverd on our Star [board] bow and a head a strong appearence of shoal water and by this time we had shoalden our water from 5 to 10 to 5 fathom, upon which I made the Pinnace's signl to edge down to it, but she not going far enough we sent the Yawl to sound in it and at the same time hauld off close upon awind with the Ship untill 4 o'Clock at which time we had run Six Miles, but did not depen our water any thing, we then edge'd away SW 4 Miles more, but finding Still Shoal  water we brought too and call'd the Boats on board by signal and hoisted them in and than hauld off close upon a wind, being at this time about 3 or 4 Leagues from the land. The Yawl found only three fathom water in the place where I sent her to sound which place we weather'd about half a mile. Between one and two oClock we pass'd a Bay or Inlet, before which lies a small Island that seems to shelter it from the Southerly winds, but I very much doubt there being water be hind it for Shipping,   I could not attempt it because the SE Trade wind blows right in, and we have not as yet had any land breezes to bring a Ship out 
        We stretched off to Sea untill 12 oClock at which time we were 10 or 11 Leagues from the land and had depen'd our water to 29 fathom, we now tack'd and stood in untill 5 o'C o'Clock, when being in 61/2 fathom water we tack'd and lay her head off untill day light   At which time we saw the land bearing NWBW distant about 4 Leagues,   we now made sail and Steer'd WSW and then WBS, but coming into 51/2 fm we hauld off SW untill we depend our water to 8 fm we than kept away WBS and West having 9 fm water and the land just in sight from the deck which we judge'd not to [be] above 3 or 4 Leagues off as it is everywhere exceeding low - At Noon we were by observation in the Latitude of 8°..38' St Longde 22°2..34' west,   St Bartholomeo Isle bore N. 69° East distt 74 Ms 
            
      

        31 August 1770
        Friday 31st Between 12 and 1 in the PM steerd WNW in which time we shoalen'd our water from 8 to 51/2 fathoms, which I thought was little enough and therefore kept away away again west and soon depen'd to 7 fathom, which depth we kept untill 6 o'Clock having the Land just in sight from the deck - At this time the western extreme bore North distant about 4 Leagues and Seem'd to end in a point and Turn away to the northward, We took it to be Point St Augustine or Walsche Caep / Latitude 8°..24' St Longde 22°2..55' Wt. We now shortend sail and hauld of SSW and SBW having the wind at SE and SEBE a gentle breeze   we stood off 16 miles having from 7 to 27 fathom deepening gradually as we run off - At Midnight we Tack'd and stood in untill daylight, at which time we could see no land and yet we had only 51/2 fathom water. We now steered NW having the same depth of water untill near 9 oClock when we began to deepen our water from to 61/2 and 7 fathom, by this I thought that we were far enough to the westward of the Cape and might haul to the northward with safety which we now did having the wind at NEBE a light breeze
        by noon we had increased our water to 9 fathom and were by observation in the Latitude of 8°..10' St which was 10 Miles to the Northward of that given by the Log by which I conjecter'd that we had met with a strong Current seting round the Cape not only to the Northward but to the Westward also, otherwise we ought to have seen the land which we did not
            
      

        1 September 1770
        Saturday 1st In the PM and most part of the night had a fresh [breeze] from the SE with which we kept standing in for the land NE and ENE Close upon awind untill half an hour past 6 o'Clock, when we anchor'd in 41/2 fathom water a Soft Muddy bottom as we have every where found upon the Coast, about an hour before we Anchord we saw the land from the Mast head extending from EBN to SSE all very low. At the time we Anchor'd we found a small drean of a Tide Seting away to the NW which continued untill 2 oClock in the Morning   when the water had fell 9 feet or better: this Tide of Ebb was than succeeded by the Flood which came from the SW, yet we did not find the water to rise much upon a perpendicular or else the greatest fall of the Tide had not been well at attended to in the night for at 6 oClock when we got under sail we had no more than 3 fathom under the Ship and yet we could not see the land from the deck - After getting under sail we stood to the northward with a light breeze at East and deepen'd our water by noon to 10 fathom, having the land just in sight from the Mast head to the SE.
        [NB: uncorrected against MS ] At this time were in the Latitude of 7°..39' St Longitude 222°..42' West Pt St Augustine bore S 10° W dist 15 Leagues
            
      

        2 September 1770
        Sunday 2nd. In the PM had it calm untill 2 oClock, when a light breeze sprung up at NBE and we stood in for the Land EBN untill 5 oClock, at which time we got the wind from the SW a light breeze with which we steer'd NE edgeing in for the land, having it in sight from the deck and which I judged to be about 3 or 4 Leagues off being all very low-Land. Found the Variation to be 2°34' East and a little before 8 oClock having but little wind we Anchord in 7 fathom water a soft Muddy bottom. In the After-noon and Evening we saw several Sea Snakes some of which the People in the Boat along side took up by hand. At Day light in the Mor[n]ing we got under sail and Stood away to the NNE having a fresh gale at East, which by Noon brought us into the Latitude of 7°14 S, Longd 222°30' W. Depth of water 13 fathom. Course and distance sailed sence yesterday Noon is N 24° East 27 miles, having at this time no land in sight for the land according to the Charts trends more Easterly than the wind would permit us to sail.
            
      

        3 September 1770
        MONDAY 3rd. Steer'd NBE with a fresh breeze at EBN untill 7 oClock in the evening when the wind came to SEBS, with which we kept standing to the Eastward close upon a wind all night having from 17 to 10 fathom Water pretty even soundings    At Day light we saw the Land extending from NBE to SE, distant about 4 Leagues. We still kept stand[in]g in for the land having the advantage of a fresh gale at ESE and EBS untill near 9 oClock when being about 3 or 4 Miles from offthe land and in 3 fathom water we brought too and I went a shore in the Pinnace accompaned by Mr Banks and Dr Solander having a mind to land once in this Country before we quit it altogether which I now am determined to do without delay for I found that it was is only spending time to little purpose and carrying us far out of our way staying upon this coast which is so shallow that we can hardly keep within sight of land. At the time we put off from the Ship we saw not the least sign of Inhabitants, but we had no sooner landed than we saw the print of Mens feet fresh upon the Sand and a little way farther we found a small shade or hutt about which lay green shells of Co coa-nutts by this we were well assured that the Inhabitants were not far off   Nay we thought we heard their Voices in the woods which were so close and thick that we did not think it safe to venture in for fear of an ambuscade as we had only a boats crew with us  apart of which was left to look after the boat which lay above a 1/4 of a Mile from the shore,   we therefore took a walk along the Sea beach but had not gone above 200 Yards before we were attacked by 3 or 4 Men who came out of the woods alittle before us  but upon our immidiatly fireing upon them they retired; finding that we could not search the Country with any degree of safety, we returnd to the boat and was follow'd by 60 or as some thought about 100 of the natives who had advance'd in small parties out of the woods but they suffer'd us to go to our boat without giving us any trouble, we had now time to View them Attentively, we thought them to be about the Size and Colour of the New-Hollanders with short crop'd hair and quite naked like them - I thought these of a lighter Colour but that might be owing to a whitish Pigment with which we thought their bodies were painted because some appear'd darker than others, their Arms were ordinary darts about 4 feet long made of a kind of Reed and pointd at one end with hard wood; but what appear'd most extraordinary to us was something they had which caused a flash of fire or smook very much like the going off of a Pistol or sml Gun but without any report, the deception was so great that the People in the Ship actualy thought that they had fire arms, indeed they seem'd to use these things in imitation of such for the moment the first man we saw made his appearence he fired off one of these things and while we lay looking at them in the boat, 4 or 5 would let them off all at once which had all the appearences in the world of Volleys of Small Arms, but I am confident that nothing came from them but smook, but by what means this was done or what purpose it answer'd we were not able to guess   I thought the Combustible matter was containd in a Reed or peice of small Bamboo which they gave a swing round in the hand and caused it to go off.  This place lies in the Latitude of 6°..15' St, about 65 Leagues to the N.E of Pt S. Augustino or Walsche Caep, and is near to what is call'd in the Charts by the long name ofC. de la Colta de Sa Bonaventura. The land is very low like every other part of the Coast we have seen, here it is thick and Luxuriously cloathed with Woods and Verdure all of which appear green and flourishing; here were Cocoa-nutt Trees, Bread fruit Trees and Plantain trees, but we saw no fruit but on the former and these were small and green; the other trees, shrubs, plants &Ca were like wise such as is common in the South-Sea Islands and in New-Holland. Upon my return to the Ship we hoisted in the boat and made sail to the Westward with a design to leave the Coast altogether to the no small satisfaction of I beleive the Major part of ye Ships companythis however it was contrary to the inclination and opinion of some of the officers who would have had me send a party of men a shore to cut down the Cocoa-nutt Trees for the sake of the Nutts  a thing that I think no man leiving could have justified, for as the Natives had attack'd us for meer landing without takeing away any one thing, certainly they would have made a vigorous effort to have defended their property in which case many of them must have been kill'd and perhaps some of our own people too  and all this for 2 o[r] 300 green Cocoa-nutts which when we had got them would have done us little service besides nothing but the u[t]most necessity would have oblige'd me to have taken this Method to come at refreshments  its true I might have proceeded farther a long the Coast to the northward and westward untill we had found a place where the Ship could lay so near the shore as to cover the people with her guns when landed but it is very probable that before we had found such a place - we should have been carried so far to the West as to have been obliged to have gone to Batavi by the way of the Moluccas and on the North side of Java where we were all utter strangers    this I did not think was so Safe a Passage  as to go to the South of Java and through the Straights of Sunda - the way I propose to my self to go; besides as the ship is leaky we are not yet sure whether or no we shall not be obliged to heave her down at Batavi, in this case it be comes the more necessary that we should make the best of our way to that place, especially as no new discovery can be expected to be made in those seas which the Dutch have I beleive long ago narrowly examined, as appears from 3 Maps bound up with the French History of Voyages to the Terra Australis, published in 1756, which Maps I do suppose by some means have been got from the Dutch as we find the names of many of the places are in that Language. It should likewise seem from the same Maps that the Spaniards and Dutch have at one time or a nother circumnavigated the whole of the Island of New Guinea as the most of the names are in these two Languages, and such part of the Coast as we have been were upon I found the Chart tolerable good which obliges me to give some Credit to all the rest notwithstanding we neither know by whome or when they were taken, and I allways understood before I had a sight of these Maps that it was unknown whether or no New-Holland and New-Guinea was not one continued land, and so it is a said in the very History of Voyages these Maps are bountd up in; however we have now put this wholy out of dispute but as I beleive it was known before tho' not publickly I clame no other merit than the clearing up of a doubtfull point. A nother doubtfull point I should liked to have clear'd up altho it is of very little if of any concequence which is whether or no the Natives of New-Holland and those of New-Guinea are or were original one People which one might well suppose as these two Countries lay so near to each other and the intermediate space fill'd up with Islands   on the other hand if these Two People have or ever had any friendly communication with each other it seems strange as I have before observed that they should not have transplanted from New-Guinea over to New Holland, Cocoa-nutts. Bread fruit, Plantains &Ca &Caall very usefull Articles for the support of man that we never saw grow in the latter and which we have now seen in the former   La Maire hath given us a Vocabulary of words spoke by the people of New-Brittain / which before Dampiers time was taken to be a part of New Guinea / by which it appears that the people of New-brittain speak a very different Language from those of New-Holland. Now should it be found that the Natives of New-Holland Britain and those of New Guiney have had one Origin and speake the same Language, it will follow of Course that the New-Hollanders are a different people from both 
            
      

        4 September 1770
        Tuesday  4th Stood to the westward all this Day having at first a Moderate breeze Southerly which afterwards freshen'd and Veer'd to SE and ESE, We kept in sounding all the time having from 14 to 30 fathom, not regular but some times more and some times less. At Noon we were in 14 fathom and by observation in the Latitude of 6°..44' St Longitude 223°..51' West, Course and Distance Saild sence yesterday Noon St 76° west. 120 Miles 
            
      

        5  September 1770
        Wednesday 5th Winds at EBS and SEBE a fresh gale and clear weather, with which we run 118 Miles upon a S 69°..15' west Course, which at Noon brought us into the Latitude of 7°..25' St Longitude 225°..41' West, depth of water 28 fathoms, having been in soundings the whole of this Days run generaly between 10 and 20 fathoms. At half an hour past one in the Morning we past by a small low Island which bore from us at that time NNW distant 3 or 4 Miles, depth of water 14 fathom, and at Day light we discover'd another low - Island extending from NNW to NNE distant 2 or 3 Leagues,   I beleive I should have landed upon this Island to have known its produce as it did not appear to be very small had not the wind blown too fresh for such an undertaking and at the time we pass'd the Island we had only 10 fathom water a rocky bottom, I was therefore afraid of runing down to leeward for fear of meeting with shoald water and foul ground - As These Islands have no proper place in the Charts unless they are the Arrow Isles, which if they are they are laid down much too far from New-Guiney    I found the South part of these to lay in the Latde 7°..6' St Longde 225°..0' West 
            
      

        6  September 1770
        Thursday 6th A Steady fresh gale at EBS and clear weather, with which we steerd WSW   At 7 oClock in the evening, we took in the small Sails, Reef'd the Top sails and sounded having 50 fathom water.   we still kept WSW all night going at the rate of 41/2 Miles an hour, at 10 oClock had 37 42 fm 11 oClock 45 37, 12 oClock 45, 1 oClock 49 and at 3 oClock 120 fathom after which we could get no ground. In the Evening we caught 2 Boobies which settled upon the rigging and these wre were the first of these Birds we have caught in this Manner the Voyage, Altho I have heard of them being caught this way in great numbers. At day light in the Morning we made all the sail we could and at 10 o'Clock saw land extending from NNW to WBN distant 5 or 6 Leagues - At Noon it bore from North to west and about the same distance, our Latitude by observation was 8°.15' St Longde 227°-47' Wt    This Land is of an even and moderate height and by our run from New Guinea ought to be a part of the Arow Isles, but it lays a Degree farther to the South than any of these Islands are laid down in the Charts. We sounded but had no ground with 50 fathoms of line 
            
      

        7  September 1770
        Friday 7th As I was not able to satisfy myself from any Chart what land it was we saw to Leeward of us and fearing that it might trend away more Southerly and the weather being hazey so that we could not see far, we steerd SW which Course by 4 oClock run us out of sight of the land    by this I was assured that no part of it lay to the Southward of 8°..15' So. We continued standing to the SW all night under an easy sail having the Advantage of a fresh gale at SEBE and ESE and clear Moon light,    we sounded every hour but had no bottom with 100 and 120 fathoms of line. At Day light in the Morning we steerd WSW and after wards WBS, which by Noon brought us into the Latitude of 9°..30' St and Longde 229°..34' West and by our Run from New-Holland Guinea ought to have been within sight of Wessels Isle which according to the Charts is laid down about 20 or 25 Leagues from the Coast of New-Holland  but we saw nothing by which I conclude that it is wrong laid down and this is not to be wonderd at when we consider that not only these Islands but the lands which bounds this sea have been discover'd and explor'd by different people and at different times and compiled and put together by others, perhaps some ages after the first discoveries were made. Navigators formerly wanted many of the helps to wards keeping an accurate Journal which the present Age is possess'd of, it is not they that are wholy to blame for the faultiness of the Charts, but the Compilers and Publishers, who publish to the world the rude sketches of the Navigator as accurate surveys without telling what authority they have for so doing, for were they to do this we should be than be as good or better judges than they and know where to depend upon the Charts and where not. Neither can I clear Seamen of this fault among the few I have known who are Capable of drawing a Chart orof sketch of a Sea Coast     I have generally, nay almost always observed them run into this error,  I have known them lay down the line of a Coast they never have seen and put down soundings where they never have sounded and after all are so fond of their performences as to pass'd the whole off as sterling under the Title of a Survey Plan &Ca These things must in time be attended with bad concequences and can not fail of bringing the whole of their works into disrepute; If he is so modest as to say such and such parts or the whole of his Plan is difective, the publishers or venders will have it left out because they say it hurts the sale of the work so that between the one and the other we can hardly tell when we are posessed of a good Sea Chart untill we our selves have proved it 
            
      

        8  September 1770
        Saturday 8th Winds Easterly with a high Sea from the same quarter - Our Course and distance saild this 24 hours is St 86°..30' West 102 miles - Latitude in 9°..36' St Longitude 231° 17' West
            
      

        9  September 1770
        Sunday 9th Light Airs and clear weather the Most part of this 24 hours - In the Evening found the Variation by several Azimuths to be 0°..12' West and by the Ampde 0°..5' West  At Noon we were by Observation in the Latitude of 9°..46' St Longde 232°..7' West Course and distance sail'd sence yesterday Noon St 78°..45' S Wt 52 Miles. For these Two Days past we have steer'd due west and yet we have by observation made 16 Miles southing  6 Miles yesterday and 10 to Day  from which it should seem that there is a Current seting to the Southward and westward withall as I should suppose 
            
      

        10  September 1770
        Monday 10th Light Airs Easterly, except in the morning when we had it at North - At Sun set found the Variation to be 0°..2' West, at the same time saw, or thought we saw very high Land bearing NW and in the Morning saw the same appearences of Land in the same quarter which left us no room to doubt but what it was Land, and must be either the Island of Timor land or Timor, but which of the two I cannot as yet determine - At Noon we were by observation in the Latitude of 10°..1' St which was 15 Miles to the Southward of that given by the Log - Longitude in pr observation 233°..27' West 
            
      

        11  September 1770
        Tuesday 11th Variable Light airs and clear weather. Steerd NW in order [to] discover the Land planer untill 4 oClock in the Morn-g at which time the wind came to NW and west with which we stood to the southward untill 9 oClock when we Tack'd and stood NW having the wind at WSW - At sun rise in the Morning we could see the land extend from WNW to NE - At Noon we could see it extend to the west-ward as far as WBS1/2S, but no further to the Eastward than NBE, we were yet now well assured that this was part of the Island of Timor. in concequence of which the last Island we saw must have been Timor land the south part of which lies in the Latitude of 8°..15' St Longitude 228°..10' West, whereas in the Charts the South pointat is laid down in Latitude 9°..30'.   It is possible that the Land we saw might be some other Island, but than I cannot See how we could have miss'd seeing Timor land supposeing it to be right laid down in Latitude as we never kept were to the Southward of 9°..30', for my design was to have made that Island and to have Landed upon it to have seen what it produced at [sic] it is / according to the Charts / a large Island and not settled by the Dutch that I ever heard off 
        We were now in the Latitude of 9°.. 37' Wt Longitude 233°..54' Wt by observation of the Sun and Moon, and yester[day] we were by Observation in 233°..27' Wt the difference is 27' which is exactly the same as what the Log gave. Thus however is a degree of accuracy in observation that is seldom to be expected 
            
      

        12  September 1770
        Wednesday 12th Winds between the S & Wt a light breeze and clear weather. In the PM stood in shore untill 8 oClock than Tack'd and Stood off being about 3 or 4 Leagues from the Land, which at dark extend[ed] from SW1/2W to NE, at this time we Sounded and had no ground with 140 fathoms of line being not above 4 Leagues from the Land. At 12 oClock we Tack'd and Stood in having but little wind and continued so untill Noon   At which time we were by observation in Latitude 9°..36' So the Log this 24 hours gave 18 Miles westing but it did not appear by the Land that we had made so much. We saw several smooks upon the Land by Day and fires in the Night
            
      

        13  September 1770
        Thursday 13th Stood in shore with a light breeze at SBW untill 1/2 past 5 o'Clock in the PM, when being a mile and a half from the Shore and in 16 fathom water, we tack'd and Stood off; at this time the extremes of the Land extended from NEBE to WBS1/2S this last was a low point distant from us about 3 Leagues. We were right before a small creek or Inlet into the Low-land which lies in the Latitude of 9°..34' St    Probably it might be the same as Dampier whent into in his boat for it did not seem to have depth of water sufficient for any thing else.    In standing in shore we sounded Several times, but found no Soundings untill we got within 21/2 Miles of the shore, where we had 25 fathom a soft bottom - We stood off Shore untill 12 oClock with the wind at South, than Tack'd and Stood to the westward 2 hours, when the Wind Veer'd to the SW and WSW and than we stood to the Southward - In the Morning found the Variation to be 1°..10' Wt by the Ampd and by the Azimuth 1°.27' Wt   At Noon we were by observation in the Latitude of 9°..45' So Longitude 234°..12' West, and about 6 or 7 Leagues from the Land which extended from No 31° Et to WSW1/2W  Winds at SSW a Gentle breeze 
            
      

        14  September 1770
        Friday 14th Light Land and Sea breezes the former we had from the WBN and only a few hours in the Morning, the latter we had from the SSW and South. With these winds we advanced but slowly to the west ward. At Noon we were about 6 or 7 Leags from the Land which extended from NBE to S.78° West our Latitude by observation was 9°..54' St Course and distance Saild sence yester noon St 68° Wt 24' Miles. We saw several smookes a shore in the PM and fires in the night, both upon the Low-land and up in the Mountains 
            
      

        15  September 1770
        Saturday 15th In the PM had the Sea breeze at SSW and South with which we stood to the westward untill 8 oClock, when being about 3 Leagues from the Land and having very little wind we tack'd and lay her head off shore    At 11 oClock we got the Land wind at North by west with which we steer'd SWBW along shore keeping about 4 or 5 Miles from the land on which in the Morning we saw several houses, Plantations &Ca At 9 oClock we got the wind at NEBE a light breeze At Noon we were about 2 Leagues from the land which extended as far to the Southward as SWBW our Latitude by observation was 10°.1' St Course and distance Saild sence yesterday at noon St 78°..45' Wt 36 miles
            
      

        16  September 1770
        Sunday 16th Light breezes from the NEBE with Clear weather, except in the Morning when we had it clowdy with a few small showers of Rain. Steerd along shore SW and SWBW untill 6 oClock in the Morning when we Steerd WSW and at 9 oClock west at which time we saw the Island Rotte right ahead At Noon we were in the Latitude of 10°..39' St Longde 235°.57' the South end of Timor bore NNW distant 5 or 6 Leagues the Island of Rotte extending from St 75° Wt to No 67' West and the Island of Anaboa as Dampier calls it, or Seman as it is call'd in the Charts which lies off the South end of Timor bore NW. Course and distance Saild sence yesterday Noon St 55° 15' Wt 67 Miles 
        Dampier who has given us a large and so far as I know an Accurate description of this Island of Timor, says that it is seventy leagues long and sixteen broad and that it lies nearly NE and SW. I found the East side to lie nearest NEBE and SWBW and the South end to lie in the Latitude of 10°.23' St Longitude 236°..5' West from Greenwich 
        We run about 45 Leagues along the East side which I observed to be free from danger, and excepting near the South end the Land which bounds the Sea is low for 2, 3 or 4 Miles inland and seem'd in many places to be intersected with salt Creeks; behind the low - land are mountains which rise one above another to a considerable height  We continualy saw upon it smooks by Day and fires in the night and in many places houses and plantations - I was strongly importune'd by some of my officers to go to the Dutch settlement at Concordia on this Island for refreshments, but this I refuse'd to comply with, knowing that the Dutch look upon all Europeans with a jealous eye that come a mong these Islands and our necessities were not so great to oblige me to put into a place where I might expect to be but indifferently treated  besides I did not see any necessity we had to stop any where untill 
            
      

        17  September 1770
        Monday 17th Winds Easterly a fresh breeze with which we Steer'd WNW untill 2 o'Clock when being pretty near the North end of Rotte we hauld up NNW in order to go between it and Anaboa, after steering 3 Leagues upon this Course we edge'd away NW and west and by 6 oClock we were clear of all the Islands, at this time the South part of Anaboa, which lies in the Latitude of 10°..15' So bore NE  distant 4 or 5 Leags and the Island of Rotte extending as far to the Southward as So 36° West. The North end of this Island and the south end of Timor lies N1/2E and S1/2W, distant about 3 or 4 Leags from each other  At the West end of the Passage between Rotte and Anaboa are two small Islands, the one lays near the Rotte shore and the other off the SW point of Anaboa, there is a good Channell between the two of 5 or 6 Miles broad which we came through 
        Being now clear of the Islands we steer'd a west Course all night untill 6 o'clock in the Morning when we unexpectedly saw an Island bearing WSW, for by the most of the Maps we had on board we were to the southward of all the Islands that lay between Timor and Java, at least there were none laid down so near to Timor in this Latitude by almost one half which made me at first think it a new discovery but in this I was Mistaken. We now steer'd directly for it and by 10 oClock were close in with the North side of it where we saw Houses, Cocoa-nutt Trees and Flocks of Cattle grazing.   these were temtations hardly to be withstood by people in our Situation, especially such as were but in a very indifferent state of health and I may say mind too, for in some this last was worse than the other sence I refuse'd to touch at the Island of Timor. Wherefore I thought I could not do less than to try to procure some refres[h]ments here as there appear'd to be plenty; with this View we hoisted out the Pinnace in which I sent Lieutt Gore in shore to see if there were any convenient place to land, giving him sending some trifles along with him to give to the Natives in case he saw any 
        Mr Gore Landed in a small sandy Cove near to some houses and was met on the beach by 8 or 10 of the Natives who both from their behavour and what they had about them shew'd that they had commerce with Europeans, upon Mr Gore's returning with this report and like wise that there was no anchorage for the Ship I sent him away again with both Mony and goods to try to purchas some refreshments while we kept standing on and off with the Ship 
        At Noon we were about a Mile from the Shore of the Island which extend[ed] from SE to WNW. Latitude in 10°..27', Longde 237°..31' West
            
      

        18  September 1770
        Tuesday 18th As soon as Mr Gore Landed he was met on the beach by several people both Horse and Foot who gave him to understand that there was a Bay to Leeward where we could Anchor and likewise get refreshments, upon Mr Gores return with this intelligence we bore away for the Bay in which we anchord at 7 oClock in 38 fathom water a Clean Sandy bottom, about a Mile from shore    the North point of the Bay bore N. 30° East 21/2 Miles and the South point or West end of the Island bore So 63° West. Two hours before we Anchor'd we saw Dutch Colours hoisted in a Village which stands about a Mile inland and at Day-light in the Morning the same Colours were hoisted on the beach abreast of the Ship,   by this I was no longer in doubt but what here was a Dutch Settlement and accordingly sent Lieutt Gore a shore to wait upon the Governor or Chief person residing here to acquaint him with the reasons that induce'd us to touch at this Island. Upon Mr Gores landing we could see that he was received by a guard of the Natives, and not Dutch Troops, and conducted up to the Village where the Colours were hoisted last night.   sometime after this I received a Message from Mr Gore him acquainting me that he was then with the King of the Island who had acquainted told him that he could not supply us with any thing without leave from the Dutch Governor, who resided at a nother part of the Island, but that he had sent to acquaint him of our arrival and request 
            
      

        19  September 1770
        Wednesday 19th At 2 oClock in the PM the Dutch Governor and King or Raja of this part of the Island came an with his attendance came on board with Mr Gore / he having left two gentlemen a shore as hostages /, we entertaind them at dinner in the best Manner we could, gave them plenty of good Liquor, made them some considerable presents and at their going away saluted them with 9 Guns. In return for these favour[s] they made many fair promises that we should be immideatly furnished with every thing we wanted at the same price the Dutch East India had it Company had it, and that in the Morning Buffaloes, Hogs Sheep &Ca should be down on the beach for us to look at and agree upon a price. I was not attall at a loss for Interpreters for both Dr Solander and Mr Sporing understood Dutch enough to keep up a conversation with the Dutchman and several of the Natives could speak Portuguese which Language two or 3 of my people understood. In the Morning I went aShore accompined by Mr Banks & sever[al] of the Officers and Gentlemen to return the Kings Viset, but my chief business was to see how well they would perform their promises in regard to the things I wanted. We had not been long a shore before we found that they had promised more than they ever intended to perform, for instead of finding Buffaloes down upon the beach we did not so much as see one or the least preparations makeing for bringing any down by either the Dutch Factor or the King, the former pretended he had been very ill all night and told us that he had had a letter from the Governor of Concordia in Timor acquainting him that a ship / meaning us / had lat[e]ly pas'd that Island and that if she should touch at this and be in want of any thing he was to supply her, but he was not to suffer her to make any stay nor to distribute or leave behind her to be distributed any Valliable presents to the Inferior Natives, this we look'd upon to be a fiction that hardly Answerd any purpose unless it was leting us see how the Dutch had insinuated themselves into favour with these people which never could be his intention. However both he and the King still promised we should have what we wanted, but pretended that the Buffaloes were far in the Country and could not be brought down before night, with these excuse's we were oblige'd to be satisfied. The King gave us a dinner of boild Pork and Rice, served up in baskets after their Manner and Palm wine to drink  with this and some of our own Liquor we fair'd tolerable well    after we had dined our servants we were call'd in to pertake of what remaind which was more than they could eat 
        Thursday 20th We stay'd at the Kings Pallace all the After noon, and at last were obliged to return on board without doing any thing, any farther than a promise of having some Buffaloes in the Morning, which we now had no great reason to rely on 
        In the Morning I went a shore again and was shew'd one small Buffaloe which they ask'd five Guines for,   I offer'd three which the Man told me he would gladly take and sent a message to the King to let him know what I had offerd    the mesenger soon return'd and let me know that I could not have it under five guines and this I refuse'd to give knowing that it was not worth one fifth part of the mony, but this my refusal had like to have over set all we had before done for soon after about a 100 Men, some arm'd with Musquets other with Lances came down to the Landing place; besides the officer that commanded this party there came along with them an Man who spoke Portuguese and was I beleive born of Portugue Parents, this man is here / as we afterwards understood / as an Assistant to the Dutch factor, he deliver'd to me the Kings order, or rather those of the Dutch Factor, the purport of which was that we were to stay no longer than this day, pretending that the people would not trade with us, because we wanted their provisions for nothing &Ca whereas the Natives shewed the greatest inclination imaginable to supply us with what ever they had and were far more desirous of goods than Mony and were before this man came selling us Fowls and Syrrup as fast as they could bring these things down. from this and other circumstances we were well assure'd that this was all the Dutchmans doing in order to extort from us a sum of Mony to put into his own pockets. There happen'd to be an old Raja at this time upon the beach whose In trest I had secure'd in the Morning by presenting him with a Spy glass, this man I now took by the hand and presented him with an old broad sword, this effectually secure'd him in our Intrest for the Moment he got it he began to flourish it over the old Portuguese and made him and the officer that commanded the party to set down at his backside. Emmidiatly after this trade was restored again for fowls &Ca with more spirit than ever, but before I could begin a Trade for Buffaloes which was what we most wanted, I was obliged to give 10 guines for two one of which weigh'd only 160 pounds - After this I bought 7 More at a More reasonable price one of which we lost after he was paid for. I might now have purchas'd as Many Buffaloes as I pleas'd for they now drove them down to the water side by Herds, but having now got as many as I well know'd what to do with, and likewise a number of Fowles and a Large quantity of Syrrup, I resolved to make no longer stay. accordingly in the Morn-g onFriday 21st

        21  September 1770
        [Friday 21st] We got under sail and stood away to the westward along the north side of the Island and a nother smaller Island which lies farther to the westward which last bore from us at Noon SSE distant 2 Leagues  Before we proceed any farther it will be proper in this place to say [some] thing of 
        the Island we have been last at, which is call'd by the Natives Savu it the Middle of it lies in about the Latde of 10°..35' St Longde 237°.30'Wt&C it may be about 8 Leagues in length from East to West, but of what breadth I know not because I only saw the north side. There are as I am told three bays where Ships can Anchor, the best is on the South West side of the SE point, the one we lay in call'd Seba  lies on the NW side of the Island   this bay is very well shelter'd from the SE Trade wind but lays wholy open to the NW - The Land of this Island which bounds the Sea is in general low, but in the Middle of the Island are Hills of a Moderate height and the whole is agreeably deversified with woods and Lawns which affords a most pleasing prospect from the sea. We were told that the Island is but indifferently water'd in the dry season, especially towards the latter end of it, at which time there is no runing stream upon the whole Island, only small springs which are all at a distance from the Sea side. The dry season commences in March or April and ends in November or the remaining 3 or 4 Months they have westerly winds with rain and this is the time that their crops of Rice, Callivances and Indian Corn are brought forth which are Articles that this Island produceth, they also breed a great number of Cattle such as / viz / Buffaloes, Horses, Hogs, Sheep and Goats,   Many of the former are sent to Concordia where they are Kill'd and salted in order to be sent to the More Northern Island[s] which are under the dominion of the Dutch - Sheep and Goats flesh is dried upon this Island, packe'd up in Bales and sent to Concordia for the same purpose. The Dutch Resident from whome we had these informations told us that the Dutch at Concordia had lately behav'd so ill to the Natives of Timor that they were obliged to have recourse to this Island and others adjacent for provisions for their own subsistance, and likewise Troops / Natives of this Island / to assist the Dutch againest those of Timor. Besides the above productions this Island here are an emmence Number of Palm Trees from which is extracted the Palm Wine, as it is call'd, avery sweet agreeable Cooling liquor, what they do not emmidiatly use they boil down and make Syrrup or Sugar of which they keep in earthen jarrs. Here are likewise Cocoa-nutts and Tamarind Trees, Limes &Ca but in no great plenty. Indico Cotton and Cinnamon sufficient to Serve the Natives, this last Article we were told the Dutch discourage the growth of 
        The Island is divided into five Kingdoms which have lived in Peace and Amity with each other for these hundred years, At present the Whole Island is partly under the direction of the Dutch East India Company who have a Resident or Factor who constantly lives here without whose leave the Natives are not to supply any other Nation with any thing what ever, but the whole product of the Island besides what serves themselves is to be sold to the Company at their prefer'd own price to be paid for in for European or some other Foriegn Commidity's and not for in Gold or Silver. in a manner the property of the Company - The Company by way of a Tribute oblige them to raise and pay Annualy a certain quantity of Rice, Indian Corn and Callivances, for which the Company make each of the Kings a Yearly present of a Casks of Arrack and some other trifles, the live stock Sheep and Goats flesh &Ca they pay for in Goods. The small Island which lies about a League to the westward of this pays Annualy a certain quantity of Areaca Nutts which is allmost the only produce of that Island. The Island of Rotte is upon the same footing as this of Savu. Both these Islands and the Three Solors belong to the Goverment of Concordia   From what we could learn of the Island of Timor it seems to be much upon the same footing as it was in Dampiers time which is that the Dutch Posess little more of that Island than what lies under the command of the Fort Concordia; the Rest is in posession either of the Native Indians or the Portuguese. we were likewise told that the Island of Ende belongs to the Portuguese, that the principal settlement was is at Larentucka where there is a Fort and a good harbour. We were told that Concordia on the Island Timor is a free Port for Ships of any Nation to touch at where they would not only be supplied with refreshments but Naval stores also,   Tradeing Ships might probably meet with a good reception, but Kings Ships I am perswaided would be look'd upon as spys   for my own part was I only in want of refreshments and obliged to touch at any of these Islands I should prefer going to a Portuguese settlement, before any of the Dutch and when I was solicited by the officers to call at Timor I propose'd going to one of the Portuguese settlements but this Mr Hicks made some objections to which was sufficient for me to lay it aside as I had not the least inclination to touch any where till we arrived at Batavia, for my falling in with Savu was mere chance and not design. But to return to this Island the Natives of which are of a dark brown Colour, with long lank hair, their cloathing is a peice of Calicoe or other Cotton cloth wraped about their Middle, the better sort have a nother peice which they wear over their Shoulders and the most of them wear Turbands or had kerchiefs ty'd round their heads. They eat of all the tame Animals they have got, viz, Hoggs, Horses, Buffaloes, Cocks and Hens, Dogs, Catts, Sheep and Goats, and are esteem'd much in the same order as I have mentioned, that is their Hogs flesh, which is certainly as good as any in the World, they prefer before any thing else next to Hoggs Horses and so on. Fish is not esteemd by them and is only eat by the Common or poor people who are allow'd little else of meat kind. They have acustom a mong them that when ever a King dies all the Cattle &Ca that are upon his Estate are kill'd with which the successor makes a feast to which is are invited all the principal people of the Island who stay untill all is consumed   After this they every one according to his abillitys make the Young King a present, by which mea[n]s he gets a fresh stock which he is obliged to husband for some time. The other principal men make also feasts which are as extraordinary as these, for they seldom end so long as the giver has got any thing left alive upon his Estate. They are said to be a people of good morals, Virtuous and Chaste, each man having only one wife which he keeps for life    Fornication and Adultery is hardly known among them. When a great Man Marries he makes presents to all his wifes Relations of European and other foreign commodities to the Value of 100 Rix-Dollars    this custom the Dutch East India Company find it their intrest to incourage. They speake a Language peculiar to themselves into which the Dutch have caused the Bible and New-Testament to be Translated and have interduced them it with the use of letters and writing among them; by this means several hundreds of them have been converted to Christianity, the rest are either some Heathens or and others of no Religion attall, and yet they all Stick up to the strick'd rules of Morality. They all both men and women Young and old Chew of the Beetle Leaf, Araeca Nutts, and a sort of white lime which I beleive is made from Coral Stone this has such an effect upon the teeth that very few even of the young people have hardly any left in their heads and those they have are as black as Ink; their houses are built on post[s] about 4 feet from the Ground, we ask'd the reason why they built them so, and was told that it was only custom, they are however certainly the Cooler for it.   they are thatched with Palm leaves and the Floor and sides are boarded 
        The Man who resides here upon this Island in behalf of the Dutch East India Company is a German by birth   his name is Johan Christopher Lange it is hard to say upon what footing he is here, he is so far a Governor that the Natives dar[e] do nothing openly without his consent, and yet he can transact no sort of business with Foreigner's either in his own or that of the Companys name nor can it be a place of either honour or profit, he is the only white man upon the Island and has resided there ever sence it hath been under the direction of the Dutch which is about 10 years He is allowd 50 Slaves / Natives of the Island / to attend upon him, these belong to and are Mentain''d by the Company. He goes the circuit of the Island once in two Months, but on what account he did not tell us; when he makes these rounds he carries with him a certain quantity of spiret to treat the great men with, which he says he is obliged to look well after otherwise the[y] would steal it and get Drunk and yet at a nother time he told us that he never know'd a theft commited in the Island, but some of the Natives themselves contridicted him in this by stealing from us an Ax,   however from their behavour to us in general I am of opinion that they are but seldom guilty of these crimes. His going round the Island once in Two Months is most likly to see that the Natives make the necessary preparations for fullfilling their engagements with the Dutch and to see that the Large boats or small Vessels are taken proper care of which the Dutch keep in all the Bays of this Island in order to collect and carry the Grain &Ca to the Ship which comes Anualy here, they are likewise employ'd in carrying Catle grain &C to Timor and when not wanted they are hauld ashore into Houses or Shads built on purpose. As I have mentioned Slaves it is necessary to Observe that all also all the great Men have slaves which are the Natives of the Island, they can dispose of them one to a nother but cannot sell them to go out of the Island, the price of a Slave is a good large fatt Hogg. Horse &Ca - I have before mentioned that many of the people can speake Portuguese, but hardly any one Dutch    from this it is probable that this Island was formerly under the Jurisdiction of the Portuguese tho the Dutch Governor never own'd as much but said that the Dutch had Traded here these hundred years past 

        1 October 1770
        MONDAY 1st Octr First and latter parts fresh breezes at SE and fair weather, the Middle Squaly with Lightning and Rain. At 7 o'Clock in the PM, being then in the Latitude of Java Head and not seeing any land assured us that we had got too far to the westward, upon which we hauld up ENE, having before steer'd NBE    At 12 oClock saw the Land bearing East, Tackd and stood to the SW untill 4 o'Clock than stood again to the Eastward having very unsettled Squally weather which split the Main Topsail Very much and obliged us to bend the other many of our sails are now so bad that they will hardly stand the least puff of wind. At 6 oClock Java head or the west end of Java bore SEBE distant 5 Leagues, soon after this saw Princes Island bearing E1/2S and at 10 oClock Saw the Island of Cracatoa bearing NE, this is a remarkable high Peaked Island which at Noon bore No 40 Et distant 7 Leagues, Princes Island Extending from So 53° Et to SBW Distant 3 Leagues. Course and Distance saild sence yesterday at Noon is N 24°..30' Et 70 Miles - Latitude in pr observation 6°..29' So Longitude 254°..244' West, but either our Longitude must be erroneous or the streights of Sunda must be falsly laid down in all Books and Charts & but this no doubt we shall have an oppertunity to settle      Note in our run from Savou I have allow'd 20' per day for the westerly current which no doubt must run strong at this time of ye Year especially of the Coast of Java, this allowance I find Answers
            
      

        2  October 1770
        Tuesday 2nd Octr In the PM had the wind at SSE and SEBS and SSE with which we stood to the Eastward close upon awind. At 6 oClock the Hill on Princes Island bore SWBS and Cracatoa Island North 10 Miles    in this situation had 58 fathom water, standing still to the Eastward at 8 oClock had 52 fathom a Muddy bottom, at 10, 23 fm By 4 oClock in the Morning we fetched close in with the Java Shore in 15 fathom than steer'd along shore - At 5 oClock it fell Calm which continued with some Variable light airs untill Noon at which time Anger Point bore NE distant 1 League and Thwart the way Island North. In the Morning I sent a boat ashore to try to get some fruits for Tupia who is very ill, and likewise to get some grass &Ca for the Buffaloes we have still left.   the boat returnd with only 4 Cocoa-Nutts a small bunch of Plantains which they purchased of the Natives for a Shilling and a few Shrubs for the Cattle 
        Wednesday 3rd Soon after 12 oClock it fell quite Calm which obliged us to anchor in 18 fm a muddy bottom, about 2 Miles from shore where we found a Strong Current seting to the SW 
        Not long before we anchord we saw a Dutch Ship laying off Anger Point, on board which I sent Mr Hicks to inquire after news,    Upon his return he inform'd me that there were Two Dutch Ships from Batavia the one bound to Ceylon and the other to the Coast of Mallabar, besides a small Fly Boat or Packet, which is stationed here to carry Packets, Letters &Ca from all Dutch Ships to Batavia; but it seems more Probable that she is stationed here to examine all Ships that pass and repass these Streights. We now first heard the Agreeable News of His Majestys Sloop the Swallow being at Batavia about two years ago. At 7 oClock a breeze sprung up at SSW, with which we weigh'd and stood to the NE between Thward the way Island and the Cap, Soundings from 18 to 26 fathom. We had but little wind all night and having a strong Current against us we got no farther by 8 oClock in the Morning than under Bantam Point, at this time the Wind came to NE and obliged us to Anchor in 22 fathom about 2 Miles from the Shore, the above Point bore NEBE distant 1 League - here we found a Strong Current seting to the NW 
        In the Morning we saw the Dutch Packet Standing after us, but after the wind shifted to NE she bore away 
        One of the Dutch Captains told Mr Hicks Yesterday that the Current sets Constantly to the SW ward and that it would continue to set so for a Mo[n]th or Six Weeks longer

        4 October 1770
        Thursday 4th In the PM had the Wind at NEBN which obliged us to lay fast. About Six oClock in the Evening one of the Country boats Came a long side in which was the Commander of the Packet before Mentioned     He seem'd to have two Montives for Coming, the one to take an account of the Ship and the other to sell us Refreshments, for in the boat were Turtle, Fowls, Birds &Ca: all of which they held at a pretty high price and had brought to a bad Market as our Savu Stock was not yet expended.   I gave a Spanish Dollor for a small Turtle which wieghd only 36 pounds. With respect to the Ship he wanted to know her Name, the Captains, the place we came last from and where bound, as I would not see him my self, I orderd that no account should be given him from whence we came, but Mr Hicks who wrote the Ships Name down in his Book, put down from Europe, seeing this he express'd some surprise and said that we might write down what we please'd, for it was of no other use than for the information of such of our Countrymen as might pass these Streights 
        At 7 oClock a light breeze sprung up at SSE with which we got under sail, At 1 o'Clock in the Morning Anchor Anchord again having not wind to stem the Current which we found to run 3 Knotts     At 2 oClock we wieghd a gain but finding that we lost ground we were obliged to Anchor in 18 fathom the Island Pulo Morock which lies Close under the Shore 3 Miles to the westward of Bantam Point, bore SEBS distant 11/2 Mile   Latitude Observed 5°..55' St 
            
      

        5 October 1770
        Friday 5th At 5 oClock in the PM we wiegh'd with a light breeze at SWBS which continued not long before it fell Calm and obliged us to Anchor again - At 1 oClock we weigh'd with the Land wind at SSE which died away in the Morning and the Current runing strong againest us we Anchor[d] in 17 fathom - A little before this a Proe came along side wherein was a Dutch Officer who came upon the same business as the other   he sent me down a printed paper in English Containing 9 Articles or Questons of which thethis following is a Copy
        The Commanders and officers of the Ships, where this Paper may be presented, Will be please'd to Answer on the following Questions Vidzt 
        1 To What Nation the Ship belongs and its Name.
        2 If it comes from Europe or any other place  
        3 From what place it lastly departed from  
        4 Where unto design'd to go  
        5 What and how many Ships of the Dutch Comp. by departure from the last Shore there layed and their Names  
        6 If one or more of these Ships in Company with this is departed for this or any other place 
        7 If during the Voyage any particularitys is happend or Seen 
        8 If not any Ships in Sea, or the Streights of Sunda have seen or hail'd in, and which  
        9 If any other News worth of Attention at the place from whence the Ship lastly Departed or during the Voyage is happen'd 
        Batavia in the Castle the By order of the Governour General & the Counselors of India 
        J Brander Bungl Sect.
        The first and fourth of these questions I only Answer'd which when the Officer saw, he made use of the very same words the other had done before, viz / that we might write what we please'd for it was of no concequence &Ca and yet he immidiatly said that he must send that very paper away to Batavia by water and that it would be there by to Morrow Noon, which shews that the Governor and Counselors of India look upon such papers to be of some Concequence    Be this as it may, My reasons for takeing notice of it in this Journal is, because I am well inform'd that it is but of very late Years that the Dutch have taken upon them to examine all ships that pass these Streights 
        At 10 oClock we wieghd with a light breeze at SW, but did little more than Stem the Current  At Noon Bantam Point and Pula baby in one bearing EBN, distant from the Point 11/2 Mile Latitude Observed 5°..53' So 
            
      

        6 October 1770
        Saturday 6th At 2 o'clock in the PM finding that we could not stem the Current we Anchord with the Kedge Anchor under Bantam point where we lay untill 9 at which time the Current made slowly to the Eastward and at the same time a light breeze springing up at SE we weigh'd and Stood to the East untill 10 oClock in the AM when the Current obliged us again Again to anchor in 22 fathom, Pula Baby bearing EBS1/2S distant 3 or 4 Miles  Our Soundings from Bantam point to this place was from 36 to 22 fathoms 

        Sunday 7th Light Airs from the Southward with frequent Calms - At 6 oClock in the PM weighd with a light breeze at SSW, which was not sufficient to stem the Current and was therefore obliged to Come too again in 15 fathom    At 10 oClock weighd again and Stood to the Eastward with the wind at SSE  At 11 AM Anchord in 21 fathom, the West end of Wapping Island bore South distant 3 Miles and the Thousand Islands NBE1/2E distant 3 or 4 Miles - found the Current still set to the westward 

        10  October 1770
        Dated in Batavia Road  J. Seetterly this 10th of Octr 1770    
        Previous to the above I had consulted with the Carpenter and all the other officers concearning the Leake and they were all unanimously of opinion that it was not safe to proceed to Europe without first seeing her bottom     Accordingly I resolved to apply for Leave to heave her down at this place and as I understood that this was to be done in writeing I drew up the following papers to be presented to the Governor &C &C  a Request and in the Morning had it translated into dutch in order to be laid before the Governor
        Wednesday 10thaccording to our reckoning, but by the People here Thurs. 11th  At 4 oClock in the P.M Anchor'd in Batavia Road where we found the Harcourt Indiaman from England, 2 English Country Ships, 13 Sail of Large Dutch Ships and a number of Small Vesels. As soon as we anchor'd I sent Lieutt Hicks a Shore to acquaint the Governor of our Arrival and to make an Excuse for not Saluting, a thing I did not intend as we could only do it with three Guns I thought it was better let a lone  for it was thought the swivles could not be heard 
        The Carpenter now deliverd me in the following Defects of the Ship, of which the following is a Copy 
        The Defects of His Majestys Ship Bark Endeavour Lieutt James Cook Commander 
        The Ship very Leakey / as she makes from twelve to six Inches pr Hour / Occationd by her Main Keel being wounded in many places and the Scarph of her stem being very open. The False Keel gone beyond the Midships / from for ward and perhaps farther / as I had no opportunity of seeing for the water when haul'd a shore for repair /. Wounded on her Larboard side under the Main Channel where I immagine the greatest Leak is / but could not come at it for the water./ One Pump on the Larboard side useless the others decay'd within 11/2 Inch of the bore - Otherwise Masts, Yards, Boats & Hull in prety good condition 

        12 October 1770
        Friday 12th At 5 oClock in the PM I was interduced to the Governor General who Recieved me very politly and told me that I should have every thing I wanted, and that in the Morning my Requist should be laid before the Councel where I was desired to attend 
        About 9 oClock in the Evening we had much Rain with some very heavy Claps of Thunder, one of which carried away a Dutch India-man's Main Mast by the Deck and split it, the Mn Topmt & Topgt mast all to shivers. she had had a Iron spindle at the Main Topgallant Mast head which had first Attracted the firy matter Lightning. This Ship lay about two Cables lengths from us and we were struck with the Thunder at the same time and in all probabillity we should have shared the same fate as the Dutchman had it not been for the Electrical Chain which we had but just before got up  this carr[i]ed the firy Lightning or Electrical matter over the side Clear of the Ship, the Shock was so great as to shake the whole ship very sencibly, this instance alone is sufficient to recommend these Chains to all ships whatever, and that of the Dutchman ought to caution people from this a having Iron spindles at their Masts heads 
        In the Morning I went a shore to the Councel Chamber and laid my Request before the Governor and Councel, who gave me for answer that I should have every thing I wanted 

        14 October 1770
        Sunday 14th Early in the Morning a ship saild from hence for Holland by which I had just time to write two or three lines to Mr Stephens Secretary of the Admiralty to acquaint him of our Arrival after which I went a shore and waited upon the Shap bander Shabanderwhich is who has the derection of the Town, port &Ca  in order to get an order to the Superintendant at Unrust to Receive us at that Island, but this I was told would not be ready before Tuesday next  Received from the Shore fresh beef and greens for the Ships Compney 
            
      

        15 October 1770
        Monday 15th Fresh Sea and land breezes and fair weather. I had forgot to mention that upon our arrival here I had not one man upon the Sick list and Lieutt Hicks Mr Green and Tupia were the only People that had any complaints Occasion'd by a long continuence at sea
            
      

        16 October 1770
        Tuesday 16th Finding by a strict inquiry that there were no private person or persons in this place that could at this time advance me a sufficient sum of Mony to defray the Charge I might be at in repairing and refiting the Ship - At least if there were any they would be afraid to do it without leave from the Governor,   Wherefore I had nothing left but to apply to the Governor himself and accordingly drew up the following a request which I laid before the Governor and Counc[e]l this Morning in concequence of which the Shapbander had orders to supply me with what mony I wanted out of the Companys Treasure 
        Lieutenant James Cook Commander of His Brittannick Majestys Bark the Endeavour begs leave to represent to His Excellency The Rigt Honble Petrus Albertus Van der Parra Governor General &Ca &Ca &Ca  
        That he will be in want of a Sum or Sums of Mony in order to defray the Charge he will be at in repairing and renting His Brittannick Majestys Ship at this place; which sum or Sums of Mony he is directed by his instructions and empower'd by his Commission to give Bills of Exchange on the respective offices which Superintend His Brittannick Majestys Navy- 
        The said Lieutt Jams Cook Requests of His Excellency 
        That he will be pleased to order him to be supply'd with such Sum or Sums of Money as he may want for the Use above mention'd either out of the Companys Treasure, or permit such private persons to do it as may be willing to advance Mony for Bills of Exchange on The Honble the Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Brittannick Majestys Navy, The Comissionrs for Victualing His Majestys Navy and the Commissioners for taking Care of the Sick and Hurt

        17 October 1770
        Wednesday 17th In the PM I waited upon the Superintendant of Unrust with an order from the Shipabander to receive us at that Island, but this order the Superintendant told me was not sufficient to impower him to give me the conveniences and assistance I wanted; and when I came to call upon the Shabander I found this mistake was owing to the word, heave down, being wrong translated, this circumstance trifling as it is will cause a delay of some days as it cannot be set to rights untill next Councel day which is not till Friday.
            
      

        18 October 1770
        THURSDAY 18th In the PM Received on board 2 live Oxen, 150 Gallns of Arrack, or 3 barls of Tarr and one of Pitch. At Day light in the A.M. took up our Anchor and Run down to Onrust - At 9 Anchord in 8 fathom off Coopers Island which lies close to Onrust, there are Warfes at both of these Islands and ships, land there stores some times on the one and some-times on the other but it is only at Onrust where the proper conveniences are for heaving down - Soon after we Anchord I went ashore to the officers of the Yard to see if they could not allow us some place to land our stores but this could not be granted without orders
            
      

        19 October 1770
        Friday 19th In the PM I sent a petty officer to Mr Hicks, who lodges ashore at Batavia for the recovery of his hilth, with orders to desire him to wait upon the Shipband Shabandar in order to get the necessary orders respecting us, despatch'd to this place as soon as possible 

        Tuesday 23rd In the PM hauld along side one of the Warfes, in order to take out our stores &Ca, after which the Ship is to be deliverd into the Charge of the proper officers at Onrust, who will / as I am inform'd / heave her down and repair her with their own people only while ours must stand and look on, who if we were permited could do every thing wanting to the Ship our selves 
            
      

        24 October 1770
        Wednesday 24th Empd clearing the Ship having a store House to put our stores &Ca in  In the PM I went up to Town in order to put on board the first Dutch Ship that Sails a Packet for the Admiralty containing a Copy of my Journal, a Chart of the South Sea, a nother of New, Zeland and one of the East Coast of New Holland - In the Morning the General accompanied by the Water Fiscall, some of the Councel and the Commodore each in their Respective boats went out into the Road on board the Oldest Captain in order to appoint him Commodore of the Fleet ready to Sail for Holland - The Ships were drawn up in two lines between which the General past to the New Commodores Ship which lay the farthest out - Each Ship as he past and repast gave him 3 Cheers and as soon as he was on board and the Dutch flag hoisted at the Main Topmast head, the other Commodore Saluted him with 21 Guns and emmidiatly after struck his Broad Pendant which was again hoisted as soon as the General left the other Ship, he was then saluted by with 17 Guns by the new made Commodore who now hoisted a Common pendant - this Ceremony of apointing a Commodore over the Grand fleet, as they call it, we were told is Yearly perform'd    I went out in my Boat on purpose to see it accompaned by Mr Banks and Dr Solander because we were told that it was one of the grandest sights Batavia afforded, that may be too and yet it did not recompence us for our trouble - I thought the whole was but ill conducted and the fleet appear'd to be very badly man'd    This Fleet consists of 10 or 12 Sail of Stout Ships not only these but all or most of their other Ships are perced for 50 Guns, but have only their upper tier Mounted and these are more by half than they have men to fight 
            
      

        25 October 1770
        Thursday 25th In the Evening I sent the Admiralty Packet on board the Kronenburg Capn Fredrick Kelger, Commodore who together with a nother Ship sails emmidiatly for the Cape where he waits for the remainder of the fleet 

In the PM we had the Missfortune to loose Mr Monkhouse the Surgeon who died at Batavia of a Fever after a Short illness of which desease and others, several of our people are daly taken ill which will make his loss be the more severly felt. He was succeeded by Mr Perry his mate who is equally well if not better skilld in his profession -
            
      

        8 November 1770
        Thursday 8th In the night had much Thunder Lightning and rain, during the day fair weather which gave us time to get every thing in readiness for heaving down 
            
      

        9 November 1770
        Friday 9th In the PM Hove the Larboard side of the Ship Keel out and found her bottom to be in a far worse condition than we expected, the False Keel was gone to within to within 20 feet of the stern post, the Main Keel wounded in ma[n]y places very considerably, a great quantity of Sheathing [off], several planks much damaged especially under the Main channell near the Keel were two planks and a half near 6 feet in length were within 1/8 of a Inch of being cut through and here the worms had made their way quite into the Timbers, so that it was a Matter of Surprise to every one who saw her bottom how we had kept her above water and yet in this condition we had saild some hundreds of Leagues in as dangerous a Navigation as is in any part of the world happy in being ignorant of the continual danger we were in. In the Evening righted the Ship    Having only time to patch up some of the worst places to prevent the water geting in in large quantitys for the present 
        In the Morning hove her down again and most of the Carpenters, and Caulkers in the yard / which are not a few / were set to work upon her bottom and at the same time a number of slaves were employ'd bailing the water out of the hold, our people altho they attend were seldom called upon, indeed by this time we were so weake[n]d by sickness that we could not muster above 320 Men and officers that were able to do duty so little should we have been able to have hove her down and repair'd her our selves as I at one time thought us capable of 
            
      

        10 November 1770
        Saturday 10th In the PM we were obliged to right the Ship before night by reason of her makeing water in her uper works faster than we could free, this made it necessary to have her weather works inside and out caulk'd which before was thought unnecessary 
            
      

        11 November 1770
        Sunday 11th In the AM having caulkd the uper works hove out the Larboard side again which a number of workmen were employ'd repairing 
            
      

        12 November 1770
        Monday 12th In the PM finishd the Larboard side and in the AM began to get ready to heave out the other 
            
      

        13 November 1770
        Tuesday 13th This day they hove the starbd side keel out which we found very little damage'd and was therefore soon done with
            
      

        14 November 1770
        Wednesday 14th Employ'd clearing the Ship of the Carreening geer her bottom being now throughaly repaird and very much to my satisfaction. In justice to the Officers and workmen of this Yard I must say that I do not believe that there is a Marine Yard in the world where Work is done with more alertness than here or where there are better conveniences for heaving Ships down both in point of safety and dispatch. Here they heave down by two Masts which is not now practised by the English men but I hold it to be much safer and more expaditious than by heaving down by one mast, a man that will not allow this must not only be strongly bigoted to his own customs but in some measure divested of reason that will not allow this after seeing with how much ease and safety the Dutch at Onrust heave down their largest Ships
            
      

        15 November 1770
        Thursday 15th In the AM Transport the Ship from Onrust to Coopers Island and moor'd her a long side the warfe -

        Tuesday 25th Having now compleatly refited the Ship & taken in a sufficient quantity of Wood Provisions of all kinds, I this afternoon tooke leave of the General and such others of the principal Gentlemen as I had any connections with all of whome upon every occasion gave me all the assistance I required. A small dispute however now aser happend between me and some of the Dutch Naval Officers about a seaman that had run from one of the Dutch Ships in the Road and enter'd on board mine,   this man the General demanded as a subject of Holland and I promised to deliver him up provide[d] he was not an English Subject, and sent the necessary orders on board for that purpose   In the Morning the Commodores Captain came and told me that he had been on board my ship for the Man but that the officer had refused to give him up alidging that he was an Englishman and that he, the Captain / was just than come from the General to demand the man of me as a Deanish Subject, he standing upon their Ships Books as born at Elsinore. I told him that I beleived there must be some Mistake in the Generals Message for I apprehended he would not demand a Deanish Seaman from me who had commited no other crime than prefering the English service to that of the Dutch but to convince him how unwilling I was to disoblige any one concern'd I had sent orders on board to deliver the Man to him in case he was found to be a Foreigner but as that was not done I was convinced suspected that the Man was a Subject of England and if I found him to be such I was resolved to keep him  Soon after this I received a letter from Mr Hicks which I carried to the Shabandar and desired that it might be shewn to the General and at the same time to acqua[i]nt him that after my having such unanswerable proofs of the Man be[ing] an English subject as was mentioned in that letter it was impossible for me to deliver him up. after this I heard no more about it 

        Wednesday 26th In the P.M. My self Mr Banks and all the Gentlemen came on board and at 6 in the AM we wiegh'd and came to sail with a light breeze at SW. The Elgin India man saluted with three Cheers and 13 Guns and soon after the Garrison with 14 both of which we returnd  Soon after this the Sea breeze set in at NBW which obliged us to anchor just without the Ships in the Road - The Number sick on board at this time amounts to 40 or up wards and the rest of the Ships company are in a Weakly condition having been ev[er]y one sick except the Sail maker an old Man about 70 or 80 Years of age and what is was still more extraordinary in this man his being generally more or less drunk every day. But notwithstanding this general sickness we lost but Seven Men in the whole   the Surgeon three Seamen, Mr Greens Servant and Tupia and his servant both of which fell a sacrifice to this unwholsom climate before they had reached the Object of their wishes. Tupia['s] death canno indeed cannot cannot be said to be owing wholy to the unwholsom air of Batavia, the long want of a Vegetable diat which he had all his life before been use'd to had brought upon him all the disorders attending a sea life. He was a Shrewd Sensible, Ingenious Man, but proud and obstinate which often made his situation on board both disagreable to himself and those about him and tended much to promote the deceases which put a period to his life 

        FRIDAY the 15th. Strong gales at SE all the after noon and most part of the night tho in the Evening it fell a little  moderate, which gave the Indimans boat an opportunity to come on board us with a compliment of a Basket of fruit &ca. She was the Admiral Pocock Captain Riddell homeward bound from [Bombay]. In the Morning we got under sail & stood into the Road having variable light airs mostly from the sea. A Dutch Boat from the shore came on board in which was the Master Attendant and some other Gentlemen; the former directed us to a proper birth where about 10 oClock we anchord in 7 fathom water a Owsey bottom, the Lyons Tail or West point of the Bay bore WNW, and the Castle sw distant 11/2 Miles. I now sent a petty officer ashore to know if they would Answer our salute but before he returnd we saluted, which was immidiatly returnd by the same number of Guns. After this I waited my self upon the Governor who was pleased to tell me that I should have every thing I wanted that the place afforded. My first care was to provide a proper place a Shore for the r[e]seption of the Sick, for which purpose I order'd the Surgeon to look out for a house where they could be Lodged and diated; this he soon found and agree'd with the people of the house for two Shillings a Day per Man, which I found was the Customary price and method of proceeding and I afterwards gave the Surgeon an order to superintend the whole.

        Few Remarksoccurences have happend sence we left Java  head that can be of real much  use to the Navigator or any other person into whose hand this Journal may fall,   Such however as have occurd I shall now insert. After our leaving Java  head we were a 11 Days before we got the general SE  Trade wind in which time we did not advance above 5° to the South and 3°  to the West, having all the time Variable light Airs of Wind interrupted by  frequent Calms, the weather all the time hot and sultry and the Airs unwholsome,  occasioned most probably by the vast Vapours brought into these Latitudes by  the Easterly Trade wind and Westerly Monsoon both of which blow at this season  time of the Year in those this  seas and  the Easterly winds prevail as far as 12°  or 10° South and the westerly winds as far as the  6° or 8°  between them the winds are variable and I beleive always  more or less unwholsome, but to us it was remarkable from the fatal concequences  that attended it; for what ever might be the cause of first bringing on the  flux among our people this unwholsome air had a great share in it & increased  it to that degree that a man was no sooner taken with it than he look'd upon  himself as a dead man, such was the despondency  that reign'd among the sick at this time, nor could it be by any means prevented  when every man saw that Medicine however skilfully administred had not the least  Effect. I shall mention what effect only the imagery approach of this disorder  had upon one man. he had long tended upon the Sick and injoy'd a tolerable good  state of hilth. one morning coming upon deck he found himself a little griped  and immidiatly began to stamp with his feet and exclaim, I have got the Gripes,  I have got the Gripes: I shall die, I shall die, in this manner he continued  untill he threw himself into a fit and was carried off the deck in a manner  dead, however he soon recover'd and did  very well 
        We had no sooner got into the SE  Trade wind then we felt its happy effects, tho we lost several men after but  they were such as were brought so low and week that there was hardly a possibility  of their recovering and yet some of them linger'd out in  a state of suspence a month after who in all probabillity would not have  lived 24 hours before this change happen'd  those that were not so far  gone remaind in the same state for some time and at last began to recover, some  few however were seiz'd with the disorder after we got into the Trade wind but  they had it but slitely and soon got over it. It is worth remarking that of  all those who had it in its last stage only one man live'd who is now in a fair  way of recovering and I think Mr Banks was  the only one that was cure'd at the first Attack'd that had it to a great degree,  or indeed attall before we got into the S.E.  Trade, for it was before that time that his cure was happily effected 
        It is to be wish'd for the Good of all  Seamen and Mankind in General that some preventative was found out against  this disease and put in practice in climates where this  disease it  is common   for it is impossible to Victual and water a ship in those  climates but what some one Article or a nother according to different peoples  opinions must have been the means of bringing on the flux. We was  were inclinable to lay it to the Water we took in at Princes Island and the  Turtle we got their on which we lived for several days, but there seems to be  no reason for this when we consider that all the Ships from Batavia this year  suffered by the  same disorder as much  as we have done and many of them arrived at this place in a far worse  state, and yet not one of these Ships took in any water at Princes Island, the  same may be said of the Harcourt Indiman Capt  Paul who saild, from Batavia, soon after our arrival, directly for the Coast  of Sumatra, we afterwards heard that she in a very short time lost by sickness  above twenty Men,  indeed this seems to have been a year of General sickness  over most parts of India   the Ships from Bengall and Madrass bring  melancholy accounts of the havock mad[e] there by the United force of sickness  and famine -
        Some few days after we left Java, we saw for 3 or 4  evenings succeeding one another Boobies fly about the Ship, now as these birds  are known to roost every night on land they seem'd to indicate that some Island  was in our neighbourhood, probabily it might be the Island Selam which Island  I find differently laid down in different Charts, in  both in name  and situation-
        The Variation of the Compass off the west Coast of Java  is about 3° West, which variation continues without any sincible difference  in the common Track of Ships to the Longitude of 288° West, Latitude 22°  0' So After this it begins to increase a pace  in so much that in the Longd of 295°- Latd  23° the Variation was 10°..20' Wt   In  7° more of Longde and one of Latde  it increased 2° in the same space farther to the West it increase'd 5°.  In the Latitude of 28° and Longitude 314° it was 24°..20', in the  Latitude of 29° and Longitude of 317° it was 26°.10' and continued  to be much the same for the space of 10° farther to the west, but in the  Lat. of 34° Longd 333°   we  observed it twice to be 281/4° West and this was the greatest Variation  we observ'd for in the Latitude of 351/2°, Longd  337° it was 24° - and continued decreasing so, that off Cape Laguillas  it was 22°.30' and in Table Bay it was 20°..30' West 
        From what I have observed of the Currents it doth not  appear that they are attall considerable untill you draw near the Meridian of  Madagascar for after we had made 52° of Longitude from Java head, we found  by observation our error in Longitude was only 2° and it was the same when  we had made only 19°    this Error might partly be owing  to a Current  seting to the Westward, or what I thought most lik[e]ly, that we did not make  sufficient allowence for the set  of the Sea before when we run, and lastly the Assumed Longitude of Java  head might be wrong, if any error lays there it arises from the Imperfection  of the Charts I made use of in reducing the Longitude from Batavia to the above  mentioned head for it cannot be doubted but the Longitude of Batavia is well  determined. After we had pass'd the Longitude of 307° we began to find the  effects of the Westerly Currents.  for in three days our error in  Longitude was 1°..5', its Velocity kept increasing as we got to the Westward  in so much that for five days successivily after we had made the land we were  drove to the SW  or SWBW by the Currents not  less then 20 leags a Day and this continued  untill we were within 60 or 70 Leagues of the Cape we then found the current  to set some times one way and some times another but mostly to the westward  
        After the Boobies above mentioned left us we Saw no  more birds till we got nearly abreast of Madagascar where in the Latitude of  273/4° we saw an A[l]batross, after that time  we saw of these birds every day and in greater numbers together with several  other sorts, one sort about as big as a Duck of a very dark brown Colour with  a Yallowish bill, the number of these birds increasd upon us as we approach'd  the shore   as soon as we got into Soundings we saw Gannets which  we continued to see asa  long as we were on the bank which stretches off from that  Cape Lagulas 40 Leagues and Extends a long shore to the Eastward from Cape Falso  according to some Charts 160 Leagues; the extent of this Bank is not well known  however it is usefull in directing Shipping when to haul in to make the land    head that can be of much use to the Navigator or any other person into whose hand this Journal may fall, Such however as have occurd I shall now insert. After our leaving Java head we were a 11 Days before we got the general SE Trade wind in which time we did not advance above 5 to the South and 3 to the West, having all the time Variable light Airs of Wind interrupted by frequent Calms; the weather all the time hot and sultry and the Airs unwholsome, occasioned most probably by the vast Vapours brought into these Latitudes by the Easterly Trade wind and Westerly Monsoon, both of which blow at this time of the Year in this sea; the Easterly wind prevail[s] as far as 12 or 10 South and the westerly winds as far as 6 or 8. Between them the winds are variable and I beleive always more or less unwholsome, but to us it was remarkable from the fatal concequences that attended it;  for what ever might be the cause of first bringing on, the flux among our people, this unwholsome air had a great share in it & increased it to that degree that a man was no sooner taken with it than he look'd upon himself as dead, such was the despondency that reign'd among the sick at this time, nor could it be by any means prevented when every man saw that Medicine however skilfully administred had not the least Effect.  I shall mention what effect only the imagery approach of this disorder had upon one man. He had long tended upon the Sick and injoy'd a tolerable good state of hilth: one morning coming upon deck he found himself a little griped and immidiatly began to stamp with his feet and exclaim I have got the Gripes, I have got the Gripes,I shall die, I shall die!in this manner he continued untill he threw himself into a fit and was carried off the deck in a manner dead, however he soon recover'd and did very well.
        We had no sooner got into the SE Trade wind then we felt its happy effects, tho we lost several men after,  but they were such as were brought so low and week that there was hardly a possibility of their recovering,  and yet some of them linger'd out in a state of suspence a month after who in all probabillity would not have lived 24 hours before this change happen'd. Those that were not so far gone remaind in the same state for some time and at last began to recover;  some few however were seiz'd with the disorder after we got into the Trade wind but they had it but slitely and soon got over it. It is worth remarking that of all those who had it in its last stage only one man live'd who is now in a fair way of recovering, and I think Mr Banks was the only one that was cure'd at the first Attack'd that had it to a great degree, or indeed attall before we got into the SE Trade, for it was before that time that his cure was happily effected.
        It is to be wish'd for the Good of all Seamen and Mankind in General that some preventative was found out against this disease and put in practice in climates where it is common; for it is impossible to Victual and water a ship in those climates but what some one Article or a nother, according to different peoples opinions, must have been the means of bringing on the flux. We were inclinable to lay it to the Water we took in at Princes Island and the Turtle we got their, on which we lived for several days, but there seems to be no reason for this when we consider that all the Ships from Batavia this year suffered by the same disorder as much as we have done, and many of them arrived at this place in a far worse state, and yet not one of these Ships took in any water at Princes Island; the same may be said of the Harcourt Indiman Capt Paul who saild from Batavia soon after our arrival, directly for the Coast of Sumatrawe afterwards heard that she in a very short time lost by sickness above twenty Men. Indeed this seems to have been a year of General sickness over most parts of India, the Ships from Bengall and Madrass bring melancholy accounts of the havock mad[e] there by the United force of sickness and famine.
        Some few days after we left Java we saw for 3 or 4 evenings succeeding one another Boobies fly about the Ship, now as these birds are known to roost every night on land they seem'd to indicate that some Island was in our neighbourhood, probabily it might be the Island Selam which Island I find differently laid down in different Charts, both in name and situation. The Variation of the Compass off the west Coast of Java is about 3 West, which variation continues without any sincible difference in the common Track of Ships to the Longitude of 288 West, Latitude 220' s. After this it begins to increase a pace in so much that in the Longd of 295, Latd 23, the Variation was 1020' w. In 7 more of Longde and one of Latde it increased 2, in the same space farther to the West it increase'd 5. In the Latitude of 28 and Longitude 314 it was 2420', in the Latitude of 29 and Longitude of 317 it was 2610' and continued to be much the same for the space of 10 farther to the west. But in the Lat. of 34, Longd 333 we observed it twice to be 281/4 West, and this was the greatest Variation we observ'd for in the Latitude of 351/2, Longd 337, it was 24 and continued decreasing, so that off Cape Laguillas it was 2230' and in Table Bay it was 2030' West.
        From what I have observed of the Currents it doth not appear that they are attall considerable untill you draw near the Meridian of Madagascar; for after we had made 52 of Longitude from Java head, we found by observation our error in Longitude was only 2, and it was the same when we had made only 19, this  Error might partly be owing to a Current seting to the Westward or what I thought most lik[e]ly, that we did not make sufficient allowence for the set of the Sea before when we run, and lastly the Assumed Longitude of Java head might be wrong: if any error lays there it arises from the Imperfection of the Charts I made use of in reducing the Longitude from Batavia to the above mentioned head, for it cannot be doubted but the Longitude of Batavia is well determined. After we had pass'd the Longitude of 307 we began to find the effects of the Westerly Currents, for in three days our error in Longitude was 15'. Its Velocity kept increasing as we got to the Westward, in so much that for five days successivily after we had made the land we were drove to the sw or SWBW by the Currents not less then 20 leagues a Day, and this continued untill we were within 60 or 70 Leagues of the Cape, we then found the current to set some times one way and some times another but mostly to the westward.
        After the Boobies above mentioned left us we Saw no more birds till we got nearly abreast of Madagascar where in the Latitude of 273/4 We saw an A[l]batross: after that time we saw of these birds every day and in greater number together with several other sorts, one sort about as big as a Duck of a very dark brown Colour with a Yallowish bill, the number of these birds increasd upon us as we approach'd the shore. As soon as we got into Soundings we saw Gannets, which we continued to see as long as we were on the bank which stretches off from Cape Lagulas 40 Leagues, and Extends a long shore to the Eastward from Cape False, according to some Charts 160 Leagues; the extent of this Bank is not well known however it is usefull in directing Shipping when to haul in to make the land.

        Wednesday 20th In the  PM saild the Holton Indiaman who saluted  us with a 11 Guns, which Compliment we returnd; this Ship during her stay in  India lost by sickness between 30 and 40 Men and had at this time a good ma[n]y  down with the scurvy, other Ships suffer'd in the same proportion, thus we find  that Ships which have been little more than Twelve Months from England have  suffer'd as much or more by Sickness than we have done who have been out near  three times along, yet their sufferings will hardly if  atall be mentioned or  known in England when on the other hand those of the Endeavour, because  the Voyage is uncommon, will very probable be mentioned in every News paper,  and what is not unlikely, with many additional hardships we never experienced  for such are the disposission of men in general in these Voyages that they are  seldom content with the hardships and dangers which will naturaly occur most  but they must  add others which hardly ever had existence but in their imaginations, by magnifying  the most trifling accidents and circumstances to the greatest hardships, and  unsurmou[n] table dangers without the imidiate interposion of Providence as  if the whole Merit of the Voyage consisted inof the dangers and hardships they underwent,  or that real ones did not happen often enough to give the mind sufficient anxiety;  thus posteriety are thtaught  to look upon these Voyages as hazardous to the highest degree 

        15 April 1771
        Monday 15th None of  the Ships in the Offing are yet arrived. Diserous as we must be of hearing news  from England I determine'd not to wait the arrival of these Ships, but took  the advantage of a breeze of wind from the WSW,  wiegh'd and stood out of the Bay - Saluted with 13 Guns which compliment was  returnd both by the Castle and Dutch Commodore, the Europa saluted us as we  pass'd her, which we returnd, this Ship was to have saild with or before us,  but not likeing the oppertunity she lay fast At 5 in the Evening Anchor'd under  Penguin or Robin Island in 10 fathom water, this Island  Extending from WNW to SSW, distant 11/2 or 2 Miles 
        In the Morning saw a Ship Standing into Table Bay under  English Colours which we took to be an Indiaman- At Noon Latitude Observed 33°..49',  Cape Town So  20° East distant 7 Miles. As we could not sail in the Morning for want of  wind I sent a boat to the Island for a few trifling articles we had forgot to  take in at the Cape, but the people ashore would not permit her to land so that  she return'd as she went and I gave my self no farther trouble about it,  Mr  Banks who was in the Boat was of opinion that it was owing to a mistake made  respecting the rank of the officer commanding the boat, be this as it may it  seems probable that the Dutch do not admit of strangers landing upon this Island  least they should carry off some of those people which for certain crimes they  banish here for life as we were told was done by a Dainish Ship a few years  ago. but they might have a better reason for refuseing our boat to land, for  it is not improbable but what there might be some English Seamen upon this Island  whome they had sent from the Cape while we lay there well knowing that if they  came in my way I should take them on board, and this I am told is frequently  done when any of His Majestys Ships are in the Bay, for it is well known that  the Dutch East India Ships are mostly man'd by foreigners 
        The Cape of Good Hope hath been so often discrib'd by  Authors and is so well known to Europeans that any discriptions I can give of  it may appear unnecessary. however I cannot help observing that most Authors,  particularly the Author of Mr Byrons Voyage,  have heighten'd the picture to a very great degree above what it will bear,  so that a stranger is at once struck with surprise and disapointment for no  Country we have seen this Voyage affords so barren a prospect as this, and not  only so in appearence but in reallity. The land over the Cape which constitutes  the Peninsula form'd by Table Bay and on  the north and False Bay on the South, consists of high barren hills  Mountains, behind these to the East or what may be call'd the Isthmus is a vast  extensive Plain, not one thousand part of which either is or can be cultivated,  the soil consists mostly of a light kind of Sea Sand and  produceth produceing hardly any thing but heath, every Inch of ground  that will bear cultivation is taken up in small Plantation consisting of  Vineyards, Orchards, Kitchen Gardens &Ca hardly  any two lay together, but are despers'd at some distance one from another. If  we may Judge from circumstances the Interior parts of this Country is not more  fertile that is the fertile land bears a very small proportion to the whole,  we were told that they have settlements 28 days Journey inland which is computed  at 900 English Miles, and thus far they bring provisions to the Cape by  land Carriage   it is also said that the Dutch farmers are  so despers'd about the Country that some have no neighbours within  four or five days Journey of them; admiting these to be facts and it will at  once appear that the Country in general cannot be very fertile for it would  be absurd to suppose that they would raise provisions at such an emence distance,  where the trouble and expence of bringing them to market must increase in proportion,  could it be done nearer     The Dutch assign another reason  for being oblige'd to extend their scater'd settlements so far inland, which  is that they never disturb the original Natives but always leave them in peaceable  posession of whatever lands they may have approbated to their own use      which  in some places is pretty extensive and that probably none of the worst, by which  good policy the new settlers very seldom if ever meet with any disturbance from  the natives    on the Contraory they  many of them  become their servants and mix among them and are usefull members to Society.  Notwithstanding the many disadvantages this Country labours under such is the  Industry, Oconomy and good management of the Dutch that not only the necessarys  but all the luxuries of life are rais'd  here in as great abundance and are  sold as cheape if not cheaper then in any part of Europe some few articles  excepted-   Naval Stores however do not want for in  Price any more here than they do at Batavia, these are only sold by the Company  who have a certain fix'd exorbitant price from which the[y] never deviate
        The Inhabitants of the Cape Town are in general well  bred and extremely civile and polite to all strangers, indeed it is their Intrest  so to do for the whole Town may be consider'd as one great Inn fited up for  the reception of all comers and goers  Upon the whole there is perhaps  not a place in the known World that can equal this in affording refreshments  of all kinds to Shipping  The Bay is  Capacious pretty safe and commodious, it lies open to the NW  winds, which winds we are told very Seldom blow strong, but some times sends  in a great sea for which reason Ships moor NE  and SW and in such a manner as to have an  open hawse with NW winds - the SE  winds blows frequently with great Volience but as this is right out of the Bay  it is attended, with no danger   near the Town is a Warfe built of  Wood run out a proper distance into the Sea for the Conveniency of landing and  Shipping off goods    to this warfe the  water is convey'd in pipes and by means of Cocks several boats may fill water  at one and the same time; the company keep several large strong Boats or Hoys,  to carry goods Provisions, Water &Ca to and  from Shipping as well strangers as their own. Fuel is one of the scarcest articles  in this  they have and is brought a long way out of the Country and consi[s]ts of Roots  of Trees Shrubs &CaIndeed  except a few English  Oaks which they have planted this Country is wholy distitute of Wood,  except at too great a distance to be brought to the Cape. In the Article of  Timber Boards  &Ca they are chiefly supply['d] from Batavia     Three of the Winter Months, / viz / from the Middle of May  to the Middle of August the Dutch oblige all their  ships to go do not allow any of their Ships to lay in Table Bay, but  oblige them to go into false Bay where there is a very safe harbour, and every  other conveniency both for their own shipping and strangers and where every  produce of the Country can be had as cheape as at the Cape Town. The Dutch I  am told never diveate from this custom of sending their Ships to False Bay at  this season of the Year notwithstand[ing] there has not a gale of wind happen'd  for many Years that would have put them in the least danger in Table Bay 
        Table Bay is defended by a Square Fort  situated on the East side of the Town close to the Sea beach together with several  other out works and Battries along the Shore of the Bay on each side of the  Town. they are so situated as to be Cannonaded by Shipping and are in a manner  defenceless againest a Superior land force    The Garrison at  present consists of 800 Regulars besides the Militia of the Country which comprehends  every man able to bear arms 
        They can, by means of Signals, alarm the whole country  in a very short time and then every man is emmidiately to repair to the Cape  Town.

        Postscript
        I have made mention in pages Book 1. page [     ] of Two Spanish Ships touching at Georges Island some Months before our arrival there. Upon our arrival at Batavia we were inform'd that two French Ships commanded by the Sieur de Bougainville had put in there about two years before us in their way home from the South Sea: We were told many circumstances relateing to these two Ships all tending to prove behond a doubt that they were the same two as were at Georges Island as above mentioned, which we than conjector'd to be Spaniards being lead into that mistake by the Spanish Iron &Ca we saw a mong the Natives and by Toobouratomta pitching upon the Colours of that nation for those they wore in which he might very easly be mistaken   but as to the Iron &Ca there might be no mistake for we were told that either one or both of these Ships had put into the River de la Plata, where they disposed of all their European goods, brought for that purpose, and purchased others to trade with the Islanders in the South sea, and I think we were told that they also touched upon the Spanish Main in the South Sea, as a proof of their having been tradeing with the Spaniards Bougainvilles Ship had on board a great quantity of Spanish Dollars at the time she arrived at and left Batavia     Some days after our arrival at the Cape of Good Hope, I was told by some French officers lately come from the Island Maritius that Oretti the Native of Georges Island which Bougainville brought away with him was now at the Maritius and that they were going to fit out a Ship to carry him to his Native Country where they intend to make a Settlement, a Hundred Troops for that purpose were to go out in the same Ship: this account is confirmed by a French Gentlemen we have on board who has very lately been at the Maritius. As I have no reason to doubt the truth of this account, it leads me to consid[er] the rout that this Ship must take, which I thank can be no other thant that of Tasmans as far as the coast of New Holland Zeland, and if she fall in with that Coast to the Southward of Cape Fare-well will very probably, put into Admiralty Bay or Queen Charlottes Sound  as Tasmans Track will in some measure point out to her one or the other of these places. I think it is not likely she will venture through the strait, even suppose she discovers it, but will follow Tasma[n]s Track to the North Cape where no doubt she will leave him and follow the direction of the Coast to the  SE South Eastwrd as it will not be out of her way, by which means she will fall in with the Most Fertile part of that Country and as they cannot know any thing of the Endeavours Voyage they will not hesitate a moment to declare themselves the first discoverer    Indeed I can not see how they can think other wise unless the natives inform them to the contrary which they may not choose to understand. The French Officer before spoke of would not allow that Georges Island was first discover'd by the Dolphin tho no doubt Bougainville did   but it was not for the Intrest of his Country nor perhaps his own, to own it, thus this Island tho of little Value may prove a bone of Contention between the two nations, especially if the french make a Settlement upon it, and the Dolphins Voyage and this of ours not published by Authority to fix the prior right of discovery behond dispute 
        Now I am upon the subject of discoveries I hope it will not be taken a Miss if I give it as my opinion that the most feasable Method of making fu[r]ther discoveries in the South Sea is to enter it by the way of New Zeland, first touching and refreshing at the Cape of Good Hope from thence proceed to the Southward of New Holland for Queen Charlottes Sound where again refresh Wood and Water, takeing care to be ready to leave that place by the latter end of September or beginning of October at farthest when you would have the whole summer before you and after geting through the Straight might, with the prevailing Westerly winds, run to the Eastward in as high a Latitude as you please and, if you met with no lands, would have time enough to get round Cape Horne before the summer was too far spent, but if after meeting with no Continent & you had other Objects in View, than haul to the northward and after visiting some of these the Islands already discover'd after which proceed with the trade wind back to the Westward in search of those before Mintioned  thus the discoveries in the South Sea would be compleat
