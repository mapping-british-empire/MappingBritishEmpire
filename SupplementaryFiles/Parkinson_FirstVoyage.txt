        Preface by the Editor.
        Unqualified to address the public, as a writer, I should have contented myself with giving the following journal to the world, without the formality of preface, had not the circumstances, which have delayed, and the arts that have been practised to suppress, its publication, made some explanation on this head particularly necessary.
        The unmerited aspersions which have been cast on me, for asserting a right to pay this tribute to the memory of a deceased brother, and to possess a bequeathed, analienated, pittance of his little fortune, earned at the hazard, and purchased, as I may say, at the expence, of his life, render it indeed incumbent on me to defend a reputation, as injuriously attacked as such dear-bought property has been unjustifiably invaded.
        It Is yet with regret I find myself reduced to this necessity; as the persons, of whom I complain, are men, from whose superior talents and situation in life better things might be expected; however they have, in this instance, been misemployed in striving to baffle a plain, unlettered, man; who, though he thinks it is his duty to be resigned under the dispensations of providence, thinks it also equally his duty to seek every lawful redress from the oppressive acts of vain and rapacious men.
        Sydney Parkinson, from whose papers and drawings the journal, now presented to the public, has been faithfully transcribed and delineated, was the younger son of the late Joel Parkinson, brewer, of Edinburgh, one of the people commonly called Quakers, and, as I am told, well known and esteemed by men of all ranks, in that city. His success in life, however, was by no means equal to that probity of mind and purity of manners, for which he was eminently distinguished; a nerosity of disposition inducing him to be improvidently remiss in prosecuting recovery of his just debts: a circumstance, which, aggravated by other sinister accidents, rendered his family, on his decease, dependent on their own talents and industry for their future support. His son Sydney was put to the business of a woollen-draper; but, taking a particular delight in drawing flowers, fruits, and other objects of natural history, he became soon so great a proficient in that stile of painting, as to attract the notice of the most celebrated botanists and connois seurs in that study. In consequence of this, he was, some time after his arrival in London, recommended to Joseph Banks, Esq. whose very numerous collection of elegant and highly-finished drawings of that kind, executed by Sydney Parkinson, is a sufficient testimony both of his talents and application.
            
      

        
        His recommendation being so effectually confirmed by these proofs of ingenuity and industry, Joseph Banks made him the proposal of going in the capacity of botanical draughtsman, on the then intended voyage to the South-seas. An insatiable curiosity for such researches prevailed over every consideration of danger, that reasonably suggested itself, as the necessary attendant of so long, so perilous, and, to my poor brother, so fatal a voyage! He accordingly accepted Joseph Banks’s offer; though by no means an alluring one, if either views of profit, or perhaps even prudence, had influenced his determination. His appointment, for executing such drawings of singular botanical subjects and curious objects of natural history as might occasionally be met with on the voyage, was settled at eighty pounds per annum. In this capacity, and under this moderate encouragement, Sydney Parkinson undertook to accompany Joseph Banks to the South-Seas; making his will before his departure, in which he bequeathed the salary, which might be due to him at the time of his decease, to his sister Britannia, and appointed me his residuary legatee.
            
      

        
        The occurrences and events that attended the expedition are minutely related in the following sheets: the contents of which, though destitute of the embel-lishments of stile and diction, may serve to shew with what assiduity the curious journalist pursued his observations, and what accuracy he aimed at, not only in the particular walk of his profession of natural history, but also in describing the persons, languages, customs, and manners of the natives of the several islands and continents they visited.
        And here let me be indulged in the spontaneous effusions of a heart still affected with the loss of a loving and a beloved brother, while I declare how I have heard many of the surviving companions of this amiable young man dwell with pleasure on the relation of his singular simplicity of conduct, his sincere regard for truth, his ardent thirst after knowledge, his indefatigable industry to obtain it, and his generous disposition in freely communicating, with the most friendly participation, to others, that information which perhaps none but himself could have obtained. That this is more than probable will appear, on comparing the different manner in which Sydney and his associates passed their time, in the most interesting situa-tions. While many others, for want of a more innocent curiosity or amusement, were indulging themselves in those sensual gratifications, which are so easily ob-tained among the female part of uncivilized nations, we find him gratifying no other passion than that of a laudable curiosity; which enabled him inoffensively to employ his time, and escape those snares into which the vicious appetites of some others betrayed them. It doth equal honour to his ingenuousness and ingenuity, to find him protected by his own innocence, securely exercising his pleasing art amidst a savage, ignorant, and hostile, people; engaging their at-tention by the powers of his pencil, disarming them of their native ferocity, and rendering them even serviceable to the great end of the voyage, in chearfully fur-nishing him with the choicest productions of the soil and climate, which neither force nor stratagem might otherwise have procured.
        By such honest arts and mild demeanor he soon acquired the confidence of the inhabitants of most places, at which the voyagers went on shore; obtaining thus, as as I am well informed, with remarkable facility, the knowledge of many words in various languages, hitherto little, if at all, known in Europe.
            
      

        
        These paved the way also to his success in acquiring a choice and rare collection of curiosities, consisting of garments, domestic utensils, rural implements, instru-ments of war, uncommon shells, and other natural curiosities, of considerable va-lue: of so much value, indeed, as even to seduce men of reputed sense, fortune, and character, to attempt, by means unworthy of themselves, to deprive me of what, after the loss sustained in the death of so deserving a brother, one would think none ought to envy me the gain.
        It has happened otherwise; and I am now to enter on the disagreeable task of submitting to the public, before whom I have been traduced, a relation of the manner in which the greater part of his effects hath been hitherto detained from me, and the use of those I got denied me, through my implicit confidence in false friends, and the specious arts of covetous and designing strangers.
        On the arrival of Joseph Banks in London, about the middle of July, 1771, he informed me, by letter, of the death of Sydney Parkinson, my brother; acquaint-ing me, at the same time, of his having taken possession of his effects, as the only person that could do it*; of which he was ready to give a proper account to his executors. I waited, of course, immediately on Joseph Banks; who appeared to sympathize with me on account of my brother, with whose services he seemed highly satisfied, and declared he suffered a considerable loss by his death; telling me, after a short conversation on the subject, that he was then much confused with a multiplicity of concerns, but that, as soon as his hurry of business was over, he would give me an account of my brother’s effects.
        * I am, however, since informed, that it is usual, in such cases, for the captain of the ship to take possession of the effects of the deceased, causing at the same time a regular inventory to be taken of them before two competent witnesses.
        Being soon after informed, that Joseph Banks had told James Lee, of Ham-mersmith, that my brother had bequeathed to him, James Lee, a journal of the voyage, and some other papers, which were unfortunately lost; I took occasion to ask Joseph Banks about this circumstance, who confirmed it; telling me that he had made a search among the ship’s company for the said journal, but could not find it. At this time he also told me that he expected to get his goods up from the ship in a few days, and that, when they arrived, I should receive the things be-queathed me by my brother; among which he observed there were some curiosities he should be glad to purchase. I replied that when I should receive and be in-clined to part with them, I would give him the preference.
            
      

        
        To delay this design, and, if possible, suppress my book, which was almost ready to appear, Dr. Hawkesworth, whose compilation was not so forward, filed a bill in chancery against me, setting forth that I had invaded his property, by printing manuscripts and engraving designs, which I sold to Joseph Banks, and which Joseph Banks had afterwards sold to him: even Dr. Fothergill supporting this misrepresentation, by affirming that I had made such sale to Mr. Banks, of which he was a witness. On this application an injunction was granted by the court of chancery, to stop the printing and publishing of my work. Nay, Dr. Hawkesworth, not contented with praying for the suppression of my book, modestly desired also to have delivered up to him the printed copies of it, which I had, at the expence of several hundred pounds, prepared to offer the public.
        * As a proof how far Dr. Fothergill did interest himself on this occasion, I beg leave to give an extract of a letter from a relation at Newcastle on the subject.
        Dear Cousin, Newcastle, 29th Jan. 1773.
———— This will inform thee thy favours came duely to hand, and that I was not a little surprized at Mr. Lee’s letter and his change of sentiments respecting Mr. Banks, as his friendship for my late cousin seemed so great, and by thine I find I am the only person who have cause of complaint and whose friendship yet remains unstaggered. —— But now to what I know of Dr. F’s letter to J. K. — The latter called upon me one day and asked me if I knew of any Journal that was printing here, published by my cousin. I told him no; but there was one printing at London, which I expected would be finished by the middle of this month; he then read the Dr’s letter, wherein after saying how ill thou had treated both him and Mr. Banks, he says from the regard he had to his promise, he offered thee .50 to stop the publication, which thou refusedst, as he supposed only through a mercenary view, to extort more money from him; which however he did not offer. || This was the meaning and the words pretty much the same, as well as I can remember, in short he said so much that notwithstanding all I could offer in thy vindication and insisting that the Journal was certainly the property of the fa-mily, as well as every curiosity Cousin had collected in the Voyage, yet the Dr. had stated his case in such terms, that James King looks on thee as highly culpable. Had my cousin at first insisted by the proper method of the Law for his brother’s last will and Effects, as I advised, he would not only have had a great deal more of the Effects, but have saved both Expence and preserved the friendship of the Dr. and Mr. Lee. However if the Book be ready, I hope a Number may be sold so as to defray the Expence and afford thee something over; but am of opinion if they are not out soon, it will be a very great disadvantage. ———— Thy truly affectionate Cousin,
J.GOMELDON.
        || This is not true. The doctor did offer first fifty and afterwards one hundred and fifty pounds.
            
      

        
        Put thus to the trouble and expence of defending a suit in chancery, and the publication of my book being delayed when just ready to appear, I had yet no remedy but that of putting in a full answer to the bill, and praying a dissolution of the injunction. This I at length obtained; the reasons for continuing the injunction not appearing satisfactory to the court, and indeed the pretended transfer of the proper-ty in my brother’s manuscripts, from me to Joseph Banks, and from Joseph Banks to Dr. Hawkesworth, being attended with a circumstance, that, on the very face of it, might reasonably suggest some collusion. This was, that the alledged date of the assignment of such property, from Banks to Hawkesworth, was prior to that of the receipt for the five hundred pounds before-mentioned, given by Stanfield and Britannia Parkinson to Banks, on which the pretended right of the latter to such manuscript was founded. Can it be supposed, that a man of Dr. Hawkes-worth’s discretion and abilities would enter into an engagement of this nature, and make a purchase of such moment, without enquiring into the title of the vender?
        Be this as it may, such is the fact. Indeed the whole purpose of the bill appears to be litigious, and calculated to answer no other end than to delay my publication, till he should get the start of me and publish his own: and this end, to my great damage and loss, it hath answered. In the mean while, and pending the suit between us, it is said that this prudential author sold the property of his own book, for no less a sum than six thousand pounds: a sum that probably would not have been given for it, had not an injunction been obtained against the publication of mine; which contains an authentic journal of the last and principal voyage, viz, that of his majesty’s ship The Endeavour.
        Having thus given a simple unvarnished narrative of the causes of the delay of this publication, I submit its encouragement to the judgement and candour of the public. I cannot help concluding, however, with a short reflection or two on the conduct of my principal oppressors.
        That of Joseph Banks, in particular, argues a high degree of insolence or avarice: possessed, as he was, of so large a collection of curiosities, as well as of my brother’s drawings and designs, was it not covetous in him to desire also the little store bequeathed to me? Might not I cite, on this occasion, the parable of the prophet, and say to this gentleman, as Nathan did unto David, thou art the man? Would it not be with propriety also that I should look on his friend. Dr. Fothergill, as a kind of Ahithophel, by whose pernicious counsel I gave the staff out of my own hands, and by whose officious meddling, to say no worse of it, I have been involved in an expensive and troublesome law-suit?  a proceeding the more reprehensible in him, as it is inconsistent with the peaceful rules of that religious society to which we mutually belong.  As to Dr. Hawkesworth, I shall only say of him, that, for a man of reputed piety, he hath behaved on this occasion with sufficient eagerness after worldly profit; and hath shewn, that, whatever be his theory of moral sentiments, he is practically qualified for the highest post, in which the exer-cise of selfish talents may be displayed, and a desire of inordinate gain be gratified.*
            
      

        
        In respect to the comparative merits of his book and mine, it Is not for me to say any thing. If I have justified myself in the eye of the impartial world for per-sisting in this publication, I shall leave the works of my brother to speak his talents ; ‡ thinking I have paid a proper respect to his memory, though it should be said of his journal, that its only ornament is truth, and its best recommendation, characteristic of himself, its genuine simplicity.
Little-Pultney-Street, Golden Square, 
June 5, 1773.
Stanfield Parkinson.
        * It is said this gentleman hath been lately made an East-India director.
        ‡ Of those works are all, or most, of the drawings, published in Dr. Hawkesworth's narrative of the voyage of the ship Endeavour; although, while the name of the engraver is pompously displayed, that of the draughtsman, or original designer, is meanly and invidiously suppressed.
            
      

        PART I. Comprehending the occurences that happened from the ship's departure from England
        On the 22d of July, 1768, I went on board the ship, ENDEAVOUR, then lying in the Galleons Reach, in the river Thames: on the 3d of August arrived in the Downs; and then sailed for Plymouth Sound, where we anchored on the l4th, and took on board some more sea-men, with a few marines. Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, Mr. Green, with their attendants, also joined us at this port; and our number was then increased to ninety six. Having taken in some more stores and guns, and made a few necessary alterations in the ship, on the 26th of August we failed from Plymouth, with the wind at N. N. W. but it did not continue long in that quarter, but changed to S. W. where it held till the 2d of September, soon after which, we discovered Cape Ortugal. From this time, till the 4th of October, we had variable winds, and then we saw Cape Finistere at about ten leagues distance.
        We continued our course, and met with no material occurrence till the 12th; then we discovered Puerto Santo, about nine leagues off; soon after we saw the island of Madeira, and, on the 13th, in the morning, anchored in Fonchiale Bay.
            
      

        
        This country is very mountainous, yet it is cultivated to the very tops of the mountains; and, being covered with vines, citrons, oranges, and many other fine fruit-trees, it appears like one wide, extended, beautiful, garden. During our stay on this island we resided at Fonchiale, which is the capital. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander lodged at the house of the British consul, W. Cheap, esq. and made several excursions into the country.
        A great part of the best provisions used on this island are imported from England and other parts of Europe, especially such as are eaten at dinner; from whence also they import most of their utensils and wearing-apparel; so that many of the necessaries of life bear a very high price amongst them.
        While the ship lay in this harbour, we had the misfortune of losing Mr. Ware, the chief-mate, who was a very honest worthy man, and one of our best seamen. His death was occasioned by an unlucky accident which happened to him while he stood in the boat to see one of the anchors slipped. The buoy-rope happening to entangle one of his legs, he was drawn overboard and drowned before we could lend him any assistance.
        Having taken in a supply of water, wines, and other necessaries, on the 19th of September we proceeded on our voyage, with the wind at E. S. E. and on the 22d saw the islands of Salvages, at about two leagues and a half distance. They lie between Madeira and the Canaries, are small and uninhabited.
        On the 23d we fell in with the trade-winds at N. E. and on the same day discovered the peak of Teneriffe.
        On the 24th we sailed between that peak and the grand Canary islands. In our passage we saw some land birds, and caught two of them, which were very much like our water wag-tail.
        On the 29th, we had a view of the island of Bona Vista, at about four leagues distance.
            
      

        
        Nothing material occurred from the 29th to the 7th of October; then we had variable winds, with some showers of rain; and the dampness of the air greatly affected all our iron utensils. We caught two sea swallows, and several curious marine animals, of the molusca tribe, such as sea-worms, star-fish, and sea urchins.
        On the 21st, we reached the S.E. trade wind, and continued our course without any remarkable occurrence till the 8th of November; then we discovered land at about eight leagues distance, and spoke with the crew of a Portugueze fishing vessel, of whom Mr. Banks bought a great quantity of fish, among which were dolphins and breams, which afforded much speculation to our naturalists. After having left the vessel, we stood in for the land, which proved to be the Brazils; and coasted along the shore till the 13th, and then sailed into the harbour of Rio de Janeiro, which lies in latitude 22° 56’ south, and longitude 42° 45’ west; but before we arrived in the harbour, the captain had sent Mr. Hicks, the first lieutenant, and the chief mate, in the pinnace, to the viceroy, to obtain a pilot; however, as the wind was fair, the captain ventured to continue sailing on, and was assisted by signals from the forts.
        The viceroy detained the lieutenant and the mate, and sent back the pinnace with three of his own officers in it (of which one was a colonel) but no pilot. The colonel told us, that our officers would only be detained till the ship should be examined, according to custom: we therefore stood forward into the harbour, and anchored near the north end of Ilhos dos Scobros, or Snakes island; but the colonel would not permit any of us to go ashore.
        Our lieutenant had been instructed to evade answering any questions the Portugueze might ask him respecting our destination; or at least to answer them with reserve: the captain thought such questions would be impertinent, as our vessel was a ship of war; and the lieutenant observed these directions.
        The viceroy held a council, the result of which was to prohibit any person coming on shore from our ship; but they condescended to order all necessary supplies to be sent to us. We were displeased on receiving this intelligence, as we had expected to have met with agreeable entertainment on shore. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander appeared much chagrined at their disappointment: but, notwithstanding all the viceroy’s precautions, we determined to gratify our curiosity, in some measure, and having obtained a sufficient knowledge of the river and harbour, by the surveys that we had made of the country, we frequently, unknown to the centinel, stole out of the cabin window at midnight, letting ourselves down into a boat by a rope; and, driving away with the tide till we were out of hearing, we then rowed to some unfrequented part of the shore, where we landed, and made excursions up into the country, though not so far as we could have wished to have done. The morning after we went ashore, my eyes were feasted with the pleasing prospects that opened to my view on every hand. I soon discovered a hedge in which were many very curious plants in bloom, and all of them quite new to me. There were so many, that I even loaded myself with them. We found also many curious plants in the sallading that was sent to us; and desired the people that brought it to procure us, if possible, all the different sorts that grew upon the island.
            
      

        
        We had plenty of fish from the markets every day, of which they are furnished with a great variety.
        We often picked off some curious molusca from the surface of the sea; and also land insects of several kinds alive, which floated round the ship upon the water.
        The country, adjacent to the city of Rio de Janeiro, is mountainous, full of wood, and but a very little part of it appears to be cultivated. The soil near the river is a kind of loam, mixt with sand; but farther up in the country we found a fine black mould. All the tropical fruits, such as melons, oranges, mangoes, lemons, limes, cocoa nuts and plantains, are to be met with here in great plenty. The air, it seems, is but seldom extremely hot, as they have a breeze of wind from the sea every morning; and generally a land wind at night *.
        * S. Parkinson had not been idle from the time he left England, having, as appeared by a letter from him to his brother, finished 100 drawings on various subjects, and taken sketches of many more; which he intended to have finished if he had lived to return.
            
      

        
        On the 7th of December, 1768, our necessary provisions, and other supplies, having been taken on board, we left the harbour of Rio de Janeiro, coasting along the Brazils, and met with nothing worthy of note till the 22d of the same month, except, that in coming out of the harbour, Mr. Flowers, an experienced seaman, fell from the main shrouds into the sea, and was drowned before we could reach him.
        On the 22d, we saw a great many birds of the procellaria genus, in latitude 39° 37’ S  and longitude 49° 16’ W. and we also met with shoals of porpoises of a very singular species.
        On the 23d of December, we observed an eclipse of the moon; and about seven in the morning a bright cloud in the west, from which a stream of fire proceeded: it bore away to the westward, and about two minutes after we heard two loud explosions like that of a cannon; and then the cloud soon disappeared.
        On the 24th, we caught a logger-head tortoise, which weighed one hundred and fifty pounds; and shot several birds, one of which was an albatros, that measured, from the tip of one wing to the other, nine feet one inch; and from the beak to the tail two feet one inch and a half. Some time after, we met with some birds of the same kind that measured fourteen feet from the tips of the wings.
        The thermometer, in the middle of the day, was from 66 to 69; and in the evening 62, when the air was not so dry.
        On the 29th, we saw several parcels of rock weed; and, from this time to the 30th, the weather was very unsettled; the wind sometimes blowing very hard, at others only a moderate gale; and then quite calm.
        For several evenings, swarms of butterflies, moths, and other insects, flew about the rigging, which we apprehended had been blown to us from the shore. Thousands of them settled upon the vessel, Mr. Banks ordered the men to gather them up; and, after selecting such as he thought proper, the rest were thrown overboard; and he gave the men some bottles of rum for their trouble.
            
      

        
        On the 31st, we had much thunder, lightening, and rain, and saw several whales: we saw also some birds about the size of a pigeon, with white breasts and grey beaks.
        On the 4th of January, 1769, we saw a cloud which we took for Pepy’s Island, and made toward it till we were convinced of our mistake. The air at this time was cold and dry, and we had frequent squalls of wind.
        On the 6th, we saw several penguins, with many other sea birds; and, on the 7th, had an exceeding hard gale of wind from S. W. in latitude 51° 25’ S. and longitude 62° 44’ W. We supposed ourselves not far from Falkland’s Islands, but, not knowing their longitude, we could not so readily find them.
        From several circumstances which occurred on the 8th, it was concluded that we had sailed between Falkland’s Islands and the main land; and were in hopes of touching at the former place, from which we designed to have forwarded some letters to Europe.
        On the 11th, we discovered Terra del Fuego; but, having contrary winds, and being apprehensive of danger from the foulness of the ground, which we discovered by sounding, we kept out at sea.
        On the 16th, the wind changing in our favour, we approached the land; and at length anchored in Port Maurice’s Bay, situated in latitude 54° 44’ S. and longitude 66° 15’ W. Some of our principal people went ashore, and found several pieces of brown European broad cloth, in a hut that had been deserted by the natives. Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander collected a great number of plants, shot several birds, and returned to the ship much pleased with their adventure.
        On the 17th we left Port Maurice’s Bay; and, at about one o’clock in the afternoon, anchored in the bay of Good Success.

        The description of the country and natives of Terra del Fuego
        We had not been long arrived before some Indians appeared on the beach at the head of the bay; the captain, Mr. Banks, and Dr. Solander, went on shore, and soon after returned on board with three of them, whom we cloathed in jackets, gave them some bread and beef, part of which they ate, and carried the remainder with them ashore: We gave them also some rum and brandy; but, after tasting it, they refused to drink any more, intimating, by signs, that it burnt their throats. This circumstance may serve to corroborate the opinion of those, who think that water is the most natural, and best drink for mankind, as well as for other animals.
        One of the Indians made several long orations to the rest; but they were utterly unintelligible to every one of us. Another of them seeing the leathern cover of a globe lie in the cabin, found means to steal it, and secrete it under his garment, which was made of a skin of some animal, and carried it ashore, undiscovered, where he had no sooner arrived, than he shewed his prize to the very person it belonged to, and seemed to exult upon the occasion, placing it upon his head, and was highly delighted with it.
        The natives make a very uncouth and savage appearance, [see pl. I.] having broad flat faces, small black eyes, low foreheads, and noses much like those of negroes, with wide nostrils, high cheeks, large mouths, and small teeth. Their hair, which is black and streight, hangs over their foreheads and ears, which most of them had smeared with brown and red paint; but, like the rest of the original inhabitants of America, they have no beard. None of them seemed above five feet ten inches high; but their bodies are thick and robust, though their limbs are small. They wear a bunch of yarn made of guanicas*  wool upon their heads, which, as well as their hair, hangs down over their foreheads. They also wear the skins of guanicas and of seals, wrapped round their shoulders, sometimes leaving the right arm uncovered. Both men and women wear necklaces, [see pl. XXVI. fig. 14] and other ornaments made of a small pearly perriwincle, very ingeniously plaited in rows with a kind of grass. We saw also an ornament made of shells, which was ten yards long. The shells that composed it were of several sizes; the largest, about the size of a damascene stone, were placed at one end, from whence they gradually lessened to the other end of the string, where the shells were not bigger than a pepper corn. The larger ornaments are worn about their waists. Many of both sexes were painted with white, red, and brown, colours, in different parts of their bodies; and had also various dotted lines pricked on their faces. The women wear a flap of skin tied round their loins; and have also a small string round each ancle: they carry their children on their backs, and are generally employed in domestic drudgery.
            
      

        
        * An animal something like a sheep, but of the size of a mule, and has a thick fleece.
        These poor Indians live in a village [see pl. II.] on the south side of the bay, behind a hill; the number of their huts is about thirteen, and they contain near fifty people, who seem to be all the inhabitants of this dreary part of the island, where it is very cold, even in the midst of summer.
        Their huts are made of the branches of trees, covered with guanica and seal skins; and, at best, are but wretched habitations for human beings to dwell in.
        Their food is the flesh of seals and shell-fish, particularly muscles, of which we have seen some very large.
            
      

        
        They use bows and arrows with great dexterity. The former are made of a species of wood somewhat like our beech; and the latter of a light yellow wood feathered at one end, and acuated at the other with pieces of clear white chrystal, chipped very ingeniously to a point. [See pl. XXVI. fig. 26.]
        There are dogs upon this island two feet high, with sharp ears.
        Having seen several rings and buttons upon the natives, we concluded that they must have had some communication with the Indians in the Streights of Magellan; but they appeared to be unacquainted with Europeans.
        The Bay of Good Success is about three miles in extent, from east to west; two miles in breadth; is defended from east winds by Staten-land, Near the shore it is very foul, and full of rocks; abounding with great quantities of sea weed. The soundings are regular from fourteen, to four fathoms; and, at the bottom of the bay, there is a fine sandy beach.

        During our stay on this island, the naturalists collected a great many plants, and other curiosities, most of which are non-descript: but an unfortunate accident happened in one of their excursions; Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, Mr. Buchan, with several attendants, two of whom were negroes, went far up into the country, and at length ascended the hills, which they found covered with snow, and the air upon them so intensely cold, that they staid but a short time. On their return, they missed their way, and wandered about for a considerable time, not knowing whither they went, but at length they found their former track. While the naturalists were searching for plants upon the hill, two negroes and a tailor, who were left to guard the liquor and provision, having made too free with the brandy-bottle, were rendered incapable of keeping pace with the rest of the company, who made all possible speed, hoping to have reached the ship before the day closed in upon them, dreading the consequence of being exposed in a strange land, and an inhospitable clime; but time, that waits for no man, brought on the night, which put an end to their hopes, and excited the most alarming apprehensions: Being out of breath, fatigued, and dispirited, and almost benumbed with cold, particularly Dr. Solander, insomuch that he was unable to walk, and was carried near two hours on their shoulders; and it was thought he would not have survived the perils of the ensuing night. In this hapless situation, they held a consultation on what was best to be attempted for their preservation, till the light of the morning should return; and determined, if possible, to kindle a fire, which they happily effected, gathering together some wood, and, by the help of their fowling pieces, and tome paper, setting it on fire. The cold was so intense, that they found it would not be safe to lie down, lest they should fall asleep, and be frozen to death; where-fore they walked round it all night. The three men who were left behind, being tired, sat down in the woods, and fell asleep, but one of them providentially soon awoke, started up, and, being apprehensive of the imminent danger they were in, attempted to rouse his companions, but they were too far sunk into the sleep of death to be recovered. In this forlorn situation the man could not expect to sur-vive them long, and therefore he fled for his life, hallooing as he went along, in hopes that some of the company would hear him, which, after wandering some time in a pathless wilderness, they happily did, and answered him as loud as their enfeebled voices would admit: Overjoyed at the event, he resumed fresh courage, and, making toward the part from which the sound proceeded, at length came up with them. Touched with sympathy for his companions, he told the company of the condition in which he left them; and they were disposed to have yielded them assistance, but, it being almost dark, there was not any probability of finding them, and the attempt would have been attended with the risque of their own lives, they therefore declined it. However, the next morning, after break of day, they dispatched the man in quest of his companions, whom he at length found frozen to death; but the dog that had been with them all the night had survived them: he found him sitting close by his master’s corpse, and seemed reluctant to leave it; but at length the dog forsook it, and went back to the company; they all set out immediately towards the ship, which they reached about 11 o’clock in the fore-noon, to our great joy, as we had despaired of their return.
        Having furnished ourselves with wood and water, and let down our guns and lumber below deck, to be better prepared for the high gales which we expected in going round Cape Horn; on the 21st of January, 1769, we weighed anchor, and left the Bay of Good Success, and proceeded on our voyage through the Straits of Le Maire, which are formed by Cape Antonio on Staten-land, and Cape Vincent on Terra del Fuego to the north; and on the south by Cape Bartholomew on Staten-land, and a high promontory on Terra del Fuego, passing between them, and are about nine leagues long, and seven broad.
        The land on both sides, particularly Staten-land, affords a most dismal prospect, being made up chiefly of barren rocks and tremendous precipices, covered with snow, and uninhabited, forming one of those natural views which human nature can scarce behold without shuddering. — How amazingly diversified are the works of the Deity within the narrow limits of this globe we inhabit, which, compared with the vast aggregate of systems that compose the universe, appears but a dark speck in the creation! A curiosity, perhaps, equal to Solomon’s, though accompanied with lets wisdom than was possessed by the Royal Philosopher, induced some of us to quit our native land, to investigate the heavenly bodies minutely in distant regions, as well as to trace the signatures of the Supreme Power and Intelligence throughout several species of animals, and different genera of plants in the vegetable system, "from the cedar that is in Lebanon, even unto the hyssop that springeth. out of the wall:"  and the more we investigate, the more we ought to admire the power, wisdom, and goodness, of the Great Superintendant of the universe; which attributes are amply displayed throughout all his works; the smallest object, seen, through the microscope, declares its origin to be divine, as well as those larger ones which the unassisted eye is capable of contemplating; but to proceed [1].
            
      

        
        On the 25th, we saw Cape Horn, at about five leagues distance, which, contrary to our expectations, we doubled with as little danger as the North Foreland on the Kentish coast; the heavens were fair, the wind temperate, the weather pleasant, and, being within one mile of the shore, we had a more distinct view of this coast, than perhaps any former voyagers have bad on this ocean.
        The point of the Cape is very low; and at the S.E. extremity there are several islands, called, by the French, Isles d’Hermitage; and near it are several ragged rocks. The Cape is in latitude 55 48’ S. and longitude 67 40’ W. We sounded in fifty-five fathom, and found round stones, and broken shells.
        On the 30th, we reached to latitude 60° 2’ S. and longitude 73&edg; 5’W. variation 24 54’ E. This was our highest southern latitude; and from thence we altered our course, steering W.N.W. with but little variation, having pleasant weather, and short nights, until the 16th of February, when we had hard gales from W. by S. S. by W. and S. and we continued our course N. W. till the 10th; between that time and the 20th, we had very copious dews, like small showers of rain.
        On the 21st, we saw a great number of tropic and egg birds, and shot two of the former, which had a very beauteous plumage, being a fine white, mingled with a most lively red: their tails were composed of two long red feathers, and their beaks were of a deep red. We found ourselves at this time in latitude 25° 21’ S. and longitude 120°  20’ W. having fair weather, with a dry, serene, and salubrious air.
            
      

        
        Continuing our course N. westerly, between the Dolphin’s first and second track, on the 4th of April, about three o’clock in the afternoon we discovered land; and after two hours sailing we approached near to it. It is a flat island, ex-tending a great length from E. to W. describing the form of a crescent; and has a sand-bank joined to it, on which the surf ran very high. In the middle of the island, there is a large salt lagoon, or lake; and at the east end of it are many palm trees. We saw clouds of smoke ascend from different parts, pro-ceeding, as we apprehended, from sires kindled by the natives, and designed as signals to us. Night came on before we could discover the west end of the island; and not knowing but there might be more islands, we lay-to all night, and the next morning we saw another in latitude 18° 23’, which, on account of a great salt lagoon in the middle of it, we called Lagoon-Isle: Before noon we made another low island, which we called Thumb-cap Island. It stretched a long way, and is made up of several parcels of land joined together by reefs; it has also a lagoon inclosed with a reef, upon which we discovered many canoes; some having ten people in them, and others a lesser number. As we sailed along, the natives followed us, some on the reef, others in canoes, and seemed desirous to have an intercourse with us; but though we beckoned to them, they would not come off. They appeared to be very stout men; their complexion almost black, with short hair, and quite naked, having long lances, or poles, in their hands. Some of them waded up to the neck in water to look at us, but they did not discover any hostile intentions. Their canoes had out-riggers, with mat-sails: and when we put away from the land one of them followed us.
        Upon these islands we saw a variety of verdant trees, amongst which were some palms; and upon the coast, rocks of coral appeared above water. We discovered some of their huts, and several sires burning around them. The land formed a large semicircular bay, and the reef before it the same figure; and the water was as smooth as a mill-pond, and abounded with flying-fish; but, to our surprise we could not reach the bottom of it with 130 fathom of line, at one mile distance from the shore.
            
      

        
        This day we also discovered another low island, which we called Chain Island: It is of an oval figure, consisting of a ridge of coral and sand, with a few clumps of small trees, and had a lagoon in the middle of it. These islands were dedicated to the Royal Society.
        In the morning of the 10th, we saw Osnabrug Island, bearing N. W. by W. half W. about six leagues distant, and, leaving it to the northward, at noon we discovered George’s Island from the main-top mast head, and stood toward it.
        The 12th, the sea being mostly calm in the forenoon, we could get very little nearer land; but many of the Indians came off to us in canoes (one of which was double, and had much carved work upon it) bringing with them cocoa nuts, and apples, to truck for nails, buttons, and beads. These canoes were but just wide enough for one person to sit in the breadth: to prevent them from oversetting, they place out riggers, upon the top of which is fixed a bamboo fishing rod. The people in the canoes were of a pale, tawny, complexion, and had long black hair. They seemed to be very good-natured, and not of a covetous disposition, giving us a couple of cocoa nuts, or a basket of apples, for a button, or a nail.
        While we lay before these islands, we had squalls of wind, some calms, and heavy showers of rain. Toward night we opened the N.W. point, and discovered the island named by the Dolphin’s people, York Island, and called by the natives, as we afterwards learned, Eimayo. A breeze springing up, we lay off and on all that night; and, on the 13th, we made the island of Otaheite, called by the Dolphin’s people George’s Island, which is opposite to York Island. We entered Port Royal harbour, called by the natives Owarrowarrow, and anchored in nine fathom water, within half a mile of the shore. The land appeared as uneven as a piece of crumpled paper, being divided irregularly into hills and valleys; but a beautiful verdure covered both, even to the tops of the highest peaks. A great number of the natives came off to us in canoes, and brought with them bananas, cocoas, bread-fruit, apples, and some pigs; but they were errant thieves; and, while I was busied in the forenoon in trucking with them for some of their cloth, (an account of which will be given hereafter,) one of them pilfered an earthen vessel out of my cabin. It was was very diverting to see the different emotions which the natives expressed at the manoeuvres of our ship. They were very social, and several of them came on board; some of them remembered such of our people as had been there in the Dolphin, and seemed highly pleased at our arrival. The captain and Mr. Banks went on shore; but they returned greatly disappointed, as they could not find the principal inhabitants, and perceived that many of their houses had been taken down since the Dolphin left them.
            
      

        Arrival at and description of the islands and natives of Otaheite
        On the 14th, in the morning, a great number of the natives came to us, round a reef point towards the south, and were very troublesome, attempting to steal every thing they could lay their hands upon: they brought with them only two or three hogs, which they would not exchange for any thing but hatchets. Among the rest who visited us, there were some people of distinction in double canoes; their cloaths, carriage, and behaviour evinced their superiority. I never beheld statelier men, [see pl. III.] having a pleasant countenance, large black eyes, black hair, and white teeth. They behaved very courteously, and expressed some un-easiness at the conduct of the rest. We entertained them in the cabin, and then bent our sails, taking them with us for guides, till we had doubled the point, where we found a fine bay to anchor in. In the afternoon, a small party of us made an excursion into the country, and the inhabitants followed us in great numbers. At length, being fatigued, we sat down under the shade of some lofty trees, the undulation of whose leaves rendered it very cool and pleasant. The high cocoas, and the low branching fruit trees, formed an agreeable contrast; while the cloud-topt hills, appearing between them, added to the natural grandeur of the prospect. The inhabitants stood gaping around us while we feasted on the cocoa-nut milk, which afforded us a pleasing repast.

        On the 15th, in the morning, several of the chiefs, one of which was very corpulent, came on board from the other point, and brought us some hogs; we pre-sented them with a sheet and some trinkets in return; but some of them took the liberty of stealing the top of the lightening-chain. We went ashore, and pitched the markee: Mr. Banks, the captain, and myself, took a walk in the woods, and were afterwards joined by Mr. Hicks, and Mr. Green. While we were walking, and enjoying the rural scene, we heard the report of some fire-arms, and presently saw the natives fleeing into the woods like frighted fawns, carrying with them their little moveables. Alarmed at this unexpected event, we immediately quitted the wood, and made to the side of the river, where we saw several of our men, who had been left to guard the tent, pursuing the natives, who were terrified to the last degree; some of them skulked behind the bushes, and others leaped into the river.  Hearing the shot rattle amongst the branches of the trees over my head, I thought it not safe to continue there any longer, and fled to the tent, where I soon learned the cause of the catastrophe.
        A centinel being off his guard, one of the natives snatched a musket out of his hand, which occasioned the fray.  A boy, a midshipman, was the commanding officer, and, giving orders to fire, they obeyed with the greatest glee imaginable, as if they had been shooting at wild ducks, killed one stout man, and wounded many others.  What a pity, that such brutality should be exercised by civilized people upon unarmed ignorant Indians!
        When Mr. Banks heard of the affair, he was highly displeased, saying, "If we quarrelled with those Indians, we should not agree with angels;"  and he did all he could to accommodate the difference, going across the river, and, through the mediation of an old man, prevailed on many of the natives to come over to us, bearing plantain-trees, which is a signal of peace amongst them; and, clapping their hands to their breasts, cried Tyau, which signifies friendship. They sat down by us; sent for cocoa nuts, and we drank the milk with them. They laughed heartily, and were very social, more so than could have been expected, considering what they had suffered in the late skirmish. — Have we not reason to conclude, that their dispositions are very flexible, and that resentment, with them, is a short-lived passion?
        The horizon not being clear, we could not make any astronomical observations; and therefore did not attempt to go round the point to the other bay. The weather, however, since we arrived here, has generally been clear, with now and then a slight shower of rain, and the wind E. N. E.
            
      

        
        Mr. Buchan was seized with an epileptic fit this morning, and remained insensible all day.
        On the 16th, but few of the Indians came to us in their canoes, being, we apprehended, somewhat alarmed at what had happened the day before. We got the ship moored; and Mr. Banks and the captain went ashore to confer with the natives, and to prevail on them to traffic with us again.
        On the 17th, early in the morning, Mr. Buchan died, and we went out in the pinnace and long boat to the offing, and buried him.
        Two of the chiefs came on board this morning, bringing with them a present of hogs, fowls, plantains, bananas, cocoas, bread-fruit and a sort of yams. At this season the cocoas are young, many of them yielding a quart of fine milk, and the shell is eatable, but they have no kernel.
        We pitched one of the ship’s tents † and went into the valley, where an Indian invited me to his hut, and sent his son up a tall cocoa-tree to gather nuts: he climbed it very dexterously, by tying his feet together with a withe, then clasping the tree, and vaulting up very swiftly. They admired every thing they saw about me, and I gave them a few trinkets.
        On the 18th, in the night, we lay on shore, and were much incommoded with a species of flies with which the island swarms; insomuch that, at dinner time, it was one person’s employ to beat them off with a feather fly-flap, the handle of which is made of a hard brown wood, rudely carved, and somewhat resembles a human figure.
        † As we were to make the observation of the transit on this island, we built a temporary fort for our accommodation on shore: [see pl.IV.] It had a fosse, with palisadoes, next the river: guns and swivels mounted on the ramparts; and within, we had an observatory, an oven, forge, and pens for our sheep. Centinels were also appointed as usual in garrisons, and military discipline observed. The sandy ground, on which the fort stood, was very troublesome when the wind was high.

        On the 20th, one of their chiefs, named Tubora Tumaida, whom we called Lycurgus, with his wife and son, came to visit and dine with us; While we were at dinner, one of his attendants made up a dish with some garbage which they brought with them, mixing it with cocoa nut liquor in a shell, and it tasted like fowens ‡  This seemed to be a favourite dish with them, but we could not relish it. They have also a kind of food like wheat flour in appearance, of which Lycurgus brought a small quantity, and mixed that also with cocoa nut liquor; and, dropping two or three hot stones into it, he stirred it about till it formed a strong jelly: on tasting it we found it had an agreeable flavour, not unlike very good blanc-mange. These people make up various kinds of paste, one of which, called Makey Poe Poe, is made of fermented bread-fruit, and a substance called Meiya, mixt with cocoa-nut milk, and baked, tastes very sweet. In making these pastes, they use a pestle made of a hard black stone, a kind of basaltes, with which they beat them in a wooden trough. See pl. XIII. fig. 10.
        ‡ A kind of flummery made of oatmeal.
            
      

        
        The mode of dressing their food too is very singular: they make a hole in the ground, and, placing stones in it, kindle a sire upon them; and when they are sufficiently heated, they sweep off the ashes, and then lay their food upon them. At their meals the married women ate apart from the men, and we could not prevail on them to join us. The men, especially, seemed to like the manner of our eating, and handled knives and forks very well. Hogs and fowls are not very plentiful amongst them; yams, and the best bananas, are very scarce in this island, the natives bring down but few of either fort, and eat of them very sparingly. When the natives want to make a fire, they take a piece of light wood, make a groove in it, and rub along that with another piece till the small dust catches fire: This is very laborious, and requires a considerable time to effect it.
        On the 21st we went round the point, and met with Lycurgus sitting on the ground, with his wife by his side, having a canoe covering, which he brought there on purpose to be near us: he gave us a hearty welcome; and, to divert us, ordered two of his boys to play on their flutes, while another sang a sort of melancholy ditty, very well suited to the music. Lycurgus is a middle-aged man, of a chearful, though sedate, countenance, with thick black frizzled hair, and a beard of the same kind: his behaviour and aspect had something of natural majesty in them.  I shewed him some of my drawings, which he greatly admired, and pronounced their names as soon as he saw them. These people have a peculiar me-thod of staining their garments: a girl that was present shewed me the whole process, which is as follows:—— She took the young leaves of a convolvulus unfoliated, and then broke off the tops of a small fig, of a reddish hue, and squeezed out of it a milky fluid, which she spread on a leaf, rubbing it gently to mix it with the juice of the leaf, and then it became red; this she soaked up with the leaf of a solanum, and then daubed it upon some cloth: the colour is good, but whether it will stand, I am unable to determine. They make a variety of neat basket-work [see a figure of one of their baskets, pl. XIII. fig. 6.] for holding of their colours; the simplest of all is made of the leaf of a cocoa-nut, which they plait together, and gather up on each side: they also make a kind of bonnet [see pl. VIII. fig. 4.] of the same materials. They do not seem very fond of their deaths, of which they have a variety of colours, but wear them sometimes one way, and sometimes another, as their humour is. Persons of distinct on amongst them wrap a number of pieces of cloth about them; and that which is of a carmine colour is only worn by the superior class. The people in general are very fond of ear-rings, and will exchange for them what they deem the most valuable of their effects. Some of their ear-rings [see pl. XIII. fig. 13 and 14] are made of mother-of-pearl cut into various figures, which are tied to their ears by human hair, curiously plaited by the women. They also tie three pearls together with hair, and hang them on their ears. [See ibid. fig. 26.]
            
      

        
        The cloth, worn by the natives of this island, is of a very singular kind, being made of the bark of a small tree which contains a glutinous juice, some of which we saw in our excursions. The mode of manufacturing it is very simple, though very laborious, and is mostly performed by women. After the bark has been soaked in water for a few days, they lay it upon a flat piece of timber, and beat it out as thin as they think proper with a kind of mallet of an oblong square, [see pl. XIII. fig. 5.] each side of which is cut into small grooves of four different sizes: they begin with that side where they are the largest, and end with the finest, which leaving longitudinal stripes upon the cloth, makes it resemble paper. These people have garments also made of matting, [see pl. IX.] which are chiefly worn in rainy weather.
            
      

        
        The rates, or terms, on which we trafficked with the natives, were a spike for a small pig; a smaller for a fowl; a hatchet for a hog; and twenty cocoa-nuts, or bread-fruit, for a middling-sized nail.
        When the natives beckon to any person at a distance, contrary to our mode they wave their hands downwards, and when they meet a friend, or relation, whom they have not seen for some time, they affect to cry for joy, but it seems to be entirely ceremonial.
        The tide rises and falls scarce afoot in the harbour; but the surf runs high. The inhabitants are very expert swimmers, and will remain in the water a long time, even with their hands full. They keep their water on shore in large bam-boos, and in them they also carry up salt-water into the country. The boys drag for fish with a sort of net made of convolvulus leaves; and sometimes catch them with hooks made of mother of pearl oysters, large pinna marina, and other shells; and the shapes of them are very singular. They have also some made of wood, which are very large; [see figures of several of them, pl. XIII. fig. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.] They fish without bait, but the fish are attracted the soonest by such hooks as are made of glittering shells. When they throw their hooks, they row their canoes as fast as possible: sometimes they make use of a decoy made of the backs of cowries, and other shells, which are perforated, and tied together in the shape of a fish, making a head to it with a small cowrey; and the tail is formed of grass ingeniously plaited. At a little distance under this decoy, hangs the hook: [see pl. XIII. fig. 15 and 25.] To sink their lines, they make use of bone, or 2 piece of spar, which they sometimes carve. See ibid. fig. 16, 17.
        The chief food of the natives is the bread-fruit and bananas, which they peel and scrape with a sharp shell; but they eat sparingly of flesh, and of fish in general; but of the latter, sometimes alive, or raw; and, as they have no salt, they dip their meat into salt water. The natives, it seems, are very subject to the itch, and other cutaneous eruptions, which is the more to be wondered at as their diet consists principally of vegetables. They often move from one part to another in their canoes, carrying with them all their household stuff. Sometimes they deep all night in their canoes *,  but those used for that purpose are made double, and have thatched awnings over them.
        * The women sometimes row the canoes.
            
      

        
        Tobiah, Obereah’s favourite, being at dinner with us, and not seeming to like our provision, which was pork-pie, remembering that we had a large cuttle-fish, we ordered it to be brought; Tubora Tumaida coming in the mean time, although he said his belly was full, immediately seized on it as if it had been a dainty morsel, and, with another man, ate much of it quite raw; and having the rest roasted, he ate the greatest part of it; the remainder he put into two cocoa nuts, and sent it home with great care; so that, to all appearance, they value this fish, as much as some Englishmen do turtle, or a haunch of venison. When this fish was dressed it ate like stewed oysters, but not so tender. I have been told that this fish makes excellent soup. These people also are fond of dog’s-flesh, and reckon it delicious food, which we discovered by their bringing the leg of a dog roasted to sell. Mr. Banks ate a piece of it, and admired it much. He went out immediately and bought one, and gave it to some Indians to kill and dress it in their manner, which they did accordingly. After having held the dog’s mouth down to the pit of his stomach till he was stifled, they made a parcel of stones hot upon the ground, laid him upon them, and singed off the hair, then scraped his skin with a cocoa shell, and rubbed it with coral; after which they took out the entrails, laid them all carefully on the stones, and after they were broiled ate them with great go&ucirc;t; nor did some of our people scruple to partake with them of this indelicate repast. Hav-ing scraped and washed the dog’s body clean, they prepared an oven of hot stones, covered them with bread-fruit leaves, and laid it upon them, with liver, heart and lungs, pouring a cocoa-nut full of blood upon them, covering them too with more leaves and hot stones, and inclosed the whole with earth patted down very close to keep in the heat. It was about four hours in the oven, and at night it was served up for supper: I ate a little of it; it had the taste of coarse beef, and a strong disagreeable smell; but Captain Cook, Mr. Banks, and Dr. Solander, commended it highly, saying it was the sweetest meat they had ever tasted; but the rest of our people could not be prevailed on to ate any of it. We have invented a new dish, which is as much disliked by the natives, as any of theirs is by us. Here is a species of rats, of which there are great numbers in this island; we caught some of them, and had them fried; most of the gentlemen in the bell-tent ate of them, and commended them much; and some of the inferior officers ate them in a morning for breakfast.
            
      

        
        On the 27th, we saw a very odd ceremony performed; Tiropoa, one of Tubora Tumaida’s wives, after weeping, and expressing some emotions of sorrow, took a shark’s tooth from under her cloaths, and struck it against her head several times, which produced a copious discharge of blood; then, lamenting most bitterly, she articulated some words in a mournful tone, and covered the blood with some pieces of cloth; and, having bled about a pint, she gathered up as much of it as she could, threw it into the sea, and then assumed a chearful countenance, as if nothing had happened. This, it seems, is a ceremony generally performed by widows after the decease of their husbands.
        This morning a woman, a fat, bouncing, good-looking dame, whom we found the queen, having a great quantity of their cloth of all colours, made us a visit, and a present.
        Tootahau, the king of the island, whom we called Hercules, too, and all his family, came and brought us presents, which we kindly accepted.
        On the 30th, the weather being fair, we made a tour in the country, which was very pleasant, and met with several rare plants, which afforded much agreeable amusement to our botanical gentlemen.
        On the 2d of May, we missed the astronomical quadrant, it having been brought on shore the day before, in order to make observation of the transit of Venus: several men were immediately dispatched into the country to search for it; and they were informed, by some of the natives, that it had been carried through the woods to the eastward. The captain, Mr. Banks, and Mr. Green, with some other of our men, Tubora Tumaida, and a few of the natives, all armed, set out in pursuit of it. Tootahau, the king, and several canoes, were detained till they returned. While they were on this expedition, I walked out to the east, in the evening, and was almost stunned with the noise of the grasshoppers, with which this island abounds. At length I came to a large open place, on the side of which I saw a long house; and in the area many of the natives assembled, having brought with them large baskets of bread-fruit: some of them were employed in dividing them, and others carried away whole baskets full; so that it had the appearance of a market of bread-fruit. Near to this opening, there was another long house, where, it seems, they coloured their cloth, of which I bought a few pieces, and returned to the fort. About eight o’clock in the evening, the party, that went out in quest of the quadrant, came back, having happily obtained it by the assistance of Tubora Tumaida. Some of the natives had taken it to pieces, and divided it amongst them, but had done it no material damage. It was stolen by a man named Moroameah, ser-vant to Titaboreah, one of their chiefs. They also found a pistol, which one of the natives had stolen some time before. Tootahau wept while the party was absent, and was much alarmed on the occasion, apprehending that he should be killed if the quadrant could not be found; and had sent for two hogs to appease us. Oboreah, the queen, fled from us; nor would any of the natives come to market. When Tubora Tumaida, and his party, who accompanied Mr. Banks, returned, and saw Tootahau confined, they set up the most doleful lamentation imaginable; but they were soon pacified by the assurances made them that we designed them no injury.
            
      

        
        On the 4th, very few people came to market with provisions, having been intimidated by the detention of their king Tootahau.
        Some of the natives gave us an account of many neighbouring islands, to the number of nineteen, and shewed us one of them from a hill, which was Yoole Etea.
        Most of the natives of this island smell strong of the cocoa oil, and are of a pale brown complexion, mostly having black hair, and that often frizzled; black eyes, flat nose, and large mouth, with a chearful countenance; they all wear their beards, but cut off their mustachios, [see pl. VIII. fig. I.] are well made, and very sturdy, having their bellies in general very prominent; and are a timorous, merry, facetious, hospitable people. There are more tall men among them than among any people I have seen, measuring six feet, three inches and a half; but the women in general are small compared with the men. [See pl.V.] They must be very honest amongst them-selves, as every house is without any fastening. Locks, bolts, and bars are peculiar to civilized countries, where their moral theory is the best, and their moral practices too generally of the worst; which might induce a celebrated writer to conclude, though erroneously, that mankind, upon the whole, are necessarily rendered worse, and less happy, by civilization, and the cultivation of the arts and sciences. Nature’s wants, it is true, are but few, and the uncivilized part of mankind, in general, seem contented if they can acquire those few. Ambition, and the love of luxurious banquets, and other superfluities, are but little known in the bar-barous nations: they have, in general, less anxious thought for the morrow, than civilized; and therefore feel more enjoyment while they partake of heaven’s bounty in the present day. Unaccustomed to indulgences in cloathing and diet, which Europeans have carried to an extreme, they are less subject to diseases; are more robust; feel less from the inclemencies of the seasons, and are, in constitu-tion, what the ancient Britons were before their civilization. Unhappily for us, the athletic constitution of our ancestors is not to be found amongst us, being enervated by excesses of various kinds; while diseases, the effect of intemperance and debaucheries, contaminate our blood, and render them hereditary amongst our offspring.

        The natives huts are inclosed by a low fence made of reeds; and the ground within them is very neatly bedded with a kind of straw, upon which they lay mats to sleep on; and, for a pillow, they have a four-legged stool, joined at the bottom, which is made out of a solid piece of wood; and the only tools they have to work with are made of stones, or shells, as they had no iron upon the island until the Dolphin arrived. [See pl. XIII. fig. 7.]
        These huts are built at a considerable distance from each other; to that the island looks like one continued village, and abounds with cocoa*, bread-fruit, and apple-trees; the fruit of which drops, as it were, into their mouths; and may be the cause that they are an indolent people: Were they inclined to industry provisions might be found in greater plenty amongst them; and, by proper cultivation, the fruits of the island would not only be increased, but their quality might be improved. They seem, however, as contented with what is spontaneously produced, as if they had attained to the ne plus ultra, and are therefore happier than Europeans in general are, whose desires are unbounded. When the men are at work, they wear only a piece of cloth round their middle, which they call maro: at other times they wear garments which they call purawei, and teepoota about their bodies, with a kind of turban on their heads; and, in walking, they carry a long white stick in one of their hands, with the smallest end uppermost.
        * I saw some stalks of cocoa-nuts which were as heavy as I could lift which surprised me the more as the stalks were very tender.
            
      

        
        These people go to war in large canoes, at one end of which there is a kind of stage erected, supported by four carved pillars, and is called tootee. Their weapons are a kind of clubs, and long wooden lances. They have also bows and arrows. The former are made of a strong elastic wood. The arrows are a small species of reed, or bamboes, pointed with hard wood, or with the sting of the ray-fish, which is a sharp-bearded bone. [See pl. XIII. fig. 13.] They also make use of slings, [see ibid. fig. I.] made of the fibres of the bark of some tree, of which, in general, they make their cordage too: some of them, as well as their slings, are neatly plaited. Their hatchets, or rather adzes, which they call towa, are made by tying a hard black stone, of the kind of which they make their paste-beaters, to the end of a wooden handle; and they look very much like a small garden hoe: and the stone part is ground or worn to an edge. [See pl. XIII. fig. 9.] The making of these stone-instruments must be a work of time, and laborious, as the stone of which they are made is very hard. The natives have maros, or pieces of cloth, which reach up from the waist, to defend them from the lances, or bunches of hair curiously plaited. They also wear teepootas upon their heads, and taowmees, or a kind of breast-plate, hung about their necks; [see pl. XI.] large turbans too, in which they stick a small bunch of parrot’s feathers; [see pl. XIII. fig. 12.] and sometimes use what they call a whaow, which is a large cap of a conical figure. In their heivos, or war-dances, they assume various antic motions and gestures, like those practised by the girls when they dance taowree whaow,* playing on a clapper made of two mother-of-pearl shells; and make the ephaita, or wry mouth, [see pl. VII. fig. 2.] as a token of defiance: they also join their hands together, moving them at the same time, and clap the palms of their hands upon their breasts near their shoulders. When they sight in their boats, they generally throw a string to one another to fasten the canoes together; and the men who are employed in doing this are never struck at †.
        * A kind of diversion.
        † We saw two men who had been pierced through the skull by stones from a sling; the wounds were healed up, but had left a large operculum.

        The natives cut their hair in various forms. When their nearest relations die, some of them cut it off entirely, and go bare-headed; others leave a border all round the head; and others cut it into circles; while some have only a circular piece cut off the crown like a priest’s tonsure; others still prefer another mode, leaving the hair upon the crown of the head, and cut off all the rest. All this they perform with a shark’s tooth, which cuts it very close: they also shave with a shark’s tooth fitted to a piece of coarse shell. The natives are accustomed to mark themselves in a very singular manner, which they call tataowing; [see pl. VII. fig. 1.] this is done with the juice of a plant; and they perform the operation with an instrument having teeth like a comb, dipped in the juice, with which the skin is perforated. [See pl. XIII. fig. 2, 3, and 4.] Mr. Stainsby, my-self, and some others of our company, underwent the operation, and had our arms marked: the stain left in the skin, which cannot be effaced without destroying it, is of a lively bluish purple, similar to that made upon the skin by gun-powder. These people have invented a musical instrument, somewhat like a flute, [see pl. XIII. fig. 8. and pl. IX.] which they blow into through their noses; but their notes, which are but very few, are rude and ungrateful. Their dances are not less sin-gular than their music; for they twist their bodies into many extravagant postures, spread their legs, set their arms a-kimbo, and, at the same time, distort the muscles of their faces, and twist their mouths diagonally, in a manner which none of us could imitate. [See pl. VII. fig. 2.]
        Polygamy is not allowed amongst them; but the married women have not a very delicate sense of modesty; their husbands will allow you any liberty with their wives, except the last, which they do not approve. Most of our ship’s company procured temporary wives amongst the natives, with whom they occasionally cohabited; an indulgence which even many reputed virtuous Europeans allow themselves, in uncivilized parts of the world, with impunity; as if a change of place altered the moral turpitude of fornication: and what is a sin in Europe, is only a simple innocent gratification in America; which is to suppose, that the obligation to chastity is local, and restricted only to particular parts of the globe.
            
      

        
        It is customary for the women to wear garlands of flowers on their heads, [see pl. VIII. fig. 1, 2.] which are composed of the white palm-leaves gathered from the spathas from which the flower proceeds. They also gather a species of gardenia, as soon as they open, and put them in their ears. Both sexes are very cleanly; they wash themselves in the river three times a day; and their hands and teeth after every meal.
        The children of both sexes are remarkably kind to one another, and, if any thing be given them, will, if possible, equally divide it amongst them.
        On the fifth, the captain and Mr. Banks, with some others, went to the west, and waited upon Tootahau, and some other of the chiefs, who, it was supposed, had taken affront, as the people did not bring fruit, as usual, to market. They received them kindly, and entertained them with wrestling and dancing: when they returned to the ship, Tootahau, their king, came along with them, brought a barbecued-hog, and the captain made him a present.
        On the sixth, being the next day, the natives brought their fruits to market as usual.
        In walking through the woods we saw the corpse of a man laid upon a sort of bier, which had an awning over it made of mats, supported by four sticks; a square piece of ground around it was railed in with bamboos, and the body was covered with cloth. These burial places are called Morai.
        This day we also saw them polishing their canoes, which was done with the madrepora fungites, a species of coral, or sea mushroom, with which they also polish the beams of their houses.

        On the 8th, Mr. Mollineux went in the long-boat to the east to buy some hogs. but could not get any: the people told them that they belonged to Tootahau, which evinced the superiority of that man.
        We saw a man this day of a very fair complexion, with ruddy nose and cheeks, having the hair of his head, beard, eye-brows, and eye-lashes, quite white, insomuch that he was a lusus naturae amongst them [2].
        On the 13th, as Mr. Banks sat in the boat, trading with them as usual, we saw a very odd ceremony performed: — Some strangers came up, to whom the rest gave way, making a lane for them to pass through: the first person in the procession presented Mr, Banks with a small bunch of parrot’s feathers, with some plantain, and malape-leaves, one after another. A woman passed along the next, having a great many clothes upon her, which she took off, and, spreading them upon the ground, turned round, and exposed herself quite naked: more garments being handed to her, by the company, she spread them also upon the ground, and then exposed herself as before; then the people gathered up all her clothes, took leave, and retired.
        On the 14th, we saw a person who had the appearance of an hermaphrodite.
        On the 15th, we had but a slight sea breeze, and the weather was very sultry, though the clouds hung upon the mountains, and we expected some rain; we had some puffs of wind from the mountains, that raised the sand in little clouds, which covered every thing, and rendered our situation still more disagreeable. In the evening we saw a remarkable large ring round the moon.
        On the 16th, it rained very hard, and there were two rainbows. We hauled the Sein in several distant places, but caught no fish.
        On the 17th, the centinel fired at one of the natives, who came before it was light with an intent to steal some of the casks, which was the second offence; but the powder flashed in the pan, and the man escaped with his life.
            
      

        
        On the 20th, but few of the natives came to market, having been prevented by the rain.
        On the 22d, it rained very hard, accompanied with thunder and lightening, more terrible than any I had ever heard, or seen, before. It rained so hard that the water came through the markee, and wetted every thing in it; and we were much afraid the ship would have suffered by the storm, but she providentially escaped.
        On the third of June, it being very fair, the astronomers had a good opportunity of making an observation of the transit. Mr. Banks, and a party, went to Eimayo, and another party to the east, to make observations at the same time. Mr. Banks returned with two hogs, which he got from the king of Eimayo.

        The island and natives of Otaheite (cont.)
        Dr. Solander, Mr. Banks, and several others, went to visit Tootahau, to see if they could obtain any hogs; and, after going much farther than where he usually resides, they met with him, and queen Oboreah: they treated them with fair promises, and invited them to stay the night with them, which they accepted; but, in the morning, some missed their stockings, others their jackets and waistcoats, amongst the rest, Mr. Banks lost his white jacket and waistcoat, with silver frogs, in the pockets of which were a pair of pistols, and other things: they enquired for them, but could get no account of them, and they came away greatly dissatisfied, having obtained but one pig.
        On the 12th, we received an account from the natives respecting two ships that had been on their coast; and we gathered from them that the crew were Spaniards, and that they had introduced the lues venerea amongst them ‡
        On the 15th, the oven-rake was stolen, which, joined to the other things that had been pilfered from us by some of the natives, and the insolent treatment Mr. Monkhouse met with, determined the captain to seek redress; he seized twenty-seven double canoes, with sails, which happened to be at the point, in the morning, some of which came from another island; and he threatened to burn them if the stolen things should not be returned. Before noon they brought back the rake, but we had no account of the rest; and the canoes were still kept in custody. Tootahau was much displeased, and would not suffer any of the natives to supply us with bread-fruit, cocoa-nuts, or apples. At this time the weather was very wet; P. Briscoe, one of Mr. Banks’s servants, was very bad of a nervous fever, and we had but little hopes of his recovery, having been, by a long course of sickness, reduced to very great weakness; and, in this hot climate, it is a long time before an European recovers his strength, as I have known by experience.
        On the 19th, in the evening, after dark, Oboreah, the queen, and several of her attendants, came from Opare, Tootahau’s palace, in a double canoe, laden with plantains, bread-fruit, and a hog; but brought none of the stolen things with them, pleading, that Obade, her gallant, had stolen them, and was gone off with them. Mr. Banks received her very coolly; nor would suffer them to lie in the markee, he being already engaged; and the captain refused their presents, at which the queen appeared very sorrowful. Mr. Banks and the rest, went to-bed; and the whole tribe of the natives would have lain in the bell-tent, but I would not suffer them, and sent them away. The next morning they returned to the tent, and captain Cook altered his resolution, and bought some of their fruit. The queen behaved very haughtily, yet Mr. Banks agreed they should lie in his markee in the day-time. Two of her attendants were very assiduous in getting themselves husbands, in which attempt they, at length, succeeded. The surgeon took one, and one of the lieutenants the other: they seemed agreeable enough till bed-time, and then they determined to lie in Mr. Banks’s tent, which they did accordingly: but one of the engaged coming out, the surgeon insisted that she should not sleep there, and thrust her out, and the rest followed her, except Otea Tea, who whined and cried for a considerable time, till Mr. Banks led her out also. Mr. Monkhouse and Mr. Banks came to an eclaircissement some time after; had very high words, and I expected they would have decided it by a duel, which, however, they prudently avoided. Oboreah, and her retinue, had gone to their canoe, and would not return; but Mr. Banks went and staid with them all night.
        ‡ These ships, we afterwards learned at Batavia, were fitted out by the French, and commanded by M. Bougainville.
            
      

        
        This day, the princess Tetroah Mituah’s canoes were taken, laden with presents for us; but, as captain Cook knew she was innocent, he let her have her canoes again.
        On the 21st, in the morning, many of the natives came to us with presents of various kinds; but, though called presents, they were all paid for. Our tent was nearly filled with people; and, soon after, Amoa, who is chief of several districts on the other side of the island, also came to us, and brought with him a hog. As soon as he appeared, the natives uncloathed themselves to the waist; which mark of obeisance to their superiors we had not observed before, but judged it was usually shewn to every person of distinguished rank amongst them. This man Oboreah called her husband, and Toobaiah his brother; but there is little regard to be paid to what they say. A woman, called Teetee, came from the west and presented a very fine garment to the Captain, of a bright yellow in the ground, bordered with red: in the middle of it were many crosses, which we apprehended they had learned from the French.
            
      

        
        On the 23d, in the morning, we missed one of our men, a Portugueze, whom we had taken in at Rio de Janeiro; enquiring among the Indians, we learned that he was at Opare with Tootahau; and one of them offered to go and bring him back to us, which he accordingly did the same night. The account which he gave on his return was, That three men came to him crying Tyau, which is the watch-word, amongst them, for friendship, and then carried him from the fort, and dragged him to the top of the bay, where they stripped him, forced him into a boat, and took him to Opare, where Tootahau gave him some cloaths, and persuaded him to stay with him. This account we believed to be true, for, as soon as is was known amongst the natives that he was rescued, all of them in the bell-tent moved off, and went to Opare in great haste, being apprehensive that we should reck our revenge on them.
        On the 26th, the captain and Mr. Banks set out to make a survey of the island, and began with the west side.
        On the 27th, we saw a favourite game, which the young girls divert themselves with in an evening dividing themselves into two parties, one standing opposite to the other, one party throws apples, which the other endeavours to catch. The right of the game I am not acquainted with; but now-and-then one of the parties advanced, stamping with their feet, making wry mouths, straddling with their legs, lifting up their cloaths, and exposing their nakedness; at the same time repeating some words in a disagreeable tone. Thus are they bred up to lewdness from their childhood, many of them not being above eight or nine years of age.
        The 28th; this evening the captain and Mr. Banks returned from their western excursion.  And,
        On the 29th, early in the morning, they set out for the east part of the island, to make a survey of it.
            
      

        
        Provisions of all kinds were, at this time, very scarce; and some of the inhabitants almost famished. This scarcity was principally occasioned by supplying us too liberally with bread-fruit, which obliged the inhabitants to eat ehee, roasted, in its stead, which tastes much like our chesnut: but, as the bread-tree was full of young fruit, we were in hopes that they would soon have another crop to relieve them.
        On the first of July, in the evening, the captain and Mr. Banks returned from surveying the island, which they found to be larger than they expected, and brought with them several hogs, and could have obtained more with more hatchets. In their tour round the island, they discovered that it consists of two peninsulas, con-nected by a low marshy isthmus, through which Mr. Banks supposed canoes might be drawn. From Port-Royal, which is situate at the west end, the coast extends E. by S. about nineteen miles to a reef of three small islands, forming a bay, called Society-Bay. From this the land inclines into a deep bay, at the isthmus or juncture of the two divisions, of which the smallest is nearly oval, and surrounded by a reef, which runs parallel to the shore at about two miles distance: This has several apertures, or passages, which afford safe anchorage within. The north side of the island is likewise defended by a similar reef; but the ground within is foul, and unsafe for vessels of burthen. The whole length of the island is about fifteen leagues; and its circumference forty leagues. Besides the above-mentioned, they saw several other bays; some of them very good, and one, in particular, in which a large fleet might have rode with ease and safety: the name the natives give it is Papara.
        They also learned, that the island is divided into two principalities, one of which, comprehending the largest peninsula, is called Otaheite Nooa, or Great Otaheite; the other, comprehending the smallest peninsula, is termed Otaheite Eetee, or Little Otaheite. The former of these divisions is also called Oboreano, in honour of of queen Oboreah, who is regent of it. The other division is also governed by a woman named Teideede; she is younger than Oboreah. The people of the two divisions do not seem to be upon good terms, having but little communication with each other.
            
      

        
        In their voyage they also saw a large monument, of a pyramidal form, of polished stone, which they were told was the morai of Oboreah and Oamo, and the people there said they were brother and sister.
        On the 6th of July, in the evening, a young woman came to the entrance of the fort, whom we found to be a daughter of Oamo. The natives complimented her on her arrival, by uncovering their shoulders. We invited her to the tent, but she did not accept of it.
        On the 9th, two of our marines being enamoured with a girl, one of the natives deserted from the fort, and fled to the west part of the island, and intended to have staid there. On the same day one of the natives stole a knife from one of our sailors, and wounded him with it in the forehead, almost through his skull: — a fray ensued, and the Indians ran away.
        On this day, Mr. Banks and Dr. Monkhouse went many miles to a valley toward Orowhaina: at length they came to a waterfall, and could proceed no far-ther. At this spot the mountains were almost perpendicular; and from several parts of them hung some ropes, designed, as was apprehended, to assist those who should attempt to ascend them in times of scarcity, to get fayhee, or wild plantain. The stones and soil, on some of the highest mountains, appeared as if they had been burnt, or calcined: and, on the lower ones, where I have been, the earth is a sort of red-ochre covered with various plants, but chiefly with fern.
        Most of the materials which composed the fort having been taken down, and put on board the ship, we prepared to set sail.
        On the 10th, hearing no tidings of the two men who deserted us, we resolved to seize several of the principal people, and detain them till we could recover them: we also sent a party in the pinnace who apprehended Tootahau, and brought him to the ship; upon which Oboreah, and several other of the chiefs, sent out their servants, who returned in the evening with one of them, and reported that the Indians had detained one of our officers who commanded the party sent out after him; also one of the men who accompanied him, and, having seized their arms, used them very roughly; upon which the marines were dispatched in the long-boat after them, taking with them some of the natives. In the mean time, the natives, whom we had made prisoners, not knowing what would be their fate, were much alarmed; but the next morning the marines returned with the men that had been detained, with the others that had deserted; and the natives, whom we had imprisoned, were released. After making strong professions of friendship, they left us; and, as soon as they reached the shore, bent their course, as fast as possible, to Opare, shewing tokens of displeasure as they went along.
            
      

        
        During our stay here, Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander were very assiduous in collecting whatever they thought might contribute to the advancement of Natural History; and, by their directions, I made drawings of a great many curious trees, and other plants; fish, birds, and of such natural bodies as could not be conveniently preserved entire, to be brought home.
        The following catalogue exhibits some of the principal botanical subjects, natives of this place, made use of by the inhabitants.

Of this plant there are five different sorts, yielding a large root, which is eaten, and counted very good food, by the islanders of the South-seas.
        Tootaoopa.              Loranthus-stelis.
This plant is remarkable for nothing except its name, which signifies the Oopa, or pigeons dung ; that bird feeds on the berries, and voids the stones on the trunk of trees, where it grows.
        E peea.               Chaitea-tacca.
The root of this plant, properly prepared, makes an excellent strong jelly, like to blanc-mange, of the nature of salop, for which it is very justly admired by these islanders.
            
      

        
        Tawhannoo.             Guettarda-speciosa.
The timber of this tree, which grows pretty large at Toopbai, and other low islands near Otaheite, serves to make stools, chests, paste-troughs, and various other utensils; they also build canoes of it.
        E awaow.             Daphne-capitata.
This plant is used to poison fish, in order to catch them; and, for this purpose, they beat or mash it together and throw it into the rivers and sea within the reefs.
        E owhe.             Arundo-bambos.
This is the common bamboe, of which these islanders make great use; the large joints they keep to hold water and oil; of the small they make arrows, flutes, cases to hold small things; and, when cut into slips, they serve them for knives, and cut tolerably well.
        E motoo.             Melastoma-malabathrica,
This plant is one of those which they hang upon their whatta-note-toobapaow, or burial-stand, to be eaten by the soul of the deceased.
        E hee, or E ratta.              Aniotum-sagiserum.
This is a tall and stately tree which bears a round flat fruit, covered with a thick tough coat, and, when roasted and stripped of its rind, eats as well as a chesnut.
        E avee.              Spondias-dulcis. 
This is a large stately tree, and often grows to the height of forty and fifty feet: the fruit, which, I believe, is peculiar to these isles, is of an oval shape, yellow when ripe, and grows in bunches of three or four, and is about the size of a middling apple, with a large stringy core: It is a very wholsome and palatable fruit, improving on the taste, which is nearest that of a mangoe; it is strongly impregnated with turpentine, and makes excellent pies when green. The wood serves for building canoes, and for several other purposes.
        Pouraoo, and epooataroorroo.              Crataeva-frondosa. 
The fruit of this shrub they lay upon their corpses, and hang it upon their burial
        whattas, it having an agreeable bitter smell: it is one of those which are sacred to their god Tane, and, for that reason, is generally planted in, or by the small Morais, called Morai Roma Tan&ecute; which are a sort of altar near the houses, upon which they offer victuals.
            
      

        
        E peereepeeree. Euphorbia-develata.
This plant is full of a milky juice, with which they dye their garments of an indifferent brown colour.
        E aowiree. Terminalla-glabrata.
This tree, which grows to a large size, is often planted in their Morais, and near their houses, for the sake of its agreeable shade; the wood serves to build canoes, make chests, stools and drums: the kernel of the nut which is in the fruit, though small, has a very pleasant taste. [See pl. X.]
        E ratta, or e pooratta.  Metrosideros - spectabilis.
This tree, or shrub, grows upon the Tooaroa, or Lower-hills, and is much resorted to by the venee, or small blue parrot, which feeds upon the flowers, and is often caught here, by means of a glewy juice which issues out from the tops of the stalks, when broke by their feeding upon them, and catches them like bird-lime: the flowers are full of beautiful scarlet stamina; the natives stick them in their ears by way of ornament; and the leaves are put in their monoe, when they can get nothing sweeter.
        E arraroo´.  Psidium-myrtifolium.
The only use they make of this tree, which has a flower like a myrtle, is to make their totos or clubs, and ewha's, or a sort of lances, being very tough they call it an eraow paree, or the cunning tree.
        E heiya. Eugenia-mallaccensis.
This tree grows upon the lower-hills, having great clusters of crimson flowers, full of stamina of the same colour, much like an almond-blossom, but more brilliant: the fruit, when ripe, is red, and as big as one's fist; sweet, very agreeable to the palate, and full of seeds: it is very well known in the East-India islands, where it is esteemed delicious fruit.
            
      

        
        E awharra. Pandanus-tectorius.
This tree generally grows on the sandy hillocks by the sea-side, and is found in great plenty on all the low islands; the leaves are long, like those of sedge, sawed on the edge; the flowers are male and female, growing upon different trees; those of the male-flower smell very sweet; and, of the bractea of them, which are white, they make a sort of garlands to put round their heads; the fruit is orange colour, and as big as one’s head, consisting of a congeries of small cones, like those of the Anana, or Pine-apple, which they much resemble: the bottom of these cones, sucked when full ripe, yield a flat insipid sweetness, and are eaten by the children; but the chief use of this tree is in the leaves, which, when plucked and dried, make excellent thatching for their houses, and various sorts of mats and baskets. This is the Palmetto of the eastern voyagers.
        E mattee. Ficus-tinctoria.
The figs of this tree are one of the chief ingredients in their red-dye for their garments: when they use them they nip or bite off the stalk close to the fruit, at which time a small drop of milky juice issues out; this they either shake upon the tow-leaves, used in this dye, or else into a cocoa-nut shell, with a little water, or cocoa-nut milk, and then dip the leaves into it, which they roll up in a small bundle, and work or squeeze them between the palm and their fingers, till the red colour is produced by the mixture of the two juices; but, what is very odd, these leaves being beaten in a mortar, and the juice taken from them and mixed with the fig-milk, will not produce the same colour. Of the bark of this tree very good twine is made, which is of particular use for making of seins, and other nets.
        Eaowa. Ficus-prolixa.
This tree is remarkable on account of its trunk, which grows to an enormous size, by the branches hanging down, and taking root again, which makes a very grotesque figure. Of the bark of young plants, raised on purpose, they make a sort of cloth, naturally of a russet-hue, which they call Ora, being worn in the mornings, and much valued by them, especially that which is beaten very fine and thin.
        E toee. Zezyphoides-argentea.
The wood of this tree they make use of for various purposes, such as sterns of canoes, heightening boards for ditto, and beams to beat their cloth upon.
        E apeeree. Dodonaea-viscosa.
The wood of this tree, which is very tough, serves to make a particular sort of weapon, which they carry in their hand when they dive after sharks, and other large fish.
        E tive. Dracontium polyphyllum.
The root of this is used to make a jelly like the Peea, but is not near so good.
        Meiya. Musa-paradisaica.
This is the well-known tropical fruit called Plantains, and Bananas, of which there is a great variety in these islands: they reckon more than twenty sorts which differ in shape and taste; some of these are for eating raw, and others best boiled, and will serve instead of bread: they plant them in a rich soil, and take great pains in their cultivation.
        Faihe. Musa-bihai.
This is another sort of Plantains, which generally grow wild in the mountains, and sometimes are planted by them; they are far inferior to the last, have a considerable astringency, and eat best boiled or roasted. There are four different sorts, and the leaves of this and the last, serve to put victuals upon; and the rind of the trunk to make a sort of baskets called Papa-meiya.
        Earee.  Coccus-nucifer 
This palm, the fruit of which is so well known in all places within the tropics, seems to be a native of these islands, being found every where in the greatest plenty, and and in the greatest perfection, especially on the two low islands, called by them Motoos: these are many of them uninhabited, and are resorted to for the sake of the cocoa-nuts, which grow to a very great size on these islands; they love a sandy soil, and thrive much near the sea-side on the rising of the hills: they are smaller, and later in growth; they begin to bear when they are about ten feet high, and yield fruit several times in the year, and continue growing till they are so very tall, that they, by far, overtop all the rest of the trees: the leaves grow all at the top, from which the fruit hangs in several clusters of twenty or thirty, so enormously heavy, it is amazing how the slender stem of this tree can support them: when they have a mind to gather any for present use, they send up a boy who ties his feet together with a string, and vaults up to the top with great ease; when there, he gets them off the stalk by screwing them round, and then flings them down, taking care to give them a twirl first, otherwise they would fall to the ground with such force, from such a height, as would split them, and lose all the liquor. When they have a mind to gather the whole bunch, they cut it off, and lower it down with a rope; the way of opening them for present use is with their teeth, with which they pull off the outer rind, and then break the shell with a stone, but when they have many to peel, they do it by driving them upon a pointed stick, which is fixed in the ground for that purpose. Some sorts of these nuts will not keep at all; and other sorts, when pulled ripe, and properly dried and cured, will keep good a whole year: upon these racemi, or bunches, are ripe fruit, those that are half ripe, and others just set at the same time. The uses of this tree are many to the islanders of the south seas; the fruit, when half ripe, yields about a pint to a quart of one of the most refreshing and agreeable liquors in nature: this delicious beverage they often put amongst their pastes and puddings, and delight much to wash their mouth and hands with a little of it; the shell is, at this time, very soft, and is often eaten together with a little of the rind, but in no great Quantities, it being apt to occasion costiveness; as the fruit grows older, the milk turns thicker, more luscious, and wastes away; the kernel begins to form round the edge, like a white transparent jelly, and is very nice eating in this state. When it is ripe, the kernel is hard and white, about half an inch thick, and eats as well as a good nut; but the liquor is very indifferent, and, in a little time, wastes away intirely; of the kernel they make two sorts of puddings, called Poe, and Etooó, and eat it roasted alone, they also make a sauce for fish of it, called Taiyero, by steeping steeping the kernel in sea-water, and often shaking it, till it is almost dissolved; but the greatest quantity is used in making monoe, or oil, to anoint their hair; for this purpose they grate the kernel very small, then put it into a wooden tray, or trough, cover it, and set it in the shade, and, as the oil falls to the edges, they take it up with a shell, and put it into a calabash for use; it smells very rank, for which reason they put it into a quantity of scented woods and plants; but after all it smells very heavy, and is apt to give an European the head-ach. The shell is used for their drinking cups, vessels to hold water, and to put their victuals in; and, for this purpose, they make them smooth by rubbing them with coral. The shell of the ripe ones is black, and the others brownish white; the outer-rind, after being soaked in water, and well beaten, is drawn out into threads, of which they make variety of plaited-line for girdles, to frap their flutes, for slinging their calabashes, and has the quality of not rotting with salt-water: with this stuff they also calk their canoes; and, in the East-Indies, they make cables of it; of the leaves they make bonnets, and baskets to put their bread-fruit and apples in: the liber of the young leaves, which are very thin and transparent, they tie up in bunches, and stick in their hair by way of ornament: the brown skin, which covers the leaf, before it is unfolded, serves also for various purposes; and the wood of this tree answers all other common purposes very well.
            
      

        
        E papa.
Of the leaves of this tree, which are very white and glistering, when dried, they make their evanne-matting, much admired for its beauty.
        E howira.
This grows chiefly in the low islands; of the split leaves they make their best mats for garments, to sit, and sleep upon.
        E yeiyei.
This plant is of the nature of osier; of the stalks of it they work their round baskets, which they call Heenei, and in which they keep their victuals, and all their utensils.
        Doodooe-awai & Oheparra. 
With these they dye their poowhirre, or brown cloth.
            
      

        
        Patarra. 
An eatable root, which I did not see.
        E nioee. 
A fine eatable fruit, of a red colour, which I did not see.
        Ea patahei.
 An elegant flower, which I also did not see.
        Oowhe note Maowa.  Dioscorea-alata.
This plant produces the root so well known by the name of Ignames, all over the East and West-Indies: they have several sorts of it, but that which grows upon the hills is the best.
        E nahae
This is a fern, which has an extraordinary sweet smell, and, for this reason, it is used by the better sort of people to sleep on.
        E ahei.
The wood of this tree, has a very rich and delicious smell; is of a yellow colour, and is the principal ingredient used in perfuming their monoe, being grated small, and put to soak amongst it; as it is very scarce, it is in great request amongst them; we could never get a sight of the tree, but were told it grew on the mountains. They have various other vegetables with which they perfume their monoe, and likewise their cloaths: the names of these are, Pooeva, Maiteeraow, Annee, Noonna, Ehaee, Amea, and Matehooa.
        E atoo.
A plant of which they make mat garments.

        REMARKS on the Otaheitean Language.
        The language is very soft, having a great number of vowels, diphthongs, and triphthongs.
        Every word, almost, begins with a vowel, which they most commonly drop.
        It is also very metaphorical, as I have observed in many instances; as Matapoa, a person blind of an eye, which literally is Night-eye. Mataavai, the name of the bay we anchored in, literally signifies Watery-eye; which appellation is not unapt from the great quantity of rain which falls in the bay. Tehaia, a woman's name, who being lost when a child, her friends went about, crying Tehai? which means, Where is she?
        The natives could not repeat, after us, the sounds of the letters, Q, X, and Z, without great difficulty; G, K, and S, they could not pronounce at all.
        Many of the names of the people of our ship having the G, K, or S, in them, they could not approach nearer the sound of them than as follows:
        Toote,  for  Cook.   Matà for Monkhouse. Opane  Banks.    Petrodero  Pickersgill. Tolano   Solander.    Tate  Clark.  Treene   Green.   Poline  Spoving. Hite   Hicks.    Taibe   Stainsby. Towara   Gore.    Patine   Parkinson. 
            
      

        
        They have various sounds peculiar to themselves, which none of us could Imitate; some of them they pronounced like B and L mingled together; others between B and P, and T and D. Some like Bh, Lh, and Dh.
        When they mean to speak of a thing somewhat small, they often double the word, as Oorè oorè, a smallish nail.
        They also double the word for the superlative, as Teá teá, very white.
Mai, when placed after a verb, signifies that the action was done to you.
        Mai, when added to an adverb, signifies several things, as Mai Maroo, somewhat soft, or inclining to be soft.
        They have a whoop, when they call after any person, which they pronounce like Ahu! raising their voice very high at the last syllable.
            
      

        Departure from Otaheite
        On the 11th, the tents were struck, and we got every thing on board; but, on examining the anchor-stocks, we found them very much worm-eaten, and were obliged to wait till the carpenter had made new ones, which detained us two days longer. None of the Indians came near us till the next day, except Toobaiah, who is a sort of high-priest of Otaheite; and he designed to sail with us; however, several of the principal natives sent their servants on board with presents; we sent them others in return, and left them tolerably well reconciled to us.
        On the 13th, several of she natives came on board to take leave of us, to whom we made some presents; and, at parting with us, they appeared very sorrowful. In the forenoon we weighed anchor, and sailed, with a fine breeze, from the west, steering our course W. by N. having Toobaiah, and his little boy Taiyota, on board with us. [See pl. IX.] On our leaving the shore, the people in the canoes set up their woeful cry, Awai, Awai; and the young women wept very much. Some of the canoes came up to the side of the ship, while she was under sail, and brought us many cocoas.

        Departure from 
        Toward night we saw an island called, by Toobaiah, Tetiroah, and altered our course a little to the westward, steering for the island of Yoolee-Etea, the native place of Toobaiah.
        On the 14th, we discovered the isle of Huaheine, which is high land, but the wind being against us, we could not reach it; we therefore tacked about, and took a stretch toward an island that we saw at a distance, which Toobaiah told us was Yoolee-Etea.
        In the afternoon of this day it was almost calm; and we had but little wind till the next day, being the 15th; at noon we had a fine breeze; and at five in the afternoon were within six leagues of the island of Huaheine. It was made up of several peaks of high land, and divided, like Otaheite, by some lower land inter-vening. The island appeared to be almost as large again as Eimayo; and, from the mast head, we could discover the tops of the mountains of Yoolee-Etea, over those of Huaheine.
        Toobaiah praying in the afternoon, in the stern-windows, called out, with much fervor, O Tane, ara mai, matai, ora mai matai; which is to say, Tane (the god of his Morai) send to me, or come to me with a fair wind; but his prayer proving ineffectual, he said, Wooreede waow, I am angry. However, he told us that we should have wind when the sun arrived at the meridian, and so it happened, though we did not impute to him the gift of prophecy or foresight.
        Toobaiah told us they often had wars with the natives of Atiarabo, a neighbouring island; and that, when they take any of them prisoners, they cut off their under-jaws, and hang them up. Several of these trophies of victory Mr. Banks saw hung up in a man’s house at Atiarabo, in one of his excursions among the people of Oboreano, at a time when they had made prisoners Oroamo’s four brothers, and two of Oboreah’s, and had taken all her canoes.
            
      

        Departure from 
        Early on the 16th, we were close to the shore of the island of Huaheine; but, meeting with no safe place to anchor in, we doubled the point, and went to the N. W. tide of the island, where we anchored, in a pretty little bay, close by the shore in eleven fathom water: the water was very smooth, and the banks shoaled so steep, that we might have rid safe within forty yards off the shore. Several canoes came off to us as we sailed along the coast, and some of the natives came on board, amongst whom was a king, who was the first that adventured to come up the ship’s side, and he approached it trembling. Toobaiah conversed with them very freely.
        This country affords a more pleasing prospect than Otaheite, being more picturesque. Some of the hills are very high; and, from this bay, we can see the islands Yoolee-Etea, Otahau, and Bolabola; which last appears like a hill of a conical form, forked at the top. Before the bay, and a good way farther on, runs a reef which opens at the two ends, but has no opening In the front. The Captain, Toobaiah, and some others, went on shore with the aree, or king; and, as soon as he landed, he immediately repaired to an adjacent morai, and returned thanks to Tane for his safe passage, whom he presented with two handkerchiefs, and some other trifles; and, to the surgeon who assisted him, he presented a hog.
        On the 17th, several of the inhabitants came on board, and brought with them some cocoa-nuts; and one of them, a friend of mine from Otaheite, brought a basket of paste or pudding, baked in bread-fruit leaves, which was made of the roots of Taro and cocoa-nuts: they call it Etaoo, and it tastes very much like the poe of Otaheite, and is very good food. The custom of changing names prevails much in this island, and is deemed a mark of great friendship.
        During the short time we were upon the coast of this island, we purchased twenty-four hogs and pigs, besides fowls, fruits, and roots, at reasonable rates; but they raised the price of their commodities before we left them.
            
      

        Departure from 
        This island, the extent of which we had not time to learn, is considerably longer than broad; and, to all appearance, very fruitful in cocoas, bread-fruit, plantains, and eatable-roots, such as taro, eape, and the sweet potatoe. These roots, with different sorts of paste, are their principal food when there is no bread-fruit. They have a plenty of cuttle-fish, but not so many of other kinds as are to be found at Otaheite. Their cloth-tree is planted very neatly, and cultivated with great care, having drains made through the beds of earth to draw off the water; and the sides neatly built up with stones: and, in the drains, they plant the arum which yields the yam they call Taio.
        We found great quantities of a bastard sort of shagreen upon the island, and many pearls of an indifferent sort.
        The natives of this island are not of such a dark complexion as those of Otaheite, and the other neighbouring islands; and the women are, in general, as handsome, and nearly of the same colour, as Europeans; [see pl. VIII. fig. 3 and 4.] from which we may draw a reason for the name of this pretty island || which I left regretting that I did not see more of it.
        On the 19th, in the afternoon, we set fall for Yoolee-Etea, and the next morning, being the 20th, we cast anchor in a bay, which is formed by a reef, on the north side of this island. Two canoes of people came to us from the shore, and brought with them two small hogs; they took but little notice of us, and expressed as little surprize at any thing they saw. The captain went on shore and took possession of the island for the king; he saw but few inhabitants, and scarce any of distinguished rank amongst them. They behaved so coolly that the captain did not know what to make of them. Toobaiah, who was with him, seemed to be quite displeased. We did not know the occasion of their reservedness, but conjectured that the Bolobola people had been amongst them.
        || Huaheine, the name of this island, means also a wife.
            
      

        Departure from 
        On the 21st, some of us went on shore, and bought many plantains, and cocoa-nuts. The plantains were mostly green, and, boiled or roasted, ate as well as a potatoe.
        In the afternoon we went on shore again, and saw but few of the natives in the country, which, though very pleasant, looks like an uninhabited or deserted place. We saw some morais, [see pl. X.] or burial places, which are similar in all these islands, and went into one of them, in which there was a whatee, or altar, with a roasted hog, and fish upon it, designed as an offering to the Ethooa, or god. Near to the whatee, or altar, there was a large house, which contained the coong-drums used at their solemnities: and, adjoining to this house, were several large cages of wood, having awnings of palm-leaves upon them. These cages are called Oro, and rested upon beams laid upon others that stood upright, and seemed in-tended for the reception of the birds sacred to Ethooa, of which there are two that fly about their morais, the grey heron, and a blue and brown king-fisher. These morais are paved, or rather covered with a sort of coral, and planted with various sorts of flowering shrubs, such as nonoah, etoa, and hibiscus. At the front of the morai, which faces the sea, they have built a fort of amphitheatre, of large rough stones; and, among these stones, there are a great many long boards set up, carved in various figures, according to their fancy. Every family of note has one of these morais ornamented as much as they can afford *. I have been told that the inhabitants of these three isles worship the rainbow, which they call Toomeitee no Tane.
        * A kind of priest, [see pl. XI.] called heiva, attends these Morais, cloathed in a feather gar-ment, ornamented with round pieces of mother-of-pearl, and a very high cap on his head, made of cane, or bamboo, the front of which is feather-work; the edges beset with quills stripped of the plumage. He has also a sort of breast-plate, of a semicircular shape, made of a kind of wicker-work, on which they weave their plaited twine in a variety of figures: over this they put feathers of a green pigeon in rows; and between the rows is a semicircular row of Shark's teeth. The edge of the breast-plate is fringed with fine white dog's hair.
        This priest is commonly attended with two boys, painted black, who assist him in placing the hog and fish for the Ethooa; as also in strewing the body of the defunct with leaves and flowers of bamboo; and, for two or three days after, is constantly employed in ranging the adjacent fields and woods, from which every one retires on his approach. The relations, in the mean time, build a temporary house near the Morai, where they assemble, and the females mourn for the deceased, by singing songs of grief; howling, and wounding their bodies in different places with shark's teeth; after which they bathe their wounds in the sea or river, and again return to howl and cut themselves, which they continue for three days. After the body is corrupted, and the bones become bare, the skeleton is deposited in a sort of stone pyramid built for that purpose.

        Description of the country and natives of Yoole-Etea, with the neighbouring islands
        On the 24th, in the afternoon, we went out at the west end of the bay, which the natives call Opou, but found our passage very difficult on account of the shoals, one of which we narrowly escaped: the man, who sounded, crying out Two fathom, we wore ship directly, or we should have been on a bank.  At length, however, we cleared the shoals; but not being able to get out in time, anchored over-against a deep bay, and some of our men went on shore to look for hogs.
         

Plate XI.  An Heiva, or kind of Priest of Yoolee-Etea, & the Neighbouring Islands.
            
      

        
        This island is, in many respects, much like Huaheine, and the country as much variegated; but this side of the island seems to have undergone some revolution; the inhabitants are but few, and poor, and have no political distinction of rank amongst them. The shagreen is in greater plenty here, and at Huaheine, than at Otaheite, where it was a searce commodity. They have also great plenty of taro, and eape. As to the bread-fruit it was but young; and of apples I saw none.
        On the 25th, we set sail from the bay of Owhare, and steered our course to the westward, designing to go to Bolobola, or round Otahau, to the south-side of Yoolee-Etea; but, the wind blowing from the westward, we could not double the point of Otahau; so that we did nothing that day but traverse the coast of Bolobola.
        The island of Bolobola is made up of one very high forked peak of land, with seven low hills round it.
        In the evening, at sun-set, we discovered the island of Toopbai, making in low land.
            
      

        
        On the 28th, the wind blowing full from the west, and being often becalmed, we could not weather the point, the wind hauling round the island, and meeting us as we tacked about.
        In the evening, Mr. Banks, Dr. Solander, and the Master, went on shore, in the pinnace, to Otahau, and, not returning so soon as expected, we fired a cannon at nine o’clock; and, still neither seeing nor hearing of them, we fired another, and hung out a light in the shrouds. We were soon answered by them with a musket, by which we found they had got out to sea; and about ten they arrived, and brought with them three hogs, fifteen fowls, with a great quantity of plantains, cocoa-nuts, and taro.
        This island is but thinly inhabited, and some parts of it very barren. — We had a great swell among these islands.
        On the 30th, we went round to Bolobola, and beat up to windward, to get to the other side of Yoolee-Etea, and had a sharp breeze from the S. E. all night. This day we saw the island of Maowrooah, consisting of a large round hill, with a small one on the side of it.
        On the 1st of August, after so long beating to windward, we at last got alongside of Yoolee-Etea; but even then we could not get into the bay which we designed to enter; and, the wind being against us, we were obliged to cast anchor at the entrance of it, between two reefs. In the afternoon we attempted to warp the ship into the bay, but endeavouring to heave the anchor, we found it was fastened to some rock, where we left it till the next morning. The natives came off to us in great numbers, and we bought of them ten hogs, for ten spikes each, with plenty of cocoas, and plantains, and they seemed very joyful at our arrival.
        Early on the 2d, we attempted again to get up the anchor; with some difficulty happily succeeded; and, afterwards, warpt the ship into the bay, which is called Amameenee, and moored her in a proper station, about a mile from shore. The natives flocked to us again; appeared highly delighted, and were so fond of our commodities, that, for a few small nails, they gave us many things of considerable value amongst them; and whatever we gave them, whether nails, pewter, watches, or other toys, were immediately hung upon their ears.
            
      

        
        On the 4th, we went on shore, and took a walk up into the country, which is very pleasant, and saw a great quantity of Taro and Eape growing: We saw also a great quantity of the true Yam, which is so common in the West-Indies; and bread-fruit trees, which were nearly in perfection; though the crop of fruit upon them did not appear to be so large as I have seen.
        There are several Morais in this part of the island; in one of which we saw a string of jaw-bones hung up on the Afale, or house, of the Ethooa, with several skulls laid in rows: and we met a man of a fair complexion, whose hair was white as milk; also their Aree Dehei, or king, who is called Oorea, and his son; the former appeared to be a very modest sort of a man, and the latter as handsome a youth as I ever saw. Opoone, who is king of Bolobola, stays in the next bay; they say he is a very old man, and we suppose the people of this island have submitted to him *.
        The border of low land round the hills is very narrow here, and not very populous; but several of the inhabitants are comely, and in a much more flourishing state than those on the other side of the island, who are men of Yoolee-etea, or men of Bolobola, we could not learn which.
        * Toobaiah informed us, that, some years past, the chiefs of Otaheite, and the neighbouring islands, banished such of their criminals as were convicted of thefts, and other crimes which they thought did not deserve death, to an adjacent island called Bolobola, which, before the commencement of that law, was almost barren and uninhabited; which practice continued several years.  In process of time their numbers to greatly increased, that the island was insufficient for their subsistence. Being men of desperate fortunes, they made themselves canoes, turned pirates, and made prisoners such of the people of the inlands near them as had the misfortune to fall in their way, and seized their canoes and effects. Opoone, who was one of the worst of these criminals, by artful insinuations so wrought on the rest, that he was admitted their chief, or king; and, growing still more powerful, by frequent acquisitions of prisoners, he adventured to make war on the people of Otahaw, a neighbouring island, who, not expecting so sudden an invasion, were not prepared for defence, and were obliged to submit to be tributaries to him. He afterwards conquered Yoolee-etea, and other islands, which he annexed to his dominion of Bolobola.
            
      

        
        There is a great number of boat-houses all round the bays, [see pl. XII.] built with a Catanarian arch, thatched all over; and the boats kept in them are very long, bellying out on the sides, with a very high peaked stern, and are used only at particular seasons.
        We had a great quantity of fish brought on board in the afternoon of this day, and three pounds and a half were served to each man of the ship’s company.
        On the 7th, in the afternoon, Mr. Banks and myself went to see an entertainment called an Heivo. We passed over four bays E. and were carried, by the natives, till we came to the bottom of a bay called Tapeeoee, where a number of people was assembled. A large mat was laid upon the ground, and they began to dance upon it, putting their bodies into strange motions, writhing their mouths, and shaking their tails, which made the numerous plaits that hung about them flutter like a peacock’s train. Sometimes they stood in a row one behind another, and then they fell down with their faces to the ground, leaning on their arms, and shaking only their tails, the drums beating all the while, with which they kept exact time. An old man stood by as a prompter, and roared out as loud as he could at every change. These motions they continued till they were all in a sweat; they repeated them three times alternately, and, after they had done, the girls began. In the interval, between the several parts of the drama, some men came forward, who seemed to act the part of drolls; and, by what I could distinguish, they attempted to represent the Conquest of Yoolee-etea, by the men of Bolobola; in which they exhibited the various stratagems used in the conquest, and were very vociferous, performing all in time to the drum. In the last scene, the actions of the men were very lascivious.
        The people, in the part where this farce was performed, are chiefly Bolobola men, and they seem to be settled in the best part of the island, the low land being wider here than in any other part near the harbour. On this coast there are many spits and shoals, formed of coral rocks; and, on the reef, the surf breaks very high, and makes a noise as loud as thunder. There are some plantations of pepper in this part of the island.
            
      

        
        It is remarkable, that, notwithstanding the people of these Islands cannot pronounce the sound of the letter K, yet I have met with a great number in Yoolee-etea, who, having a hec in their speech, continually substitute it instead of that of their favourite letter T.

          Plate XIII. Various Instruments, & Utensils, of the Natives of Otaheite, 
          & of the adjacent Islands. 
      
        No. 1. Is a Sling, about four feet long, made of plaited twine, formed from the fibres of the bark of a tree; the part, which holds the stone, is woven very close, and looks like cloth, from which the string gradually tapers to a point.
        2. The Paddle, made of wood neatly shaped, and worked very smooth, used to strike the instruments No. 3 and 4, wherewith they indent or mark their skins, which they call Tataowing. It is about eighteen inches long.
        3. and 4. Are their Tataowing Instruments, the handles of which are wood; towards the end of which is a hollow made to lay the fore-finger of the hand in which holds it: the head is made of one or two flat pieces of bone, of various breadths, tapering to a point towards the handle, to which it is fastened very tight with fibres of the bark of a tree: the broad part, or bottom, is cut into many small sharp teeth. When they mark any person, they dip the instrument, a small one or large one, according to the figure intended, into a black liquid, or juice, expressed from some plant, and, placing it on the part intended to be marked, give it a small blow with the paddle, which causes a great deal of pain. These instruments are about five inches in length.

          & of the adjacent Islands. 
      
       5. The Cloth-beater, about fourteen inches long. 
      
        6. One of their Baskets; round the mouth is a kind of netting made of plaited twine, through which a string is put, which draws the plaiting together, and closes up the mouth. It is eleven inches high, and three feet in circumference.
        7. An Ebupa, or Stool, used as a pillow; they generally put a piece of their cloth on it before they lay their head on it. There are many sizes of them; the very large ones they use also as stools to sit on. This, expressed in the figure, was twelve inches and a half long; but some are of the length of two feet.
        8. Is one of their Flutes, made of Bamboo, and ornamented with the plaited twine, which also strengthens it; they are about one foot and a half long.
        9. One of their Hatchets, the handle of this was fourteen inches and a half long;
the head about four inches and a half in length, and the edge about two inches broad.
        10. Is a figure of the Stone Paste-beater:  this was seven inches and a quarter high.
        11. A Fly-flap, the handle made of a hard brown wood, is thirteen inches long.
        12. The Feather Ornament for the Head, six inches long.
        13, 14. Mother-of-pearl Ornaments for the Ears, about half an Inch long.
        15. The Decoy used in fishing, made of shells; the length, from the head to the extremity of the tail, seven inches and a half.
        16. A Bone Plummet for their fishing lines, carved, two inches and a quarter long.
        17. Another Plummet, made of Spar, about one inch long.

       18. A Mother-of-pearl Fish hook, two inches 
      long. 
      
        19. A Fish-hook made of wood, and pointed with a piece of shell, three inches and three quarters long.
        20. A Fish-hook made of a large Pinna-marina shell, three inches and three quarters long.
        21. Another Fish-hook, made of a large Pinna-marina shell, three inches and three quarters long.
        22. Another ditto, made of Mother-of-pearl, two inches long.
        23. Another ditto, three quarters of an inch in length.
        24. Another ditto, made of Pinna-marina shell, one inch and half long.
        25. Another ditto, made of two pieces of Mother-of-pearl, one for the shank, the other for the point. The line is fastened both at the top and bottom. The points of these hooks are sometimes barbed like ours; at the bottom they tie some hair.
        26. Three Pearls tied together by plaited hair, worn as an ornament for the ears:
each pearl was about the size of a small pea.
        27. Sting of a Sting-Ray, used to point their lances and arrows, four inches and a half long.
            
      

        PART II. Comprehending the occurences met with from leaving Yoolee-Etea to the time of the ship's departure from the coast of New Zealand.
        ON the 9th of August we weighed anchor, and proceeded from this bay to the southward, to see what discoveries we could make there, pursuant to the directions of the admiralty, and carried with us as many hogs from this island as we could stow, with a great number of Plantains, Taro, Eape, and Yams, to serve us instead of bread.
        On the 13th, at noon, having had a brisk wind for three days, we discovered high land, and, toward night, approached near it. Toobaiah informed us that it was an island called Oheiteroah, being one of the cluster of nine, and bore the title of Oheite added to them.
        We hauled in our wind, and, on the 14th, in the morning, bore down to the island, and hoisted out the pinnace, in which Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander went on shore to seek for an anchoring place in a large bay formed by two points of land. They returned with an account that they could find none, nor any good landing for the boat: and that, when they got near the shore, several of the natives jumped into the pinnace, and attempted to seize on Mr. Banks, which obliged our people to fire, and some of the natives were wounded. They were armed with long clubs, and spears, made of the wood of a tree which they called Etoa; and their cloaths were red and yellow, made of bark, striped and figured very regularly, and covered with gum. They had also curious caps on their heads, and made a very martial appearance. Mr. Banks brought some wooden-work on board, very ingeniously wrought, and told us that they saw canoes which were carved with great ingenuity, and painted very neat.
            
      

        
        These people are very tall, well proportioned, and have long hair, which they tie up, [see pl. VIII. fig. 5 and 6.] and are tataowed, or marked on different parts of their bodies, but not on their posteriors, like the people of the other islands. On one of our boats approaching them, they began to talk to Toobaiah, though they seemed very much intimidated, and begged that our people would not kill them; and said they would not furnish us with any eatables unless we came on shore, which they intreated us much to do. They saw no women among them. From the ship we observed a few houses.
        This island does not shoot up into high peaks, like the others, but is more even and uniform, divided into small hillocks, like England, which are here and there covered with tufts of trees. At the water’s edge there are many clifts almost perpendicular. We saw no bread-fruit, and very few cocoas; but all along the edge of the beach was thick planted with Etoa, which served to shelter their houses and plantations of Meiya from the wind.
        This island is situate in 22°  23' south latitude, and 150° 5'  west longitude, and has no reef surrounding it, like the other islands.
        On the 15th, in the morning, we passed the tropic of Capricorn, having a fine breeze from the north, with clear pleasant weather; and saw several tropic birds.
        On the 28th, we had hazy weather, and a drizzling rain all day, with a faint breeze from the north, and saw a great many birds called Shear-coots. This morning, John Raden, the boatswains mate, died.  His death was occasioned by drinking too freely of rum the night before. In the evening the wind came about to the west, and, the next morning, the 29th, the weather being clear, at about four oclock we saw a comet, about 60 degrees above the horizon. Latitude 37°
            
      

        
        On the 16th, we saw the appearance of several high peaks of land, which deceived us all: we bore away for them, but, the sky clearing up, we found our mistake, and so resumed our course to the south. Thermometer 72, and a cold air.
        On the 17th, we were becalmed most part of the day, and had a great swell from the west in latitude 26° 25  S. Thermometer 70.
        On the 20th, we had light breezes, and were often becalmed; but, toward night, we had a brisk breeze from the north, which increasing, we brought the ship to, under the two topsails, and remained so all night, and had a continual swell, which made the ship roll very much.
        On the 21st, we had a stiff gale all day, with hazy weather, and some thunder and lightening from the west; we scudded before the wind, having the foresail and two topsails close-reefed set. The swell was so great that the ship rolled pro-digiously, and every thing was thrown down. We saw several Pintado birds, and Shear-waters.
        On the 22d, we had fine clear weather, and the wind much abated. We saw some Albatrosses, and several Pintado birds. This bird is barred on the wing with black and white, from whence the name in Spanish, a Cheque-board. We also saw several parcels of sea-weed. Latitude 31° 3  S. Wind S. W. and by W.
        On the 23d, we had light breezes, and it was calm most part of the day. Toward night, it rained very hard, with the wind to the north. We saw a grampus, or young whale, and an albatross. Lat. 32&deg: 5.
        On the 24th, we had heavy squalls, with rain, from the south, and saw a water-spout. The wind still continuing to blow very hard, we lay-to under our main-sail; and, in the night, the wind was excessive cold.
        On the 25th, we had fair weather, but the air was stlll sharp, though the wind was moderate, and came about to the S. W. Lat. 32&deg: 3. Thermometer 62.
        On the 26th, we had variable weather, with a westerly wind, and saw a grampus and an albatross. Latitude 32&deg: 15.
        On the 27th, we had clear weather, with the wind at north, but, toward the evening, it was squally. We saw several albatrosses, pintados, and shear-waters. Latitude 33&deg: 35.—— On the same day we killed a dog, and dressed him, which we brought from Yoolee-Etea: he was excessively fat, although he had eaten nothing while he had been on board.
            
      

        
        On the 30th, we had a brisk breeze, and a great swell from the west with fair clear weather, but very cold. The Thermometer, in open air, was at 52. One of Mr. Bankss servants saw a bird of a fine green colour, and likewise some sea-weed. In the night, we had heavy showers of hail, and sudden gusts of wind, which were very piercing, and so violent, that we were obliged to lay the ship to under the foresail. The same weather continued all the next day, the 31st, accompanied with a high swell from the west, which made the ship run gunnel-to under water. A vast number of birds, of different kinds, followed us all day, sporting on the surface of the water. These were Pintados, (a bird of a silver colour, such as we saw in the Atlantic ocean,) Albatrosses, and various sorts of Procellariae. Several parcels of rock-weed were also seen by some of our people. Latitude 39° 25 S. Thermometer, in open air, 48.
        On the 1st of September, we had hard piercing gales and squalls from the W. and N. W. with violent showers of hail and rain. The sea ran mountain-high, and tossed the ship upon the waves: she rolled so much, that we could get no rest, or scarcely lie in bed, and almost every moveable on board was thrown down, and rolled about from place to place. In brief, a person, who has not been in a storm at sea, cannot form an adequate idea of the situation we were in. The wind still increasing, we laid the ship to under the foresail. The heavens, how-ever, being clear, at four in the morning, we saw the comet again between Aldebaran and Orion.  Latitude, by account, 40° and odd; and Thermometer 44.
        On the 2d, we had hard gales, and squally weather.  About noon we set the mainsail, and bore away N. N. W. the captain having, pursuant to his orders, gone in search of the continent as far as 40° south latitude, and determined to stand to the southward, to see what discoveries he could make in that quarter, apprehending that, if we continued much longer in these high latitudes, we should not have sails enough to carry us home: besides, the weather was so tempestuous, that, had we made land, it would not have been safe to have approached near it. — The course which we have steered to the southward, has been mostly between 147 and 150 degrees, west longitude.
        On the 3d, we had dark and gloomy weather, with a light westerly breeze, and the air was very cold.
        On the 5th, we had variable weather, with some rain: we saw some Albatrosses.  with white beaks, and others all white, except the tips of their wings.
        On the 6th, we had hard gales from the west, which obliged us to go under our courses, but the weather was clear, though cold.
        On the 8th, we were becalmed most part of the morning; but, in the after-noon, the wind came about easterly, and brought with it some rain.
            
      

        
        On the 9th, we had a sine breeze, all day, from the south, with clear weather; and, toward night, saw some parcels of sea-weed.—  This day a whole allowance of beef was given to the ship's company.
        On the 10th, we had squally weather, with the wind at S. S. W. saw some sea-weed, and had several white squalls, which looked as if we had been near land.
        On the 11th, we had some squalls, with light showers of rain, and the wind at S. W.
        On the 12th, the wind varied between S. and W. and we had agreeable clear weather, with some few squalls. Latitude 33°  18'. Thermometer 57.
        On the 14th, we had moderate, though variable, weather, with the wind at north. We saw several Albatrosses flying about the ship, and two very large ones, quite white, swimming upon the water.
        On the 15th, we had hard gales of wind from the E, and S. E. the weather very hazy, with some rain, and saw a few Pintados.
        On the 16th, the weather was squally, but clear, and the wind S. W.
        On the 18th, we were becalmed most part of the day, however, the weather was clear, and the wind S. W.
        On the 19th, it was calm till the afternoon, and then we had a short breeze from the east. Mr. Banks went in the boat, and shot some Pintados, and caught some Molusca, Doris, Phyllodore, and the sine purple Limax, which were swimming upon the water. At night the water was full of flashes of light, occasioned by the Molusca. Latitude 29° S. Longitude 159 W. and we had a great swell from the S. W.
            
      

        
        On the 21st, we had a smart breeze from the S. E. supposed to be the tail of the trade winds, with clear weather. This breeze continued till the 24th, with fair and moderate weather. We steered S. S. W. in hopes of discovering the continent. Latitude 31 24 south, and 162 west longitude.
        On that day the wind came about to the east: we saw some sea-weeds, and a log of wood about three feet long.
        On the 26th, we had a fresh breeze from the north, with the weather gloomy. We saw several parcels of sea-weed, of that kind called Leather-weed, in latitude 35° 53 S. 162 longitude. In the night we had a very hard gale from the north, with heavy showers of rain.
On the 27th, early in the morning, the wind was moderate, but the sea ran very high, and the ship rolled so much that every moveable on board was thrown about; and it was with great difficulty that we saved ourselves from being tossed out of our cots. The night came on while we were in this situation, which proved very dark, and every thing conspired to make it dismal, and aggravate our distress. The next morning, however, was fair; the heavens cloudless; the fun rose peculiarly bright, and we had a sine breeze from the west In the afternoon the wind veered to the north, and we saw many parcels of sea-weed of different sorts. We also saw a seal, and concluded that we were not far from land. Latitude 37 30 south.
        On the 28th, we had afresh gale from the west, which continued till noon, and then chopped about to the S. W. We altered our course to W. N. W. having run to the south as far as 40° latitude, and longitude 166° west; met with some sea-weed ; and saw several black-beaked Albatrosses and Shear-waters.
        On the 29th, we had a smart breeze from the south, with clear, though sharp weather; thermometer 54; — saw several parcels of sea-weed, and a land-bird that flew like a plover; with a great number of Pintados, Shear-waters, and large white Albatrosses, with the tips of their wings black. We sounded, but found no bottom, with 120 fathoms of line. The captain apprehended that we were near land, and promised one gallon of rum to the man who should first discover it by day, and two if he discovered it by night; also, that part of the coast of the said land should be named after him.
            
      

        
        On the 1st of October, the weather was fair, but very cold, and almost calm. In the morning, we saw a seal asleep upon the surface of the water, which had, at first, the appearance of a log of wood; we put the ship about to take it up, but it waked, and dived out of sight.  Great flocks of Shear-waters flew about the ship, and several parcels of sea-weed floated by the side of it. We found, by this days observation, that we had gone ten leagues farther to the northward, than what appeared by the log-account.  The master was sent in quest of a current, but could find none. Latitude 37° 45 south, and 172° longitude, west from London.
        Though we had been so long out at sea, in a distant part of the world, we had a roasted leg of mutton, and French-beans for dinner; and the fare of Old England afforded us a grateful repast.
        This day we sounded, and found no bottom at 120 fathoms.
        On the 2d, the sea was as smooth as the Thames, and the weather fair and clear. Mr. Banks went out in a little boat, and diverted himself in shooting of Shear-waters, with one white Albatross, that measured, from the tip of one wing to the other, ten feet, seven inches; and also picked up a great many weeds of various kinds: we saw also several sorts of rock-weed; and the water looked as green as it does in the channel.
        On the 4th, we had light breezes from the S. E. with clear sharp weather. In the morning we saw some rock-weed; and, in the evening, a great shoal of bottle-nosed porpoises swam along-side of the ship, with a great number of other porpoises, having sharp white snouts, and their sides and bellies of the same colour.
        On the 5th, we had light breezes from the N. E. and pleasant weather: about two oclock in the afternoon one of our people, Nicholas Young, the surgeons boy, descried a point of land, of New Zealand, from the starboard bow, at about nine leagues distance, bearing W. and by N. we bore up to it, and, at sun-set, we had a good view of it. The land was high, and it appeared like an island. We regaled ourselves in the evening upon the occasion; the land was called Young Nicks Head, and the boy received his reward. The sea, on this coast, was full of a small transparent animal, which, upon examination, we called Beroe Coaretata. Latitude 38° 49 *.
        On the 8th, we had light breezes and dead calms all day, and could not get in nearer the land than two or three leagues; but it appeared, at this distance, to be of considerable extent, with many small islands around it; and had rising hills like the coast of Portugal.  We saw smoke ascend from different parts, and thence concluded that it was inhabited. The two extreme points of the land bore N. and S.S.W. We saw several grampusses, but few birds.
        * As we have, in pl. XXV given a map of the coast of New Zealand, in which the latitudes and longitudes, of the several places we explored, are correctly set down, we shall, in our account of that island, omit mentioning the situation of places in that respect, and, once for all, refer the reader to the map.
            
      

        Views of the head-lands and delineations of the coast, country, and inhabitants, of New Zealand
        On the 9th, early in the morning, the wind being favourable, we stood in nearer land, where it seemed to open and form a deep bay; [see pl. XIV.] but, on approach-ing it, we discovered low land, and it was much shallower than we expected.  Upon entering we had regular soundings all the way, from twenty-six to six fathoms, and cast anchor on the east side in ten fathoms water, about two or three miles from the shore, over-against the land on the right, where there was the appearance of a river. At the entrance of the bay, which is a very large one, being about three leagues in breadth, and two in depth, are several chalky cliffs, from which runs a low ridge of land that ends in a hillock: at a little distance from the hillock, there is a small high island, and, on the top of it, an inclosure of pales.  Abundance of white cliffs are seen all along the coast; and the hills appear to be covered with small wood and bushes, affording but an indifferent landscape. We discovered several houses by our glasses. They seemed to be thatched, and the eaves of them reached to the ground. Within the bay there are many hills one behind another; though most part of the bay is surrounded by a valley in which is a number of trees; from whence, as well as other parts of the country, we saw some smoke arise. We also discovered many of the natives (who seemed to be of a very dark hue) and several of their canoes hauled upon the beach. The natives, on approaching nearer to them, took but little notice of us.  Having cast anchor, the pinnace, long-boat, and yaul, were sent on shore with the marines.  As soon as the people who were in the pinnace had passed a little way up into the country, while the long-boat went up the river to see for water, some of the natives, who had hid them-selves amongst the bushes, made their appearance, having long wooden lances in their hands, which they held up in a threatening posture, as if they intended to throw them at the boys in the yaul. The cockswain, who stayed in the pinnace, perceiving, them, fired a musquetoon over their heads, but that did not seem to intimidate them: he therefore fired a musket, and shot one of them through the heart; upon which they were much alarmed, and retreated precipitately.

        The water in the river was found to be brackish, in which we were disappointed; but they shot some wild ducks of a very large size, and our botanical gentlemen gathered a variety of curious plants in flower.
        In the ensuing night, while we were all on board, the natives assembled on the shore, which was about three miles distance, talked loud, and were very clamorous. We ordered a strict watch to be kept all the night, lest they should come off in their canoes and surprise us.
        Early on the morning of the 10th, the long-boat, pinnace, and yaul, went on shore again; landed near the river where they had been the night before, and attempted to find a watering place. Several of the natives came toward them, and, with much entreating, we prevailed on some of them to cross the river, to whom we gave several things, which they carried back to their companions on the other side of the river, who seemed to be highly pleased with them, and testified their joy by a war-dance. Appearing to be so pacifically disposed, our company went over to them, and were received in a friendly manner. Some of the natives were armed with lances, and others with a kind of stone truncheon; through the handle of it was a string, which they twisted round the hand that held it when they attempted to strike at any person. [See pl. XV.] We would have purchased some of their weapons, but could not prevail on them to part with them on any terms.  One of them, however, watched an opportunity, and snatched a hanger from us; our people resented the affront by firing upon them, and killed three of them on the spot, but the rest, to our surprise, did not appear to be intimidated at the sight of their expiring countrymen, who lay weltering in their blood; nor did they seem to breathe any revenge upon the occasion; attempting only to wrest the hanger out of the mans hand that had been shot, and to take the weapons that belonged to their other two deceased comrades; which having effected, they quietly departed. After having taken possession of the country, in form, for the king, our company embarked, and went round the bay in search of water again, and to apprehend, if possible, some of the natives, to gain farther information of them respecting the island. They had not gone far before they saw a canoe; gave chace to it, and, when they came up with it, the crew threw stones at them, and were very daring and insolent. Our people had recourse to their arms: the Captain, Dr. Solander, and Mr. Banks, fired at them, and killed and wounded several of them. The natives fought very desperately with their paddles, but were soon overpowered: their canoe was taken, three of them made prisoners, and brought on board the ship, and the rest were suffered to escape. They were, in person, much like the natives of Otaheite, and had their lips marked with a blue colour, but no other part of their bodies, in which they differed from the before-mentioned people. They talked very loud, but were rude in their address, and more unpolished than the Otaheiteans.  We were much surprised to find they spoke the Otaheitean language, though in a different dialect, speaking very guttural, having a kind of hec, which some of the people of Yoolee-Etea have in their speech. Toobaiah understood them very well, notwithstanding they make frequent use of the G and K, which the people of Otaheite do not. Their canoe was thirty feet long, made of planks sewed together, and had a lug-sail made of matting.
            
      

        
        On the 11th, in the morning, the boats went on shore again, and carried the three men whom we had taken, dressed up very finely. The men did not seem willing to land, and when we left them, they cried, and said that the people on that side of the bay would eat them. While a party of our men went to cut wood, these men hid themselves in the bushes, and many of the natives appeared on the other side of the river. We beckoned to them, and, at length, one man, of more courage than the rest, ventured over to us without arms, with whom we conferred, by our interpreter Toobaiah, for a considerable time; and, during the conference, about two hundred more, armed with lances, poles, and stone bludgeons, made up to us, which the captain seeing, and being apprehensive they intended to cut off our retreat to the boats, as they had got to the other side of the river, he ordered us to embark, and return to the ship; which we did accordingly, taking with us the three natives whom we had brought on shore; but, in the afternoon, we set them on shore again; they parted with us reluctantly, and went into the woods;
but, some time after, we saw them, with our glasses, come out again, make signs to us, and then go in again.

        These men, while on board, ate an Immoderate quantity of every thing that was set before them, taking pieces at one time into their mouths six times larger than we did, and drank a quart of wine and water at one draught. They informed us, that there was Taro, Eape, Oomara, Yams, and also a peculiar kind of Deer,  to be found upon the island.
        The natives on this side of the bay were tataowed, or marked, in various forms on their faces; and their garments, wrought of rushes, reached down below their knees, and were very thick and rough. They tie their foreskins to their girdle with a string, and have holes pierced in their ears, which shews that they sometimes wear some sort of ear-rings: they have also some bracelets; neck-laces they well knew the use of; but they did not like our iron wares. We saw a piece of wood which looked as smooth as if it had been cut with an axe; but of what materials the instruments are composed, which they use for that purpose, we could not learn. We went into some of their houses, which were very meanly thatched, having a hole in the center of the roof to let out the smoke; but we saw nothing in them except a few cockles, limpets, and muscle-shells.
        We found here a sort of long-pepper, which tasted very much like mace; a Fulica, or bald Coot, of a dark blue colour; and a Black-bird, the flesh of which was of an orange colour, and tasted like stewed shell-fish. A vast quantity of pumice-stone lies all along upon the shore, within the bay, which indicates that there is a volcano in this island.
            
      

        
        On the 12th, early in the morning, we weighed anchor, and attempted to find some better anchoring-place, as this bay (which, from the few necessaries we could procure, we called Poverty Bay) was not well sheltered from a S. E. wind, which brings in a heavy sea. The natives call the bay Taoneroa, and the point of land, at the entrance on the east side, they call Tettua Motu.
        In the afternoon we were becalmed; and six canoes came off to us, filled with people; some of them armed with bludgeons made of wood, and of the bone of a large animal. They were a spare thin people, and had garments wrapt about them made of a silky flax, wove in the same manner as the cotton hammocks of Brazil, each corner being ornamented with a piece of dog-skin. Most of them had their hair tied upon the crown of their heads in a knot, and by the knot stuck a comb of wood or bone. In and about their ears some of them had white feathers, with pieces of birds skins, whose feathers were soft as down; but others had the teeth of their parents, or a bit of green stone worked very smooth. These stone ornaments were of various shapes. They also wore a kind of shoulder-knot, made of the skin of the neck of a large sea-fowl, with the feathers on, split in two length-ways. Their faces were tataowed, or marked either all over, or on one side, in a very curious manner; some of them in fine spiral directions like a volute, [see pl. XVI.] being indented in the skin very different from the rest: and others had their faces daubed over with a sort of red ochre. The bottom of their canoes was made out of a single tree; and the upper part was formed of two planks, sewed together, narrowed both at head and stern. The former was very long, having a carved head at the end of it painted red, and the stern ended in a flat beak. They had thwarts to sit on, and their paddles were curiously stained with a red colour, disposed into various strange figures; and the whole together was no contemptible workmanship. After we had given them a variety of beads and other trinkets, they set off in so great a hurry, that they left three of their people on board with us. We were at this time off a cape, which we named Table Cape: we made but little way that night.
        On the 13th, two canoes came off to us, and one of the natives came on board of our ship, but, being much intimidated, could not be prevailed on to stay long. He was tataowed in the face, and wore a garment made of a sort of silky flax, wrought very strong, with a black and brown border round it, and a weapon in his hand made of the bone of a grampus. [See pl. XXVI. fig. 22.] There were several women in the canoe with uncommon long breads, and their lips stained with a blue colour.
            
      

        
         

Plate XVI. The Head of a Chief of New-Zealand, the face curiously tataowd, or mark'd, according to their Manner. 
        In the afternoon, more canoes came to us. Some of the people in them were disfigured in a very strange manner, they brandished their arms, and shewed signs of contempt, while the rest paddled hard to overtake us; and, at length, attempted to board us. The captain ordered one of the men to fire a musket over them, which they did not regard.  A great gun, loaded with grape shot, was fired, which made them drop astern; but whether any of them were wounded, we could not discover. Several of the canoes had outriggers; and one of them had a very curious piece of ornamental carving at the head of it.
        At this time we were doubling the west point of the land, formed by a small high island, and got into very foul ground, the soundings being from seven to thir-teen fathoms, and were afraid of running upon it, but we happily escaped. After we had doubled this island, which was called Portland Isle, or, according to the natives, Teahowray, we got into a sort of large bay, and, the night coming on, we thought it best to drop anchor, designing, next morning, to make for a harbour in the corner of the bay, where there was the appearance of an inlet. Most of the country in view makes in flat table-hills, with cliffs of a white clay toward the sea. In the evening, several of the natives came, in two canoes, to visit us: they seemed to be more friendly than the former; but were, however, so frightened, that we could not persuade them to come on board: we offered them various things, which they kindly accepted.
        On the 14th, we made for the inlet, which we saw the night before, and, on coming up to it, found that it was not sheltered, having only some low land at the bottom of it. Ten canoes, filled with people, chaced us; but our ship sailing too fast for them, they were obliged to give over the pursuit.
            
      

        
        We sailed round most part of the bay without finding any opening; and the soundings, all along the shore, were very regular. The country appeared more fertile hereabout, and well covered with wood, the sea-shore making in clayey cliffs, upon which the surf broke very high. This bay was called Hawkes Bay.
        In the afternoon, a canoe followed us, with eighteen people in her, armed with lances; but as they could not keep pace with us, they gave up their expedition.
        In sailing along, we could plainly distinguish land that was cultivated, parcelled out into square compartments, having some sorts of herbs growing upon them.
        On the 15th, in the morning, we bent our course round a small peninsula, which was joined to the main land by a low isthmus, on which were many groves of tall strait trees, that looked as if they had been planted by art; and, within-side of it, the water was quite smooth.  We saw some very high ridges of hills streaked with snow; and, when we had doubled the point of this peninsula, the low isthmus appeared again, stretching a long way by the sea-side. The country looked very pleasant, having fine sloping hills, which stretched out into beautiful green lawns, though not covered with wood, as other parts of the coast are.
        In the morning, while we were on the other side of the peninsula, nine canoes came to us, in which were one hundred and sixty of the natives: they behaved in a very irresolute manner, sometimes seeming as if they would attack us; then taking fright, and retreating a little; one half paddling one way, and the other half paddling another, shaking their lances and bone bludgeons at us, talking very loud and blustering, [see pl. XVII.] lolling out their tongues, and making other signs of defiance. We did all we could to make them peaceable, but to no purpose, for they seemed, at length, resolved to do us some mischief; coming along-side of the ship again, and threatening us, we fired one of our guns, loaded with grape-shot, over their heads: they looked upon us for some time with astonishment, and then hastened away as fast as they could. By this time two other canoes came toward us, but stopped a little, and held a conference with those that were returning, and then made up to us, leaving the rest at some distance, who seemed to wait their destiny. We made signs to them that we meant them no harm, if they would behave peaceably, which they so well understood, that they took all their weapons and put them into a canoe, and sent it off while they came close to the ship. We threw them several kinds of things, but they were so timorous that they durst not venture on board; nor would they send any thing to us. During this interview another canoe came up, threw a lance at the stern of the ship, and made off again. The lance fell into the water and sunk immediately. There were some good-looking people in these canoes, others were disfigured, and had a very savage countenance. One old man, in particular, who seemed to be a chief, was painted red, and had a red garment, but the garments of some others were striped. The principals amongst them had their hair tied up on the crown of their heads; and some feathers, with a little bundle of perfume, hung about their necks. Most of them were tataowed in the face, and many of them quite naked, who seemed to be servants to the rest. Several of them had pieces of a green stone * hung about their necks, which seemed to be pellucid, like an emerald. Their spears were not unlike our sheriffs halberts, having red and yellow tassels tied to them. In one of their canoes we saw a hatchet, made of the green stone, in shape like those of Otaheite. Their canoes [see pl. XVIII.] had from eighteen to twenty-two men in them, and were adorned with fine heads made out of a thick board, cut through like filligree-work, in spirals of very curious workmanship.  At the end of this was a head, with two large eyes of mother-of-pearl, and a large heart-shaped tongue. This figure went round the bottom of the board, and had feet and hands carved upon it very neatly, and painted red: they had also high-peaked sterns, wrought in filligree, and adorned with feathers, from the top of which depended two long streamers, made of feathers, which almost reached the water. Some of these canoes were between fifty and sixty feet long, and rowed with eighteen paddles. They gave us two Heivos, in their canoes, which were very diverting. They beat time with their paddles, and ended all at once with the word Epaah; at the fame instant striking their paddles on the thwarts: all which afforded a truly comic act.
        * Pieces of this kind of stone were brought home in the Endeavour; on examination it appears to be a fine sort of Nephritic stone. This remark will serve for all their ornaments hereafter mentioned, said to be made of a green stone.

        The weather was remarkably fine for some time before and after we came to this island, having light breezes, and clear weather, with some calms.
        On the 16th, we had several fisher canoes come to us; and, after much persuasion, they gave us some fish for cloth and trinkets; but none of their fish was quite fresh, and some of it stank intolerably. They went away very well satisfied, and then a larger canoe, full of people, came up to us, having their faces shock-ingly besmeared with some paint. An old man, who sat in the stern, had on a gar-ment of some beasts skin, with long hair, dark brown, and white border, which we would have purchased, but they were not willing to part with any thing. When the captain threw them apiece of red baize for it, they paddled away immediately; held a conference with the fishers boats, and then returned to the ship. We had laid a scheme to trepan them, intending to have thrown a running bow line about the head of the canoe, and to have hoisted her up to the anchor; but, just as we had got her a-head for that purpose, they seized Toobaiahs little boy, who was in the main-chains, and made off with him, which prevented the execution of our plan. We fired some muskets and great guns at them, and killed several of them. The boy, soon after, disingaged himself from them, jumped into the sea, swam toward the ship, and we lowered down a boat and took him up, while the canoes made to land as fast as possible.
        The speech of these people was not so guttural as the others, for they spoke more like the Otaheiteans. Many of them had good faces; their noses rather high than flat; and some of them had their hair most curiously brought up to their crowns, rolled round, and knotted.
        In the evening, we were over-against a point of land, which, from the circumstance of stealing the boy, we called Cape Kidnappers.  On doubling the cape, we thought to have met with a snug bay, but were disappointed, the land tending away to a point southward. Soon after we saw a small island, which, from its desolate appearance, we called Bare Island.
            
      

        
        On the 17th, we sailed along the coast, near as far as forty-one degrees, but, not meeting with any convenient harbour to anchor in, the land lying N. and S. when we came abreast of a round bluff cape, we turned back, being apprehen-sive that we should want water if we proceeded farther to the southward. We saw no canoes, but several villages, and, in the night, some fires burning upon the land. The coast appeared more barren than any we had seen before. There was clear ground, and good anchorage upon the coast, two or three miles from the shore; and from eight to twenty fathoms water. This cape we named CapeTurn-Again.
        On the 19th, in the afternoon, we were off Hawkes Bay, which we could not enter, the wind being foul. A canoe came to us with five people in it, who seemed to place great confidence in us: they came on board, and said they would stay all night. The man, who seemed to be the chief, had a new garment, made of the white silky flax, which was very strong and thick, with a beautiful border of black, red, and white round it.
        On the 20th, early in the morning, having a fine breeze, we made Table Cape, passed Poverty Bay, and came to a remarkable point of land, being a flat perpen-dicular triangular-shaped rock, behind which there appeared to be a harbour, but, on opening it, we found none: this point we called Gable-End Foreland. The country is full of wood, and looks very pleasant in this part; but, toward night, we saw some land that appeared very broken and dreary, formed into a number of points, over which we could see the back land.
        On the 2lst, we anchored in a very indifferent harbour, in eight fathoms and a half water, about one mile and a half from the shore, having an island on our left hand, which somewhat sheltered us. Many canoes came off to us, and two old men, of their chiefs, came on board. These people seemed very peaceably inclined, and were willing to trade with us for several trifles which they had brought with them. We saw many houses, and several tracts of land, partly hedged in and cultivated, which formed an agreeable view from the harbour, called, by the the natives, Tegadoo. Some of our boats went on shore for water, and found a rivulet where they filled their casks, and returned to the ship unmolested by the inhabitants, many of whom they saw near the rivulet.
            
      

        Description of the chiefs, warriors, and war-canoes, &c. of New-Zealand
        On the 22d, in the morning, the boats went on shore again for wood and water; and, a short time after, Mr. Banks and some others followed them; and, while they were absent, the natives came on board and trafficked with us; having brought some parcels of Oomarra, and exchanged them with us for Otaheite cloth, which is a scarce commodity amongst them. They were very cunning in their traffic, and made use of much low artifice. One of them had an axe made of the before-mentioned green stone, which he would not part with for any thing we offered him. Several of them were very curiously tataowed; and one old man was marked on the breast with a large volute, and other figures. The natives, both on board and on shore, behaved with great civility, and, at night, they began to heivo and dance in their manner, which was very uncouth; nothing could be more droll than to see old men with grey beards assuming every antic posture imaginable, rolling their eyes about, lolling out their tongues, and, in short, work-ing themselves up to a sort of phrenzy.
        The surf running high, the men who went on shore found great difficulty in getting the water into the long-boat, and, in coming off, the boat was swampt; we therefore enquired of the natives for a more convenient watering-place, and they pointed to a bay bearing S. W. by W.  On receiving this information we weighed anchor; but, the wind being against us, we stood off and on till the next morning, the 23d, and then bore away to leeward, and looked into the bay which we had passed before. About noon we dropped anchor, and one of our boats went into a little cove where there was smooth landing and fresh water, and we moored the ship about one mile and a half from the shore. This bay is called, by the natives, Tolaga, and is very open, being exposed to all the violence of the east wind.  Several canoes came along-side of the ship, of whom we got some fish, Oomarras, or sweet potatoes, and several other things; but the natives were very indifferent about most of the things we offered them, except white cloth and glasses, which suited their fancy, so that we found it difficult to trade with them. They had some green stone axes and ear-rings but they would not part with them on any terms; and as to their Oomarras, they set a great value upon them.
            
      

        
        The country about the bay is agreeable beyond description, and, with proper cultivation, might be rendered a kind of second Paradise. The hills are covered with beautiful flowering shrubs, intermingled with a great number of tall and stately palms, which fill the air with a most grateful fragrant perfume.
        We saw the tree that produces the cabbage, which ate well boiled. We also found some trees that yielded a fine transparent gum: and, between the hills, we discovered some fruitful valleys that are adapted either to cultivation or pasturage. The country abounds with different kinds of herbage fit for food; and, among such a variety of trees as are upon this land, there are, doubtless, many that pro-duce eatable fruit.  Our botanists were agreeably employed in investigating them, as well as many other lesser plants with which the country abounds. Within land there were many scandent ferns and parasaitic plants; and, on the sea shore, Sali-cornias, Misembrean, Mums, and a variety of Fucuss. The plant, of which they make their cloth, is a sort of Hemerocallis, and the leaves yield a very strong and glossy flax, of which their garments and ropes are made. Adjoining to their houses are plantations of Koomarra * and Taro †: These grounds are cultivated with great care, and kept clean and neat.
        The natives, who are not very numerous in this part of the country, behaved very civil to us: they are, in general, lean and tall, yet well shaped; have faces like Europeans; and, in general, the aquiline nose, with dark-coloured eyes, black hair, which is tied up on the crown of the head, and beards of a middling length. As to their tataowing, it is done very curiously in spiral and other figures; and, in many places, indented into their skins, which looks like carving; though, at a distance, it appears as if it had been only smeared with a black paint. This tataowing is peculiar to the principal men among them: servants and women content themselves with besmearing their faces with red paint or ochre; and, were it not for this nasty custom, would make no despicable appearance. Their cloth is white, and as glossy as silk, worked by hands, and wrought as even as if it had been done in a loom, and is chiefly worn by the men, though it is made by the women, who also carry burdens, and do all the drudgery.  Their cloathing consists in a girdle of platted grass, which they wear round their loins, having some leaves hung upon it, and a kind of grass-rug cloak thrown over their shoulders. Many of the women, that we saw, had very good features, and not the savage countenance one might expect; [see pl. XIX.] their lips were, in general, stained of a blue colour, and several of them were scratched all over their faces as if it had been done with needles or pins. This, with a number of scars which we saw on the bodies of the men, was done upon the decease of their relations. The men have their hair tied up, but the womens hangs down; nor do they wear feathers in it, but adorn it with leaves. They seem to be proud of their sex, and expect you should give them every thing they desire, because they are women; but they take care to grant no favours in return, being very different from the women in the islands who were so free with our men.

        The men have a particular taste for carving: their boats, paddles, boards to put on their houses, tops of walking sticks, and even their boats valens, are carved in a variety of flourishes, turnings and windings, that are unbroken; but their favourite figure seems to be a volute, or spiral, which they vary many ways, single, double, and triple, and with as much truth as if done from mathematical draughts: yet the only instruments we have seen are a chizzel, and an axe made of stone. Their fancy, indeed, is very wild and extravagant, and I have seen no imitations of nature in any of their performances, unless the head, and the heart-shaped tongue hanging out of the mouth of it, may be called natural, [See pl. XXVI. fig. 16.]
        The natives build their huts on rising ground under a tuft of trees; they are of an oblong square, and the eaves reach to the ground. The door is on one side, and very low, their windows are at one end, or both. The walls are composed of several layers of reeds covered with thatch, and are of considerable thickness. Over the beams, that compose the eaves, they lay a net made of grass, which is also thatched very close and thick. Their fires are made in the center upon the floor, and the door serves them for a chimney. Their houses, therefore, of course, must be full of smoke; and we observed that every thing brought out of them smelt strong of it; but use, which is a kind of second nature, makes them insensible of the inconvenience, or they would have found out some means to have removed it; for necessity is the mother of invention. We saw but few of their houses, and those few were mostly deserted, their inhabitants having forsaken them through fear of us, who, doubtless, appeared as strange kind of beings to them as they did to us.

        We saw many beautiful parrots, and birds of various kinds, one in particular that had a note very much like our blackbird; but we found no ground fowl, or domestic poultry. Of quadrupeds we saw no other than dogs, which were like those on the island of Otaheite, and of them but a few, though it cannot be supposed that so large a country, as this appears to be, should be destitute of deer, and other kind of four-footed animals.
        This bay abounds in a variety of fish, particularly shell and cray-fish; some of the latter, which we caught, weighed eleven pounds; these are found in great plenty, and seemed to be the principal food of the inhabitants, at this season of the year, though they have a kind of fern, the roots of which, roasted, make a good substitute for bread, especially when their Koomarra is young and unfit for use.
            
      

        Picturesque views on the coast
        Most of the rocks, which are many on the sea shore, are composed of a sandy stone, through which the surf had worn several passages. One of them, in particular, was very romantic, it had the appearance of a large arch which led from the sea-side into the vallies, and through it ran a stream of water. The whole formed a very uncommon view, [see pl. XX.] peculiarly striking to a curious spectator.
        From the view which we had of the coast, and the observations made, we might judge that the country is well situated, naturally fertile, and capable of great improvement by cultivation, especially as the climate is distinguishably mild and favourable.
        We had clear and fair weather all the time we were upon the coast, excepting one day, and, though the weather was hot, yet it seemed, by what we observed, that a sea breeze constantly set in about eleven oclock in the forenoon, which moderated it.
        On the 30th, having obtained a sufficient quantity of wood and water, we left the bay, and, sailing along the coast, about noon came up with a point of land be-fore an island: this point we called East Cape; and the island. East Island, from which the land altered its direction, and tended away to the west. This day the land appeared to us considerably higher than the rest. It was divided by fine deep valleys, and had all the appearance of a rich fertile country, being cloathed with large verdant trees, had some parcels of ground cultivated, and several rivulets among them which lost themselves in the sea. We could also discover several villages, which seemed to have been fenced in by art. We passed a bay which we called Hickss Bay, after our first lieutenant.
        On the 31st, we sailed along the coast, and had light breezes, and pleasant weather. In the forenoon seven canoes came off to us in a hostile manner, bran-dishing their lances, and waving their paddles. One of these canoes was very large, and had between fifty and sixty people in her; some of them gave us an heivo; and one of them, a priest, as we supposed, talked very much. They kept pad-dling about us, calling out to us Kaka kee, no Tootwais, harre yoota patta pattoo; that is to say, if we would go on shore they would beat us with their patta pattoos; and, being apprehensive that if we suffered them to approach nearer to us, we might be obliged to offer violence to them, the captain ordered a gun, loaded with grape-shot, to be fired over their heads, the report of which terrified them so much, that they paddled away till they had got, as they supposed, out of our reach, and then they stopped, and held a consultation; after which they seemed as if they intended to return, and we fired another gun loaded with ball, and then they made as fast as possible to the shore. These were the same sort of people, and their canoes of the same kind with those we had seen before. Being at this time off a cape, we named it, from the hasty retreat of the natives, Cape Run-away. This day we discovered land to the N. E. of us.
            
      

        
        On the 1st of November, a great number of canoes came off to us, one of which had part of a human skull to throw out the water with.  We prevailed on some of the natives to come along-side of the ship, and traded with them for cloth, crayfish, and muscles. They gave us severl [sic] Heivos, but some of them seemed to threaten us. A breeze springing up, we left them; and, a little farther on the coast, another squadron of fisher-boats came off to us, with whom also we had some traffic. These, as well as the rest, were very ready to snatch any thing they could lay their hands on; and, watching an opportunity, they stole a pair of sheets that were tied by a line at the ships stern, and were going off with them, upon which we fired several muskets, but they did not much regard them; we then fired some grape-shot amongst them, and they paddled away something faster, till they ima-gined themselves out of our reach, and then they held up their paddles, and seemed to defy us. We fired another gun loaded with round and grape-shot, which passed between two canoes, and narrowly missed them; on which they hesitated no longer, but repaired immediately to the shore.
        Toward night, we were near a small high island, called by the natives Mow-tohora, about three leagues from the land.  In going between this and the main land, a canoe came off to us from the island. This canoe was double, and differed in other respects from those we had seen before. After we had talked with the people which came in it a considerable time, they gave us several heivos, then looked at us very stedfastly, and, having threatened us, they stood off toward the main land. Opposite to this there is a high peaked hill, which we named Mount Edgecombe; and a small bay, which we called Lowland Bay, and the two points thereof, from their situation, Highland Point, and Lowland Point; the latter of which stretches a great way, and is covered with trees, near it there are three small islands, or rocks, and it was with difficulty that we steered clear of them in the night, and got into six fathoms water; soon after which we made a point of land, which we called Town Point: this was at the entrance of a little cove.
            
      

        
        On the 2d, in the morning, we discovered three sorts of land; but, as the weather was hazy, could not make many observations.  We also passed three other islands: one of them was rocky, high and barren, which we called White Island. The other two were lower; one of them we named Flat Island, in which which we saw a village. A canoe pursued us, but, having a brisk breeze, it could not overtake us. Toward night it blew pretty hard, right on shore; we therefore tacked about, and sailed backward and forward till the next morning, the 3d: then the canoe which we saw the night before gave us chace again; having a sail, they at length came up with us; sailed along-side of us for a considerable time, and now and then gave us a song, the tune of which was much like the chant which the popish priests use at mass: they also gave us a heivo, but soon after threw some stones at us: we fired a musket, loaded with small shot, at a young man who distinguished himself at the sport, and he shrunk down as if he had been wounded. After a short consultation they doused the sail, and stood back for an island.
        We sailed along with a moderate breeze, and passed an island, or cluster of rocks, which we called the Court of Aldermen: and, from the vicinity of one of the three last mentioned islands to them, we gave it the name of The Mayor.
        This cluster of rocks lies off a point of land, and terminates the bounds of this large bay to the N. W. which, from the number of canoes that came off to us, bringing provisions, we named The Bay of Plenty.
        The coast hereabout appeared very barren, and had a great number of rocky islands, from which circumstance we named the point, Barren Point. The land is very grotesque, being cleft, or torn into a variety of strange figures, and has very few trees upon it.  About noon, several canoes came off to us, and the people in them were so daring as to throw a lance into the ship, but we fired a musket, and they paddled away from us. Their canoes were formed out of one tree, and shaped like a butchers tray, without any ornament about them. The people, who were naked, excepting one or two, were of a very dark complexion, and made a mean appearance. We stood in for a bay, and, at night, anchored in it, having seven fathoms water. Several canoes, like the former, followed us; the people in them cut a despicable figure; but they were very merry, and gave us several heivos, or cheers.
            
      

        
        This bay, which the inhabitants call Opoorangee, is the best harbour we have found, being well land-locked; and we found good landing at the watering-place, in a salt-water river, which winds a great way up into the country.  At the bot-tom of the bay there is another river, which also seems to extend very far within land. The name the natives gave to the country, about the bay, is Konigoo-taoivrao.
        On the 4th, early in the morning, we were visited by several canoes; the people in them, about one hundred and thirty-five in number, had a few arms, but seemed unresolved what to do; sometimes staring at us in a wild manner, and then threatening us: but, at last, they traded with us, exchanging the few trifles they had brought for cloth. They were very sly, and attempted to cheat us. We fired several muskets at them, and wounded two of them; the rest, however, did not seem to be alarmed till the captain shot through one of the canoes, which struck them with a panic; and, on firing a great gun, they made off to land.
        On the 5th, in the morning, two of the natives came on board, and seemed to be very peaceably inclined: we made them some presents; they exchanged what trifles they had for small pieces of cloth, which they were very fond of, and went away highly pleased, promising to bring us some fish. Some people, it seemed, came to them now-and-then from the north, plundered them of every thing they could find, and carried their wives and children away captives; and not knowing who we were, nor our design in visiting their coast, was the reason that they were at first so shy of us. To secure themselves from these free-booters, they build their houses near together on the tops of rocks, which, it seems, they can easily defend against the assaults of their enemies; but, being so subject to the ravages of those ruffians, they are much dispirited, and that may be the principal cause of their poverty and wretchedness.
            
      

        
        We sent the pinnace to haul the seine, and caught a large draught of mullets, and other kind of fish. In the mean time the yaul drudged for shell-fish, and met with indifferent success.
        On the 9th, a great number of the natives came in canoes about the ship, and brought us a large quantity of fish, mostly of the mackrel kind, with a few John Dories; and we pickled down several casks full of them.
        Some of these canoes came from another part of the country, which were larger, and of a better sort than the rest: the people in them, too, had a better appearance; among whom there were some of superior rank, furnished with good garments, dressed up with feathers on their heads, and had various things of value amongst them, which they readily exchanged for Otaheite cloth. In one of the canoes there was a very handsome young man, of whom I bought some things: he seem-ed, by the variety of his garments, which he sold one after another till he had but one left, to be a person of distinction amongst them: his last garment was an upper one, made of black and white dog-skin, which one of the lieutenants would have purchased, and offered him a large piece of cloth for it, which he swung down the stern by a rope into the canoe; but, as soon as the young man had taken it, his companions paddled away as fast as possible, shouting, and brandishing their weapons as if they had made a great prize; and, being ignorant of the power of our weapons, thought to have carried it off securely; but a musket was fired at them from the stern of the ship: the young man fell down immediately, and, it is probable, was mortally wounded, as we did not see him rise again. What a severe punishment of a crime committed, perhaps, ignorantly! The name of this unfortunate young man, we afterwards learned, was Otirreeoònooe.
        The weather being clear all day, we made a good observation of the passage of Mercury over the suns disk, while Mr. Green made an observation on shore. From this circumstance the Bay was termed Mercury Bay.
        On the 11th, it blew very hard all day from the N. and N. by E. and a great swell tumbled into the bay, which rendered our situation a very favourable one; for, had we been out at sea, we should have had a lee-shore. The inhabitants did not venture out in their canoes this day; and, the night before, we were almost swamped in coming off in the long-boat, being upon the shoals, and the sea running high.
            
      

        
        While we lay in this bay the natives brought us a great number of cray-fish, of an enormous size, which were very good. These were caught by women, who dived for them in the surf amongst the rocks. A long-boat full of rock oysters, too, were brought on board of us at one time, which were good food, and tasted deliciously.  A little way up the river there were banks entirely composed of them. We also got abundance of parsley for the ships use; and, at the place where we watered, we found a great quantity of fern, the root of which partakes much of a farinaceous quality: the natives dry it upon the fire, then beat it upon a stone, and eat it instead of bread.
        On the 16th, in the morning, the weather being very fair, we weighed anchor, and stood out to sea, but, having a strong breeze from the west, which was against us all this day and the next, being the l7th, we did nothing but beat to windward. The country in view appeared rather barren, and had but few signs of inhabitants. We saw several islands, which we named Mercury islands.
        On the 18th, in the morning, we passed between the main and an island which appeared to be very fertile, and as large as Yoolee-Etea. Two canoes came to us from the main, having carved heads, like those we had seen in the bay of Opoorangee: one of them was longer than the other, and had sixty of the natives in her: they gazed at us awhile, and then gave us several heivos; but the breeze freshening, they were obliged to drop astern, and we soon left them. The coast hereabout is full of islands: the name of the largest is Waootaia; and one of the small ones is called Matoo Taboo. After we had passed this island, (the passage between which and the main we named Port Charles,) it seemed as if we were in a large bay, the land surrounding us on every side, excepting a-head, where we could discover none: we bent our course that way, and got, at length, inclosed between two shores, which seemed to form a kind of strait. Night coming on, we anchored here, not daring to venture farther, as we knew not whether we were in a strait or a bay. The land on both sides of us appeared very broken, and had a high and bold shore, tolerably well cloathed with verdure; but it appeared to be thinly inhabited; nor did we see any signs of cultivation. There are many small islands along the shore, among which are some good harbours.
            
      

        
        On the 19th, in the morning, several of the natives came on board of us: their canoes were the largest we had seen, and the people in them behaved very friendly. By what we could learn, they had got intelligence of us from the people that inhabit the country about Opoorangee Bay, which is not very distant. They told us this was not an entrance into the main, but a deep bay. Some of them presented us with a large parcel of smoaked eels, which tasted very sweet and luscious. We observed that the natives mode of salutation was by putting their noses together.
        We sailed along till we came to six fathoms water, and then let go our anchor. The weather being hazy, we could not have so good a view of the land upon the coast as we wished to have; but it appeared to be well covered with wood, and some parts of it cultivated. This day we caught a considerable quantity of fish, with hook and line, of the scienna or bream kind. The natives call this harbour Ooahaowragee.
        On the 20th, early in the morning, the Captain, Mr. Banks, and Dr. Solander, set out, in the long-boat and pinnace, for the bottom of this gulph, to see in what manner it terminated: and, as it blew very fresh, and a great swell rolled into the bay all day, they did not attempt to return till the next morning, the 21st; then, with some difficulty, on account of the swell, they reached the ship again, and reported, that they had been a considerable way up a fresh-water river, at the end of the gulph, in which they found three fathoms water. It was about half a mile broad, and would make an excellent harbour.  Near the entrance of this river, which they named the Thames, there was a village, and a Hippa, or place of re-fuge, erected to defend it, which was surrounded by piquets that reached above water when the tide was up; and, at low-water, it was unapproachable on account of a soft deep mud. The inhabitants of the village behaved civil and obliging, and promised to bring some provisions to the ship; but, the weather proving unfavourable, they could not fulfil their engagement.  On that day they also met with the large tree of which we had seen so many groves formed in different parts of the coast. This tree has a small narrow leaf, like a junipers, and grows to the height of ninety feet, and is nine feet in girth. It is generally found in low land, and has a very dark-coloured appearance at a distance. The natives, it is thought, make their canoes of this tree. They also saw several young cabbage palm-trees, and a new species of Pardanus, or palm-nut.
            
      

        
        In the afternoon we weighed anchor, proceeded down the gulph with the tide, the wind blowing hard from N. N. W. and, toward night anchored pretty near the shore.
        On the 22d, in the evening, several canoes, full of people, some of whom we saw the night before, came on board, brought us some provisions, and parted very readily with their cloaths, and any thing they had about them, for pieces of waste paper and Otaheite cloth, which they put about their heads and ears, and were very proud of their dress.
        The wind being still against us, we were obliged to tide it down the river, and anchored between tides, and passed a point of land which we called Point Rodney.
        The next day, being the 23d, we had heavy rains, accompanied with thunder.
        On the 24th, we had a smart breeze from the S. W. and, sailing along shore, passed between the main and a number of islands of several sizes. The appearance of the coast was very different at different places; well cloathed and verdant in some parts, and barren in others; but we saw no signs of inhabitants in any.  We anchored in an open bay, and caught a great number of large fishes of the scienna or bream kind; we therefore named this Bream Bay; and the two extreme points which formed it, Bream Head and Bream Tail. Off this bay lies a parcel of rocks, to which we gave the appellation of the Hen and Chickens.
        On the 25th, we had clear weather, with the wind at S. W. The coast we passed along that day was mostly level, having but few signs of inhabitants: toward night several large canoes came off to us, filled with people, armed with a variety of weapons; they paddled round the ship, singing and dancing; sometimes grinning, and then threatening: we trafficked with them for some things; but they went off with some others, meaning to take an advantage of us. While they were parlying among themselves we fired several muskets at them, loaded with small shot, which they attempted to skreen themselves from with their ahavos, or cloaks. We fired again, and splintered one of their canoes, which seemed to alarm them much, and they paddled away from us as fast as possible, till they thought themselves out of our reach, and then they stopped and threatened us; but we fired a great gun, which so thoroughly disconcerted them, that they made the best of their way to the shore. These people were much like them we had seen heretofore, excepting that they were more tataowed: most of them had the figure of volutes on their lips, and several had their legs, thighs, and part of their bellies, marked. One woman, in particular, was very curiously tataowed. The tataow upon their faces was not done in spirals, but in different figures from what we had ever seen before.
            
      

        
        On the 26th, many canoes visited us. The people in them were much the same as the former. They had a variety of things on board, and about them, but were loth to part with any of them excepting fish, of which we obtained a large quantity.
        The coast we sailed along this day, was generally barren, and broke into a number of small islands, among which we presumed there might be safe and good anchorage. We had calm and pleasant weather.
        On the 27th, we were among a parcel of small broken islands, which we called the Poor Knights; and many canoes came along-side of us, but the people in them seemed to be half mad. We asked them for some fish, and they took them up by handfuls and threw them at us, not regarding whether they had any thing from us in return: more canoes coming up, they began to behave very rudely, and heaved stones at us. One man, in particular, more active than the rest, took up a stick and threw it at one of our men on the taffel. A musket loaded with small shot was fired at him, upon which he clapped his hands to his face and fell flat in the canoe. This event alarmed the rest, and they made off as fast as they could, and we saw no more of them.

        The wind having been against us for several days, and as we could get no farther with our heavy ship, on the 29th, in the morning, having weathered a long point of land, which we named Cape Brett, we bore away to leeward; got into a very large harbour, where we were land-locked, and had several pretty coves on every side of us. We passed a small island which we named Piercy Island, and soon after cast anchor.  Many canoes came off to us; and the people in them, according to custom, behaved somewhat unruly: while I saluted one of them, in their manner, he picked my pocket. Some of our people fired upon them, but they did not seem to regard it much. One of our boats went on shore, and then they set off all at once, and attempted to seize her, in which, however, they sailed; but soon after Mr. Banks got on shore, he had like to have been apprehended by one of the natives, but happily escaped. The marines fired upon them; five great guns were fired from the ship, and Otegoowgoow, [see pl. XXI] son to one of their chiefs, was wounded in the thigh. The natives, affrighted, fled precipitately to a Hippa, where our people followed them; and, at length, they became very submissive. Had these barbarians acted more in concert, they would have been a formidable enemy, and might have done us much mischief; but they had no kind of order or military discipline among them. They gave us some large mackarel, which ate very deliciously, and that was almost the only article they would part with.
        On the 5th of December, we weighed anchor, but were becalmed at the entrance of the bay, which we called the Bay of Islands, from the many islands in it. However, as it frequently happens in life, a lesser evil secured us from a greater; being detained here, we escaped a severe gale at sea, that might have proved very dangerous to us, as the wind blew a perfect hurricane, one day, accompanied with heavy showers of rain.
        The natives (being more sensible of our power) behaved very civil, and brought us a great many fish; and while we lay here, we caught some ourselves with hook and line.
            
      

        
        A canoe came into the bay that had eighty people in her, most of whom paddled; the chiefs wore garments of dogs skins, and were very much tataowed; the men upon their hips, and the women on their breasts, necks, and bellies. We saw many plantations of the Koomarra, and some of the Eaowte, or cloth trees.
        At night, again, it was almost calm, and we were near the shore. We designed to tack about, but were hurried, by an eddy-tide, upon the breakers, off a point of land called, by us. Point Pococke, before we were aware of it, which threw us into a panic, and occasioned great confusion. Not having room to anchor, we hoisted out the pinnace to tow her off: we thought we had seen a whale, but it proved to be a rock, and we struck upon it twice.  We got clear of it again, and streamed the buoy, but luckily did not let go the anchor.  Soon after we saw several small islands, which we named Cavalle Islands. We passed two points of land which formed a bay, to which we gave the appellation of Doubtless Bay; and the two points which formed it were called by us Bay Point, and Knuckle Point.  We were now got into a very long open bay, which, from the appearance of the country, we named Sandy Bay.
        We beat to windward four days, and made but little way, having continual breezes from the west; and, on the 19th[sic], many canoes came off to us, of which we bought a good quantity of fish. The land hereabout looked very barren, and tends away to the north.
        On the 10th, the wind was N. W. we beat to windward, and made but little way. The land in sight was very low, and very barren, being mostly sandy, having here and there a few bushes, but scarce a tree to be seen, yet it appeared to be inhabited.
        On the 13th, the N.W. wind still prevailing, we could do nothing but lie on and off the land, without making any way. It blew very hard, and we had some fierce squalls, attended with heavy showers of rain, which drove us back to where we had been four days before.
            
      

        
        On the 14th, we were quite out of sight of land; the wind continued to blow very strong; we had great swells from the west; and our sails being very tender, many of them were much torn in the gale.
        On the 17th, in the morning, we were near land again, which seemed to be the farthest north, the land tending away from this point, which we called the North Cape to the South West. This land was pretty high, with a table top. We saw no canoes, nor any inhabitants; but, in the evening, we saw some smoke on the high land.
        On the 20th, the wind still continuing westerly, we got no farther than the last bluff point.  We had some violent squalls of wind, with heavy rains, thunder, and lightening.
        On the 21st, in the morning, the wind came about to the south; but, as we were a considerable distance from shore, we could only stand to the westward, without being able to get near the land.
        On the 24th, after having beat about for three days, we discovered land, which we supposed was the island of the Three Kings, though we could not bring it to appear any thing like the described figure of that island in Dalrymples Book, having nothing of that broken appearance which that figure exhibits, forming one large clump of land, rather flat at the top, with eleven small rocks lying in a row from it. It being calm, Mr. Banks went out in the small boat; and we saw some birds so much like our island geese, that we could not have distinguished the difference. We caught several of them, made them into a pye, and they tasted excellently.
        On the 27th, in the morning, it blew very hard from the east, all day, accompanied with heavy showers of rain, and we brought the ship to under a reef main-sail.
            
      

        
        On the 28th, the wind veered about to the S. W. and blew from that quarter fiercer than it had done the day before from the east; the sea also ran very high, and we brought to under a balanced mizen, and a mizen stay-sail.
        On the 30th, we discovered land to leeward of us, which we took for Cape Maria Van Diemen; but as the wind continued still very boisterous, and the sea ran very high, we did not venture to approach near it; we therefore tacked about, and stood to the N. W. intending to stand backwards and forwards till the weather should be more moderate. In the evening, we discovered the island of the Three Kings, on our lee-bow, and tacked about, without attempting to weather it.
        On the 31st, the wind blowing from the S. W. we did not approach the shore, but, in the afternoon, we saw the land very plain, and discovered a mountain which we had seen on the other side of the land; we called it Mount Camel, from its likeness to that animal: to the north of which it appears very sandy and barren, having only here and there a green plat. The same neck of land we saw on the other side, which reaches to Cape Maria Van Diemen, and this tends to the S. E.
        On the 3d of January, 1770, in the forenoon, we saw the land again; this was high flat table land, and tended away to the S. E. where we lost sight of it; the wind still continued between the south and west.
        On the 4th, we stood along shore: the coast appeared very low, sandy, and barren. About noon, the wind began to frisk and blow from the S.W. and fearing, if it should blow fresher, that we might get foul on a lee-shore, we tacked about, and proceeded to the N. W.  Before we tacked, we observed a bending of the land which we thought might be a bay, but it proved otherwise, and we there-fore named it False Bay.
        On the 7th, we had light breezes and calms for several days, with fair weather, and were out of sight of land. On that day we saw a sun fish, very short and thick, having scarce any tail, but two large fins; it was as big as a shark, and of the same colour.
            
      

        
         
Plate XXII.  View of the great Peak, & the adjacent Country, on the West Coast of New Zealand.
            
      

        
        On the 9th, we had a pleasant breeze from the N. E. the weather gloomy; the land in view low and level, tending away to the S. E. In the evening it appeared higher, and tended suddenly to the west; but we were not near enough to distinguish any thing upon it.
        On the 10th, we had a fine breeze from the north, and passed a high sloping land, covered with wood, where we had seen some smoke. A few leagues farther from this point, which we called Woody Point, we saw a small flat island, or rock, which was almost covered with gannets, or soland geese; and therefore called it Gannet Island. Soon after we passed a point of land, at which time, seeing a number of albatrosses on the sea, we named it Albatross Point: This point stretched out a great way, and formed a small harbour. As we proceeded on our course, the land, though level, appeared much higher, and pretty well cloathed with verdure. We saw a point of land which we called, from its appearance, Sugar-Loaf Point, near which are several small islands; and, from their vicinity to the point, we named them Sugar-Loaf Isles. The weather being still gloomy, and the wind veering about to the S. W. we were obliged to stand off and on the land.
        On the 11th, in the evening, we discovered a very peaked hill, which appeared to be as high as the peak of Teneriffe; [see pl. XXII.] and all the bottom part of it was covered with clouds in the same manner; we named it Mount Egmont.
        The next morning, on the 12th, we approached nearer to it, but could not see the top of it, which was lost in the clouds. From this peak the land declined gradually to a point on each side, one ending in the sea, and the other stretching to the coast north of it, which was, in general, low and level, but covered with trees, as were also both sides of the peak. When we were abreast of it we had very heavy showers of rain, with thunder and lightening; and, at length, the peak itself was totally inveloped in darkness. In the night we saw a large fire, The point off this peak we called Cape Egmont.
            
      

        
        On the 13th, early in the morning, we descried the top of the peak, which was streaked with snow, and, finding the land tended away to the east, we concluded that we were in a large bay.
        On the 14th, we saw land ahead of us, and still apprehended we were in a large bay. We also discovered several islands and very deep breaks in the land; The coast hereabout is very high, and the tops of the hills are covered with clouds; but, the weather being hazy, we saw nothing on the land excepting a fire lit up at night.
        On the 15th, in the forenoon, having reached to the farther end of the supposed bay, we entered into a smaller, or rather a harbour, it being land-locked on every side.  At the entrance of this harbour there are two islands, on the smallest of which we discovered a Hippa: we passed very near it, and the natives flocked in crouds to gaze at us. We stood in for a little cove, and anchored within two cables length of the shore, opposite to a small rivulet which ran into the sea. Some of our people went on shore, and shot some birds: we also hauled the sein, and caught a large draught of fishes, some of which weighed twenty-one pounds; and, on the shore, we found muscles, and other sorts of shell-fish, in great plenty.
        All the coves of this bay teem with fish of various kinds, such as cuttle-fish, large breams, (some of which weighed twelve pounds, and were very delicious food, having the taste of fine salmon,) small grey breams, small and large baracootas, flying gurnards, horse-mackarel, dog-fish, soles, dabs, mullets, drums, scorpenas or rock-fish, cole-fish, the beautiful fish called chimera, and shaggs.
        The manner in which the natives of this bay catch their fish is as follows:— They have a cylindrical net, extended by several hoops at the bottom, and contracted at the top; within the net they stick some pieces of fish, then let it down from the side of a canoe, and the fish, going in to feed, are caught with great ease.
            
      

        
        The country, about the cove where we lay, is entirely covered with wood, and so full of a sort of supple-jack, that it is difficult to pass through it: there is also a little sand fly which is very troublesome; and the bite of it is venomous, raising a bump upon the skin which itches very much. The tops of some of the hills, which at first appeared to be bare, we found covered with the fern plant, which grows up to about a mans height. The hills decline gently to the waters-edge, and leave no flat land excepting one place.
        The woods abound with divers kinds of birds, such as parrots, wood-pigeons, water-hens; three sorts of birds having wattles; hawks; with a variety of birds that sing all night. We also found a great quantity of a species of Philadelphus, which makes a good substitute for tea. At one particular place we met with a substance that appeared like a kids skin, but it had so weak a texture, that we concluded it was not leather; and were afterward informed, by the natives, that it was gathered from some plant called Teegoomme: one of them had a garment made of it, which looked like their rug cloaks.
        The air of the country, one would imagine, is very moist, and endued with some peculiar putrescent qualities, as we found maggots in birds a few hours after they had been shot.
        The natives came to us sometimes, and behaved peaceably; but, to our surprise, we had adequate proofs that they are CANNIBALS. Some of our people, in the pinnace, went into a little cove, where one family resided, and saw several human bones which appeared to have been lately dressed and picked; and were told, that a little while before, six of their enemies had fallen into their hands; four they killed and ate; the other two jumped into the water and escaped from them, but they were unfortunately drowned, and our people saw one of their bodies floating upon the water. The natives also brought us several human bones on board, and offered them to sale, sucking them in their mouths, and, by the signs which they made to us, evinced that they thought human flesh delicious food. One day, in particular, they brought four skulls to sell; but they rated them very high. These skulls had their brains taken out, and some of them their eyes, but the scalp and hair was left upon them. They looked as if they had been dried by the fire, or by the heat of the sun. We also found human bones in the woods, near the ovens, where they used to partake of their horrid midnight re-pasts: and we saw a canoe the baler of which was made of a mans skull. The natives seemed even to take pride in their cruelty, as if it was the most laudable virtue, instead of one of the worst of moral vices; and shewed us the manner in which they dispatched their prisoners, which was to knock them down with their patta pattoos, and then to rip them up.
            
      

        Singular head-dresses of the natives
        The natives, in this part of New Zealand, [see pl. XXIII.] wear large bunches of feathers on their heads, and their garments in a singular manner, just as Abel Tasmen, the person who, about one hundred and fifty years ago, discovered this land, has figured in his work. They were not desirous of any thing we had except nails, which they soon discovered to be useful.
        When these people are pleased on any particular occasion, they express it by crying Ai, and make a cluck with their tongues not unlike a hens when she calls her chickens.
        We heard a great cry, or howling, at the Hippa every night, and, most likely, at that time they were cutting and slashing themselves, according to their custom, which is done with a piece of green stone, shell, or sharks tooth, which they drive into their flesh, and draw it along, beginning at their feet and continuing it to their heads.
        While we lay here, some of our people went toward the Hippa in a boat; several of the natives came out to welcome them; most likely they took it to be a traverse, and Mr. Monkhouse shot at them. An old man came in a few days after and told us one person was dead of a wound which he received. In this Hippa there are about thirty-two houses, containing upwards of two hundred inhabitants. Some of our people saw the bones of a girl, the flesh of which, they said, they ate the day before. Another party of our people, going to an isle on the other side of the bay, met with a canoe, and were told, that a young girl had been taken from them.

        There are many small islands around that appear to be entirely barren; and we saw no Inhabitants upon this excepting those that belong to the Hippa; and they neither sow nor plant any thing, but live chiefly on fish, and on their neigh-bours when they can catch them.
        We saw one of their Hippas which was situated on a very high rock, hollow underneath, forming a most grand natural arch, one side of which was connected with the land; the other rose out of the sea. Underneath this arch a small vessel might have sailed. [See pl. XXIV.] It was near a pleasant bay, and almost inaccessible: one of the natives came out and waved a large garment, or piece of cloth, to us as we passed along.
        Their canoes were very stately ones: very few of the natives are tataowed: we asked them if their ancestors had not told them of such a ship as ours that they had seen in their time, but they appeared to be entirely ignorant of it. These cannibals told us, that the people, who belonged to those they had slain and eaten, were coming to them, over the hills, to kill them the next day, but it proved a false alarm.
        On the 1st of February, we had a strong wind from the N. E. The hawser with which we moored the ship was broke by the strain of the sea, it being fastened on shore to a tree, and we were obliged to let go another bower. It rained all this day and part of the next, continuing, without intermission, for thirty-two hours.
        On the 6th, we left the bay, which we called Cannibal Bay, having been in it about three weeks. The captain called it Charlottes Sound. The two points, which form the entrance, were named Cape Koomarroo, and Point Jackson. The natives call the land about it Totarranooe. We bent our course to an opening at the entrance of this bay, on the east, which we saw on our coming into it, concluding it a passage between the north and south part of this island. In the evening we were in the mouth of the straits, where we were becalmed. On a sudden we were carried toward a parcel of broken islands, or rather rocks, which lie at the entrance of the straits; the two largest we named the Two Brothers. Being alarmed, we ran to the poop of the ship, where we heard a great noise, and saw the appearance of breakers, upon which we drove bodily astern; neared the islands quickly; let go our anchor; and, before we had veered away 150 fathoms of cable, we found ourselves amongst these supposed breakers, which proved to be a strong tide that set through the straits; it made a very great ripling, especially near the islands, where the water, running in heaps, bears, and whirl-pools, made a very great noise in its passage. These straits run nearly in a north and south direction.
            
      

        
        On the 7th, we weighed anchor, and proceeded along the straits with the tide and a fine breeze, which set us through with great rapidity. At the entrance into the straits, from the north, there is a small island on the north side, near a point of land on the main; this island we called Entry Island. The land on the south side is very high, and but thinly cloathed, though we saw here and there a fine level. At one part, in particular, the land was very low, and seemed to form an entrance. We saw a very long row of high trees, like those at Hawkes bay, and at Ooahaowragee, or the river Thames; and it is probably the mouth of some river. We called this bay Cloudy Bay; opposite to which, on the other side of the straits, is a cape or point of land which the natives of Cannibal Bay call Teera-witte. Here is also a great number of hills, and one much higher than the rest, having its summit covered with snow, which we saw at a great distance. The north coast tended away eastward; and the south to the S. S. W, which we followed till the night closed in upon us; then the wind chopped about; and, being willing to satisfy ourselves whether the north part of this land was an island, we resolved to sail as far north as Cape Turnagain. These straits, which we named Cooks Straits, are about thirteen miles long, and fourteen broad. The two easter-most points of which we called Cape Campbell and Cape Palliser. The flood tide comes strong in from the southward, and, on the days of new and full moon, it is high water about eleven oclock.
        On the 8th, we sailed along the southern coast of this island: the weather was hazy, but we discovered many extensive lawns, with some high hills, the tops of which which were mostly flat. In the afternoon, three canoes came off to us; two of them were large and handsome. The natives in them, who seemed to have been out and mangled in several parts of their bodies, behaved peaceably; and, by asking for nails, we concluded they had heard of us from the people of some other islands where we had been. They were much like the natives of Mataroowkaow, a vil-lage in Tolaga Bay; being very neatly drest, having their hair knotted on the crown of their heads in two bunches, one of which was Tamoou, or plaited, and the wreath bound round them the same. In one of the canoes there was an old man who came on board, attended by one of the natives; he was tataowed all over the face, with a streak of red paint over his nose, and across his cheek. His brow, as well as the brows of many others who were with him, was much furrowed; and the hair of his head and beard quite silvered with age.  He had on a flaxen garment, ornamented with a beautiful wrought border; and under it a petticoat, made of a sort of cloth which they call Aooree Waow: on his ears hung a bunch of teeth, and an ear-ring of Poonamoo, or green stone. For an Indian, his speech was soft, and his voice so low that we could hardly hear it.  By his dress, carriage, and the respect paid to him, we supposed him to be a person of distinction amongst them.
            
      

        
        We observed a great difference betwixt the inhabitants on this tide of the land, north of Cooks Straits, and those of the south. The former are tall, well-limbed, clever fellows; have a deal of tataow, and plenty of good deaths; but the latter are a set of poor wretches, who, though strong, are stinted in their growth, and seem to want the spirit or sprightliness of the northern Indians. Few of them are tataowed, or have their hair oiled and tied up; and their canoes are but mean.
        On the 9th, at noon, latitude south, we had a good view of Cape Turnagain. We hauled in our wind to S. W. to make the land on the other side of Cooks Straits. The coast we sailed along was lower, and had many white clayey and chalky cliffs upon it. We passed two points of land to which we gave the names of Castle Point and Flat Point.
            
      

        
        On the 14th, we passed Cooks Straits, without seeing them, on the east side of  * Toaipoonamoo. The land consists of high ridges of mountains, whose tops, streaked with snow, had but little verdure upon them; and, at the bottom of them, we saw but little low land.
        In the afternoon, four double canoes, in which were fifty-seven people, came off to us; they had some leaves about their heads, but few cloaths on their bodies, and seemed to be poor wretches. They kept aloof from us, nor could we persuade them to traffic with us.
        On the 16th, we sailed along shore, and had frequent calms. About noon we passed a broad opening which seemed to divide the land; on the N. W. side of which is a small bay, which we named Gores Bay. In the evening the land tend-ed away to the S.W. and formed in various bluff points, and was, within, of a middling height, very broken, and somewhat bare. We saw some smoke, but were not near enough to make any accurate observations. We passed also the ap-pearance of several good harbours.
        On the 17th, we saw more land which still tended away to the S.W. and, It is pro-bable, the straits we saw is a passage between the main or land we sailed along the day before and the island or land we saw this day; or this may, perhaps, be a con-tinuation of the larger. About the middle of this island, which we called Bankss Island, there seems to be a fine large bay. We hauled in our wind, and stood to the east, one of the lieutenants being persuaded that he saw land in that quarter; but, in the evening, we bore away to the south, and, on the 18th, Latitude 45° 16, we hauled in our wind, and stood to the west, being certain that we could not miss of land if there was any so far to the south. In the evening we saw vast shoals of grampusses and bottle-nosed porpoises.
        On the 19th, standing still to the westward, with a brisk breeze, in the fore-noon, we discovered high land southward of us, being then, by our reckoning, thirty-three leagues to the westward, and eight southward of the land we had parted from when we sailed to the east. We hauled in our wind and stood for it.
        * Or the Land of Poonamoo, which is the name by which the natives distinguish the southern division of this island, and where the Poonamoo, or Green Stone, is found. The northern division of New Zealand is called by them Eaheino-Mauwe
            
      

        
        On the 20th, in the morning, we were near the land, which formed an agreeable view to the naked eye. The hills were of a moderate height, having flats that extended from them a long way, bordered by a perpendicular rocky cliff next to the sea; but, when viewed through our glasses, the land appeared very barren, having only a few trees in the valleys, or furrows of the hills, and had no signs of inhabitants. The air was very sharp and cold.
        Having beat to windward for several days without gaining any way, with the weather gloomy and very cold, on Saturday, the 24th, we had a fresh breeze from the north, which carried us round the outermost point, which we called Cape Saunders: beyond which the land tended away to the S. W.
        The next day, the 25th, we had variable winds and calms till the afternoon; and then we had the wind from the S. W. which was directly against us: it blew very violently, and we were obliged to go under fore and main sails; and tore our fore-sail in pieces. The land thereabout was pretty high, indifferently well covered with trees, but had no signs of inhabitants.
        On the 27th, it continued blowing hard from the S. W. we lay to all day: at length the wind abated, but continued still in our teeth. Thermometer 46.
        On the 4th of March, after having beat about near a week, by the favour of a breeze from the north, we got sight of land again, which tended away to the S. W. and by W. and appeared to be of great extent. We had a continual rolling swell from the S. W. and saw the appearance of a harbour, which we named Moulineuxs Harbour, after the name of the master of our ship. We had light breezes and calms till the ninth; and, at the dawn of that day, we narrowly escaped running the ship upon a ledge, or parcel of craggy rocks; some of which were but just seen above water. They were luckily discovered by the midshipmans going to the mast head. The breeze being moderate, we put the helm a-lee, and were delivered from this imminent danger by the good providence of God. The land, which we then saw at a considerable distance, seemed to be an island, having a great opening between it and the land which we had passed before; but, the captain designing to go round, we steered for the south point, hoping it was the last. This large opening we named South-East Bay; on the N. W. side of which there is a small long island, that we called Bench Island. We stood out to sea, but, meeting with contrary winds, we beat to windward for a considerable time: at length, the wind coming fair, we steered westerly, and, unexpectedly, found ourselves between two large shoals, which had some rocks upon them; but we fortunately escaped them. We called these shoals The Traps. Toward night, we got so far round as to make the point bear N.N.E. and then we saw some kind of stuff upon it that glittered very much, but could not discover what it was composed of.  This day the weather was more moderate than it had been for many days; and being one of the inferior officers birth day, it was celebrated by a peculiar kind of festival; a dog was killed that had been bred on board; the hind quarters were roasted; and a pye was made of the fore quarters, into the crust of which they put the fat; and of the viscera they made a haggis.
            
      

        
        On the 10th, we stood out a considerable way to sea; and, on the 11th, in the morning, fetched the land, and approached near it. It had the appearance of a cluster of islands, or a bay with a large break, being divided by a number of valleys and peaked hills, many of which were pretty well covered with wood, and had some snow on the tops of them; but we saw no signs of inhabitants. We called this bay South-West Bay, near which lies a small island, that we named Solanders Isle. Having contrary winds we were driven back as far as 47° 45 south latitude; but, the wind coming round again, we steered north-westerly, and made a point of land, which we named the West Cape. We went round this cape; on the N. E. side of which there is a small bay; we called it Dusky Bay; and the N. W. point of it we called Five Fingers Point, about which we saw several rocks.
        On the 13th, we sailed along the western coast with a very brisk breeze from the south. The land appeared very romantic, having mountains piled on mountains to an amazing height; but they seemed to be uninhabited. We saw the appearance of some good harbours, one of which, larger than the rest, we called Doubtful Harbour; but night coming on we did not venture into any of them.
            
      

        
        On the 14th, we sailed along shore with a pleasant breeze; the land rose immediately from the waters edge to a very great height. Some of the highest hills were covered with snow, and the others with wood; but we saw no signs of inhabitants. We passed several breaks in the land, which might be good harbours, but we did not enter into any of them. We saw, this day, a great number of albatrosses.
        On the 16th, having a breeze, we sailed along the shore of the land we had passed the day before, which appeared as wild and romantic as can be conceived. Rocks and mountains, whose tops were covered with snow, rose in view one above another from the waters edge: and those near the shore were cloathed with wood, as well as some of the valleys between the hills, whose summits reached the clouds. We saw a break in the land which we thought might be a good harbour, but it proved only a small open bay, we therefore called it Mistaken Bay. As we sailed along we passed a broken point, that had a flat top, from which the water poured down into the sea, and formed three grand natural cascades. This point we named Cascades Point. On the N. E. side of it there was a bay which we called Open Bay.
        On the 20th, we met with contrary winds, which carried us away to the west-ward; but, the wind coming favourable again, we resumed our former course, and came up with a head of land which we named Cape Foul Wind.
        On the 24th, we saw a point of land which we called Rocks Point, and soon after met with a Cape; and, when we got round it, found ourselves in a large bay, but did not anchor in it. The land tended away to the S. E. and, at the bottom of the bay, there is probably a river. We continued our course to the S. E. and came up with a large tract of land stretching a good way from the main to a point, near which there is a small island. We named this point Cape Stephens; and the island Stephens Isle. Having weathered the point we found ourselves in a large bay, which we called Admiralty Bay. In the mouth of this bay there are several small islands, which we named Admiralty Isles.
            
      

        Map of the coast of New Zealand
        On the 26th, in the evening, we anchored in the Bay, which we found was about ten leagues N.W. of Charlottes Sound, or Cannibal Bay, after having endured the dangers of foul winds, and the tedious suspense of many calms*. The inhabitants of Cannibal Bay, where we were on the 6th of February, told us, that we might sail round the south land in four days, but we had been near seven weeks in making the tour. There is no low land hereabout, the hills rising from the waters edge. Since we came from Charlottes Sound, we saw no signs of inhabitants, except one smoke, which, perhaps, arose from some other than the hand of man, for it would seem that this land was almost entirely uninhabited, except Charlottes Sound; and it has all the appearance of a cluster of islands, through which there are various straits, though we had no time to discover them. This second part of the land is about the size of the other, and the whole together is as large as Great-Britain.
        In this bay we saw some deserted houses, but no inhabitants; and the land about it is more wild and not so flat as Charlottes Sound; but the bay abounded as plentifully with fish, and we caught a great quantity with hooks and lines, which were distributed amongst the ships company. We had now passed near six month, on the coast of New Zealand; had surveyed it on every side, and discovered it to be an island near three hundred leagues in length; inhabited by Cannibals, accustomed to the carnage of war from their infancy, and peculiarly undaunted, as well as in-sensible of danger.
        The captain having fulfilled his orders, it was at his option to stay as much longer in these seas as the safety of the ship and provisions would admit; and to return home either by the East-Indies or Cape Horn. Considering that Cape Horn was at a great distance from this bay; that the season of the year was at hand which is the most unfavourable for going into so high a latitude; and that at the present time, and for five months past, the monsoons prevailed in the Chinese seas; it was thought best to proceed west to the coast of New Holland, and so to the northward along it, in order to find a convenient refreshing place; then to search for the supposed Straits between New Holland and New Guinea, (which, it is thought, admiral Torrey went through;) and along the north coast of New Holland, to the island of Java; but, if these could not be found, it was proposed to proceed along the coast to Dampiers Straits, which lie between New Guinea and New Britain; then to cross the line, and sail down among the spice islands to Java, as we were in want of many kinds of provisions, particularly sugar, salt, oil, tea, and tobacco: our spirits also very low: and, as to bread, we had not had any for upwards of six months, and our sails were nearly worn out.
        * The Map annexed, in which the ships track is accurately marked, will give the reader an idea of the fatigue and danger which attended our traverse. [See pl. XXV.]

        Something has already been mentioned respecting the language of the New-Zealanders, and of its affinity to that of the people of Otaheite; the following Vocabulary will more fully shew this agreement, which is a very extraordinary circumstance, and leads us to conclude that one place was originally peopled from the other, though they are at near two thousand miles distance, and nothing but the ocean intervenes, at least to our knowledge; and such a long navigation, we should hardly believe, could be practicable in their small canoes, the only vessels that they appear to have ever possessed; yet what should lead too distinct people, having no communication with each other, to affix the same sounds to the same things, would be hard to account for In any other manner. This opinion is farther corroborated, by comparing their customs and manners, as also their instruments of war and household utensils, which will be found to agree in many particulars. The migra-tion was probably from New-Zealand to Otaheite; as the inhabitants of the former place were totally unacquainted with the use of bows and arrows till we first taught them; whereas the people of the latter island use them with great dexterity, having doubtless discovered the use of them by some accident after their separation; and it cannot be supposed that the New-Zealanders would have lost so beneficial an acquisition, if they had ever been acquainted with it.

        Description and delineation of the military weapons and household implements, personal adornments, &c. of New-Zealand
        Having given a plate, containing principally the figures of the New-Zealand household and warlike INSTRUMENTS, it may be proper here to give a description of them. [See pl. XXVI.]
         
Plate XXVI.  Various Kinds of Instruments Utensils &c, of the Inhabitants of New Zealand, with some Ornaments &c, of the People of Terra del Fuego & New Holland.
        Fig. 1. An Ornament for the Neck, made of three round pieces of Auris Marina, or ear-shell, the inside of which is a beautiful coloured pearl. These pieces are notched on the edges, and strung on a piece of plaited tape, made of white flax, and coloured red. It hangs loosely about the neck, and is two feet, eight inches and a half long.
        2. One of their common Paddles; when used it is held by one hand at the top of the handle, in which there is a hole, and by the other at the bottom, where it is carved very neatly, being five feet, nine inches and a half long.
        3. A Fish-hook, made of wood, and pointed with bone, which is tied on with twine; three inches and three quarters long.
            
      

        Implements of 
        4. A Fish-hook, made of two pieces of bone tied together; the line is fastened both at top and bottom; and, to the latter part, they tie some small feathers. The length of this hook is 4 3/8 inches.
        5. A Fish-hook, made of wood, pointed with bone; about two inches and a half long.
        6. A large Fish-hook, made of wood, and pointed with bone, having the end, to which the line is fastened, curiously carved; eight inches and a half long.
        7. A Fish-hook, made of human bone; one inch and a quarter long.
        8. A Fish-hook, made of wood, pointed with shell; five inches 5/8 in length.
        9. A Fish-hook, made of wood, and pointed with a substance that looked like one part of the beak of a small bird; two inches and a half long.
        10. A Fish-hook, made of wood, and pointed with bone; three inches and a half long.
        11. A Fish-hook, made of bone; one inch and a quarter long.
        12. An Ornament made of bone, probably of some deceased relation, and worn in the ear; one inch and three quarters long.
        13. and 14. are treated of in the accounts of Terra del Fuego and New-Holland.
        15. A piece of Wood, part of the head of a canoe, singularly carved; nine inches and a quarter in length.
        16. A favourite Ornament, which resembles a human face, made of wood, coloured red, and is much like some of the Roman masks. The eyes are made of the fine coloured ear-shell mentioned No. 1, laid into the wood. This was six inches long; but they have different sizes. Some of the smaller ones have handles carved very ingeniously; these they frequently held up when they approached the ship: perhaps it may be the figure of some idol which they worship.

        Implements of 
        17, 18, and 19, are Figures of Patta-pattoos, or War-bludgeons. They have holes in the handles of them, through which a string is passed and tied round the wrist when they make use of them. Numbers 17 and 19, are made of wood; the former is about fourteen inches long, and the latter twelve. Number 18 is about fourteen inches in length, made of a hard black stone, a kind of basaltes, and similar to the stone of which the Otaheiteans paste-beaters and hatchets are made.
        20. Is a kind of Battle-axe, used either as a lance or as a patta-pattoo. The length of these is from five to six feet. The middle part of them is very ingeniously carved.
        21. An Ivory Needle, made of the tooth of some large marine animal, with which they fasten on their cloaks. This is about six inches 3/8 in length; but they have of various sizes; and some of them are made of the circular edge of the ear-shell mentioned in No. 1.
        22. An Instrument made of the bone of some large animal, probably of a grampus, which is used sometimes as a paddle, and at others as a patta-pattoo, and is about five feet long.
        23. A Wedge or Chisel, made of the green stone, or Poonammoo, as they call it, and sometimes of the Basaltes. These wedges they sometimes tie to a wooden handle, and then use them as hatchets and hoes. They are of various sizes, from one to eight inches in length.
        24. A Whistle, made of wood, having the out-side curiously carved. Besides the mouth-hole they have several for the fingers to play upon. These, which are worn about the neck, are three inches and a half in length, and yield a shrill sound.

        Implements of 
        25. A Trumpet, nineteen inches and a half in length, made of a hard brown wood, which they split, and carefully hollow out each side so as to sit neatly again, leaving an edge on each side; and joining them together, they are bound tight with withes made of cane: it is broadest in the middle, which is rather flat, and gradually tapers to the ends that are open. In the middle of it there is a large hole which represents the mouth of a figure somewhat like a human one, having hands and feet, the parts of which are carved round the instrument: the head is not unlike the mask, No. 16. Another such like mask is also carved near one end of the trumpet. They produce a harsh shrill sound.
        26. Is spoken of in the account of the people of Terra del Fuego.
        27. A singular kind of hand-scoop, or water-bailer, made of one piece of wood: the handle of it proceeds from the edge and hangs over the middle, and both it and the edge are very ingeniously carved. It is about eleven inches long, eight inches wide, and near six inches deep under the handle.
        28. The head of a spear, made of bone, about six inches in length.
            
      

        PART III. Comprehending the incidents that happened from the time of the ship's leaving New-Zealand, to its arrival at and departure from Batavia for Europe.  Account of the country, natives, and natural produce, of New-Holland
        ON the 31st, in the morning, we weighed anchor, having a fine breeze from the S. E. left the coast of New Zealand, and steered our course toward New Holland, taking our departure from a point of land near Blind Bay, which point we named Cape Farewell. We had fine weather and a fair wind till the 9th; then we saw one of the tropic birds, although we were in latitude 38° 34, thermometer 73. We were becalmed nine days, from the 9th to the 17th, and then the wind blew from the S. S. W. and S. W. and we had a broken sea that caused the ship to pitch and roll very much at the same time; we shipped a sea fore and aft, which deluged the decks, and had like to have washed several of us overboard: we were then in latitude 38°46 and 22 degrees west of Cape Farewell, out of sight of land: so that the land of Van Diemen, if not an island, must have tended away abruptly to the east, or we should have seen it before this time. We continued our course, but nothing worthy of note occurred till the 19th, in the morning, and then we discovered the land of New Holland, extending a great way to the south, and to the eastward. It is moderately high: part of it appeared to be flat, and covered with sand; but, the weather being foggy, we had not a good view of it. We were obliged to steer E. N. E. to clear it; and saw three water spouts, one of which continued very near a quarter of an hour. Latitude 37° 51.
            
      

        
        On the 20th, we sailed along shore with a fine brisk breeze, but we found no harbour. The land appeared rather level, with here and there a gentle ascent covered entirely with wood, some of which appeared large. About noon we saw some smoke ascending out of a wood near the sea tide. Latitude 36° 51.
        On the 21st, we had fine clear weather, and a brisk gale: the coast appeared much the same as it did the day before, excepting that it was rather lower. In the evening the land appeared very low and strait, stretching away to the N.E. and was well covered with trees. We saw some clouds of smoke rising from them a good way up the country, but we found no harbour. Latitude 35° 51.
        On the 22d, the coast made a good view, being flat, level, and covered with verdure. The hills within land were remarkably flat: we discovered five men upon them, through our glasses, who were quite naked. It is probable they live upon the produce of the earth, as we did not see any canoes, and the coast seems to be unfavourable for fishing. Latitude 35° 27.
        On the 25th, we were in latitude 34° 22. The weather was very fine, but we were often becalmed. The land appeared still flat, remarkably level, and strait on the top. We saw several fires along the coast lit up one after another, which might have been designed as signals to us.
        On the 27th, in the morning, the wind being against us, we stood off and on shore. At noon, being about one mile from land, some of our men were sent on shore in a boat, which soon returned, not being able to land for the surf, which which ran very high all along the coast. They espied three men, sitting on the beach, who were naked, and of a very dark colour; but, on the boats approaching nearer toward them, they fled into the woods. Our people also discovered several canoes drawn upon the beach, and a kind of house or wig-warn adjacent. We also, from the ship, saw five men walking, two of whom carried a canoe on their shoulders. The country looked very pleasant and fertile; and the trees, quite free from underwood, appeared like plantations in a gentlemans park.
            
      

        
        On the 28th, we got into a fine bay, and some of our people went on shore on one side of it, where we saw some houses. On our approaching the shore, two men, with different kinds of weapons, came out and made toward us. Their countenance bespoke displeasure; they threatened us, and discovered hostile intentions, often crying to us, Warra warra wai. We made signs to them to be peaceable, and threw them some trinkets; but they kept aloof, and dared us to come on shore. We attempted to frighten them by firing off a gun loaded with small shot; but attempted it in vain. One of them repaired to a house immediately, and brought out a shield, of an oval figure, painted white in the middle, with two holes in it to see through, and also a wooden sword, and then they advanced boldly, [see pl. XXVII.] gathering up stones as they came along, which they threw at us. After we had landed, they threw two of their lances at us; one of which fell between my feet. Our people sired again, and wounded one of them; at which they took the alarm and were very frantic and furious, shouting for assistance, calling Hala, hala, mae; that is, (as we afterwards learned,) Come hither; while their wives and children set up a most horrid howl. We endeavoured to pacify them, but to no purpose, for they seemed implacable, and, at length, ran howling away, leaving their wives and children, who hid themselves in one of the huts behind a piece of bark. After looking about us a little while, we left some nails upon the spot and embarked, taking with us their weapons; and then pro-ceeded to the other side of the bay, where we had seen a number of people, as we came in, round a fire, some of whom were painted white, having a streak round their thighs, two below their knees, one like a sash over their shoulders, which ran diagonally downwards, and another across their foreheads. Both men and wo-men were quite naked, very lean and raw-boned; their complexion was dark, their hair black and frizzled, their heads unadorned, and the beards of the men bushy. Their canoes were made of one piece of bark, gathered at the two ends, and extended in the middle by two sticks. Their paddles were very small, two of which they used at one time; and we found a large lump of yellow gum in their gigs which seemed to be for striking fish. Some of their weapons had a kind of chisel fixed at their ends, but of what substance they were formed we could not learn.
            
      

        
         

Plate XXVII. Two of the Natives of New Holland, Advancing to Combat.
            
      

        
        The natives often reconnoitred us, but we could not prevail on them to come near us or to be social; for, as soon as we advanced, they fled as nimbly as deer, excepting at one time, when they seemed determined to face us: then they came armed with spears, having their breasts painted white; but, as soon as they saw our boat go off from the ship, they retreated. Constrained by hunger, they often came into the bay to fish; but they kept in the shallows, and as near as possible to the shore. In one of their houses, at the top of the bay, we had laid some nails, pieces of cloth, and various trinkets; and though the natives had been there in our absence, yet they had not taken any of them.
        This bay is in latitude 34° 6, and makes a good harbour, being only two or three points open to the eastward; but the water is in general shallow; and it has several arms extending from it, which are also shallow. On these shallows we found a great number of rays, some shell-fish, and a few sharks. The rays are of an enormous size: one of them which we caught weighed two hundred and thirty-nine pounds, and another three hundred and twenty-six. They tasted very much like the European rays, and the viscera had an agreeable flavour, not unlike stewed turtle. These rays, and shell-fish, are the natives chief food.
        The country is very level and fertile; the soil, a kind of grey sand; and the climate mild: and though it was the beginning of winter when we arrived, every thing seemed in perfection. There is a variety of flowering shrubs; a tree that yields gum; and a species of palm, [Borasus flabellifer,] the berries of which are of two sorts; one small, eaten by the hogs, and the other, as large as a cherry, has a stone in it; it is of a pale crimson colour, and has the taste of a sweet acid. We also found a species of Salvia Fortea.
        We met with but one quadruped on the Island, which was about the size of a hare: we found also the skin of a snake, and saw a great number of birds of a beautiful plumage; among which were two sorts of parroquets, and a beautiful briquet: we shot a few of them, which we made into a pie, and they ate very well. We also met with a black bird, very much like our crow, and shot some of them too, which also tasted agreeably. From the number of curious plants we met with on shore, we called the bay Botany-Bay.
        Having got on board a good stock of hay for our sheep, on the 6th of May we weighed anchor, and left this bay. On this day, Forbes Sutherland, a native of the Orkneys, who had departed this life, was carried on shore, and decently interred.
        Having only moderate breezes from the N. and N.E. we made but little way till the 9th. In the evening of that day we saw two of the most beautiful rainbows my eyes ever beheld: the colours were strong, clear, and lively; those of the inner one were so bright as to reflect its shadow on the water. They formed a complete semicircle; and the space between them was much darker than the rest of the sky.
        In latitude 32° 51, on the 10th, the land appeared considerably higher, and more broken, very sandy, and less fertile.  We saw several clusters of islands; among which, it is probable, there may be some good harbours.
        On the 11th, we passed high broken land, having several distinct peaks and hills, an extensive flat along the shore covered with pretty large trees, and a sandy beach. We saw also many snakes, and three remarkable hills, which we called The Three Brothers. Latitude 32° 2.
        On the 14th, latitude 30° 22, the land appeared high, and well covered with wood; but, being three or four leagues from it, we could not distinguish many particulars upon it, though we saw clouds of smoke arise from different dis-tant parts of the country. The wind was very variable after our leaving the last bay, and we had some calms. The wind hangs mostly between the N. and E. on this coast, blows very gently, and then dies away to a stark calm; but this day we had a fresh breeze from the S.W.
            
      

        
        On the 15th, we were in the latitude of 28° 40. The breeze continued brisk from the S. W. the land appeared very uneven ; and we saw a remarkable high peak, with three points at the top : behind it were three other hills, with round tops; and the nearest land was well covered with wood. We saw six men, quite naked, walking upon a strait, white, sandy beach ; and, in the evening, having a low point of land a-head, we discovered several breakers, at a considerable distance from the shore. The wind freshening, we stood to the east ; and, soon after dark, brought to, continued founding every half-hour, and found thirty fathoms water.
        On the 16th, we were in latitude 27° 40, and saw a vast tract of low land, with, here and there, a rising hill.
        On the 17th, the land appeared higher, having many remarkable peaks; one of which was like a glass-house: we also saw some smoke, and the appearance of a large river; the water of which was of a pale green colour. Latitude 26° 28.
        On the 18th, in latitude 25° 36, the land appeared to rise perpendicular, of an unequal height, and looked like a wall along the coast, without having any break; which prevented us from seeing the back land; and it was covered with great patches of white sand and stinted shrubs. The sea was full of a sort of orange-coloured powder, like that we saw on the coast of Brazil. On this day, we saw a water-snake.
        On the 20th, in the forenoon, we were a-breast of a point which seemed to be the last of the land to the north, and tended away abruptly to the south. From this point there runs a very large shoal, on several parts of which the water broke. We sailed along-side of it, and had from seventeen to nine fathoms water. Before night came on, we got round it, and kept our course westward, as we had seen the looming of land in that quarter. The barren sandy land continued to this point, and was uninhabited. We saw a large turtle, some large grampusses that leaped out of the water, a great number of porpoises, many sharks which would not take bait, and several men-of-war birds. Latitude 24° 24.
            
      

        
        On the 21st, in the forenoon, we discovered land again, extending a great way, and forming a curve. It was very flat, level, and covered with trees, with a few hills within-land. We sailed along it, to look for a harbour, to the N. W. There was no appearance of land to the S. W. so that it is very probable there is a river in that part. We found no current, and our course was very shallow, as we had but from seven to twenty fathoms water at a great distance from land.
        On the 22d, in the evening, we anchored In an open road or bay, round the north cape of the great bay. As we sailed along, this day, the country appeared very barren and sandy, having only a few low shrubs.*
        On the 23d, the captain and some others went on shore, and saw a few of the natives, but could not get near them. We saw, too, about twenty of them from the ship, who stood gazing at us upon the beach; also smoke arising out of the woods, which, perhaps, was only an artifice of theirs, to make us think they were numerous. We observed nothing worthy of note on land, excepting a great variety of plants; one of which bore a fruit like a small crab-apple, having a large stone in it, the Eawharra of Otaheite, and the dung of some quadruped that fed on grass. We hauled the seine, and tore it in pieces, but caught no fish: though we saw great shoals of them in this bay, they would not take the bait. We found a nautilus pompilius, and some of a curious kind of hammer oysters; as also a number of porpoises. We shot a duck of a beautiful plumage, with a white beak, black body, and white and green on the wings. We likewise shot another large bird, of the bustard kind, coloured black, white, and brown, which weighed seventeen pounds. The hills seen in this bay, which was called Bustard Bay, appeared very barren, having nothing upon them but a few diminutive shrubs; but we saw a large tract of low and flat land, that was covered with small wood, had several lagoons in it, and some of the same kind of plants which grow on the island of Otaheite and in the East-Indies.
        * This day the captains clerk had his ears cut off, and his cloaths also cut off his back. The captain and officers offered. Come time after, at Batavia, a reward of fifteen guineas, to any one who should discover the person or persons who cut off his ears, and fifteen gallons of arrack, to any one that should discover him or them who had cut off his cloaths.
            
      

        
        On the 24th, in the morning, we weighed anchor, and left this bay. At noon, we were becalmed, and caught, with hook and line, several forts of beautiful-coloured fishes. We saw some very large pelicans, which were near five feet high, and the tail of some quadruped, which we supposed might be a guanica. In latitude 23° 51 the land tended away from the sandy point in the great bay to the north-west.
        On the 25th, in the forenoon, we crossed the tropic of Capricorn. The land appeared very desolate, being little else than sand and rocks, parcelled out into several islands and ragged points. We came to at night, in a sort of bay formed by the turning of the land, and found a considerable tide flowing into it. There was the appearance of an opening in the land, which may possibly be the mouth of a river.
        On the 26th, we got in among a parcel of islands, to get clear of which we proposed going by a passage to the north-west, which was next to the main; but, finding our water shoal very much, we sent some men in a boat a-head of us, to found, and came into three and two and a half fathom water. They returned with an account that there was hardly water enough; so we tacked about and stood out. The next morning, we had a fine breeze, and went through a passage to the north-east, between two islands: in this found, the tide fell thirteen feet. Our people, who went off in the boat, saw many of the natives upon one of the islands, and they hallooed to them: they were of the same sort as those we had seen before. On the land round about, we saw both high and low ridges, with some peaks: part of it was well covered; though there appeared some large patches of white sand. Latitude 22° 52.
        On the 28th, resolving to keep the main close aboard, which continued tending away to the west, we got into another cluster of islands; where we were much alarmed, having but three fathoms water, on a sudden, in a ripling tide: we put about, and hoisted out the boats, to seek for deeper water; after which, as it was very gloomy and blew fresh, we kept an easy sail to the west, sounding all the way; and, at night, came to the entrance of a bay. This cluster of islands is very much variegated; some of them are high, others low; some exceedingly broken and mere barren rocks, others well cloathed. Part of the main land is very high, and has extensive flats, covered with trees. Latitude 22° 8.
            
      

        
        On the 29th, in the morning, we passed into the bay, which appears to be the entrance into some river, by the strong tide that runs into the channel, which fell twelve feet in six hours. The captain intended to ground the ship here, in order to clean her bottom; but,
        On the 31st, we left this bay, not being able to find any fresh water, or any kind of provisions, not even fish. The bay is open to the north; is very large and deep, and capable of containing a navy at anchor. There were many creeks, that seemed to end in a lagoon; but the captain could not determine whether the inlet, that led into the country, was a river. The country about the bay is but indifferently cloathed; the trees are small; and the soil on the hills is very stony, and bare of grass under the trees. That part of the shore, which I saw, seemed to be a rock, composed of broken stones, cemented together with mud. On our first view of this coast, we conceived the most pleasing hopes, but were unhappily disappointed. We saw only two of the Indians, but the marks of many more, and the footsteps of an animal that had a cloven hoof.  We saw also many of the Yam-trees, the greater part of them having been stripped of the bark; and several sorts of ants, some of which build their nests of earth against the side of a tree, while others make them of leaves, glued together and hung upon the branches.
        From a hill, at the entrance into the bay, we had thirty islands in view. Through this labyrinth of islands we passed with some difficulty, on account of the number of shoals which we met with; one of which we should have been upon, had not the men in the boat given us timely notice. We were encouraged to at-tempt a passage through them, from an expectation, we had formed, of finding one to the north side of the land.
        On the 2d of June, we were in the latitude of 20° 56 and still among islands, through which we were obliged to steer with great caution, keeping a boat out ahead, and coming to every night; we yet narrowly escaped a bank, the soundings were so unequal. The land appeared very high, and much broken; had but an indifferent aspect, and seemed to be thinly inhabited.
            
      

        
        On the 3d, in the morning, we had land on every quarter, excepting at south-east, and stood to north-west; where there appeared to be an opening, which carried us into a strait, in which we found deep water. This strait lies almost north and south; is about seven leagues long, and one and a half broad. On the west of it lies the main, and, on the east, a row of islands which extend a considerable way to the south. The land on both sides looked much better than that which we had seen before; being high, abounding in trees, and not sandy. We discovered three persons through our glasses, and a canoe with out-riggers, like those of Otaheite. In the evening, we had almost got out of the straits, the islands sailing, and the main tending more to the west. Latitude 20° 27.
        On the 4th, we cleared the straits and islands, and got into an open sea. The land upon the coast was full of very high hills, whose bowels are probably rich in ore; but their surface is poor indeed, being more barren, and fuller of stones, than any land we had seen. We had clear and pleasant weather, and the land still tended away to the west. Latitude 19° 48.
        On the 7th, we were between a parcel of islands and the main. The main-land looked very barren and dreary: the hills upon it looked like a heap of rubbish, on which nothing was to be seen, excepting a few low bushes: but the islands made a better appearance. We saw a few people in canoes, striking fish, some smoke on the main, and some palm-trees. Latitude 18° 48.
        On the 8th, the main land appeared still higher, and very barren. We discovered several islands that looked like so many heaps of rubbish, which had lain long enough to have a few weeds and bushes grow on them. On one of them, which is not more than two miles in circumference, we saw a company of the natives, entirely naked, and of a dark complexion, standing quite still, and beholding the ship with astonishment. At night we saw a fire, which yielded a very grateful odour, not unlike that produced by burning the wood of gum benjamin.
        On the 10th, we continued our course to the north-west; and, about nine oclock in the morning, we sailed down a reef of coral-rocks. Our water shoaled very soon, from twenty-one to eight fathoms; which alarmed us very much: every countenance expressed surprize, and every heart felt some trepidation. About eleven, the ship struck upon the rocks, and remained immoveable. We were, at this period, many thousand leagues from our native land, (which we had left upwards of two years,) and on a barbarous coast, where, if the ship had been wrecked, and we had escaped the perils of the sea, we should have fallen into the rapacious hands of savages. Agitated and surprised as we were, we attempted every apparent eligible method to escape, if possible, from the brink of destruction. The sails were immediately handed, the boats launched, the yards and topmasts struck, and an anchor was carried to the southward: the ship striking hard, an-other anchor was dispatched to the south-west. Night came on, which providentially was moon-light, and we weathered it out as patiently as possible, considering the dreadful suspense we were in.
        On the 11th, early in the morning, we lightened the ship, by throwing over-board our ballast, firewood, some of our stores, our water-casks, all our water, and six of our great guns; and set the pumps at work, at which every man on board assisted, the Captain, Mr. Banks, and all the officers, not excepted; relieving one another every quarter of an hour. About noon, the ship heaved much on one side; upon which five anchors were carried out, and dropt at different parts; while all the hands on board plied the pumps incessantly, hoping to have heaved her off the rock, but hoping in vain.  At four oclock in the afternoon it was low water, and the ship, in several places, grounded on the rock. Between nine and ten, the tide rose four feet, and the ship righted again; and, about ten, after some farther attempts to clear her, she providentially got off.  This desirable event gave us spirits; which, however, proved but the transient gleam of sunshine, in a tempestuous day; for they were soon depressed again, by observing that the water increased in the hold, faster than we could throw it out; and we expected, every minute, that the ship would sink, or that we should be obliged to run her again upon the rocks.
            
      

        
        In the midst of these gloomy prospects and alarming apprehensions, we found means to stop the leak, by a method suggested to us by an officer, who had, in a former voyage, made use of it with success: we sewed a great quantity of hair and oakum to a large piece of canvas, which we let down by two ropes, one on each side of the bow of the ship: in making way, she sucked this under, close to her bottom; and, when it reached the leak, it was forced in by the intruding water, and obstructed its passage so much, that we kept it under with a single pump. Providentially, too, at this instant, a breeze sprang up, and we steered towards the land, the boats going before, in quest of a harbour, which they also happily found, at about two or three leagues distance. On the 14th of June, we dropped anchor in the mouth of it; but the entrance into it was so narrow, that we were obliged to place buoys all the way, to steer by. While we lay on the rock, it was calm; and, from the time we left it, till this day, it blew gently; but now it began to blow hard, which prevented us from getting into the bay till the 18th; when we reached the desired haven, though not without some danger, the ship having several times touched the ground.
        When we threw the guns overboard, we fixed buoys to them, intending, if we escaped, to have heaved them up again, but, on attempting it, we found it was impracticable.
        Soon after we arrived in the bay, we laid the ship on a steep bank, on the side of a river; set up tents on shore, unloaded her, carried all the cargo and provisions into them, and there lodged and accommodated our sick.
        On the 22d, we examined the ships bottom, and found a large hole; through the planks into the hold, which had a piece of coral-rock, half a yard square, sticking in it: the fame rock, therefore, that endangered us, yielded us the principal means of our redemption; for, had not this fragment intruded into the leak, in all probability the ship would have sunk.
        We lost no time, but immediately set about repairing the ships bottom, and in a few days made it found again. In the mean time, the boats were sent out, in search search of another passage, which they found, and returned to the ship on the 3d of July.
            
      

        
        On the 4th of July, the ship was carried to the other side of the river, and examined thoroughly; but, being found in good condition, she was soon placed in her former station; where she was loaded, and properly fitted to proceed on the voyage.
        During the time we staid here, we picked up a great many natural curiosities from the reef we struck upon, consisting of a variety of curious shells, most of which were entirely new to Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander. We met also with many new species of fish. Madrepores and other curious corals; sea-weed and other beautiful marine productions.
        On shore we were not less successful. Of vegetables, we found Glycine rosea, which yields a sort of bean purslain, that eats very well, boiled; Cicas circinalis, the kernels of which, roasted, tasted like parched pease; but it made some of our people sick, who ate of it: of this fruit, they make a kind of sago in the East-Indies: we cut down many of them for the cabbage, which is very good food. We found also a black purple fruit, with a kernel in it which had a flat sweet taste; two sorts of fruit like pears, having stony sides, somewhat like the Guava, and of a very indifferent taste; a small-leaved plant, that smelt like lemon and orange peel, and made an agreeable substitute for tea; the E peea, Taro, E ow-haee, and E peepee, of Otaheite: also wild Plantain, like the Meyia of Otaheite, which is very full of seed, and has hardly any pulp; a sort of fig-tree, that bears fruit on the main stem, which tastes very insipid; the Etee and Eroa, of which the natives of Otaheite make the bed lines; many gum-trees, and a great number of other plants, among which was a beautiful Nymphea, with blue and white petala.
        Of birds, we found grey pigeons, with red beaks and reddish brown crests, which ate very well; two sorts of small doves; two sorts of beautiful perroquets; a very uncommon hawk, pied black and white; several other sorts of hawks; large black cocatoes, with scarlet and orange-coloured feathers on their tails, and some white spots between the beak and the ear, as well as one on each wing; wing; the goat-sucker, or churn-owl; merops, or bee-eaters; large bats; a small bird, with wattles of a deep orange red; a bird like a Tetrao, having wattles of a fine ultramarine colour, and whose beak and legs were black; an owl, having the iris of its eyes gold colour, the pupil of them dark blue; a large black and white gull, with a bright yellow beak, on the gibbous part of which was a spot of scarlet; the corners of its mouth, and irides of the eyes, were of a bright scarlet colour; the legs and feet a greenish yellow: a black-bird, of the oyster-cracker genus, with a bright red beak, except toward the point, where it was yellow; the iris of its eyes scarlet; the irides of them bright orange; the feet and legs of a pale-red colour: a large olive-coloured bird of the loxia genus, having the iris of its eyes of a gall-stone colour, and the pupils of them black: a black and white shag, the iris of whose eyes was of a fine dark-green colour, the pupils black; the skin which surrounded the eyes was of a verditer-green colour; the beak a pale grey; on each side of which was a bare yellow spot; the feet were black: a large pigeon, the iris of the eyes of which was of a blood colour, the pupils of them black; their irides of a carmine colour; its legs and feet pale red. The two last were taken in a bay called Tasmano Bay. The black and white hawk before-mentioned, had the iris of its eyes very broad, of a rich scarlet colour, inclining to orange; the beak was black, the cera dirty grey yellow; the feet were of a gold or deep buff colour, like kings-yellow. Besides these, we saw many other curious birds.
        Of quadrupeds, there are goats, wolves, a small red animal about the size of a squirrel; a spotted one of the viverra kind, and an animal of a kind nearly approaching the mus genus, about the size of a grey-hound, that had a head like a fawns; lips and ears, which it throws back, like a hares; on the upper jaw six large teeth; on the under one two only; with a short and small neck, near to which are the fore-feet, which have five toes each, and five hooked claws; the hinder legs are long, especially from the last joint, which, from the callosity below it, seems as if it lies flat on the ground when the animal descends any declivity; and each foot had four long toes, two of them behind, placed a great way back, the inner one of which has two claws; the two other toes were in the middle, and resembled a hoof, but one of them was much larger than the other. The tail, which is carried like a grey-hounds, was almost as long as the body, and tapered gradually to the end. The chief bulk of this animal is behind; the belly being largest, and the back rising toward the posteriors. The whole body is covered with short ash-coloured hair; and the flesh of it tasted like a hares, but has a more agreeable flavour.
            
      

        
        Mr. Banks found, in the woods, an Opossum *, with two young ones sucking at her breasts.
        There were many alligators on the coast, some of them very large, and we frequently saw them swimming round the ship.
        We found also several sorts of snakes, ants, and a small culex, or fly, which is not bigger than a grain of sand; the bite or sting of which was venomous, and caused protuberances on the skin, which itched violently.
        Of fish, we found many different sorts, and a variety of beautiful shell-fish; among them three sorts of oysters; some were found in lagoons; some adhering to the mangrove; and others along the shore: large cavalhe, or scomber; large mullets, some flat-fish, a great number of small scombri; and skate or ray-fish; one of which, that we caught, was curiously marked on the back with polygons finely coloured, and another of an orbicular figure, with a blue grey-coloured back, and white belly, which tasted like veal; some other parts like beef; and the entrails as agreeable as turtle. We caught also turtles of a bright green colour, some of which weighed near four hundred pounds †.
        The natives, who were naked, though of a diminutive size, ran very swiftly, and were very merry and facetious. Their bones were so small, that I could more than span their ancles; and their arms too, above the elbow joint. The tallest we saw measured but five feet nine inches; though their slimness made them appear taller, most of them were about five feet five inches; and were painted with red and white in various figures. The colour of their skin was like that of wood-soot. They had flattish noses, moderate-sized mouths, regular well-set large teeth, tinged with yellow. Most of them had cut off the hair from their heads; but some of them wore their hair, which was curled and bushy, and their beards frizzled. On their breasts and hips were corresponding marks like ridges, or seams, raised above the rest of the flesh, which looked like the cicatrices of ill-healed wounds. Some of them were painted with red streaks across the body, and others streaked over the face with white, which they called Carbanda. Some of them had a small hair-rope about their loins, and one about an arm, made of human hair. They had also a bag that hung by their necks, which they carried shell-fish in. Their noses had holes bored in them, through which they drew a piece of white bone about three or five inches long, and two round. [See pl. XXVI fig. 13. and pl. XXVII.]  One of them had his ears bored in like manner, and pieces of bone hung in them. Some of them had necklaces made of oval pieces of bright shells, which lay imbricated over one another, and linked together by two strings. The women, who did not approach nearer to us than the opposite shore, had feathers stuck on the crown of their heads, fastened, as we were informed, to a piece of gum.
        * This creature has a membraneous bag near the stomach in which it conceals and carries its young when it is apprehensive of danger.
        † On opening a turtle that we caught we found part of a wooden lance in it, which had gone in by the breast before the calapee.
            
      

        
        They had lances and levers, very neatly made of a reddish wood; and had two pieces of bone, joined together with pitch, that stood out at the end of them. To polish their lances they made use of the ficus riduola, which served the pur-pose of a rasp. Their canoes were made out of the trunks of trees; had an out-rigger; and eight outriggers on which they laid their lances. Their paddles were long in the blade.  To throw the water out of their canoes, they used a large shell called the Persian-crown.
        Their language was not harsh, as may be seen by the following vocabulary, and they articulated their words very distinctly, though, in speaking, they made a great motion with their lips, and uttered their words vociferously, especially when they meant to shew their dissent or disapprobation. When they were pleased, and would manifest approbation, they said Hee, with a long flexion of the voice, in a high and shrill tone. They often said Tut, tut, many times together, but we knew not what they meant by it, unless it was intended to express astonishment. At the end of this Tut, they sometimes added Urr, and often whistled when they were surprised.

        As a mark of dissent, they said Aipa, several times, and this was the only word, that we could distinguish, to accord with the Otaheitean language.
        On our arrival, the natives shewed themselves, on the land opposite to us, by degrees; and, after having thrown them some fish, they ventured to approach us in a canoe; landed by us; laid down their lances, and came forward to meet us, shewing signs of amity as they came along; but they were so much abashed at first, that they took but little notice of us, or of any thing about us, though they did not seem to be apprehensive of danger.  We made them some presents, which they accepted, but did not shew much fondness for them. They became, at length, more free when only three of us were present, and made signs for us to take off some of our garments, which we did accordingly. They viewed them with surprize; but they seemed to have had no idea of cloaths; nor did they express a desire for any; and a shirt, which we gave them, was found afterwards torn into rags.
        The natives shewed a great antipathy to our tame birds, and attempted to throw one of them over-board; and, a little before we left the land, they set fire to the grass round the spot where we had pitched our tent; but, luckily for us, most of our things were on-board, or they would, in all probability, have been consumed, as the fire burnt very fiercely, and had like to have destroyed a litter of pigs, and some other things. We shot at one of them, who ran up the hill with a fire-brand, and wounded him. Several of them came to us afterwards, and made peace with us.
        They seem to live mostly on shell-fish, the remains of which we frequently saw about their fires, which they procure by twirling a piece of wood in a hole, made in another piece, till it is lit up into a flame.
            
      

        
        Some of our people, in a pinnace, went in search of a passage to go out of the bay, and landed on a coral reef, where they met with a great number of shells; and, among the rest, the spondylus, and a large fort of trochus, or top-shell, with which they loaded the boat.
        On the 4th of August, in the morning, we weighed anchor, left the harbour, and steered N. E. till we were near the Turtle Reefs; there we anchored again, and sent the boats on shore, which returned with a turtle, a large skate, and a great number of clams, a sort of cockle, some of them very large.
        On the 5th, it blew so hard that we could not weigh anchor till afternoon, and then we stood to the N. E. but, meeting with several shoals, we were obliged to cast anchor again, as the wind blew fresh, and were detained till the 10th. On the morning of which we weighed anchor again, but the wind blowing hard from the S. S. E. we drove, and were obliged at length to let go two anchors, and rode by the first with near two hundred fathoms of cable.
        We had chiefly strong gales of wind after the suns approach toward us from the tropic of Capricorn; and, on account of the many shoals hereabout, we did not go directly out to sea, but kept near the shore, and passed by some low islands well covered with trees.
        We also saw three high islands, and sailed betwixt them and the main: the latter appeared very low, barren, and sandy.
        Toward evening we were on a sudden alarmed by the appearance of land all round us: the weather being hazy, and the wind blowing fresh, we hauled in our wind, and came to under a bluff point of the main.
        On the 13th, in the morning, we weighed anchor, and stood to the eastward, close to one of the high islands which we had passed before, and so on through a break of the reef, which was about half a mile wide. This reef, which the captain discovered  from the top of the last-mentioned island, ran farther than the eye could reach, on the outermost side of all the rest, like a wall, and the sea broke very high upon it: We found no sounding in the passage, latitude 14° 38, and we stood to the N. E. in order to get out to sea, intending to keep to the north-ward on the morrow.
            
      

        
        On the 15th, about noon, we saw land again in latitude 13° S. also a continuation of the reef which ran along-side of it. In the evening, standing right in for land, we were alarmed by suddenly discovering that reef extended to leeward of us, upon which we hauled in our wind, and crouded all the sail we could, that we might be able to weather the farthest point of it. The wind was easterly this day, more moderate, and the swell of the sea less.
        On the 16th, at the dawn of day, we had a reef under our lee, at about a mile distance, which alarmed us much. When it was quite light, we saw breakers all round us excepting to windward, where we came in. The wind sail-ing us about midnight, we tacked about, being afraid to stand any farther; and the winds still sailing was the cause that we drove on the reef, which we now neared apace. In this dilemma, we first hoisted out our small boats (the long boat being stowed, and the pinnace repairing) to tow her off, and got a pair of sweeps rigged out of the gun-room ports, to turn her head about. A slight puff of wind gave us some hopes of effecting it; but that sailing, we approached so near the breakers, that there was but one heave of the swell between them and the ship. However, with our pulling, the alteration of the tide, and another slight puff of wind, we cleared her a little more from the reef, and stood to where we saw a break in the reef to leeward, there we hoped, at least, to find ground to anchor upon; but, when we got to the entrance of it, we were driven off by a ripple of the tide that set out with great force; which, however, proved very providential, as we afterward found there were rocks in the passage, and that it was not a proper break. We then stood to windward, intending either to get out as we came in, or a little farther down to leeward, where the reef seemed detached; but, perceiving, soon after, the tops of some rocks in the passage, we declined attempting it. The wind again dying away, we were at a lots what to do for the best; but, at last, determined on sending some of our people in the boat to examine into the appearance of another break still farther to leeward; and, a light breeze springing up from the east, we resolved to push in there, though the passage was but narrow, which we happily accomplished, being assisted by the tide; and we anchored between the reef and the shore, in fifteen fathoms water; though, at the very edge of these reefs, we had no sounding at one hundred and fifty-five fathoms. At our first entrance into this place we had very unequal soundings; sometimes finding no bottom; and one fathom farther finding it with twenty fathoms of line. This, we apprehended, was occasioned by the coral rocks which rise up almost perpendicular. Latitude 12° 36.
            
      

        
        On the 17th, in the morning, we sent some men in the boat to the reef for turtles and clams, but they returned without any of the former, and with but few clams, though they were of a large size.
        The reefs were covered with a numberless variety of beautiful corallines of all colours and figures, having here and there interstices of very white sand. These made a pleasing appearance under water, which was smooth on the inside of the reef, while it broke all along the outside, and may be aptly compared to a grove of shrubs growing under water. Numbers of beautiful coloured fishes make their residence amongst these rocks, and may be caught by hand on the high part of the reef at low water. There are also crabs, molusca of various sorts, and a great variety of curious shell-fish, which adhere to the old dead coral that forms the reef.
        On the 18th, we weighed anchor, and stood along shore on the inside of the reef, thinking that would be the safest and best way of finding the passage between New-Guinea and this land: we met with a great many islands, shoals, and reefs, and came to at night. We kept along shore till the 21st, and, at noon, in latitude 10° 36, we came to a great number of islands near the main land, which tended away to the S. W.  We stood through between two of these islands, to the west, and found a very strong tide, which carried us along briskly, and gave us hopes that this was a passage between New Holland and New Guinea.  At length we came to, and the pinnace was sent on shore to a spot where we saw some of the natives stand gazing at us, but when the boats company landed, they immediately fled.  fled. The captain, and some others, went up to the top of a hill, and, seeing a clear passage, they hoisted a jack, and fired a volley, which was answered by the marines below, and the marines by three vollies from the ship, and three cheers from the main shrouds. The natives were armed with lances, and one of them had a bow in his hand. In other respects they were much like the people we saw last, being quite naked, and of a dark colour. This land was more rocky, and less sandy than we had lately seen, but still very barren; though the flats, indeed, were covered with many verdant trees. We also discovered very high land at a great distance to the N. E. which we took for the land of New Guinea.
            
      

        
        We were obliged to keep a constant look-out while we passed between the reef and the land, as it was full of shoals, reefs, sandy keys, and small islands; and had we not come in again, we should not have found a passage.
        On the 23d, we had light breezes from the N. and S.W. with some calms, and were certain of being in a strait, which seemed to be not very remote from the river Van Speult in Carpentaria; the land to the north being made up of a cluster of islands. We found shallow water all through this strait, which we named Endeavour Straits; and went over a bar that had only three fathoms and a half water. About noon, we saw a small island covered with birds-dung of a white colour, and some of our people went off in a boat, and shot a score of birds called Boobies.
        On the 24th, in the morning, the cable broke in weighing up the anchor, which obliged us to drop another, and detained us all day sweeping for it with much trouble; but, the next morning, we got it up, and soon after were under way, and stood on to the N. W. with a fine breeze from the east. About two oclock, in the afternoon, we were much alarmed by finding ourselves amongst a parcel of small shoals. These shoals were discovered by the waters appearing a little brownish. They consisted of rocks upon which there were only two and three fathoms water; and, though there was a pretty large swell, they did not break. There was one not half a cables length from the ship. We had not more than from six to eleven fathoms water in this sea when we were out of sight of land. After examining around for the safest way to get clear of these shoals, we weighed anchor and stood out, first southerly, and then to the west, till we deepened our water to eleven fathoms; and then supposed that we passed near some part of that great shoal, stretching round part of the island of Hogeland, on the north of Carpentaria.
            
      

        
        On the 26th, we steered west all day, with a fine breeze from the east, and deepened our water to twenty-five fathoms, in latitude 10° 10.
        On the 27th, steering northward for the coast of New Guinea, we were surprized again by the appearance of a shoal all round us; on examination, however, we found it was only a sort of spawn swimming upon the water, such as we had often seen before, that gave it that appearance. We had, on this day, twenty-nine fathoms water and under. Latitude 9° 56.
        On the 28th, about noon, we got into very broken ground, the soundings being, on a sudden, from three fathoms to ten, and continued very irregular all the afternoon, with hard ground. This, however, did not prevent us from making all the sail we could, and without a boat ahead.  About four oclock in the afternoon, we saw low land. Toward the evening it blew very hard from the S. E. and we stood E. N. E. and were in great danger of striking.  As the water was so shoal, we stood backwards and forwards all night; and, through the good providence of God, met with no accident. Latitude 8° 54.
        On the 29th, we stood in for the land of New Guinea, which looked very flat, and was covered with trees, among which we saw a great many palms that over-topped the rest; but whether there were cocoa-nuts we could not get near enough, for the shoals, to determine. We saw an opening which had the appearance of a rivers mouth; and many smokes on the land. In the afternoon we were abreast of a point of land, which we supposed was that distinguished in the maps by the name of Cape Valsch, or False Cape: From this cape the land continued low, but did not tend to the S. E. as we expected. We could not keep near the shore, the soundings being only from five to ten fathoms, at three or four leagues distance from. land. The water was very white and muddy, like that of a river, and had a sandy bottom. Latitude 8° 19.
            
      

        
        On the 30th, we coasted along about three or four leagues from the land, which was very flat. Our soundings were much the same as the day before. This sand-bank extends about a league farther out to sea, as we judged from the dark-coloured water which we saw from the ship. In the evening, the land seemed to end in a point, and tend away to the north.  The sea was very full of some stuff like chaff, and we saw some smoke upon land. Latitude 8° 39.
        On the 31st, in the night, a current carried us away so far to westward, that it was evening, the next day, before we made land again. We were now pretty certain that we had got round Cape Valsch by the smoothness of the water, and thought the sand-bank would have broken off here, but it rather increased, for we had only four fathoms water, and, at the same time, could not see the land.
        After beating about for three days in quest of land, being prevented getting in with it by the wind setting east, on the 3d, in the morning, we made the coast again, and approached to within three or four leagues of the shore: A party of our people went, in the pinnace, to examine the country while we stood off and on. They soon returned with an account that a great number of the natives threatened them on the beach, who had pieces of bamboo, or canes, in their hands, out of which they puffed some smoke, and then threw some darts at them about a fathom long, made of reeds, and pointed of Etoa wood, which were barbed, but very blunt. Our people fired upon them, but they did not appear to be inti-midated; our men, therefore, thought proper to embark. They observed that these people were not negroes, as has been reported, but are much like the natives of New Holland, having shock hair, and being entirely naked. They also saw a plenty of cocoa-nuts growing on the trees, as well as lying in heaps on the ground; and plantains, bread-fruit, and Peea. The country appeared very fertile, having a great number of different sorts of trees, which formed very thick woods. The soil is very rich, and produces much larger plants than grow on the islands. Latitude 6° 15.
        On the 5th, in the morning, which was moon-light, about one oclock, we passed two low islands, which, we supposed, are the southermost of the Arow Isles that are set down about this parallel. There is a fine fresh trade-wind, which generally blows easterly in the day time, but comes about at night more southerly, and blows much stronger. We kept a W. S. W. course, being in latitude 7° 24 south, about twelve degrees from the island of Timor. Since the 3d instant we have had from twelve to twenty fathoms water till this day, and then our soundings were much deeper.
            
      

        
        The Arow Isles belong to the Dutch East-India company, who go there from Banda, and trade for sago, birds of paradise, and New-Guinea slaves.
        On the 6th, in the forenoon, in latitude of 8° 15, we saw an island to the N.W. of us, of considerable extent, being about six or seven leagues of flat level land; and, by the latitude we were in, we supposed it was Timor land, which is laid down in the maps more to the westward. We had a very fresh trade-wind from the S.E. and no soundings.
        On the 7th, we had a fresh trade-wind from the east, with clear weather, latitude 9° 31, and saw abundance of very small flying-fish, and some porpoises.
        On the 9th, we had light breezes, or calms, all day.  Mr. Banks went out in the small boat, and shot between thirty and forty large boobies, which prey upon the flying-fish. In the evening we saw land to the N. W. of us, and supposed it to be about twenty leagues distant, which being very high, we thought, at first, it had been clouds.  Latitude 9° 46.
        On the 10th, we had light breezes or calms all day, and were still at a great distance from land. We made an observation of the sun this day, and of the moon at night, to determine the longitude, and found ourselves in 233° 33 west from London; and our latitude, by observation, was 10° 1 south, by which we were certain that a current had driven us to the south, as we kept our course to the west. We saw several sharks, dolphins, and barracootas, about the ship, and caught a large shark.
            
      

        
        On the 12th, in the morning, we had light breezes from the west, but, in the afternoon, it veered round to the south. We were on the east side of Timor, and about one mile and a half from the shore, which is very strait, and has a sandy beach; the inner side of which has a skirting of Etoa trees. We saw the opening of a river which might make a snug harbour. Both the high and low land is covered with wood, amongst which are many palms on the hills: we saw no house, or any human being, but a great many smokes.
        On the 15th, after having been troubled several days with light breezes from the S. W. we had the wind N. E. and E. and stood southward to weather it. The land, this day, appeared very scabby to the naked eye, but, viewed through our glasses, we discovered these to be clear places, many of which were fenced about, and had houses upon them, the eaves of which reached to the ground. We saw also a great many palm-trees on the beach, as well as on the hills, some parts of which were cultivated.  We had a bold shore, with hardly any beach. Toward evening the land near the shore appeared much flatter and more level; behind which, at a great distance, we discovered many high hills. Latitude 10° 1.
        On the 16th, in the morning, we had a brisk trade-wind from the east, and a view of the island of Rotté, which lies off the south end of Timor, and passed between it and Anamaboo, which lies to the S. W. of Timor. Both these islands were much lower than Timor; neither did they appear so fertile. We saw no houses, smoke, or cultivated land upon them, but many palms of a kind we were not acquainted with.  We had a fine brisk trade-wind this day, but no soundings;
latitude, by observation, was 10°24, about four or five leagues from the southermost part of Timor. In the night, between ten and eleven oclock, before the moon was up, we saw a remarkable phaenomenon, which appeared in the south quarter, extending one point west, and two east, and was about twenty degrees high, like a glow of red rising from fire, striped with white, which shot up from the horizon in a perpendicular direction, alternately appearing and disappearing.
            
      

        
        On the 17th in the morning, we saw a small island, which, by its appearance, promised nothing, being brown, and almost bare, excepting of palms, and a few other trees. On our approaching nearer to it, we saw several sorts of cattle, which induced us to steer to leeward and send the boat on shore; in the mean time, standing off and on, several of the natives came to them on horseback, who spoke a little Portugueze, and told them there was a bay on the other side of the next point where the ship might anchor, and we might meet with a supply of provisions. We pursued our course round the point, and anchored in a very large bay. In the evening we saw a village, situate on the side of a hill, that had Dutch colours hoisted in it. The next morning some of us went on shore, and waited on the Raja, or king, who received us very graciously, and promised to supply us with every thing, if the Dutchman pleased: The Dutchman vouchsafed to consent, and made us a visit on board, in company with the Raja and his attendants: they dined with us; were very ceremonious, and left us, after having made specious professions of friendship. The next day some of our people returned the visit, and dined with them. After much shuffling on their part, we made shift to obtain a large number of fowls, eight bullocks, several goats, hogs, a great quantity of syrup, and a few fruits.
        They informed us that they had been without rain in the country for seven months, and that the herbage was almost burnt up.
        This island, which is divided into five districts, is about thirty miles long; is called Savoo, and lies south of India. It contains near nine thousand inhabitants, and for these nine years past has been possessed by the Dutch, who have a resident here, and trade to India, Macassar, and Timor; and, from this island, furnish Concordia with provisions.  It was formerly in the possession of the Portuguese, who left it about an hundred years since.
        As we were not permitted to examine the country, or its products, the Dutch-man not suffering us to go any where without a strong guard, I amused myself in picking up, from the natives of the island, what particulars I could learn in respect to their language, from which I afterwards formed the following vocabulary.

        After a stay of two or three days, we left Savoo, and, on the 1st of October, in the morning, discovered Java and Princes Islands. We directed our course through the Straits of Sundy; and, in the afternoon, passed a small island, upon which we saw a very high hill, of a conical figure, and several small ones. This is called the Isle of Crocata: We saw also Pepper-Point. In the night, the wea-ther was squally, and we had rain, with thunder and lightening. By our reckoning we found that Java Head is about 14° 22 to the west of Timor. We had a brisk trade-wind from the S. E. and very near over-shot the Straits; but not finding land, we hauled to the eastward, and luckily got into the Straits to the leeward of Princes Island. Our latitude, at noon, was 6° 9.
        On the 2d, we sailed up as far as Angor Point, where we were becalmed, and waited for the current, which sets to the south till the monsoon shifts. We saw two Indiamen at anchor in Angor Bay. This was a pleasing sight; and, being impa-tient to hear news from England, the pinnace was hoisted out, and some of our people went on board of them, who learned that the Swallow had arrived safe in the English channel; that fresh disturbances had arisen at home, in respect to the ministers, and in America on account of taxes; that the flame of war was like to break out; that the Russians, Poles, and Turks, were already embroiled in a war, and that the Russians had made some vigorous attacks upon the Turks both by sea and land. We sent the boat on shore for some plantains and cocoa-nuts; and, in the evening, having a gentle breeze, we weighed anchor, and stood through between Angor Point and the opposite shore, and past Keita island. The land of Sumatra seemed very near, and appeared to be exceeding high. We had also a more distinct view of Java, which was woody, and very high, particularly Bantam-hill, which is to be seen at a great distance.
        On the 3d, we got up near to Bantam Point, or Point St. Nicholas, where we were becalmed, and dropped anchor. We saw a Chinese vessel pass along the Straits, with Chinese colours flying, which were white, and had a broad border, partly blue and partly black: in the middle of it several Chinese characters, and a star, which were painted of the latter colour. She had one mast; an oblong square sail, a bamboo yard, and an awning, or house, in the middle.
            
      

        
        In the afternoon, some people came off to us, in a boat, from Angor-Point, to enquire who we were, and brought plantains, pumplenoses, oranges, turtles, parrots, domestic poultry, some small birds, and monkeys, which they offered to sale. They told us that the Prince-George, captain Riddle, was lost last June off Batavia, and that the crew were carried by a Dutch ship to Bengal.
        In the evening we weighed anchor, but, having only a light breeze, we made no way.
        On the 4th, we had a northerly wind, which was directly against us, and the current ran very strong. Finding that we had lost ground, we anchored at night off Pulo Pisane; and, while we lay at anchor, some of our people went on shore in a boat, and bought some cocoas, and Paddy, or rice in the husk. On the even-ing of the next day, a light breeze sprang up from the West; but we were soon becalmed, and dropped anchor again. The weather was very sultry. Thermo-meter 86.
        On the 7th, we weighed and dropped anchor several times, having light breezes and calms: however, the tide shifting in our favour, we reached, that day, as far as Pulo Babi, which lies in the bay of Bantam, and passed Pulo Panjang.
        On the 8th, having light breezes, with calms, and the current running strong against us, we made but very little way. This day we sailed between the Milles Isles, Pulo Tidong, and Pulo Fare. These are mostly small and low islands, covered with trees; and, by the lights which we saw on shore, we concluded that some of them were inhabited; and were not deceived in our conjectures; for, at night, some of the natives came off to us, and brought some turtles, pumpkins, and dried fish.
        On the 10th, we anchored in the road of Batavia, in which we found sixteen large ships, three of which were British; one of them an Indiaman that had lost its passage to China, and the other two private merchantmen. A lieutenant, in the pinnace, was dispatched to the deputy-governor with a message, who told him, he should be glad to see captain Cook, and that it would be proper to present his requests to the council in writing, who were to meet the next day. The pinnace returned to the ship, loaded with pine-apples, plantains, water-melons, and a bun-dle of London newspapers, which were very acceptable presents.
            
      

        
        The Dutch commodore sent a messenger on-board of us, to enquire who we were; and by him we learned that the Falmouth man-of-war fell to pieces in this road about four months before we arrived.
            
      

        Description of the city, inhabitants, customs, and persons trading to Batavia
        Batavia, formerly called Jocatra, is situated in a very large open bay, in which is a great number of low islands; the principal of which, called the Milles Isles, lie off the bay. It is walled round, and has many canals cut through it, supplied by a river, which is divided into several streams, that run through the town. The main canal, which is large enough to admit small vessels, is carried a long way into the sea by means of a mole. The mountainous part of this country is at a great distance within land; and the plain flat land, which surrounds the city, is of considerable extent, very fertile, and watered with a great many rivulets; which renders the communication between different parts very easy. The roads which lead from the city are many, and as good as ours in England; they extend a long way into the country, and are so many avenues, planted with Tamarind, Cocoa, Pisang, Bread-fruit, Jacca, Duriam, and Allango, trees, which render them very pleasant. There is a great number of villas all along these roads, many of which have a magnificent appearance. In brief, the whole country looks like a garden, divided into different plantations by hedge-rows of trees and canals. But these canals, which are so convenient and enrich the views of the country, are supposed to be pre-judicial to the health of the inhabitants: for, in the dry season, they stagnate, be-come putrid, and, being exhaled by the sun, the air is charged with noxious vapours: while the great number of trees prevents them from being dispersed by the winds, and occasions that kind of putrid fever, which is so common, rages so much, and is so fatal amongst them, insomuch that it carries off a patient in a few days; and indeed the climate is so unhealthy, that even the slaves, brought here from other parts of India, feel the effects of it. Fluxes too are also very common and dangerous at Batavia; and their intermittents, which the inhabitants think trivial, are very prejudicial to foreigners; but it must be allowed, however, that they mostly prove so for want of observing a proper regimen.
            
      

        
        The houses in the city are mostly built of brick, and plaistered over; many of them are very spacious, and furnished very sumptuously, especially on the ground-floor, the bed-chambers, in general, having but little furniture in them. There are five gates to the city, with draw-bridges to each, which are shut at night. The suburbs, which surround the town, cover a large piece of ground, but are meanly built. The Campan China, which is largest, is on the south side.
        The public buildings, in this city, are the castle, a town-hall, and several churches. The castle is square, surrounded by a ditch, and consists of several square courts, in one of which is deposited a great number of warlike instruments, especially of guns and balls.
        The town-hall and the great church are handsome edifices. The church is of an octagon figure, having a dome and lanthorn of the same form, and has a very fine organ. Ruyters kirk, belonging to the Lutherans, is small, but a very neat building. The Portuguese church is of an oblong square; and the priests, belonging to it, preach in the Malay as well as the Portuguese language.
        The streets of Batavia are paved on both sides, are very regular and straight, and a canal runs through the middle of most of them, both sides of which are planted with trees, which have a very agreeable effect; and, as all kinds of goods are conveyed by water, the streets are in good repair. The bazar, or market-place, is large and square, intersected by rows of stalls, and abounds with different fruits and garden herbage, also with poultry, pork, dried fish, and a variety of other com-modities. Near it is another square bazar, for fish, shell-fish, and meat; but the chief market for vegetables is held at a place, called Tannabank, a little distance from the town, on every Saturday morning, where they may be had very cheap.
        This city is the seat of the Dutch governor-general and council of the Indies, and is, with several neighbouring settlements of that nation, immediately under their direction; and to them all the other governments, belonging to their East-India company, are subject. They meet, for the dispatch of business, several times in a week. There are also two sabanders, who, amongst other things, transact the business of foreigners with the council; a mayor of the city; and a land and water fischal for criminal affairs.
        The Dutch, by their industry, have done more here than any other power in Europe has done in India; and, by means of their policy, have rendered it one of the most flourishing cities in this part of the world, where most European, as well as Indian, commodities may be purchased; but it is not a good market for Indian goods; for you meet with but few of them, and those few are very dear. This city is the chief rendezvous of the Dutch trade for the East-Indies, and from this port the ships for Europe take their departure. Here is a large house, appointed by the company, as a hotel for the accommodation of all European strangers, where they are obliged to reside, and pay two rix-dollars a day for a maintenance, while the Dutch may live for twenty-five rix-dollars a month. There is not, perhaps, any city in the world that contains a greater variety of people. One would imagine there were assembled, of different human beings, from every nation under heaven, who, for the most part, retain their several peculiar dresses, and are allowed to live after the manner of their respective countries. Of whites, there are Dutch, who are masters; but the greater part of the companys servants, and of the inhabitants, are Germans, Danes, Swedes, and Hungarians; with a few English, French, and Italians; of these the foreign merchants are chiefly composed; and most of them keep their chariots, and live in great luxury and elegance. A great number of slaves precede and follow their chariots; and, when the women go abroad, the female slaves sit on the steps of the chariot. The men are dressed excessively gay, having silk and velvet garments, richly laced and embroidered, with laced hats, and finely-dressed wigs. Their waistcoats have sleeves; and, when they sit in a house, they always take off their coats. Amongst the middle class of people, a pair of drawers, which have two gold buttons and reach above their breeches, is reckoned a great piece of finery. The women dress mostly in chintzes, made generally in the European, though sometimes in the Malay, fashion: they are seldom seen walk-ing in the streets, usually riding in carriages. Both men and women have a sickly complexion, without any colour in their cheeks; but paleness, it seems, is reckoned one mark of beauty among the ladies. Besides chariots, which are open and richly ornamented, they have sedans, with wooden lattices, carved and gilt, and short spokes, which make an aukward appearance to a stranger: and, for their children they have a sort of oblong square box, with a lattice at the sides, and a roof fashioned like the eaves of a house; this has a spoke at each end, and is carried by two men on their shoulders, and the child within sits all along on the bottom of it.
            
      

        
        Their manner of living is pretty much the same in all seasons of the year. They rise as soon as it is light, and drink tea or coffee; then transact their business, either within or without doors, till nine oclock in the morning, at which time it is too hot to be in the open air; and they negotiate business, or divert themselves otherwise, within doors, till about noon, and then dine. After dinner, they strip themselves of every thing, except a pair of drawers and a short cotton gown, and go to bed. At four or five oclock in the afternoon they rise again, drink tea, and, if they have no business to transact, as there are no public places of diversion, they take an airing in their carriages; come home, sup, and go to bed again about eleven at night. Those born here of European parents, who are not many and are of a mixed breed, generally follow the Malay customs.
        The inhabitants are mostly Chinese, and their number is very great both in town and country. The China town, which is on the south side of the city, is pretty large, but meanly built, as the better sort of Chinese live within the city. The greater number of shopkeepers are Chinese; they make all the arrack and sugar; nor can any person hold an arrack-house without having it under the name of some Chinese. They also cultivate all the variety of garden-stuff with which Batavia is furnished; and of them there are silver-smiths, pewterers, carpenters, joiners, masons, calkers, barbers, hawkers, dealers, and chapmen. There is not any trade, however mean and servile, which they do not follow: and, though the Dutch have laid them under many restrictions, yet they find means to acquire a comfortable subsistence, and often accumulate wealth. The Dutch have imposed a poll-tax on them of a ducatoon, or six shillings and eight pence, a month.
        The Chinese in and about Batavia have a sallow complexion, black eyes, and tolerable good noses, but they pluck their beards up by the roots, and make, upon the whole, a very effeminate appearance.
            
      

        
        They form two sects, and keep mostly to their own customs. One of them wears all their own hair; and the other, which is by far the most numerous, shaves all the head except the crown. These different modes arise from a peculiar religious tenet held amongst them. When a rich man has a child, and thinks he can maintain it, independent of any servile employment, he suffers the hair on its head to grow, which is wound up, tied upon the crown, and ornamented with a gold bodkin or two, and it must never afterwards be shaven; these are of high rank amongst them. The other children have their heads shaven nine months after their birth, and on every ninth day afterwards, till they attain a certain age; and then they are at liberty either to wear it growing or have it shaved: the lock of hair, left on the crown of some of their heads, grows to a great length, reaching down to their posteriors. Their dress is excellently adapted to a hot climate, being generally white taffety, or callico; and consists of a pair of trowsers, over which they wear a frock with wide sleeves, which buttons before: a purse, wrought with silk, hangs beneath the upper garment; and a pair of Chinese pampouches completes their dress. The old men sometimes wear a sort of white boots, that reach up to their knees; and they always carry a fan in their hands, to shade their heads from the sun. Their usual salutation is, Adda bai ke, how do you do, sir? and they are very courteous in their address and behaviour, especially to Britons, whose generosity, I suppose, they have often experienced. The hawkers, amongst them, who outdo the Jews in low artifice, will ask twenty dollars for a thing, and take one, and have acquired, even among themselves, the character of great cheats.
        Before the rebellion in 1740, the Chinese were intirely governed by two of their own nation, who were judges in all cases, and sat in council. At present, they have a captain and two lieutenants, one of whom sits every forenoon, with a jury of twelve, in a hall they have for that purpose, to hear and make up suits and quarrels, which happen amongst them, if possible, before they go before a Dutch court of judicature; and this the Chinese must do, if they design to live in harmony with their community. To the said hall they all repair, the three first days of the month, to pay their head-money; at which time there is a Dutch ensign hoisted on a staff before the gate.
            
      

        
        There is another set of people called Portuguese; whom the Malays call Orrang Cerami, or people of Ceram; but for what reason I could not learn: They are very dark-coloured, but you may distinguish European features amongst them.
        Other people, of which there are many to be seen at Batavia, are Banjans, or Gentoos; the Malays call them Orrang Codjo: Their heads are shaven, and covered with a conical cap; the other parts of their dress are a short petticoat, or wrapper, about their loins; and, over that, a banjan. The Javanese, who reside here, are dressed much in the same manner, except the cap: they are all free, as the taking them for slaves is prohibited under a very severe penalty. Here are also Armenians, Persians, Moguls, people from many parts of India, as well as negroes from Madagascar, Mosambique, and all the eastern parts of Africa.
        Batavia is plentifully furnished with all sorts of provisions; but, in this city, as well as in others that are very populous, most articles bear a high price. Here are some bullocks, but many more buffaloes, which are sold on reasonable terms, and their flesh eats pretty well; also Cambeong, or goat-sheep; but they are lean, dry, and indifferent food: Hogs of the Chinese and European breed; the former are very fat, eat very well, and are cheap; but the Europeans despise them, and prefer the latter, which are very dear. They have also tame fowls in abundance, which are cheap. I have likewise seen wild-fowls. Their ducks are not so good as ours, and are of another kind. Muscovy ducks and geese are bought reasonable; but turkeys and pigeons are dear. They have a plentiful market of fish, which is the favourite food of the Malays, but no great variety: Claw-fish, shell-fish, and particularly oysters, though small, are pretty good food; but their turtle, of which they have a plenty, is remarkably bad, and is only eaten by the common people. I believe there is not any place can equal Batavia for the variety of provisions, which may be bought at stalls, and are hawked about the streets, ready cooked, or cooking. They are furnished with flour from the Cape, and their bread is very good and cheap; but rice is more generally used, which grows in Java, and is very plentiful. Their common drink is arrack punch. The best arrack is sold for fifteen-pence the gallon. By what I could learn, the principal ingredient in it is sugar; with the best sort they mix Dooae, or palm-syrup; but whether they use rice I cannot tell.
            
      

        
        Claret and Rhenish are the most common wines drank at Batavia: Claret you may buy at eighteen-pence the bottle; but beer sells at twenty-pence. Sugar is another article which they have in great plenty; the best sells for about twopence-farthing the pound; and sugar-candy at threepence-halfpenny. They have a great quantity of coffee, which grows at Java: It is a companys trade, but may be bought, smuggled, for twopence-halfpenny the pound. They make as good butter as need be eaten; and have a sufficient quantity of it to serve most of the inhabitants with their coffee and tea: they have also some good butter from the Cape. Of garden-stuff, they have pease, French-beans, asparagus, cos-lettuce, parsley, purslain, onions, white radishes, potatoes, cabbages, spinage, cucumbers, celery, endive, and these all the year long: besides these, which are exotics, they have several sorts of Cajang, or beans, Oobe, or yams, sweet potatoes, pumpkins, mushrooms, Vuevues, which taste like mushrooms when roasted, garlick, and a sort of small onions that taste like shallots, Chabe, or red-bird pepper; with a variety of other pot-herbs, too tedious to enumerate.
        The best fruits they have at Batavia are the Mangasteen, which is so wholesome, that it may be eaten in a fever: the Ramboutan, about the size of a large plumb, growing in bunches, and covered with a thick husk, of a bright red colour, full of soft prickles, which gives it a furzy appearance; the inside, which is about the size of a pigeons egg, is transparent, and yields a very rich juice, which has an agreeable poignancy. Pine-apples, which are also very good and plentiful, may be bought for an halfpenny or a farthing each. The Nanca and Durian are much admired by the natives; but they are very disagreeable to foreigners, as they smell like onions and garlick, mixed with sugar: the Nanca is rather long, divided into four equal parts within, has a stone in each, and is as large as a half-peck loaf: they grow on the trunk of a tree; the outside of the fruit is of a green colour, and the inside of a yellow: they are covered with a bag, before they are ripe, which pre-serves them from the vermin. The Durian is considerably less, quite round, and covered with spiny tubercles. They have bread-fruit, too; but, being full of seed, it is never eaten. Also a plenty of mangoes, of several sorts, which, in my opinion, eat best when they are green, with pepper and salt. Oranges are very scarce and very indifferent; but they have plenty of limes, and some Namnams too, which eat very well fried. They also have a fruit, produced by a sort of rattan, called Salae, which is covered over with small brown scales, and tastes like cheese, apples, and onions. Guavas, though deemed good of their kind, smell so disagreeably, that I could not endure them. Of Jamboo, they have many sorts, some large, some small, some round, and others long; white, pink, crimson, and scarlet. They have also a plenty of cocoa-nuts, of which they generally make their oil. Their other fruits are Pisang, or plantains, Manco, or water-melons, anona squamosa, custard-apples, anona reticulata, grapes, pumplenoses, citrons, and acajou apples.
        All the ships, which are careened and hove-down here, go to a small island in the bay, called Unrust, about seven miles from Batavia; where there is proper tackle to heave them down, and a bass, or overseer, to manage all matters. The whole island is one dock-yard, inhabited entirely by carpenters, and others, who belong to the ships that are there.*   Near Unrust is another island, called the Kuypers, or Coopers, which is full of warehouses, where ships deposit their goods while they are heaving-down. About a mile from this, there is another island, called Palmirante, where there is an hospital for sick seamen: and upon this island the ships companies inter their dead. There are many other islands in the bay, named Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Eadam, where the company have rope-manufactories, and send their felons.
        * At this place our ship was examined; and we found that many of her planks; and her keel, were much damaged; one part of her not being above one-eighth of an inch thick, which was luckily be-fore one of the timbers, or, in all probability, she would have sunk long before we reached the bay of Batavia. While our ship was repairing at Unrust, most of the crew were at Coopers-island, where they were taken with a putrid dysentery; three of whom, the steward of the gun-room, one of the seamen, and a boy, died. The disorder also carried off Toobaiah, and the lad Taiyota, natives of Otaheite, whom we designed to have brought to England. They had been several times up to Batavia, and expressed great surprize at the many various objects to which they had been unaccustomed: they were particularly struck with the sight of carriages drawn by horses; and were very inquisitive in respect of what they saw, that was new to them; having, before our arrival at Batavia, made great progress in the English tongue, in which they were greatly assisted by Mr. Green, the astronomer, who took much pains therein, particularly with Taiyota. When Taiyota was seized with the fatal disorder, as if certain of his approaching dissolution, he frequently said to those of us who were his intimates, Tyau mate oee, "my friends, I am dying."  He took any medicines that were offered him; but Toobaiah, who was ill at the same time, and survived him but a few days, refused every thing of that kind, and gave himself up to grief; regretting, in the highest degree, that he had left his own country, and, when he heard of Taiyotas death, he was quite inconsolable, crying out frequently, Taiyota! Taiyota! They were both buried in the island of Eadam. During our stay at Batavia, most of us were sickly; Mr. Monkhouse, our surgeon, and the astronomers servant, died; and some others hardly escaped with life.
            
      

        
        The island of Java abounds with monkies, cockatoos, parrots, and wild poultry: there are also a great many horses, which are small, but very spirited.
        The westerly monsoon sets in about October or November, and sometimes later; and then the rainy season comes on: the easterly sets in about April or May.
        The general language spoken at Batavia is low Malay; and it is necessary that every person, who designs to stay long there, should learn it. This language is very different from the high and proper Malay, which is spoken on the continent of India; and may be compared to the Lingua-Franca, being a compound of several other languages; viz. of Malay, Portuguese, and those of the eastern isles. A short vocabulary of each is here annexed as a specimen; as also vocabularies of the lan-guages of other nations, in the neighbourhood of Batavia, which I collected from natives of the different places, during my stay in that city.

        One of our midshipmen ran away from us here, and it was suspected that he was the person who cut off Ortons ears.
        On the 26th of December, we weighed anchor, and sailed from the bay of Batavia; and, on the 5th of January, 1771, we arrived and anchored at Princes Island, on the east side, (the water of which was very deep close to the shore) and staid there till the 16th. Here we were plentifully supplied with turtle, and fine fish of different sorts; cocoa-nuts, plantains, mangoes, limes and lemons: also with deer about the size of a calf; and a sort of smaller deer about as large as a rabbit, which ate much like them: a great quantity of poultry, with which the island abounds; young Indian corn, Tagaree, sugar, and some ducks. Their turtles were very lean, and far inferior to those we caught on the coast of New Holland, which I supposed might be owing to their having been kept long in crawles. We had also very fine water-melons, and bread-fruit, which would have been better had it not been so young.
            
      

        
        This side of the island is pretty high, and covered with wood, excepting plantations of rice, upon which we saw several houses. The other side is plain flat ground, and abounds with plantations of pisang, calappa, and other fruits. The people who are upon it have been there between three and four years, and came from the main land of Java; and it is most likely dispossessed the former inhabi-tants. They are all Mahometans. It was the month of Ramezan when we were there, and in this month they never eat in the day-time. They have a Radja, or king, who, indeed, is but a poor one. They wear a piece of cotton check about their waists, which reaches to their knees, and another piece over their shoulders. Their hair is very mean, and unlike that of the Malays, which is very fine. *

OF A
VOYAGE to the SOUTH SEAS,
in his Majesty's ship THE ENDEAVOUR.
        ON the 16th of January, we took our departure from this island; and, a few days after, the disorder with which several of our company had been attacked, and died at Batavia and Coopers Island, began to rage among us with great violence, and, in a few days, carried off Mr. Charles Green, the astronomer; Mr. Sydney Parkinson, Mr. David Spoving, clerk to Mr. Banks, and many of the common men. Mr. Green, being early seized with a delirium, unfortunately left some of his minutes so loose and incorrect, that it is feared it will be difficult to render them intelligible.
            
      

        
        On our arrival at the Cape, we were in great distress, not having more than six men capable of duty; but, providentially for us, the Pocock East-Indiaman was there, homeward bound, and captain Riddle generously sent his boat to us with a supply of fruits, and other vegetables, as the wind blew hard, and we could not send our boat on shore.
        The next day, the Captain, Mr, Banks, Dr. Solander, and several others of our principal people, went on shore, were kindly received by the governor; and met with a different treatment from that at Rio de Janeiro. He gave them a grant to hire a house for the sick, who were all landed the next day; and, from the wholesomeness of the climate, and a proper diet, most of them soon recovered. We staid there about a month; a great part of which time Dr. Solander was very ill. Mr. Banks spared neither time nor expence in collecting of plants, insects, skins of wild beasts, and other curious animals; and employed a number of people to assist him, some of whom he sent up a long way into the country for plants. Lieutenant Gore, with only one attendant, a slave belonging to Mr. Brand, a burgher at the Cape town, made an excursion, out of curiosity, to the top of the table-hill, where they saw several tigers and wolves, and brought some curious plants, in flower, which he presented to Mr. Banks, to whom they were very acceptable.
        After the sick had recovered, and we had taken in all necessary supplies, and had engaged some Portugueze to supply the lots of our sailors, we left the Cape, and proceeded on our voyage homeward. Three days after we left the Cape, Mr. Robert Molineux, the master of our ship, died.
        After a passage of eighteen days, during which time nothing remarkable happened, we arrived at St. Helena, where we found his majestys ship, the Portland, commanded by captain Elliot, with twelve East-Indiamen under her convoy. In going into the road we ran foul of one of the Indiamen; but, with the assistance of some boats, we happily got clear of her, without much damage, except to our upper-works. The Portland being under sailing orders, and we under captain Elliots command, as senior officer, we were assisted, by his people, in procuring wood and water; and he furnished us with some European provisions. We stayed there but four days, and then the whole fleet, consisting of fourteen sail, weighed anchor, and steered homeward.
            
      

        
        Twelve days after we left St. Helena, our first lieutenant, Mr. Zachariah Hicks, died.  About a month after we fell in with a schooner from Rhode-island, who was whaling off the western islands. We sent a boat on board for news; and were informed, to our great joy, that all was peaceable in England when she left it. Through our heavy sailing in the night, we lost sight of the fleet, and, in a few days, saw another whaling schooner, who confirmed the account which we had received from the former, and told us, that two days before they had chased a large whale into a harbour of St. Michaels Island, and that, while they were pursuing it, they were fired upon by the Portuguese, and obliged to retreat, leaving the whale a prize to them, who, doubtless, made sure of it. We bought, of the master of the schooner, some fine salt cod, with some fresh fish; also some New-England rum. This vessel, it seemed, had been out twenty-one days, and was in want of beef, and seemed distressed.
        About sixteen days after we left the schooner, we got into soundings; and, in a few more days, beat into the Chops of the Channel; and the wind, which had been before at N. E. coming about to the S.W. we proceeded directly to the Downs, where we arrived on the 12th of July, 1771, after having been absent from England within a few days of three years. We immediately sent our sick on shore; and, after staying three days, received orders to proceed round to Woolwich, where we anchored on the 20th of the same month.
        It may not be amiss to inform the curious in natural subjects, that Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander have discovered, in the course of this adventure, many thousand species of plants heretofore unknown: among the rest, one that produceth a kind of white silk flax, which, as it grows under the same parallel of latitude with England, it is presumed, will also thrive here, if properly cultivated. They have also brought over with them a quantity of seed, which, if it succeeds on this island, may, in all probability, be of much national advantage to Great-Britain.
            
      

        
        They have also described a great variety of birds and beasts, heretofore unknown, or but indifferently treated of; and above three hundred new species of fish, and have brought home with them many of the several kinds; with about one hundred species of new shells; and a great number of curious infects, some of them of a new genus; and corals; also of other marine animals, particularly of the Molusca tribe.
        Copious descriptions of all these curiosities, with elegant engravings annexed, are now preparing to be published to the world by the above-mentioned gentlemen.
