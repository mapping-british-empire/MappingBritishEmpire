During	O
this	O

,	O
Mr.	O

had	O
an	O
opportunity	O
of	O

taken	O
notice	O
;	O

a	O

which	O
was	O
found	O
adhering	O
to	O
the	O
Medusa	PNM

an	O
animal	O
of	O
an	O

about	O
three	O

one	O
thick	O

with	O
a	O

and	O
a	O
brown	O
spot	O
on	O
one	O

,	O
which	O
they	O
conjectured	O
might	O
be	O
its	O
stomach	O
;	O
four	O
of	O
these	O
adhered	O
together	O
by	O
their	O
sides	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
taken	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
at	O
first	O
they	O
were	O
thought	O
to	O
be	O
one	O
animal	O
,	O
but	O
upon	O
being	O
put	O
into	O
a	O
glass	O
of	O
water	O
they	O
soon	O
separated	O
,	O
and	O
swam	O
about	O
very	O
briskly	O

These	O
animals	O
are	O
of	O
a	O
new	O
genus	O
,	O
to	O
which	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
and	O
Dr.	O
Solander	O
gave	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
Dagysa	PNM

from	O
the	O
likeness	O
of	O
one	O
species	O
of	O
them	O
to	O
a	O
gem	O

several	O

which	O

exceeded	O

had	O
ever	O
seen	O

the	O

of	O
these	O

were	O
equal	O
to	O

from	O

to	O
that	O

the	O
genus	O

he	O
learnt	O
that	O
no	O
wood	O

of	O
apology	O
for	O

my	O

,	O
and	O
putting	O
an	O
officer	O
on	O
board	O
my	O

,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
invariable	O
custom	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
to	O
detain	O
the	O
first	O
officer	O
who	O
came	O
on	O
shore	O
from	O
any	O
ship	O
on	O
her	O
arrival	O
,	O
till	O
a	O
boat	O
from	O
the	O
Viceroy	O
had	O
visited	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
suffer	O
no	O
boat	O
to	O
go	O
either	O
from	O

to	O
a	O
ship	O
,	O
while	O
she	O
lay	O
there	O
,	O
without	O
having	O
a	O
soldier	O
on	O

They	O
said	O
that	O
I	O
might	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
when	O
I	O
pleased	O
;	O

wished	O
that	O

the	O

which	O
they	O

performed	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
*	O
the	O
14th	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
obtained	O
leave	O
of	O
the	O
Viceroy	O
to	O
purchase	O
provisions	O
and	O
refreshments	O
for	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
provided	O
I	O
would	O
employ	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
people	O
as	O
a	O
factor	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
otherwise	O
.	O

I	O
made	O
some	O
objections	O
to	O
this	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
insisted	O
upon	O
it	O
as	O
the	O
custom	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
.	O

I	O
objected	O
also	O
against	O
the	O
putting	O
a	O
soldier	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
every	O
time	O
she	O
went	O
between	O
the	O
ship	O
and	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
done	O
by	O
the	O
express	O
orders	O
of	O
his	O
court	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
he	O
could	O
in	O
no	O
case	O
dispense	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
requested	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
Gentlemen	O
whom	O
I	O
had	O
on	O
board	O
might	O
reside	O
on	O
shore	O
during	O
our	O
stay	O
,	O
*	O
and	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
might	O
go	O
up	O
the	O
country	O
to	O
gather	O
plants	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
he	O
absolutely	O
refused	O
.	O

I	O
judged	O
from	O
his	O
extreme	O
caution	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
severity	O
of	O
these	O
restrictions	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
suspected	O
we	O
were	O
come	O
to	O
trade	O
;	O
I	O
therefore	O
took	O
some	O
pains	O
to	O
convince	O
him	O
of	O
the	O
contrary	O
.	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
bound	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
order	O
of	O
his	O
Britannic	O
Majesty	O
,	O
to	O
observe	O
a	O
transit	O
of	O
the	O
planet	O
Venus	O
over	O
the	O
Sun	O
,	O
an	O
astronomical	O
phaenomenon	O
of	O
great	O
importance	O
to	O
navigation	O
.	O

Of	O
the	O
transit	O
of	O
Venus	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
he	O
could	O
form	O
no	O
other	O
conception	O
,	O
than	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
passing	O
of	O
the	O
North	O
Star	O
through	O
the	O
South	PNM
Pole	PNM
;	O
for	O
these	O
are	O
the	O
very	O
words	O
of	O
his	O
interpreter	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
a	O
Swede	O
,	O
and	O
spoke	O
English	O
very	O
well	O
.	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
it	O
necessary	O
to	O
ask	O
permission	O
for	O
the	O
Gentlemen	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
shore	O
during	O
the	O
day	O
,	O
or	O
that	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
on	O
shore	O
myself	O
,	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
at	O
liberty	O
,	O
taking	O
for	O
granted	O
that	O
nothing	O
was	O
intended	O
to	O
the	O
contrary	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
this	O
I	O
was	O
unfortunately	O
mistaken	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
took	O
leave	O
of	O
his	O
Excellency	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
an	O
officer	O
who	O
had	O
orders	O
to	O
attend	O
me	O
wherever	O
I	O
went	O
:	O
of	O
this	O
I	O
desired	O
an	O
explanation	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
told	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
meant	O
as	O
a	O
compliment	O
;	O
I	O
earnestly	O
desired	O
to	O
be	O
excused	O
from	O
accepting	O
such	O
an	O
honour	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
good	O
Viceroy	O
would	O
by	O
no	O

suffer	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
dispensed	O
with	O

With	O
this	O

therefore	O
,	O
I	O
returned	O
on	O
board	O

about	O
twelve	O

I	O
was	O
impatiently	O
expected	O
by	O
Mr.	O

Dr.	O
Solander	O

who	O
made	O
no	O
doubt	O

that	O
a	O
fair	O
account	O
of	O
us	O

been	O
given	O
by	O
the	O

had	O
been	O
on	O

of	O
the	O

removed	O

dispose	O

Their	O
disappointment	O
at	O
receiving	O
my	O
report	O
may	O
easily	O
be	O
conceived	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
still	O
increased	O
by	O
an	O
account	O
,	O
*	O
that	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
resolved	O
,	O
not	O
only	O
to	O
prevent	O
their	O
residing	O
on	O
shore	O

going	O
up	O
the	O
country	O

but	O
even	O
their	O
leaving	O
the	O

given	O

that	O
no	O

such	O

upon	O
duty	O

should	O
be	O
permitted	O
to	O
land	O

and	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
probably	O
a	O
particular	O
view	O
to	O
the	O
passengers	O
in	O
this	O
prohibition	O

as	O
they	O
were	O

In	O
the	O

however	O
,	O
Mr.	O

dressed	O
themselves	O

to	O
make	O
a	O
visit	O
to	O

had	O

off	O
with	O
our	O
pinnace	O

which	O
kept	O

lay	O
here	O

for	O

In	O

rather	O

be	O

a	O
prisoner	O
in	O

a	O
compliment	O

attended	O
me	O

I	O

insisted	O

upon	O
going	O
with	O
me	O

from	O

still	O
imagining	O

that	O
the	O

of	O

must	O
proceed	O
from	O
some	O

notion	O
about	O
us	O

might	O
more	O
easily	O
be	O
removed	O

drew	O
up	O

Mr.	O

drew	O
up	O
another	O

were	O
both	O
answered	O

by	O
no	O

to	O
our	O
satisfaction	O

replied	O

some	O

of	O
force	O

on	O

great	O
uneasiness	O

that	O
the	O

they	O
had	O

,	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
now	O
too	O
much	O
reason	O
to	O
apprehend	O

to	O
us	O

I	O
sent	O
another	O

I	O
thought	O
he	O
could	O

him	O
with	O

from	O

for	O
the	O
recovery	O
of	O
our	O

I	O
also	O
renewed	O
my	O
demand	O
that	O
the	O

should	O
be	O
no	O
longer	O
detained	O
:	O
after	O

thought	O

both	O
with	O
my	O
request	O

demand	O
;	O
and	O
the	O

we	O
happily	O
recovered	O
both	O
the	O
long-boat	O

with	O

every	O

On	O
the	O
23d	O
,	O
the	O
Viceroy	O
,	O
in	O
his	O
answer	O
to	O
my	O
remonstrance	O
against	O
seizing	O
my	O
men	O
and	O
detaining	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
acknowledged	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
treated	O

some	O
incivility	O

said	O
that	O

was	O

I	O
had	O
before	O

all	O

I	O
was	O

His	O

scruples	O

remained	O

in	O
his	O

to	O
my	O
letter	O
he	O
not	O
only	O
expressed	O
them	O
in	O
still	O
plainer	O
terms	O
,	O
but	O
accused	O
my	O
people	O
of	O
smuggling	O
.	O

This	O
charge	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
confident	O
,	O
was	O
without	O
the	O
least	O
foundation	O
in	O
truth	O
.	O

Mr.	O
Banks	O
's	O
servants	O
had	O
indeed	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
on	O
the	O
22d	O
at	O
day-break	O
,	O
and	O
stay	O
till	O
it	O
was	O
dark	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
brought	O
on	O
board	O
only	O
plants	O
and	O
insects	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
sent	O
for	O
no	O
other	O
purpose	O
.	O

And	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
greatest	O
reason	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
not	O
a	O
single	O
article	O
was	O
smuggled	O
by	O
any	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
who	O
were	O
admitted	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
though	O
many	O
artful	O
means	O
were	O
used	O
to	O
tempt	O
them	O
even	O
by	O
the	O
very	O
officers	O
that	O
were	O
under	O
his	O
Excellency	O
's	O
roof	O
,	O
which	O
made	O
the	O
charge	O
still	O
more	O
injurious	O
and	O
provoking	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
indeed	O
some	O
reason	O
to	O
suspect	O
that	O
one	O
poor	O
fellow	O
bought	O
a	O
single	O
bottle	O
of	O
rum	O
with	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
clothes	O
upon	O
his	O
back	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
my	O
answer	O
I	O
requested	O
of	O
his	O
Excellency	O

that	O
,	O
if	O
such	O
an	O
attempt	O
at	O
illicit	O
trade	O

would	O
without	O

the	O
distance	O

3/4	O

a	O
mile	O

the	O

this	O

a	O

rout	O

the	O

which	O

that	O
from	O
this	O
hill	O

should	O
push	O

seemed	O
by	O
the	O

rout	O
not	O
to	O

more	O

half	O
a	O
mile	O
over	O

into	O
the	O

of	O

there	O
build	O

Their	O

assembled	O
at	O

Dr.	O
Solander	O

who	O

crossed	O
the	O

fatigue	O

produces	O
a	O
torpor	O
and	O
sleepiness	O
that	O
are	O
almost	O
irresistible	O
:	O
he	O
therefore	O
conjured	O
the	O

to	O
keep	O

whatever	O

it	O
might	O

them	O

at	O

admonished	O

they	O

before	O

the	O

as	O
to	O

the	O

that	O
had	O

Dr.	O
Solander	O
himself	O
was	O
the	O

who	O
found	O
the	O

Mr.	O

intreated	O

remonstrated	O
in	O

down	O

lay	O
upon	O
the	O

though	O
it	O

it	O
was	O
with	O

Richmond	O
also	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O

having	O
suffered	O
from	O
the	O
cold	O
in	O
the	O

manner	O
as	O
the	O
Doctor	O

Mr.	O
Banks	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
sent	O
five	O
of	O
the	O
company	O
,	O
among	O
whom	O
was	O
Mr.	O
Buchan	O
,	O
forward	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
fire	O
ready	O
at	O
the	O
first	O

place	O
they	O
could	O
find	O
;	O
and	O
himself	O
,	O
with	O
four	O
others	O
,	O
remained	O
with	O
the	O
Doctor	O

Richmond	O
,	O
whom	O
partly	O
by	O
persuasion	O
and	O
entreaty	O
,	O
and	O
partly	O
by	O
force	O
,	O
they	O
brought	O
on	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
they	O
had	O
got	O
through	O
the	O
greatest	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
birch	O

swamp	O
,	O
they	O
both	O
declared	O
they	O
could	O
go	O
no	O

Mr.	O
Banks	O
had	O
recourse	O
again	O
to	O
entreaty	O
and	O
expostulation	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
produced	O
no	O
effect	O
:	O
when	O
Richmond	O
was	O
told	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
go	O
on	O
he	O
would	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
be	O
frozen	O

death	O
;	O
he	O
answered	O
,	O
That	O
he	O
desired	O
nothing	O
but	O
to	O
lie	O
down	O
and	O
die	O
:	O
the	O
Doctor	O
did	O
not	O
so	O
explicitly	O
renounce	O
his	O
life	O
;	O
he	O
said	O
he	O
was	O
willing	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
he	O
must	O
first	O
take	O
some	O
sleep	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
had	O
before	O
told	O
the	O
company	O
that	O
to	O
sleep	O
was	O
to	O
perish	O
.	O

Mr.	O
Banks	O
and	O
the	O
rest	O
found	O
it	O
impossible	O
to	O
carry	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
being	O
no	O
remedy	O
they	O
were	O
both	O
suffered	O
to	O
sit	O
down	O
,	O
being	O
partly	O
supported	O
by	O
the	O
bushes	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
they	O
fell	O
into	O
a	O
profound	O
sleep	O
:	O
soon	O
after	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
sent	O
forward	O
returned	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
welcome	O
news	O
that	O
a	O
fire	O
was	O
kindled	O
about	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O

on	O
the	O
way	O

Mr.	O
Banks	O
then	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
wake	O
Dr.	O
Solander	O
and	O
happily	O
succeeded	O
:	O
but	O
,	O
though	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
slept	O
five	O
minutes	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
almost	O
lost	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
his	O
limbs	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
muscles	O
were	O
so	O
shrunk	O
that	O
his	O
shoes	O
fell	O
from	O

;	O
he	O
consented	O
to	O
go	O
forward	O
with	O
such	O
assistance	O

could	O
be	O
given	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
no	O
attempts	O

poor	O
Richmond	O
were	O
successful	O

It	O
being	O
found	O
impossible	O
to	O
make	O
him	O
stir	O
,	O
after	O
some	O
time	O
had	O
been	O
lost	O
in	O
the	O
attempt	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
left	O
his	O
other	O
black	O
servant	O
and	O
a	O
seaman	O
,	O
who	O
seemed	O
to	O
have	O
suffered	O
least	O
by	O
the	O
cold	O
,	O
to	O
look	O
after	O
him	O
;	O
promising	O

that	O

as	O
two	O

should	O
be	O
sufficiently	O
warmed	O

they	O
should	O
be	O
relieved	O

*	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
,	O
with	O
much	O
difficulty	O
,	O
at	O
length	O
got	O
the	O
Doctor	O
to	O
the	O
fire	O
;	O
and	O
soon	O
after	O
sent	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
refreshed	O
,	O
in	O
hopes	O
that	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
assistance	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
left	O

,	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
bring	O
Richmond	O
,	O
even	O
though	O
it	O
should	O
still	O
be	O
found	O
impossible	O
to	O
wake	O
him	O
.	O

In	O
about	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
the	O
mortification	O
to	O
see	O
these	O
two	O
men	O
return	O
alone	O
;	O
they	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
all	O
round	O
the	O
place	O
to	O
which	O
they	O
had	O
been	O

but	O
could	O
neither	O
find	O
Richmond	O
nor	O
those	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
left	O
with	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
though	O
they	O
had	O
shouted	O
many	O
times	O
,	O
no	O
voice	O

replied	O
.	O

This	O
was	O
matter	O
of	O
equal	O
surprise	O
and	O
concern	O
,	O
particularly	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
while	O
he	O
was	O
wondering	O
how	O
it	O
could	O
happen	O
,	O
missed	O
a	O
bottle	O
of	O
rum	O
,	O
the	O
company	O
's	O
whole	O
stock	O

which	O
they	O
now	O
concluded	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
the	O
knapsack	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
absentees	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
conjectured	O
,	O
that	O
with	O
this	O
Richmond	O
had	O
been	O
rouzed	O
by	O
the	O
two	O
persons	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
left	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
,	O
having	O
perhaps	O
drank	O
too	O
freely	O
of	O
it	O
themselves	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
all	O
rambled	O
from	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
left	O

in	O

the	O

for	O
those	O
who	O

their	O
assistants	O
and	O
guides	O
.	O

Another	O
fall	O
of	O
snow	O
now	O
came	O
on	O
,	O
and	O
continued	O
incessantly	O
for	O
two	O
hours	O

so	O
that	O
all	O
hope	O
of	O

them	O
again	O
,	O
at	O

alive	O

were	O
given	O
up	O

about	O
twelve	O

to	O
the	O
great	O
joy	O
of	O
those	O
at	O
the	O
fire	O
,	O
a	O
shouting	O
was	O
heard	O
at	O
some	O
distance	O

Mr.	O
Banks	O
,	O
with	O
four	O
more	O
,	O
immediately	O
went	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
the	O
seaman	O
with	O
just	O
strength	O
enough	O
left	O
to	O
stagger	O
along	O
,	O
and	O
call	O
out	O
for	O
assistance	O
:	O
Mr.	O

sent	O
him	O
immediately	O
to	O
the	O
fire	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
by	O
his	O
direction	O
,	O
proceeded	O
in	O
search	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
,	O
whom	O
he	O
soon	O

found	O

Richmond	O
was	O
upon	O

not	O
able	O

his	O
companion	O
was	O
lying	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O

All	O
hands	O
were	O
now	O
called	O
from	O
the	O
fire	O

*	O
and	O
an	O
attempt	O
was	O
made	O
to	O
carry	O
them	O

it	O

but	O
this	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
the	O
united	O
efforts	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O

was	O
found	O
to	O

The	O
night	O
was	O
extremely	O
dark	O

the	O

was	O
now	O
very	O
deep	O

,	O
under	O
these	O

The	O
only	O

was	O
to	O

observing	O
that	O

held	O
one	O

our	O
readiness	O

to	O
give	O
a	O

solemnity	O

We	O
then	O
proceeded	O
,	O
and	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
watering-place	O
it	O
was	O
intimated	O
to	O
us	O
by	O
signs	O

that	O
we	O
might	O
occupy	O
that	O
ground	O

but	O
it	O
happened	O
not	O
to	O

During	O

they	O
had	O
shaken	O
off	O
their	O
first	O

sense	O
of	O
our	O
superiority	O

were	O

familiar	O
:	O
they	O
went	O
with	O
us	O
from	O
the	O
watering-place	O
and	O
took	O
a	O
circuit	O
through	O
the	O
woods	O
:	O
as	O
we	O
went	O
along	O
,	O
we	O
distributed	O
beads	O
and	O
other	O
small	O
presents	O
among	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
the	O
satisfaction	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
much	O
gratified	O
.	O

Our	O
circuit	O
was	O
not	O
less	O
than	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
miles	O
,	O
through	O
groves	O
of	O
trees	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
loaded	O
with	O
cocoa-nuts	O
and	O
bread-fruit	O
,	O
and	O
afforded	O
the	O
most	O
grateful	O
shade	O

Under	O
these	O
trees	O
were	O
the	O
habitations	O
of	O
the	O

most	O

and	O
the	O
whole	O

We	O
remarked	O
however	O

not	O
without	O
some	O
regret	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
all	O
our	O
walk	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
only	O
two	O
hogs	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
a	O
single	O
fowl	O
.	O

Those	O
of	O
our	O
company	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
here	O
with	O
the	O
Dolphin	O
told	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
none	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
whom	O
we	O
had	O
yet	O
seen	O
were	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
class	O
;	O
they	O
suspected	O
that	O
the	O
chiefs	O
had	O
removed	O
,	O
and	O
upon	O
carrying	O
us	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
what	O
they	O
called	O
the	O

had	O
stood	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
no	O
traces	O

During	O
this	O
visit	O
a	O
wife	O
of	O
our	O
noble	O
host	O
,	O
whose	O
name	O
was	O
TOMIO	O

to	O
place	O
herself	O
upon	O
the	O

him	O

Tomio	O
was	O
not	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
bloom	O
of	O
her	O
youth	O
,	O
nor	O
did	O
she	O
appear	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
ever	O
remarkable	O
for	O
her	O
beauty	O
:	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
therefore	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
,	O
pay	O
her	O
the	O
most	O
flattering	O
attention	O
:	O
it	O
happened	O
too	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
farther	O
mortification	O
to	O
this	O
lady	O
,	O
that	O
seeing	O
a	O
very	O
pretty	O
girl	O
among	O
the	O
crowd	O
,	O
he	O
,	O
not	O
adverting	O
to	O
the	O
dignity	O
of	O
his	O
companion	O
,	O
beckoned	O
her	O
to	O
come	O
to	O
him	O
:	O
the	O
girl	O
,	O
after	O
some	O
entreaty	O
,	O
complied	O
,	O
and	O
sat	O
down	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O
him	O
;	O
he	O
loaded	O
her	O
with	O
beads	O
,	O
and	O
every	O
showy	O
trifle	O
that	O
would	O
please	O
her	O
:	O
his	O
Princess	O
,	O
though	O
she	O
was	O
somewhat	O
mortified	O
at	O
the	O
preference	O
that	O
was	O
given	O
to	O
her	O
rival	O
,	O
did	O
not	O
discontinue	O
her	O
civilities	O
,	O
but	O
still	O
assiduously	O
supplied	O
him	O
with	O
the	O
milk	O
of	O
the	O
cocoa-nut	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
other	O
dainties	O
as	O
were	O
in	O
her	O

This	O

might	O
possibly	O
have	O
become	O
more	O
curious	O

if	O
it	O
had	O

been	O
suddenly	O

by	O
an	O
interlude	O
of	O
a	O

Just	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
Dr.	O
Solander	O

Mr.	O

complained	O
that	O

Dr.	O

The	O

with	O
a	O

of	O

took	O
Mr.	O

by	O

lay	O
at	O
the	O

Mr.	O
Banks	O
put	O
it	O
by	O

and	O
gave	O
him	O
to	O
understand	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
wanted	O
nothing	O
but	O
what	O
had	O
been	O
dishonestly	O
taken	O
away	O

Toubourai	O

went	O

out	O

Mr.	O

with	O
his	O

Tomio	O

who	O
during	O
the	O

of	O
terror	O

confusion	O
had	O
kept	O
constantly	O
at	O
his	O
side	O

intimating	O
his	O
desire	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
wait	O
there	O

his	O

Mr.	O

accordingly	O
sat	O
down	O

as	O
well	O

he	O
could	O
by	O

about	O
half	O

The	O
chief	O
then	O
came	O
back	O
with	O

snuff-box	O

the	O
case	O
of	O
the	O
opera	O

in	O

,	O
with	O
a	O
joy	O
in	O
his	O
countenance	O
that	O
was	O
painted	O
with	O
a	O
strength	O
of	O
expression	O
which	O
distinguishes	O
these	O

case	O
of	O
the	O

however	O

upon	O
being	O
opened	O

was	O
found	O
to	O
be	O
empty	O

upon	O
this	O
discovery	O
,	O
his	O
countenance	O
changed	O
in	O
a	O
moment	O
;	O
and	O
catching	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
again	O
by	O
the	O
hand	O
,	O
he	O
rushed	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
,	O
without	O
uttering	O
any	O
sound	O
,	O
and	O
led	O
him	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
walking	O
with	O
great	O
rapidity	O
:	O
when	O
they	O
had	O
got	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
house	O
,	O
a	O
woman	O
met	O
him	O
and	O
gave	O
him	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
cloth	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
hastily	O
took	O
from	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
continued	O
to	O
press	O
forward	O
with	O
it	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O

Dr.	O
Solander	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Monkhouse	O
had	O
followed	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
came	O
at	O
length	O
to	O
a	O
house	O
where	O
they	O
were	O
received	O
by	O
a	O
woman	O
,	O
to	O
whom	O
he	O
gave	O
the	O
cloth	O
,	O
and	O
intimated	O
to	O
the	O
gentlemen	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
give	O
her	O
some	O
beads	O
.	O

They	O
immediately	O
complied	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
beads	O
and	O
cloth	O
being	O
deposited	O
upon	O
the	O
floor	O
,	O
the	O
woman	O
went	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
about	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
returned	O
with	O
the	O
opera	O
glass	O
,	O
expressing	O
the	O
same	O
joy	O
upon	O
the	O
occasion	O
that	O
had	O
before	O
been	O
expressed	O
by	O
the	O
Chief	O
.	O

The	O
beads	O
were	O
now	O
returned	O
,	O
with	O
an	O
inflexible	O
resolution	O
not	O
to	O
accept	O
them	O
;	O
*	O
and	O
the	O
cloth	O
was	O
,	O
with	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
pertinacity	O
,	O
forced	O
upon	O
Dr.	O
Solander	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
recompence	O
for	O
the	O
injury	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
done	O
him	O
.	O

He	O
could	O
not	O
avoid	O
accepting	O
the	O
cloth	O
,	O
but	O
insisted	O
in	O
his	O
turn	O
upon	O
giving	O
a	O
new	O
present	O
of	O
beads	O
to	O
the	O
woman	O
.	O

It	O
will	O
not	O
perhaps	O
be	O
easy	O
to	O
account	O
for	O
all	O
the	O
steps	O
that	O
were	O
taken	O
in	O
the	O
recovery	O
of	O
this	O
glass	O
and	O
snuff-box	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
thought	O
strange	O
,	O
considering	O
that	O
the	O
scene	O
of	O
action	O
was	O
among	O
a	O
people	O
whose	O
language	O
,	O
policy	O
and	O
connections	O
are	O
even	O
now	O
but	O
imperfectly	O
known	O

upon	O

they	O

honour	O

the	O
N.	O

that	O

respect	O

at	O

pleased	O

sat	O
down	O

was	O
upwards	O

The	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
our	O
friend	O
Tubourai	O
Tamaide	O
made	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
a	O
visit	O
at	O
the	O
tent	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
with	O
him	O
not	O
only	O
his	O
wife	O
and	O
family	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
roof	O
of	O
a	O
house	O
,	O
*	O
and	O
several	O
materials	O
for	O
setting	O
it	O
up	O
,	O
with	O
furniture	O
and	O
implements	O
of	O
various	O
kinds	O
,	O
intending	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
understood	O
him	O
,	O
to	O
take	O
up	O
his	O
residence	O
in	O
our	O
neighbourhood	O
:	O
this	O
instance	O
of	O
his	O
confidence	O
and	O
good-will	O
gave	O
us	O
great	O
pleasure	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
determined	O
to	O
strengthen	O
his	O
attachment	O
to	O
us	O
by	O
every	O
means	O
in	O
our	O
power	O
.	O

Soon	O
after	O
his	O
arrival	O
,	O
he	O
took	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
by	O
the	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
leading	O
him	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
line	O
,	O
signified	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
accompany	O
him	O
into	O
the	O
woods	O
.	O

Mr.	O
Banks	O
readily	O
consented	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
walked	O
with	O
him	O
about	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
,	O
they	O
arrived	O
at	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
awning	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
already	O
set	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
his	O
occasional	O
habitation	O
.	O

Here	O
he	O
unfolded	O
a	O
bundle	O
of	O
his	O
country	O
cloth	O
,	O
and	O
taking	O
out	O
two	O
garments	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
red	O
cloth	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
of	O
very	O
neat	O
matting	O
,	O
he	O
clothed	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
in	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
without	O
any	O
other	O
ceremony	O
,	O
immediately	O
conducted	O
him	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
tent	O
.	O

His	O
attendants	O
soon	O
after	O
brought	O
him	O
some	O
pork	O
and	O
bread-fruit	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
eat	O
,	O
dipping	O
his	O
meat	O
into	O
salt	O
water	O
instead	O
of	O
sauce	O
:	O
after	O
his	O
meal	O
he	O
retired	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
's	O
bed	O
,	O
and	O
slept	O
about	O
an	O
hour	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
his	O
wife	O
Tomio	O
brought	O
to	O
the	O
tent	O
a	O
young	O
man	O
about	O
two	O
and	O
twenty	O
years	O
of	O
age	O
,	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
comely	O
appearance	O
,	O
whom	O
they	O
both	O
seemed	O
to	O
acknowledge	O
as	O
their	O
son	O
,	O
though	O
we	O
afterwards	O
discovered	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
this	O
young	O
man	O
and	O
another	O
Chief	O

who	O
had	O
also	O
paid	O

a	O

Tubourai	O

Our	O
Surgeon	O

Mr.	O
Monkhouse	O
,	O
having	O
walked	O
out	O
this	O

,	O
reported	O

man	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
shot	O
at	O
the	O

which	O
he	O
said	O
was	O
wrapped	O
in	O

placed	O
on	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
bier	O

supported	O
by	O

under	O
a	O

for	O

:	O
that	O
near	O
it	O
were	O
deposited	O
some	O

of	O
war	O

and	O
other	O
things	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
would	O
particularly	O
have	O
examined	O
but	O
for	O
the	O
stench	O
of	O
the	O
body	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
intolerable	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
saw	O
also	O
two	O
more	O

in	O
one	O

they	O
were	O

We	O
discovered	O

that	O
this	O
was	O

Mr.	O

went	O
out	O
and	O
brought	O
her	O
in	O
;	O
he	O
saw	O
that	O
the	O
tears	O

stood	O
in	O
her	O
eyes	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
she	O
entered	O
they	O
began	O
to	O
flow	O
in	O
great	O
abundance	O
:	O
he	O
enquired	O
earnestly	O
the	O
cause	O
,	O
but	O
instead	O
of	O
answering	O
she	O
took	O
from	O
under	O
her	O
garment	O
a	O
shark	O
's	O
tooth	O
,	O
and	O
struck	O
it	O
six	O
or	O
seven	O
times	O
into	O
her	O
head	O
with	O
great	O
force	O
;	O
a	O
profusion	O
of	O
blood	O
followed	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
talked	O
loud	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
a	O
most	O
melancholy	O
tone	O
,	O
for	O
some	O
minutes	O
,	O
without	O
at	O
all	O
regarding	O
his	O
enquiries	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
repeated	O
with	O
still	O
more	O
impatience	O
and	O
concern	O
,	O
while	O
the	O
other	O
Indians	O
,	O
to	O
his	O
great	O
surprize	O
,	O
talked	O
and	O
laughed	O
,	O
without	O
taking	O
the	O
least	O
notice	O
of	O
her	O
distress	O
.	O

But	O
her	O
own	O
behaviour	O
was	O
still	O
more	O
extraordinary	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
bleeding	O
was	O
over	O
,	O
she	O
looked	O
up	O
with	O
a	O
smile	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
collect	O
some	O
small	O
pieces	O
of	O
cloth	O
,	O
which	O
during	O
her	O
bleeding	O
she	O
had	O
thrown	O
down	O
to	O
catch	O
the	O
blood	O
;	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
she	O
had	O
picked	O
them	O
all	O
up	O
,	O
she	O
carried	O
them	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
tent	O
,	O
and	O
threw	O
them	O
into	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
carefully	O
dispersing	O
them	O
abroad	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
she	O
wished	O
to	O
prevent	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
them	O
from	O
reviving	O
the	O
remembrance	O
of	O
what	O
she	O
had	O
done	O
.	O

She	O
then	O
plunged	O
into	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
after	O
having	O
washed	O
her	O
whole	O
body	O
,	O
returned	O

As	O

as	O
her	O

an	O

was	O
made	O
to	O
conduct	O
her	O
to	O
the	O

Of	O
this	O
she	O
readily	O
accepted	O

came	O
on	O

two	O

several	O

who	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
all	O
of	O
her	O

;	O
I	O
received	O
her	O
with	O
such	O
marks	O
of	O
distinction	O
as	O
I	O
thought	O
would	O
gratify	O
her	O
most	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
not	O

of	O
my	O
presents	O

among	O
which	O
this	O

seemed	O

we	O
landed	O

a	O
hog	O

several	O
bunches	O
of	O

the	O

that	O
was	O
shewed	O
to	O

became	O

when	O
she	O
produced	O
her	O
doll	O

that	O
to	O
propitiate	O
him	O
it	O
was	O
thought	O
proper	O
to	O

him	O
with	O
another	O

fit	O
to	O
prefer	O
a	O
doll	O
to	O
a	O

this	O

arose	O
only	O
from	O
a	O

jealousy	O

could	O

soothed	O

by	O
a	O

without	O
his	O
permission	O

We	O
now	O
began	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
this	O
man	O
was	O
indeed	O
a	O
great	O
Prince	O
;	O
for	O
an	O
influence	O
so	O
extensive	O
and	O
absolute	O
could	O
be	O
acquired	O
by	O
no	O
other	O
.	O

And	O
we	O
afterwards	O
found	O
that	O
he	O
administered	O
the	O
government	O
of	O
this	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
as	O
sovereign	O
,	O
for	O
a	O
minor	O
whom	O
we	O
never	O
saw	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
upon	O
it	O

When	O
Mr.	O
Green	O
returned	O
from	O
this	O
expedition	O
,	O
*	O
he	O
said	O
he	O
had	O
seen	O
a	O
tree	O
of	O
a	O
size	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
afraid	O
to	O
relate	O
,	O
it	O
being	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
sixty	O
yards	O
in	O
circumference	O
;	O
but	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
and	O
Dr.	O
Solander	O
soon	O
explained	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
species	O
of	O
the	O
fig	O
,	O
the	O
branches	O
of	O
which	O
,	O
bending	O
down	O
,	O
take	O
fresh	O
root	O
in	O
the	O
earth	O
,	O
and	O
thus	O
form	O
a	O
congeries	O
of	O
trunks	O
,	O
which	O
being	O
very	O
close	O
to	O
each	O

,	O
and	O
all	O
joined	O
by	O
a	O

the	O
satisfaction	O

that	O

pressed	O
him	O

neither	O

up	O
all	O

recovering	O
our	O

which	O
indeed	O
were	O
never	O

all	O

we	O
had	O

therefore	O

in	O
no	O

set	O
out	O

As	O
we	O
were	O
returning	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
entertained	O
with	O
a	O
sight	O
that	O
in	O
some	O
measure	O
compensated	O
for	O
our	O
fatigue	O
and	O
disappointment	O
.	O

In	O
our	O
way	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
the	O

places	O
where	O
access	O
to	O
the	O
island	O
is	O
not	O
guarded	O
by	O
a	O
reef	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
consequently	O
,	O
a	O
high	O
surf	O
breaks	O
upon	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
a	O
more	O
dreadful	O
one	O
indeed	O
I	O
had	O
seldom	O
seen	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
any	O
European	O
boat	O
to	O
have	O
lived	O
in	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
the	O

swimmer	O
in	O
Europe	PNM
had	O
,	O
by	O
any	O
accident	O
,	O
been	O
exposed	O
to	O
its	O
fury	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
confident	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
preserve	O
himself	O
from	O
drowning	O
,	O
especially	O
as	O
the	O
shore	O
was	O
covered	O
with	O
pebbles	O
and	O
large	O
stones	O
;	O
yet	O
,	O
in	O
the	O

of	O
these	O
breakers	O

were	O
ten	O

twelve	O
Indians	O
swimming	O
for	O
their	O
amusement	O
:	O
whenever	O
a	O
surf	O
broke	O
near	O
them	O
,	O
they	O
dived	O
under	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
to	O
all	O
appearance	O
with	O
infinite	O
facility	O
,	O
rose	O
again	O

This	O
diversion	O
was	O
greatly	O
improved	O
by	O
the	O
stern	O
of	O
an	O
old	O
canoe	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
happened	O
to	O
find	O
upon	O

spot	O
;	O
they	O
took	O
this	O

swam	O
out	O
with	O
it	O
as	O

*	O

turning	O
the	O
square	O

to	O
the	O
breaking	O
wave	O
,	O
were	O
driven	O
in	O
towards	O
the	O
shore	O
with	O
incredible	O
rapidity	O
,	O
sometimes	O
almost	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O
;	O
but	O
generally	O
the	O
wave	O
broke	O
over	O
them	O
before	O
they	O
got	O
half	O
way	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
case	O
they	O
dived	O

rose	O
on	O
the	O

side	O
with	O
the	O
canoe	O
in	O
their	O
hands	O

they	O

swam	O
out	O

it	O
again	O

were	O
again	O

just	O
as	O

in	O

Upon	O
this	O
occasion	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
observed	O
,	O
that	O
human	O
nature	O
is	O
endued	O
with	O
powers	O
which	O
are	O
only	O
accidentally	O
exerted	O
to	O
the	O

;	O
and	O
that	O
all	O

are	O
capable	O
of	O
what	O
no	O
man	O
attains	O

except	O
he	O
is	O
stimulated	O

the	O
effort	O

some	O

These	O
Indians	O
effected	O
what	O
to	O
us	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
supernatural	O
,	O
merely	O
by	O
the	O
application	O
of	O
such	O

no	O

The	O
truth	O
of	O
the	O
observation	O

The	O

their	O

not	O
to	O
any	O

to	O
an	O

improvement	O
of	O

gifts	O
;	O

though	O
equal	O
diligence	O

these	O

any	O
more	O

there	O
is	O
no	O
doubt	O

that	O
a	O
certain	O
degree	O
of	O

A	O
list	O

was	O
made	O
out	O

of	O
the	O

came	O

nothing	O

which	O
I	O
was	O
much	O

for	O

were	O
in	O
the	O
utmost	O
distress	O
for	O
the	O
fish	O

which	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
would	O
be	O
spoilt	O
;	O
I	O
was	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
reduced	O
to	O
a	O
disagreeable	O
situation	O
,	O
either	O
of	O
releasing	O
the	O
canoes	O
,	O
contrary	O
to	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
solemnly	O

publickly	O
declared	O
,	O
or	O
to	O
detain	O
them	O

to	O
the	O
great	O
injury	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
were	O
innocent	O

without	O
answering	O
any	O
good	O
purpose	O
to	O
ourselves	O
:	O
as	O
a	O
temporary	O
expedient	O

I	O
permitted	O
them	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
fish	O

but	O
still	O
detained	O
the	O
canoes	O

This	O
very	O
licence	O

was	O
productive	O
of	O
new	O
confusion	O
and	O
injury	O
;	O
for	O

not	O
being	O
easy	O
at	O

the	O

These	O
circumstances	O
having	O
strongly	O
excited	O
our	O
curiosity	O
,	O
we	O
enquired	O
who	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
informed	O
,	O
that	O
Oamo	O
was	O
the	O
husband	O
of	O
Oberea	PNM

though	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
separated	O
by	O
mutual	O
consent	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
young	O
woman	O
and	O
the	O
boy	O
were	O
their	O
children	O
.	O

We	O
learnt	O
also	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
boy	O
,	O
whose	O
name	O
was	O
TERRIDIRI	O
,	O
was	O
heir	O
apparent	O
to	O
the	O
sovereignty	O
of	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
his	O
sister	O
was	O
intended	O
for	O
his	O
wife	O
,	O
the	O
marriage	O
being	O
deferred	O
only	O
till	O
he	O
should	O
arrive	O
at	O
a	O
proper	O
age	O
.	O

The	O
sovereign	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
was	O
a	O
son	O
of	O
WHAPPAI	O
,	O
whose	O
name	O
was	O
OUTOU	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
,	O
as	O
before	O
has	O
been	O
observed	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
minor	O
.	O

Whappai	O
,	O
Oamo	O
,	O
and	O
Tootahah	O
,	O
were	O
brothers	O
:	O
Whappai	O
was	O
the	O
eldest	O
,	O
and	O
Oamo	O
the	O
second	O
;	O
so	O
that	O

no	O

Outou	O
,	O
Terridiri	O

the	O
son	O
of	O
his	O
next	O
brother	O
Oamo	O
,	O
was	O
heir	O
to	O
the	O
sovereignty	O
.	O

It	O
will	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
seem	O
strange	O
that	O
a	O
boy	O
should	O
be	O
sovereign	O
during	O
the	O
life	O
of	O
his	O
father	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
custom	O
of	O
the	O

,	O
a	O
child	O
succeeds	O
to	O
a	O

title	O

soon	O

it	O

the	O

about	O

we	O

the	O
advice	O
of	O
our	O
Indian	O
guide	O
,	O
who	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
the	O
country	O
was	O
rich	O
and	O
good	O

The	O
Chief	O
,	O
whose	O
name	O
was	O
OTOOAREITE	O
,	O
soon	O
came	O
down	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
but	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
total	O
stranger	O
both	O
to	O
us	O
and	O
to	O
our	O
trade	O
:	O
his	O
subjects	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
brought	O
us	O
plenty	O
of	O
cocoa-nuts	O
,	O
and	O
about	O
twenty	O
bread-fruit	O
.	O

The	O
bread-fruit	O
we	O
bought	O
at	O
a	O
very	O
dear	O
rate	O
,	O
but	O
his	O
excellency	O
sold	O
us	O
a	O
pig	O
for	O
a	O
glass	O
bottle	O

which	O
he	O
preferred	O
to	O
every	O
thing	O
else	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
give	O
him	O

We	O
found	O
in	O
his	O
possession	O
a	O
goose	O
and	O
a	O
turkey-cock	O

were	O

been	O

the	O
Dolphin	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
both	O
enormously	O
fat	O

and	O
so	O
tame	O
that	O
they	O
followed	O
the	O

them	O

In	O
a	O

what	O
was	O
altogether	O

to	O

At	O

there	O
was	O
not	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
that	O
wanted	O

A	O
sight	O
so	O

excited	O
our	O

we	O
made	O
many	O

at	O

When	O
we	O
left	O
this	O
place	O
,	O
the	O
Chief	O
,	O
Mathiabo	O
,	O
desired	O
leave	O
to	O
accompany	O
us	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
readily	O
granted	O
.	O

He	O
continued	O
with	O
us	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
proved	O
very	O
useful	O
,	O
by	O
piloting	O
us	O
over	O
the	O
shoals	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O
,	O
we	O
opened	O
the	O
bay	O
on	O
the	O
north	O

almost	O

the	O

as	O
I	O
have	O
observed	O
before	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
we	O
had	O
coasted	O
about	O
two-thirds	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
we	O
determined	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
shore	O
for	O
the	O
night	O

We	O
saw	O
a	O
large	O
house	O
at	O
some	O
distance	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
Mathiabo	O
informed	O
us	O
,	O
belonged	O
to	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
friends	O
;	O
and	O
soon	O
after	O
several	O
canoes	O
came	O
off	O
to	O
meet	O
us	O
,	O
having	O
on	O
board	O
some	O
very	O
handsome	O
women	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
by	O
their	O
behaviour	O
,	O
seemed	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
sent	O
to	O
entice	O
us	O
on	O
shore	O

As	O
we	O
had	O
before	O
resolved	O
to	O
take	O
up	O
our	O
residence	O
here	O
for	O
the	O
night	O
,	O
little	O
invitation	O
was	O
necessary	O

We	O
found	O
that	O
the	O
house	O
belonged	O
to	O
the	O
Chief	O
of	O
the	O
district	O
,	O
whose	O
name	O
was	O
WIVEROU	O
;	O
he	O
received	O
us	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
friendly	O
manner	O
,	O
and	O
ordered	O
his	O
people	O
to	O
assist	O
us	O
in	O
dressing	O
our	O
provision	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
now	O
got	O
a	O
tolerable	O
stock	O

*	O
When	O
our	O
supper	O
was	O
ready	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
conducted	O
into	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
where	O
Wiverou	O
was	O
sitting	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
eat	O
it	O
;	O
Mathiabo	O
supped	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
Wiverou	O
calling	O
for	O
his	O
supper	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
,	O
we	O
eat	O
our	O
meal	O
very	O
sociably	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
great	O
good-humour	O
.	O

When	O
it	O
was	O
over	O
,	O
we	O
began	O
to	O
enquire	O
where	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
sleep	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
was	O
shewn	O
us	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
told	O
we	O
might	O
take	O
possession	O
for	O
that	O
purpose	O
.	O

We	O
then	O
sent	O
for	O
our	O
cloaks	O
,	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
began	O
to	O
undress	O
,	O
as	O
his	O
custom	O
was	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
precaution	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
taught	O
by	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
the	O
jackets	O
at	O
Atahourou	PNM
,	O
sent	O
his	O
clothes	O
aboard	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
proposing	O
to	O
cover	O
himself	O
with	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
Indian	O
cloth	O
.	O

When	O
Mathiabo	O
perceived	O
what	O
was	O
doing	O
,	O
he	O
also	O
pretended	O
to	O
want	O
a	O
cloak	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
behaved	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
done	O
us	O
some	O
service	O
,	O
a	O
cloak	O
was	O
ordered	O
for	O
him	O
.	O

We	O
lay	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
observed	O
that	O
Mathiabo	O
was	O
not	O
with	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
supposed	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
gone	O
to	O
bathe	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
Indians	O
always	O
do	O
before	O
they	O
sleep	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
not	O
waited	O
long	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
when	O
an	O
Indian	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
a	O
stranger	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
came	O
and	O
told	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
cloak	O
and	O
Mathiabo	PNM
had	O
disappeared	O
together	O
.	O

This	O
man	O
had	O
so	O
far	O
gained	O
our	O
confidence	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
at	O
first	O
believe	O
the	O
report	O
;	O

it	O
being	O
soon	O

our	O

Indian	O
,	O
we	O
knew	O
no	O

to	O

As	O
it	O
was	O
impossible	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
pursue	O
the	O
thief	O
with	O
any	O
hope	O
of	O
success	O
,	O
without	O
the	O
assistance	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
about	O
us	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
started	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
telling	O
our	O
case	O
,	O
required	O
them	O
to	O
recover	O
the	O
cloak	O
;	O
and	O
to	O
enforce	O
his	O
requisition	O
,	O
shewed	O
one	O
of	O
his	O
pocket	O
pistols	O

he	O
always	O
kept	O

him	O

Upon	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
pistol	O
,	O
the	O
whole	O
company	O
took	O
the	O
alarm	O

instead	O

to	O
catch	O
the	O
thief	O
,	O
or	O
recover	O
what	O
had	O
been	O

with	O

precipitation	O
to	O
leave	O
the	O
place	O

one	O
of	O

was	O
seized	O

upon	O
which	O

immediately	O
offered	O
to	O
direct	O

:	O

set	O
out	O

with	O
Mr.	O

all	O

the	O
alarm	O
had	O
got	O
before	O
us	O

for	O
in	O
about	O
ten	O
minutes	O
we	O
met	O
a	O
man	O
bringing	O
back	O
the	O
cloak	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
thief	O
had	O
relinquished	O
in	O
great	O
terror	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
then	O
think	O
fit	O
to	O
continue	O
the	O
pursuit	O
,	O
he	O
made	O
his	O
escape	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
returned	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
house	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
there	O
had	O
been	O
between	O
two	O
and	O
three	O
hundred	O
people	O
,	O
entirely	O
deserted	O

It	O
being	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
soon	O
known	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
resentment	O
against	O
any	O

Mathiabo	O

the	O

our	O

up	O

In	O
this	O
place	O

we	O
were	O
destined	O
to	O
more	O
confusion	O
and	O
trouble	O
,	O
for	O
about	O
five	O
o'clock	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
our	O
sentry	O
alarmed	O
us	O
,	O
with	O
an	O
account	O
that	O
the	O
boat	O
was	O
missing	O
:	O
he	O
had	O
seen	O
her	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
about	O
half	O
an	O
hour	O
before	O
,	O
at	O
her	O
grappling	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
not	O
above	O
fifty	O

from	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
but	O
upon	O
hearing	O
the	O
sound	O
of	O
oars	O

he	O
had	O
looked	O
out	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
see	O
nothing	O
of	O
her	O

At	O
this	O
account	O
we	O
started	O
up	O
greatly	O
alarmed	O

and	O
ran	O
to	O
the	O
water	O
side	O

the	O
morning	O
was	O
clear	O

that	O

a	O

there	O
was	O
no	O
appearance	O
of	O
the	O

most	O

apprehensions	O

dead	O

suppose	O
her	O
to	O
have	O
broken	O
from	O
her	O

we	O
had	O
great	O
reason	O
to	O
fear	O
that	O
the	O
Indians	O
had	O
attacked	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
finding	O
the	O
people	O
asleep	O

At	O
this	O
place	O
we	O
saw	O
a	O
very	O
singular	O
curiosity	O

it	O
was	O
the	O
figure	O
of	O
a	O

rudely	O
made	O

it	O
was	O
something	O
more	O
than	O
seven	O

rather	O
too	O
bulky	O
in	O

its	O
height	O

The	O
wicker	O
skeleton	O
was	O
completely	O

which	O
were	O
white	O

the	O
skin	O
was	O
to	O
appear	O

black	O

upon	O

there	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
a	O

of	O

upon	O
the	O

also	O
were	O
four	O

three	O

The	O

we	O

the	O

the	O

Some	O

we	O

For	O
about	O

about	O

of	O
which	O

after	O
a	O

they	O

;	O
in	O
bad	O

it	O
is	O
not	O
easy	O
to	O

they	O

about	O
six	O

following	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
the	O

found	O
the	O
river	O
banked	O
by	O
steep	O
rocks	O

from	O
which	O
a	O
cascade	O
,	O
falling	O
with	O

formed	O
a	O
pool	O

so	O
steep	O

that	O
the	O
Indians	O
said	O
they	O
could	O
not	O

seemed	O

not	O
much	O
to	O

the	O

The	O
way	O
up	O

one	O

yet	O
up	O

a	O

by	O
concealing	O
them	O

might	O
compel	O

had	O
the	O
pleasure	O
to	O
observe	O

intimation	O

in	O

with	O
a	O
strong	O
party	O

When	O
I	O
questioned	O
the	O
petty	O
officer	O
concerning	O
what	O
had	O
happened	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
he	O
told	O
me	O

that	O
neither	O
the	O

him	O
,	O
nor	O
those	O
whom	O

met	O
in	O

,	O

would	O
give	O
them	O
any	O
intelligence	O
of	O
the	O
deserters	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
contrary	O
,	O
became	O
very	O
troublesome	O
:	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
returning	O
for	O
further	O
orders	O
to	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
he	O
and	O
his	O
comrade	O
were	O
suddenly	O
seized	O
by	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
armed	O
men	O
,	O
who	O
having	O
learnt	O
that	O
Tootahah	O
was	O
confined	O
,	O
had	O
concealed	O
themselves	O
in	O
a	O
wood	O
for	O
that	O
purpose	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
who	O
having	O
taken	O
them	O
at	O
a	O
disadvantage	O
,	O
forced	O
their	O
weapons	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
declared	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
detain	O
them	O
till	O
their	O
Chief	O
should	O
be	O
set	O
at	O
liberty	O
.	O

He	O
said	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
Indians	O
were	O
not	O
unanimous	O
in	O
this	O
measure	O
;	O
that	O
some	O
were	O
for	O
setting	O
them	O
at	O
liberty	O
,	O
and	O
others	O
for	O
detaining	O
them	O
:	O
that	O
an	O
eager	O
dispute	O
ensued	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
from	O
words	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
blows	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
the	O
party	O
for	O
detaining	O
them	O
at	O
length	O
prevailed	O
:	O
that	O
soon	O
after	O
,	O
Webb	O
and	O
Gibson	O
were	O
brought	O
in	O
by	O
a	O
party	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
as	O
prisoners	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
also	O
might	O
be	O
secured	O
as	O
hostages	O
for	O
the	O
Chief	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
after	O
some	O
debate	O
resolved	O
to	O
send	O
Webb	O
to	O
inform	O
me	O
of	O
their	O
resolution	O
,	O
to	O
assure	O
me	O
that	O
his	O
companions	O
were	O
safe	O
,	O
and	O
direct	O
me	O
where	O
I	O
might	O
send	O
my	O
answer	O
.	O

Thus	O
it	O
appears	O
that	O
whatever	O
were	O
the	O
disadvantages	O
of	O
seizing	O
the	O
Chiefs	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
never	O
have	O
recovered	O
my	O
men	O
by	O
any	O
other	O
method	O

the	O

were	O
set	O
on	O

from	O
the	O

,	O
those	O
at	O
the	O

set	O
at	O

,	O
after	O
staying	O
with	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
about	O
an	O
hour	O
,	O
they	O
all	O
went	O
away	O

Upon	O
this	O

as	O
they	O
had	O
done	O
upon	O
another	O
of	O

expressed	O
their	O
joy	O
by	O
an	O
undeserved	O
liberality	O
,	O
strongly	O
urging	O
us	O
to	O
accept	O
of	O
four	O
hogs	O

we	O
absolutely	O
refused	O

to	O

the	O

did	O

we	O
found	O
that	O
the	O

a	O

Some	O
canoes	O
very	O
soon	O
came	O

the	O

seemed	O
afraid	O

of	O

that	O
came	O
up	O
to	O

was	O
the	O

Upon	O

earnestly	O
repeated	O
,	O
their	O
Majesties	O
and	O
some	O

came	O
on	O

At	O
first	O
they	O
were	O
struck	O
with	O
astonishment	O
,	O
and	O
wondered	O
at	O
every	O
thing	O
that	O
was	O
shewn	O
them	O
;	O
yet	O
they	O
made	O
no	O
enquiries	O

seeming	O
to	O
be	O
satisfied	O
with	O
what	O
was	O
offered	O
to	O
their	O
notice	O
,	O
they	O
made	O
no	O
search	O
after	O

objects	O
of	O
curiosity	O

with	O
which	O
it	O
was	O
natural	O

suppose	O
a	O
building	O
of	O
such	O

as	O

After	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
they	O
became	O
more	O

I	O
was	O
given	O
to	O
understand	O

that	O
the	O
name	O

that	O
we	O
should	O
exchange	O

To	O
this	O
I	O
readily	O
consented	O

he	O
was	O

set	O

In	O

course	O
of	O
this	O

About	O
five	O

we	O

the	O

that	O

at	O

in	O

landed	O
abreast	O

on	O

finding	O
the	O

I	O
ordered	O

carry	O
us	O
over	O

left	O
the	O

the	O

were	O
assembled	O

they	O
all	O
ran	O
away	O

,	O
we	O
landed	O
,	O
and	O
leaving	O
four	O
boys	O
to	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
the	O
yawl	O

we	O
walked	O
up	O
to	O
some	O

which	O
were	O
about	O
two	O

three	O
hundred	O

from	O

When	O
we	O

four	O

running	O
up	O

would	O

down	O

looked	O
round	O
them	O

in	O
a	O
few	O

renewed	O
the	O
pursuit	O

brandishing	O
their	O

in	O
a	O

the	O

then	O
fired	O
a	O
second	O
musquet	O
over	O
their	O

this	O
they	O
took	O
no	O

lifting	O
up	O
his	O

it	O
at	O
the	O

another	O
piece	O
was	O
fired	O

shot	O
him	O
dead	O

he	O
fell	O

the	O

stood	O
motionless	O
for	O
some	O

as	O

petrified	O
with	O
astonishment	O

as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O

they	O
went	O

them	O
the	O

they	O

the	O

Mr.	O

Tupia	O
was	O
again	O
directed	O
to	O
speak	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
with	O
great	O
pleasure	O
that	O
we	O
perceived	O
he	O
was	O
perfectly	O
understood	O
,	O
he	O
and	O
the	O
natives	O
speaking	O
only	O
different	O
dialects	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
language	O
.	O

He	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
we	O
wanted	O
provision	O
and	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
give	O
them	O
iron	O
in	O
exchange	O
,	O
the	O
properties	O
of	O
which	O
he	O
explained	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
able	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
willing	O
to	O
trade	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
come	O
over	O
to	O
them	O
for	O
that	O
purpose	O
:	O
to	O
this	O
we	O
consented	O
,	O
provided	O
they	O
would	O
lay	O
by	O
their	O
arms	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
be	O
persuaded	O
to	O
do	O
.	O

During	O
this	O
conversation	O
,	O
Tupia	O
warned	O
us	O
to	O
be	O
upon	O
our	O
guard	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
our	O
friends	O
:	O
we	O
then	O
pressed	O
them	O
in	O
our	O
turn	O
to	O
come	O
over	O
to	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
last	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
stripped	O
himself	O
,	O
and	O
swam	O
over	O
without	O
his	O
arms	O
:	O
he	O
was	O
almost	O
immediately	O
followed	O
by	O
two	O
more	O
,	O
and	O
soon	O
after	O
by	O
most	O
of	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
twenty	O
or	O
thirty	O
;	O
but	O
these	O
brought	O
their	O
arms	O
with	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
made	O
them	O
all	O
presents	O
of	O
iron	O
and	O
beads	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
set	O
little	O
value	O
upon	O
either	O
,	O
particularly	O
the	O
iron	O
,	O
not	O
having	O
the	O
least	O
idea	O
of	O
its	O
use	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
got	O
nothing	O
in	O
return	O
but	O
a	O
few	O
feathers	O
:	O
they	O
offered	O
indeed	O
to	O
exchange	O
their	O
arms	O
for	O
ours	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
refused	O
,	O
made	O
many	O
attempts	O
to	O
snatch	O
them	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
hands	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
came	O
over	O
,	O
Tupia	O
repeated	O
his	O
declaration	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
our	O
friends	O
,	O
and	O
again	O
warned	O
us	O
to	O
be	O
upon	O
our	O
guard	O
;	O
their	O
attempts	O
to	O
snatch	O
our	O
weapons	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
did	O
not	O
succeed	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
gave	O
them	O
to	O
understand	O
by	O
Tupia	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
obliged	O
to	O
kill	O
them	O
if	O
they	O
offered	O
any	O
farther	O
violence	O

In	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Green	O
happening	O
to	O
turn	O
about	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
snatched	O
away	O
his	O
hanger	O
,	O
and	O
retiring	O
to	O
a	O
little	O
distance	O
,	O
waved	O
it	O
round	O
his	O
head	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
shout	O
of	O
exultation	O
:	O
the	O
rest	O
now	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
extremely	O
insolent	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
saw	O
more	O
coming	O
to	O
join	O
them	O
from	O
the	O
opposite	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O

It	O
was	O
therefore	O
become	O
necessary	O
to	O
repress	O
them	O

and	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
fired	O
at	O
the	O
man	O
who	O
had	O
taken	O
the	O
hanger	O
with	O
small	O
shot	O

at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
about	O
fifteen	O
yards	O

when	O
the	O
shot	O
struck	O
him	O

he	O
ceased	O
his	O
cry	O
;	O
but	O
instead	O
of	O
returning	O
the	O
hanger	O
,	O
continued	O
to	O
flourish	O
it	O
over	O
his	O
head	O

at	O
the	O

To	O
my	O
great	O
regret	O

I	O
found	O
no	O
place	O

I	O
could	O
land	O

a	O
dangerous	O
surf	O
every	O

beating	O
upon	O

I	O
saw	O
two	O
canoes	O
coming	O
in	O
from	O
the	O
sea	O
,	O
one	O
under	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
worked	O
with	O

I	O
thought	O
this	O
a	O
favourable	O
opportunity	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
into	O
my	O
possession	O
without	O
mischief	O

as	O
those	O
in	O
the	O
canoe	O
were	O
probably	O

without	O

and	O
I	O
had	O
three	O
boats	O
full	O
of	O
men	O

I	O
therefore	O
disposed	O
the	O
boats	O
so	O
as	O
most	O
effectually	O
to	O
intercept	O
them	O
in	O
their	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
shore	O
;	O
the	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
canoe	O
that	O
was	O
paddled	O
perceived	O
us	O
so	O
soon	O

that	O
by	O
making	O
to	O
the	O
nearest	O
land	O
with	O
their	O
utmost	O
strength	O
,	O
they	O
escaped	O
us	O
;	O
the	O
other	O
sailed	O
on	O
till	O
she	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
midst	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
without	O
discerning	O
what	O
we	O
were	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
moment	O
she	O
discovered	O
us	O
,	O
the	O
people	O
on	O
board	O
struck	O
their	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
to	O
their	O
paddles	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
plied	O
so	O
briskly	O
that	O
she	O
out-ran	O
the	O
boat	O

They	O
were	O
however	O
within	O

,	O
and	O
Tupia	O
called	O
out	O
to	O
them	O
to	O
come	O
along	O

and	O
promised	O
for	O
us	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
come	O
to	O
no	O

:	O
they	O
chose	O

however	O
,	O
rather	O
to	O
trust	O
to	O
their	O
paddles	O
than	O
our	O
promises	O
,	O
and	O
continued	O
to	O
make	O
from	O
us	O
with	O
all	O
their	O
power	O
.	O

I	O
then	O
ordered	O
a	O
musquet	O
to	O
be	O
fired	O
over	O
their	O
heads	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
least	O
exceptionable	O
expedient	O
to	O
accomplish	O
my	O
design	O
,	O
hoping	O
it	O
would	O
either	O
make	O
them	O
surrender	O
or	O
leap	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
.	O

Upon	O
the	O
discharge	O
of	O
the	O
piece	O
,	O
they	O
ceased	O
paddling	O
;	O
and	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
being	O
seven	O
in	O
number	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
strip	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
imagined	O
to	O
jump	O
overboard	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
happened	O
otherwise	O
.	O

They	O
immediately	O
formed	O
a	O
resolution	O
not	O
to	O
fly	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
fight	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
the	O
boat	O
came	O
up	O
,	O
they	O
began	O
the	O
attack	O
with	O
their	O
paddles	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
stones	O
and	O
other	O
offensive	O
weapons	O
that	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
so	O
vigorously	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
fire	O
upon	O
them	O
in	O
our	O
own	O
defence	O
:	O
four	O
were	O
unhappily	O
killed	O

the	O
other	O
three	O

were	O

eldest	O
about	O
nineteen	O

and	O
the	O

about	O
eleven	O

the	O
eldest	O
swam	O
with	O
great	O
vigour	O

resisted	O
the	O
attempts	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
to	O
take	O
him	O
into	O
the	O
boat	O
by	O
every	O
effort	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
make	O
:	O
he	O
was	O
however	O
at	O
last	O
overpowered	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
were	O
taken	O
up	O
with	O
less	O
difficulty	O
.	O

I	O
am	O
conscious	O
that	O
the	O
feeling	O
of	O
every	O
reader	O
of	O
humanity	O
will	O
censure	O
me	O
for	O
having	O
fired	O
upon	O
these	O
unhappy	O
people	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
impossible	O
that	O
,	O
upon	O
a	O
calm	O
review	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
approve	O
it	O
myself	O

certainly	O
did	O
not	O
deserve	O

they	O
had	O
apprehended	O
no	O

the	O
nature	O
of	O
my	O

me	O
to	O
obtain	O
a	O
knowlege	O
of	O
their	O

which	O
I	O
could	O
no	O

my	O
way	O

or	O
gaining	O
admission	O
through	O
the	O
confidence	O

good-will	O
of	O
the	O

I	O
had	O
already	O
tried	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
presents	O
without	O

and	O
I	O
was	O
now	O
prompted	O

by	O
my	O
desire	O

avoid	O
further	O
hostilities	O

to	O
get	O
some	O
of	O

not	O

cheerful	O

their	O
cheerfulness	O
was	O
encouraged	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
sung	O
a	O
song	O
with	O
a	O
degree	O
of	O
taste	O
that	O
surprised	O
us	O
:	O
the	O
tune	O
was	O
solemn	O

slow	O

of	O
our	O

In	O

they	O
all	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
cheerful	O

eat	O

we	O

that	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
disappointment	O

I	O
hoped	O
the	O
report	O

procure	O

Mr.	O

upon	O

with	O
the	O

crossing	O

at	O

to	O
be	O
unwilling	O
to	O
leave	O
us	O
;	O
but	O
at	O
length	O
they	O
suddenly	O
changed	O
their	O
mind	O

,	O
though	O
not	O
without	O
a	O
manifest	O
struggle	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
tears	O
,	O
they	O
took	O
their	O
leave	O
:	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
gone	O
,	O
we	O
proceeded	O
along	O
a	O
swamp	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
design	O
to	O
shoot	O
some	O
ducks	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
saw	O
great	O
plenty	O
,	O
and	O
four	O
of	O
the	O
marines	O
attended	O
us	O
,	O
walking	O
abreast	O
of	O
us	O
upon	O
a	O
bank	O
that	O
overlooked	O
the	O
country	O

After	O
we	O
had	O
advanced	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
,	O
these	O
men	O
called	O
out	O
to	O
us	O
and	O
told	O
us	O

that	O
a	O
large	O

of	O
the	O
Indians	O
was	O
in	O
sight	O

advancing	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
rate	O

Upon	O
receiving	O
this	O
intelligence	O
,	O
*	O
we	O
drew	O
together	O

and	O
resolved	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
our	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
boats	O
;	O
we	O
had	O
scarcely	O
begun	O
to	O
put	O
this	O
into	O
execution	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
three	O
Indian	O
boys	O
started	O
suddenly	O
from	O
some	O
bushes	O
,	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
concealed	O
themselves	O
,	O
and	O
again	O
claimed	O
our	O
protection	O
:	O
we	O
readily	O
received	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
repairing	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O
as	O
the	O
clearest	O
place	O
,	O
we	O
walked	O
briskly	O
towards	O
the	O
boats	O
.	O

The	O
Indians	O
were	O
in	O
two	O
bodies	O
;	O
one	O
ran	O
along	O
the	O
bank	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
quitted	O
by	O
the	O
marines	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
fetched	O
a	O
compass	O
by	O
the	O
swamp	O
so	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
see	O
them	O
:	O
when	O
they	O
perceived	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
formed	O
into	O
one	O
body	O
,	O
they	O
slackened	O
their	O
pace	O
;	O
but	O
still	O
followed	O
us	O
in	O
a	O
gentle	O
walk	O
:	O
that	O
they	O
slackened	O
their	O
pace	O
,	O
was	O
for	O
us	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
a	O
fortunate	O
circumstance	O
;	O
for	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
expected	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
boats	O
that	O
were	O
to	O
carry	O
us	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
wooders	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
the	O
pinnace	O
at	O
least	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
her	O
station	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
sent	O
to	O
pick	O
up	O
a	O
bird	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
shot	O
by	O
the	O
officer	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
little	O
boat	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
make	O
three	O
trips	O
before	O
we	O
could	O
all	O
get	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
party	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
drawn	O
up	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
,	O
the	O
Indians	O
came	O
down	O
,	O
not	O
in	O
a	O
body	O
as	O
we	O
expected	O
,	O
but	O
by	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
,	O
all	O
armed	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
their	O
number	O
increased	O
to	O
about	O
two	O
hundred	O
:	O
as	O
we	O
now	O
despaired	O
of	O
making	O
peace	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
seeing	O
that	O
the	O
dread	O
of	O
our	O
small	O
arms	O
did	O
not	O
keep	O
them	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
too	O
far	O
off	O
to	O
reach	O
the	O
place	O
with	O
a	O
shot	O
,	O
we	O
resolved	O
to	O
re-imbark	O
,	O
lest	O
our	O
stay	O
should	O
imbroil	O
us	O
in	O
another	O
quarrel	O
,	O
and	O
cost	O
more	O
of	O
the	O
Indians	O
their	O
lives	O
.	O

We	O
therefore	O
advanced	O
towards	O
the	O
pinnace	O
which	O
was	O
now	O
returning	O
,	O
when	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
boys	O
suddenly	O
cried	O
out	O
,	O
that	O
his	O
uncle	O
was	O
among	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
had	O
marched	O
down	O
to	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
us	O
to	O
stay	O
and	O
talk	O
with	O
them	O
:	O
we	O
complied	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
parley	O
immediately	O
commenced	O
between	O
them	O
and	O
Tupia	O
;	O
*	O
during	O
which	O
the	O
boys	O
held	O
up	O
every	O

we	O
had	O
given	O
them	O
as	O
tokens	O
of	O
our	O
kindness	O
and	O
liberality	O
;	O
but	O
neither	O
would	O
either	O
of	O
the	O

swim	O
over	O
to	O
them	O

any	O

the	O
beach	O

the	O

seeing	O
it	O
lie	O
very	O
near	O

went	O
up	O
to	O
it	O

covered	O
it	O
with	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
clothes	O
that	O

given	O
them	O
;	O

soon	O

a	O

man	O

the	O

of	O

the	O
youngest	O
of	O
the	O
boys	O

swam	O
over	O
to	O
us	O

bringing	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
a	O
green	O
branch	O

which	O
we	O
supposed	O

as	O
well	O
here	O
as	O
at	O
Otaheite	PNM
,	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
emblem	O

We	O
received	O
his	O
branch	O
by	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
Tupia	PNM
,	O
to	O
whom	O
he	O
gave	O
it	O

made	O
him	O
many	O
presents	O

we	O
also	O
invited	O
him	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
board	O
the	O
ship	O

but	O
he	O
declined	O
it	O
;	O
we	O
therefore	O
left	O
him	O

and	O
expected	O
that	O
his	O
nephew	O

and	O
the	O
two	O
other	O
young	O
Indians	O
would	O
have	O
staid	O
with	O
him	O

but	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
surprize	O

they	O
chose	O
rather	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
us	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
retired	O
,	O
he	O
went	O
and	O
gathered	O
another	O
green	O
branch	O

and	O
with	O
this	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O

he	O
approached	O
the	O

with	O

this	O
was	O

returned	O

down	O
upon	O
the	O
sand	O
to	O

round	O
him	O

continued	O
in	O

was	O
sixty-eight	O

five	O

three	O

a	O

three	O

that	O

were	O
not	O

squared	O
so	O

no	O

The	O

November	O
,	O
*	O
we	O
counted	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
five	O
and	O
forty	O
canoes	O
that	O
were	O
coming	O
from	O
the	O
shore	O

the	O
ship	O

seven	O
of	O

came	O
up	O
with	O
us	O

after	O
some	O

with	O

sold	O

some	O

were	O

some	O

came	O
off	O

who	O
began	O
also	O
to	O
trade	O
fairly	O
;	O
but	O
after	O
some	O
time	O
they	O
took	O
what	O
was	O

down	O
to	O
them	O

without	O
making	O
any	O
return	O

one	O
of	O
them	O
who	O
had	O
done	O
so	O
,	O
upon	O
being	O

,	O
began	O
to	O
laugh	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
many	O
marks	O
of	O
derision	O
set	O
us	O
at	O
defiance	O

at	O
the	O

time	O
putting	O
off	O
the	O
canoe	O
from	O
the	O
ship	O
:	O
a	O
musquet	O
was	O
then	O
fired	O
over	O
his	O
head	O
,	O
which	O
brought	O
him	O
back	O
in	O
a	O
more	O
serious	O
mood	O
,	O
and	O
trade	O
went	O
on	O
with	O
great	O
regularity	O

At	O

the	O
cabbin	O

was	O
not	O
taken	O
to	O

had	O
been	O
taken	O
before	O

that	O
the	O

grew	O

stolen	O

dropped	O

all	O
set	O
up	O
their	O
song	O

I	O
was	O

I	O
thought	O
their	O

were	O

About	O
two	O
in	O
the	O

we	O
saw	O
a	O
pretty	O
high	O
island	O
bearing	O
west	O
from	O

and	O
at	O
five	O
,	O
saw	O
more	O

to	O

We	O
hauled	O

without	O
them	O

but	O
could	O
not	O

I	O

up	O

this	O

we	O

we	O
were	O

that	O

only	O
two	O

When	O

we	O
laid	O
down	O

which	O
grew	O
here	O

after	O

some	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
hide	O
themselves	O
in	O
a	O
cave	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
rocks	O
,	O
we	O
therefore	O
went	O
towards	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
when	O
an	O
old	O
Indian	O
,	O
who	O
proved	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
Chief	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
presented	O
with	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
broad	O
cloth	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O

came	O
out	O
with	O
his	O
wife	O

his	O
brother	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
supplicating	O
posture	O
put	O
themselves	O
under	O

We	O
spoke	O
kindly	O
to	O
them	O

and	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
then	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
he	O

another	O

one	O
of	O
those	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
wounded	O
by	O
the	O
small	O

and	O
enquired	O
with	O
much	O
solicitude	O
and	O
concern	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
die	O
.	O

We	O
assured	O
him	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
put	O
into	O
his	O
hand	O
both	O
a	O
musket	O
ball	O
and	O
some	O
small	O

telling	O
him	O

that	O
those	O
only	O
who	O
were	O
wounded	O
with	O
the	O
ball	O
would	O
die	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
others	O
would	O
recover	O
;	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
assuring	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
attacked	O
again	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
certainly	O
defend	O
ourselves	O
with	O
the	O
ball	O

which	O
would	O
wound	O
them	O
mortally	O

now	O
taken	O

down	O

us	O

as	O

up	O

told	O
us	O

that	O
one	O
of	O

men	O
who	O
had	O
been	O

upon	O

was	O
dead	O
;	O

to	O
my	O
great	O
comfort	O
I	O
afterwards	O
discovered	O
that	O
this	O

was	O
not	O
true	O

and	O
that	O
if	O
Topāa	O
's	O

were	O
taken	O

they	O
would	O
frequently	O
lead	O
us	O

Mr.	O
Banks	O

Dr.	O
Solander	O
were	O
several	O

during	O
the	O
last	O
two	O

three	O
days	O
,	O
not	O
without	O
success	O

greatly	O
circumscribed	O
in	O
their	O
walks	O
by	O
climbers	O
of	O
a	O
most	O
luxuriant	O
growth	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
so	O
interwoven	O
together	O

fill	O
up	O

The	O

several	O

islands	O

I	O
had	O
set	O
off	O
the	O

points	O
for	O
my	O
survey	O
,	O
I	O
erected	O
another	O
pile	O

I	O
left	O

I	O
made	O
a	O
visit	O
to	O
several	O

it	O

a	O

had	O
already	O

no	O

it	O
must	O

be	O
confessed	O

that	O
Roggewein	O

about	O

we	O
stood	O

of	O

by	O

stone	O
was	O

thrown	O

struck	O
the	O

upon	O

he	O
immediately	O
ran	O
to	O
one	O
of	O

which	O
was	O
distant	O
about	O

hundred	O
yards	O

I	O
now	O
hoped	O
that	O
our	O
contest	O
was	O
over	O

we	O
immediately	O
landed	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
had	O
scarcely	O
left	O
the	O
boat	O
when	O
he	O
returned	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
then	O
perceived	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
left	O
the	O
rock	O
only	O
to	O
fetch	O
a	O
shield	O
or	O
target	O
for	O
his	O
defence	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O
came	O
up	O

he	O
threw	O
a	O
lance	O
at	O
us	O

his	O

fell	O

threw	O
another	O

both	O
immediately	O
ran	O
away	O

if	O

might	O

taken	O
one	O
of	O

Mr.	O

suggesting	O
that	O

thought	O
it	O

repaired	O

had	O
hidden	O
themselves	O
behind	O
a	O
shield	O

some	O
bark	O

peeped	O
at	O

left	O
them	O

retreat	O

without	O
their	O
knowing	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
discovered	O

we	O
threw	O
into	O

went	O
away	O
some	O
beads	O

pieces	O

the	O

away	O
with	O
us	O

to	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
about	O
fifty	O

were	O
from	O

was	O
pointed	O

very	O

favoured	O

opinion	O

discovered	O
that	O
it	O
was	O

appeared	O

by	O
the	O
sea-weed	O

Upon	O
examining	O
the	O
canoes	O
that	O
lay	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O

we	O
found	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
worst	O

had	O
ever	O
seen	O

they	O
were	O
between	O

Mr.	O

myself	O

seven	O

properly	O

out	O

to	O
the	O
huts	O

near	O
the	O

whither	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
continued	O
every	O
day	O
to	O
resort	O
;	O
and	O
though	O
the	O
little	O
presents	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
left	O
there	O
before	O
had	O
not	O
yet	O
been	O
taken	O
away	O
,	O
we	O
left	O
others	O
of	O
somewhat	O
more	O
value	O
,	O
consisting	O
of	O
cloth	O
,	O
looking-glasses	O
,	O
combs	O
,	O
and	O
beads	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
went	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
the	O
soil	O
to	O
be	O
either	O
swamp	O
or	O
light	O
sand	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
finely	O
diversified	O
by	O
wood	O
and	O
lawn	O
.	O

The	O
trees	O
are	O
tall	O
,	O
strait	O
,	O
and	O
without	O
underwood	O
,	O
standing	O
at	O
such	O
a	O
distance	O
from	O
each	O
other	O
that	O
the	O
whole	O
country	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
where	O
the	O
swamps	O
do	O
not	O
render	O
it	O
incapable	O
of	O
cultivation	O
,	O
might	O
be	O
cultivated	O
without	O
cutting	O
down	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
:	O
between	O
the	O
trees	O
the	O
ground	O
is	O
covered	O
with	O
grass	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
there	O
is	O
great	O
abundance	O
,	O
growing	O
in	O
tufts	O
about	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
can	O
well	O
be	O
grasped	O
in	O
the	O
hand	O
,	O
which	O
stand	O
very	O
close	O
to	O
each	O
other	O
.	O

We	O
saw	O
many	O
houses	O
of	O
the	O
inhabitants	O
,	O
and	O
places	O
where	O
they	O
had	O
slept	O
upon	O
the	O
grass	O
without	O
any	O
shelter	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
saw	O
only	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
who	O
the	O
moment	O
he	O
discovered	O
us	O
ran	O
away	O
.	O

At	O
all	O
these	O
places	O
we	O
left	O
presents	O
,	O
hoping	O
that	O
at	O
length	O
they	O
might	O
produce	O
confidence	O
and	O
good-will	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
transient	O
and	O
imperfect	O
view	O
of	O
a	O
quadruped	O
about	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
a	O
rabbit	O
:	O
*	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
's	O
greyhound	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
got	O
sight	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
probably	O
have	O
caught	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
moment	O
he	O
set	O
off	O
he	O
lamed	O
himself	O
,	O
against	O
a	O
stump	O
which	O
lay	O
concealed	O
in	O
the	O
long	O
grass	O
.	O

We	O
afterwards	O
saw	O
the	O
dung	O
of	O
an	O
animal	O
which	O
fed	O
upon	O
grass	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
we	O
judged	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
less	O
than	O
a	O
deer	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
footsteps	O
of	O
another	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
clawed	O
like	O
a	O
dog	O
,	O
and	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
about	O
as	O
big	O
as	O
a	O
wolf	O
:	O
we	O
also	O
tracked	O
a	O
small	O
animal	O
,	O
whose	O
foot	O
resembled	O
that	O
of	O
a	O
polcat	O
or	O
weasel	O
.	O

The	O
trees	O
over	O
our	O
head	O
abounded	O
with	O
birds	O
of	O
various	O
kinds	O
,	O
among	O
which	O
were	O
many	O
of	O
exquisite	O
beauty	O
,	O
particularly	O
loriquets	O
and	O
cockatoos	O
,	O
which	O
flew	O
in	O
flocks	O
of	O
several	O
scores	O
together	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
some	O
wood	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
felled	O
by	O
the	O
natives	O
with	O
a	O
blunt	O
instrument	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
barked	O
.	O

The	O
trees	O
were	O
not	O
of	O
many	O
species	O
;	O
among	O
others	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
large	O
one	O
which	O
yielded	O
a	O
gum	O
not	O
unlike	O
the	O
Sanguis	O
draconis	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
steps	O
had	O
been	O
cut	O
at	O
about	O
three	O
feet	O
distance	O
from	O
each	O
other	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
convenience	O
of	O
climbing	O
them	O

three	O

four	O

oysters	O

went	O
ashore	O

boat	O

out	O

In	O
his	O

he	O
fell	O
in	O

a	O
body	O

faced	O
about	O

went	O
on	O

came	O
in	O

Mr.	O
Monkhouse	O

two	O

it	O

Mr.	O

the	O

that	O
we	O
were	O
neither	O
afraid	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
nor	O
intended	O
them	O
any	O
mischief	O

we	O
advanced	O
towards	O
them	O

making	O
signs	O
of	O
expostulation	O
and	O
entreaty	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
persuaded	O
to	O
wait	O
till	O
we	O
could	O
come	O
up	O
.	O

Mr.	O
Gore	O
told	O
us	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
seen	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
up	O
the	O
bay	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
invited	O
him	O
by	O
signs	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
shore	O

which	O
he	O
,	O
certainly	O
with	O
great	O
prudence	O
,	O
declined	O

The	O
morning	O
of	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
was	O
so	O
rainy	O
,	O
*	O
that	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
glad	O
to	O
stay	O
on	O
board	O

In	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
it	O
cleared	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
made	O
another	O
excursion	O
along	O
the	O
sea-coast	O
to	O
the	O
southward	O
:	O
we	O
went	O
ashore	O
,	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
and	O
Dr.	O
Solander	O
gathered	O
many	O
plants	O
;	O
but	O
besides	O
these	O
we	O
saw	O
nothing	O
worthy	O
of	O
notice	O
.	O

At	O
our	O
first	O
entering	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
*	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
three	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
who	O
instantly	O
ran	O
away	O
:	O
more	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
seen	O
by	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
all	O
disappeared	O
,	O
with	O
great	O
precipitation	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
found	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
discovered	O

By	O
the	O
boldness	O
of	O
these	O
people	O
at	O
our	O
first	O
landing	O

the	O
terror	O
that	O
seized	O
them	O
at	O
the	O
sight	O
of	O
us	O
afterwards	O
,	O
it	O
appears	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
sufficiently	O
intimidated	O
by	O
our	O
fire-arms	O
:	O
not	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
any	O
reason	O
to	O
think	O
the	O
people	O
much	O
hurt	O
by	O
the	O
small-shot	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
fire	O
at	O
them	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
attacked	O
us	O
at	O
our	O
coming	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
had	O
probably	O
seen	O
the	O
effects	O
of	O
them	O

from	O
their	O
lurking	O
places	O

upon	O
the	O

Tupia	O

who	O
was	O
now	O

a	O
good	O
marksman	O
,	O
frequently	O
strayed	O
from	O
us	O
to	O
shoot	O
parrots	O
;	O
and	O
he	O
had	O
told	O
us	O

that	O
while	O
he	O
was	O
thus	O
employed	O

he	O
had	O
once	O
met	O
with	O
nine	O
Indians	O
,	O
who	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
perceived	O

them	O

The	O
next	O

twelve	O
canoes	O
,	O
in	O
each	O
of	O
which	O
was	O
a	O

Indian	O
,	O
came	O
towards	O
the	O

and	O
were	O
within	O
half	O
a	O
mile	O
of	O
it	O
a	O
considerable	O
time	O
:	O
they	O
were	O
employed	O
in	O
striking	O
fish	O

upon	O
which	O
,	O
like	O
others	O
that	O
we	O
had	O

before	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
so	O
intent	O
that	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
regard	O
nothing	O
else	O

It	O
happened	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
that	O
a	O
party	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
were	O
out	O
a	O
shooting	O
near	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
,	O
whose	O
curiosity	O
might	O
at	O
length	O
perhaps	O
be	O
roused	O
by	O
the	O
report	O
of	O
the	O
fowling-pieces	O
,	O
was	O
observed	O
by	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
to	O
haul	O
up	O
his	O
canoe	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
and	O
go	O
towards	O
the	O
shooting	O
party	O
:	O
in	O
something	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O
hour	O
he	O
returned	O

launched	O
his	O
canoe	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
off	O
in	O
her	O
to	O
his	O
companions	O
.	O

This	O
incident	O
makes	O
it	O
probable	O
that	O
the	O
natives	O
acquired	O
a	O
knowlege	O
of	O
the	O
destructive	O
power	O
of	O

While	O
Mr.	O

was	O
gathering	O

near	O
the	O

,	O
I	O
went	O
with	O
Dr.	O
Solander	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Monkhouse	O
to	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
the	O
bay	O

that	O
I	O
might	O
examine	O
that	O
part	O

the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
make	O
farther	O
attempts	O
to	O
form	O
some	O
connection	O
with	O
the	O
natives	O
.	O

In	O
our	O
way	O
we	O
met	O
with	O
eleven	O
or	O
twelve	O
small	O
canoes	O
,	O
with	O
each	O
a	O
man	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
probably	O
the	O
same	O
that	O
were	O
afterwards	O
abreast	O
of	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
who	O
all	O
made	O
into	O
shoal	O
water	O
upon	O
our	O
approach	O
.	O

We	O
met	O
other	O
Indians	O
on	O
shore	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
we	O
landed	O
,	O
who	O
instantly	O
took	O
to	O
their	O
canoes	O
,	O
and	O
paddled	O
away	O
.	O

We	O
went	O
up	O
the	O
country	O
to	O
some	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
it	O
nearly	O
the	O
same	O
with	O
that	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
described	O
already	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
soil	O
was	O
much	O
richer	O
;	O
for	O
instead	O
of	O
sand	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
deep	O
black	O
mould	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
thought	O
very	O
fit	O
for	O
the	O
production	O
of	O
grain	O
of	O
any	O
kind	O
.	O

In	O
the	O
woods	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
tree	O
which	O
bore	O
fruit	O
that	O
in	O
colour	O
and	O
shape	O
resembled	O
a	O
cherry	O
;	O
the	O
juice	O
had	O
an	O
agreeable	O
tartness	O
,	O
though	O
but	O
little	O
flavour	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
also	O
interspersed	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
finest	O
meadows	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
:	O
some	O
places	O
however	O
were	O
rocky	O
,	O
but	O
these	O
were	O
comparatively	O
few	O
:	O
the	O
stone	O
is	O
sandy	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
be	O
used	O
with	O
advantage	O
for	O
building	O
.	O

When	O
we	O
returned	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
some	O
smoke	O
upon	O
another	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
coast	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
thither	O
in	O
hopes	O
of	O
meeting	O
with	O
the	O
people	O
,	O
but	O
at	O
our	O
approach	O
,	O
these	O
also	O
ran	O
away	O

We	O
found	O
six	O
small	O
canoes	O
,	O
and	O
six	O
fires	O
very	O
near	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
muscles	O
roasting	O
upon	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
few	O
oysters	O
lying	O
near	O
:	O
by	O
this	O
we	O
judged	O
that	O
there	O
had	O
been	O
one	O
man	O
in	O
each	O
canoe	O
,	O
who	O
having	O
picked	O
up	O
some	O
shell-fish	O
were	O
come	O
ashore	O
to	O
eat	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
each	O
had	O
made	O
his	O
separate	O
fire	O
for	O
that	O
purpose	O
;	O
we	O
tasted	O
of	O
their	O
cheer	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
them	O
in	O
return	O
some	O
strings	O
of	O
beads	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
things	O
which	O
we	O
thought	O
would	O
please	O
them	O

At	O
the	O
foot	O
of	O
a	O
tree	O
in	O
this	O

we	O
found	O
a	O

well	O
of	O

by	O
a	O
spring	O
;	O

the	O
day	O

ship	O

Mr.	O

made	O
a	O
little	O

with	O

found	O
such	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
quails	O

resembling	O
those	O
in	O

,	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
shot	O
as	O
many	O
as	O
he	O
pleased	O

his	O
object	O
was	O
variety	O

The	O

morning	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
wind	O
would	O
not	O

me	O
to	O

I	O
sent	O
out	O
several	O

try	O
again	O

a	O

His	O

as	O

out	O
of	O
a	O

observed	O
six	O

standing	O
together	O

at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
about	O
fifty	O
yards	O

One	O
of	O

pronounced	O

which	O
was	O
supposed	O
to	O

a	O
signal	O

for	O
a	O

at	O
him	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
wood	O

very	O
narrowly	O
missed	O
him	O

When	O
the	O
Indians	O
saw	O
that	O
the	O
weapon	O

not	O

they	O
ran	O
away	O

nineteen	O

twenty	O

come	O
down	O

Mr.	O

up	O

laying	O
the	O

ashore	O

and	O
cleaning	O
her	O

I	O
therefore	O
landed	O

in	O
search	O
of	O
a	O

purpose	O

and	O
was	O
accompanied	O
by	O
Mr.	O

Dr.	O
Solander	O

We	O
found	O
walking	O
here	O
exceedingly	O
troublesome	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
ground	O
was	O
covered	O
with	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
grass	O

the	O
seeds	O
of	O
which	O
were	O
very	O
sharp	O

bearded	O
backwards	O

so	O
that	O
whenever	O
they	O
stuck	O
into	O
our	O
clothes	O

which	O
indeed	O
was	O
at	O
every	O
step	O

they	O
worked	O
forwards	O
by	O

of	O
the	O

till	O
they	O
got	O
at	O
the	O
flesh	O

at	O
the	O

time	O
we	O
were	O
surrounded	O
by	O

cloud	O
of	O

,	O
which	O
incessantly	O
tormented	O
us	O

We	O
soon	O
met	O
with	O
several	O
places	O
where	O
the	O

might	O
conveniently	O
be	O
laid	O
ashore	O
;	O
but	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
disappointment	O
we	O
could	O
find	O
no	O
fresh	O
water	O

We	O
proceeded	O
however	O
up	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
where	O
we	O
found	O
gum	O
trees	O
like	O
those	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
observed	O
that	O
here	O
also	O
the	O
gum	O
was	O
in	O
very	O

Upon	O
the	O
branches	O

some	O

But	O
upon	O
another	O

of	O
the	O

we	O
found	O
a	O
small	O

perforated	O
all	O

as	O
those	O
that	O
were	O

We	O
found	O
also	O
an	O
incredible	O
number	O
of	O
butterflies	O

so	O
that	O
for	O
the	O
space	O
of	O
three	O

four	O

the	O

was	O
so	O

were	O
to	O

was	O
covered	O
with	O

that	O

not	O
upon	O

We	O
found	O
here	O
also	O
a	O
small	O
fish	O
of	O
a	O
singular	O

;	O
it	O
was	O
about	O

had	O
two	O

it	O
in	O

it	O
might	O

it	O
did	O
not	O

by	O
the	O

At	O
sun-rise	O
I	O
went	O
ashore	O
,	O
and	O
climbing	O
a	O
considerable	O
hill	O
,	O
I	O
took	O
a	O
view	O
of	O

the	O
islands	O
that	O
lie	O
off	O

having	O
an	O
azimuth	O

with	O
me	O
for	O
that	O
purpose	O
;	O

I	O
observed	O
that	O
the	O
needle	O
differed	O
very	O
considerably	O
in	O
its	O
position	O

even	O
to	O
thirty	O

in	O
some	O

once	O
I	O
found	O
it	O
differ	O
from	O
itself	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
two	O
points	O
in	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
fourteen	O
feet	O

I	O
took	O
up	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
loose	O
stones	O
that	O
lay	O
upon	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
and	O
applied	O
them	O
to	O
the	O
needle	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
produced	O
no	O
effect	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
therefore	O
concluded	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
iron	O
ore	O
in	O
the	O
hills	O

of	O
which	O
I	O
had	O

I	O
proceeded	O
with	O

I	O
set	O
out	O
with	O
the	O
first	O
of	O
the	O

and	O
long	O
before	O
high-water	O
I	O
had	O
advanced	O
above	O
eight	O

Its	O
breadth	O
thus	O

was	O

upon	O
a	O

by	O

but	O
here	O
it	O
opened	O

formed	O
a	O

which	O
to	O
the	O
N.	O
W.	O
communicated	O
with	O
the	O
sea	O

and	O
I	O
not	O
only	O
saw	O
the	O
sea	O
in	O
this	O

but	O
found	O
the	O
tide	O
of	O
flood	O
coming	O
strongly	O
in	O
from	O
that	O
point	O
:	O
I	O
also	O
observed	O
an	O
arm	O
of	O
this	O
lake	O
extending	O
to	O
the	O
eastward	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
improbable	O
that	O
it	O
may	O

On	O
the	O

side	O
of	O
the	O
lake	O
is	O
a	O
ridge	O
of	O
high	O

which	O
I	O
was	O
very	O

it	O
being	O
high-water	O

and	O
the	O
day	O
far	O
spent	O

I	O
was	O
afraid	O
of	O
being	O
bewildered	O
among	O
the	O
shoals	O
in	O
the	O
night	O

especially	O
as	O
the	O

I	O
made	O
the	O

of	O
my	O
way	O
to	O
the	O

performed	O
it	O
in	O
this	O
manner	O
:	O
He	O
took	O
a	O
lower	O

a	O
large	O
quantity	O

it	O
was	O
not	O

little	O

its	O

into	O

we	O
naturally	O
enquired	O
in	O
what	O

his	O

down	O

in	O
the	O

I	O
sent	O
a	O

of	O
men	O

under	O
the	O
direction	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Gore	O
,	O
in	O
search	O
of	O
refreshments	O
for	O
the	O

this	O

returned	O
about	O
noon	O
with	O
a	O
few	O
palm	O
cabbages	O

and	O
a	O
bunch	O
or	O
two	O

the	O

walking	O
this	O

at	O
a	O

in	O
size	O

shape	O
very	O
much	O
resembling	O
a	O
greyhound	O
;	O
it	O
had	O
a	O
long	O
tail	O
also	O
,	O
which	O
it	O
carried	O
like	O
a	O
greyhound	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
taken	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
wild	O
dog	O
,	O
if	O
instead	O
of	O
running	O
,	O
it	O
had	O
not	O
leapt	O
like	O
a	O
hare	O
or	O
deer	O
:	O
its	O
legs	O
were	O
said	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
slender	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
print	O
of	O
its	O
foot	O
to	O
be	O
like	O
that	O
of	O
a	O
goat	O
;	O
but	O
where	O
I	O
saw	O
it	O
the	O
grass	O
was	O
so	O
high	O
that	O
the	O
legs	O
were	O
concealed	O

and	O
the	O
ground	O
was	O
too	O
hard	O
to	O
receive	O
the	O
track	O

Mr.	O
Banks	O
also	O
had	O
an	O
imperfect	O
view	O
of	O
this	O
animal	O

was	O
of	O
opinion	O
that	O
its	O
species	O
was	O
hitherto	O
unknown	O

ashore	O

all	O
the	O

that	O

backwards	O

so	O
that	O
although	O
she	O
was	O
dry	O
forward	O
,	O
she	O
had	O
nine	O
feet	O
water	O
abaft	O

as	O
in	O
this	O

therefore	O
her	O
bottom	O
could	O
not	O

examined	O
on	O

I	O
took	O
the	O

out	O

all	O

that	O

no	O

The	O
loss	O
of	O
her	O

a	O

Mr.	O

an	O

Having	O
proceeded	O
about	O
three	O

among	O
swamps	O

,	O
they	O
went	O
up	O
into	O
the	O

they	O
found	O
to	O
differ	O

little	O
from	O
what	O
they	O

before	O
:	O
they	O
pursued	O
their	O
course	O
therefore	O
up	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
at	O
length	O
was	O
contracted	O
into	O
a	O
narrow	O
channel	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
bounded	O
,	O
not	O
by	O
swamps	O
and	O
mangroves	O
,	O
but	O
by	O
steep	O
banks	O

that	O
were	O

with	O
trees	O

a	O

among	O
which	O
was	O
that	O
which	O
in	O
the	O

called	O
Mohoe	O

the	O
bark	O
tree	O

tiliaceus	O
;	O
the	O

within	O
was	O
in	O
general	O
low	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
thick	O
covering	O
of	O
long	O
grass	O
:	O
the	O
soil	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
such	O
as	O
promised	O
great	O
fertility	O

to	O
any	O
who	O
should	O
plant	O
and	O
improve	O
it	O

In	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
,	O
Tupia	O
saw	O
an	O
animal	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
by	O
his	O
description	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
judged	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
wolf	O
:	O
they	O
also	O
saw	O
three	O
other	O
animals	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
neither	O
catch	O
nor	O
kill	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
bat	O
,	O
as	O
large	O
as	O
a	O
partridge	O
,	O
but	O
this	O
also	O
eluded	O
all	O
their	O
diligence	O
and	O
skill	O
.	O

At	O
night	O
,	O
they	O
took	O
up	O
their	O
lodging	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
banks	O
of	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
and	O
made	O
a	O
fire	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
musquitos	O
swarmed	O
about	O
them	O
in	O
such	O
numbers	O
,	O
that	O
their	O
quarters	O
were	O
almost	O
untenable	O
;	O
they	O
followed	O
them	O
into	O
the	O
smoke	O
,	O
and	O
almost	O
into	O
the	O
fire	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
hot	O
as	O
the	O
climate	O
was	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
better	O
endure	O
than	O
the	O
stings	O
of	O
these	O
insects	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
an	O
intolerable	O
torment	O
.	O

The	O
fire	O
,	O
the	O
flies	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
a	O
better	O
bed	O
than	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
rendered	O
the	O
night	O
extremely	O
uncomfortable	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
passed	O
it	O
not	O
in	O
sleep	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
restless	O
wishes	O
for	O
the	O
return	O
of	O
day	O
.	O

With	O
the	O
first	O
dawn	O
they	O
set	O
out	O
in	O
search	O
of	O
game	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
walk	O
of	O
many	O
miles	O
,	O
they	O
saw	O
four	O
animals	O
of	O
the	O

kind	O
,	O
two	O
of	O
which	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
's	O
greyhound	O
fairly	O
chaced	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
threw	O
him	O
out	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
,	O
by	O
leaping	O
over	O
the	O
long	O
thick	O
grass	O
,	O
which	O
prevented	O
his	O
running	O
:	O
this	O
animal	O
was	O
observed	O
not	O
to	O
run	O
upon	O
four	O
legs	O
,	O
but	O
to	O
bound	O
or	O
hop	O
forward	O
upon	O
two	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
Jerbua	PNM
,	O
or	O
Mus	O
Jaculus	O
.	O

About	O
noon	O
,	O
they	O
returned	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
again	O
proceeded	O
up	O
the	O
river	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
soon	O
contracted	O
into	O
a	O
fresh	O
water	O
brook	O
,	O
where	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
the	O
tide	O
rose	O
to	O
a	O
considerable	O
height	O
:	O
as	O
evening	O
approached	O
,	O
it	O
became	O
low	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
then	O
so	O
shallow	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
and	O
drag	O
her	O
along	O
,	O
till	O
they	O
could	O
find	O
a	O
place	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
might	O
,	O
*	O
with	O
some	O
hope	O
of	O
rest	O
,	O
pass	O
the	O
night	O
.	O

Such	O
a	O
place	O
at	O

offered	O

and	O
while	O
they	O
were	O
getting	O
the	O
things	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
they	O
observed	O
a	O
smoke	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
about	O
a	O
furlong	O
:	O
as	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
doubt	O

that	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
with	O
whom	O
they	O
had	O
so	O
long	O

earnestly	O
desired	O
to	O
become	O
personally	O
acquainted	O

were	O
about	O
the	O
fire	O
,	O
three	O
of	O
the	O
party	O
went	O
immediately	O
towards	O
it	O
,	O
hoping	O
that	O
so	O
small	O
a	O
number	O
would	O
not	O
put	O
them	O
to	O
flight	O
:	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
place	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
they	O
found	O
it	O
deserted	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
they	O
conjectured	O
that	O
before	O
they	O
had	O
discovered	O
the	O
Indians	O
,	O
the	O
Indians	O
had	O
discovered	O
them	O

They	O
found	O
the	O
fire	O
still	O
burning	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
hollow	O
of	O
an	O
old	O
tree	O
that	O
was	O

several	O

broken	O
down	O
,	O
with	O
which	O
children	O
appeared	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
playing	O
:	O
they	O
observed	O
also	O
many	O
foot-steps	O
upon	O
the	O
sand	O
,	O
below	O
high	O
water	O
mark	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
certain	O
indications	O
that	O
the	O
Indians	O
had	O
been	O
recently	O
upon	O
the	O
spot	O
.	O

Several	O
houses	O
were	O
found	O
at	O
a	O
little	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
ovens	O
dug	O
in	O
the	O
ground	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
manner	O
as	O
those	O
of	O
Otaheite	PNM

in	O
which	O
victuals	O
appeared	O

dressed	O
since	O

morning	O

scattered	O

some	O
fragments	O

After	O
regretting	O
their	O
disappointment	O
,	O
they	O
repaired	O
to	O
their	O
quarters	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
a	O
broad	O
sand	O
bank	O
,	O
under	O
the	O
shelter	O
of	O
a	O

beds	O
were	O
plantain	O

which	O
they	O
spread	O
upon	O
the	O
sand	O

and	O
which	O
were	O
as	O
soft	O
as	O

them	O
for	O

and	O
some	O
bunches	O
of	O
grass	O
for	O

with	O

a	O

the	O
last	O

to	O
their	O
great	O
comfort	O
,	O
not	O
a	O
musquito	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
.	O

Here	O
then	O
they	O
lay	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
such	O
is	O
the	O
force	O
of	O
habit	O
,	O
they	O
resigned	O
themselves	O
to	O
sleep	O

without	O
once	O
reflecting	O
upon	O
the	O
probability	O
and	O
danger	O
of	O
being	O
found	O
by	O
the	O
Indians	O
in	O
that	O
situation	O

If	O
this	O
appears	O
strange	O
,	O
*	O
let	O
us	O
for	O
a	O
moment	O
reflect	O
,	O
that	O
every	O
danger	O

and	O
every	O
calamity	O

after	O
a	O
time	O
becomes	O

it	O
were	O

that	O

with	O
these	O

truths	O

by	O

we	O
scarce	O
know	O
when	O

they	O

all	O

and	O
we	O
think	O
no	O
more	O
of	O
the	O
approach	O
of	O

age	O
and	O
death	O
,	O
than	O
these	O
wanderers	O

of	O

evil	O

the	O
approach	O
of	O
the	O

at	O
a	O
time	O
when	O
they	O
must	O
have	O
fallen	O
an	O
easy	O
prey	O
to	O
their	O
malice	O
or	O
their	O
fears	O
.	O

And	O
it	O
is	O
remarkable	O

that	O
the	O
greater	O
part	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
have	O
been	O
condemned	O
to	O
suffer	O
a	O
violent	O
death	O
,	O
have	O
slept	O
the	O
night	O
immediately	O

though	O
there	O
is	O

the	O

Thus	O
is	O
the	O
evil	O
of	O

above	O

We	O
now	O
perceived	O
that	O
the	O
colour	O
of	O
their	O
skin	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
dark	O
as	O
it	O
appeared	O
,	O
what	O
we	O
had	O
taken	O
for	O
their	O

being	O
the	O
effects	O
of	O
dirt	O
and	O
smoke	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
,	O
we	O
imagined	O

they	O
contrived	O
to	O
sleep	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
the	O
heat	O
of	O

as	O

Among	O

things	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
given	O
them	O
when	O
we	O
first	O
saw	O
them	O
,	O
were	O
some	O

,	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
hung	O
round	O
their	O
necks	O
by	O
a	O
riband	O
;	O
and	O
these	O
ribands	O
were	O
so	O
changed	O
by	O
smoke	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
easily	O
distinguish	O
of	O
what	O
colour	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
:	O
this	O
incident	O
led	O
us	O
more	O
narrowly	O
to	O
examine	O
the	O
colour	O
of	O
their	O
skin	O
.	O

While	O
these	O
people	O
were	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
two	O
others	O
on	O
the	O
point	O
of	O
land	O
that	O
lay	O
on	O
the	O
opposite	O
side	O

the	O

at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
about	O
two	O
hundred	O
yards	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
our	O
glasses	O
discovered	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
woman	O

a	O
boy	O
;	O
the	O
woman	O
,	O
like	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
being	O
stark	O
naked	O

We	O
observed	O
,	O
that	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
remarkably	O
clean-limbed	O
,	O
and	O
exceedingly	O
active	O
and	O
nimble	O

One	O
of	O
these	O

had	O
a	O
necklace	O
of	O
shells	O
,	O
very	O
prettily	O
made	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
bracelet	O
upon	O
his	O
arm	O
,	O
formed	O
of	O
several	O
strings	O
,	O
so	O
as	O
to	O
resemble	O
what	O
in	O
England	PNM
is	O
called	O
gymp	O

both	O

them	O
had	O
a	O
piece	O

were	O
disfigured	O

they	O
were	O
continually	O

eight	O

we	O
ascended	O
a	O
very	O
high	O
hill	O

and	O
were	O
soon	O
convinced	O
that	O
the	O
danger	O
of	O
our	O
situation	O
was	O
at	O

equal	O
to	O
our	O
apprehensions	O
;	O
for	O
in	O
whatever	O
direction	O
we	O
turned	O
our	O
eyes	O

we	O
saw	O
rocks	O

shoals	O
without	O
number	O

no	O
passage	O
out	O

returned	O

On	O
the	O
19th	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
visited	O
by	O
ten	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O
,	O
the	O
greater	O
part	O
from	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
of	O

we	O
saw	O
six	O

seven	O

them	O
women	O

people	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
in	O
this	O

were	O
stark	O

Our	O

brought	O
with	O

a	O
greater	O
number	O
of	O
lances	O
than	O
they	O
had	O

up	O

set	O
a	O

boy	O
to	O
watch	O
them	O
:	O
the	O
rest	O
then	O
came	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
*	O
and	O
we	O
soon	O
perceived	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
determined	O
to	O
get	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
turtle	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
probably	O
as	O
great	O
a	O
dainty	O
to	O
them	O
as	O
to	O
us	O
.	O

They	O
first	O
asked	O
us	O
,	O
by	O
signs	O
,	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
one	O
;	O
and	O
being	O
refused	O
,	O
they	O
expressed	O
,	O
both	O
by	O
looks	O
and	O
gestures	O
,	O
great	O
disappointment	O
and	O
anger	O
.	O

At	O
this	O
time	O
we	O
happened	O
to	O
have	O
no	O
victuals	O
dressed	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
offered	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
some	O
biscuit	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
snatched	O
and	O
threw	O
overboard	O
with	O
great	O
disdain	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
them	O
renewed	O
his	O
request	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
,	O
and	O
upon	O
a	O
refusal	O
stamped	O
with	O
his	O
foot	O
,	O
and	O
pushed	O
him	O
from	O
him	O
in	O
a	O
transport	O
of	O
resentment	O
and	O
indignation	O
:	O
having	O
applied	O
by	O
turns	O
to	O
almost	O
every	O
person	O
who	O
appeared	O
to	O
have	O
any	O
command	O
in	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
without	O
success	O
,	O
they	O
suddenly	O
seized	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
turtles	O
,	O
and	O
dragged	O
them	O
towards	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
where	O
their	O
canoe	O
lay	O
:	O
our	O
people	O
soon	O
forced	O
them	O
out	O
of	O
their	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
replaced	O
them	O
with	O
the	O
rest	O
.	O

They	O
would	O
not	O
however	O
relinquish	O
their	O
enterprise	O
,	O
but	O
made	O
several	O
other	O
attempts	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
kind	O
,	O
in	O
all	O
which	O
being	O
equally	O
disappointed	O
,	O
they	O
suddenly	O
leaped	O
into	O
their	O
canoe	O
in	O
a	O
rage	O
,	O
and	O
began	O
to	O
paddle	O
towards	O
the	O
shore	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
I	O
went	O
into	O
the	O

with	O
Mr.	O

and	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
of	O
the	O

we	O
got	O
ashore	O

were	O

employments	O

as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
landed	O

they	O
seized	O
their	O
arms	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
before	O
we	O
were	O
aware	O
of	O
their	O
design	O

they	O
snatched	O
a	O
brand	O
from	O
under	O
a	O
pitch	O
kettle	O
which	O
was	O
boiling	O

and	O
making	O

to	O
the	O
windward	O
of	O
the	O
few	O
things	O
we	O
had	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
they	O
set	O
fire	O
to	O
the	O
grass	O
in	O
their	O
way	O
,	O
with	O
surprising	O
quickness	O
and	O
dexterity	O
:	O
the	O
grass	O

which	O
was	O
five	O
or	O
six	O
feet	O
high	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
dry	O
as	O
stubble	O
,	O
burnt	O
with	O
amazing	O
fury	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
fire	O
made	O
a	O
rapid	O
progress	O
towards	O
a	O
tent	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
's	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
set	O
up	O
for	O
Tupia	O
when	O
he	O
was	O
sick	O

taking	O
in	O
its	O
course	O
a	O
sow	O
and	O
pigs	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
which	O
it	O
scorched	O
to	O
death	O
.	O

*	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
leaped	O
into	O
a	O
boat	O
,	O
and	O
fetched	O
some	O
people	O
from	O
on	O
board	O
,	O
just	O
time	O
enough	O
to	O
save	O
his	O
tent	O
,	O
by	O
hauling	O
it	O
down	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
smith	O
's	O
forge	O
,	O
at	O
least	O
such	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
as	O
would	O
burn	O
,	O
was	O
consumed	O
.	O

While	O
this	O
was	O
doing	O
,	O
the	O
Indians	O
went	O
to	O
a	O
place	O
at	O
some	O
distance	O
,	O
where	O
several	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
were	O
washing	O
,	O
and	O
where	O
our	O
nets	O
,	O
among	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
seine	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
great	O
quantity	O
of	O
linen	O
,	O
were	O
laid	O
out	O
to	O
dry	O
;	O
here	O
they	O
again	O
set	O
fire	O
to	O
the	O
grass	O
,	O
entirely	O
disregarding	O
both	O
threats	O
and	O
entreaties	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
therefore	O
obliged	O
to	O
discharge	O
a	O
musquet	O
,	O
loaded	O
with	O
small	O
shot	O
,	O
at	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
drew	O
blood	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
about	O
forty	O
yards	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
putting	O
them	O
to	O
flight	O
,	O
we	O
extinguished	O
the	O
fire	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
before	O
it	O
had	O
made	O
much	O
progress	O
;	O
but	O
where	O
the	O
grass	O
had	O
been	O
first	O
kindled	O
,	O
it	O
spread	O
into	O
the	O
woods	O
to	O
a	O
great	O
distance	O
.	O

As	O
the	O
Indians	O
were	O
still	O
in	O
sight	O
,	O
I	O
fired	O
a	O
musquet	O
,	O
charged	O
with	O
ball	O
,	O
abreast	O
of	O
them	O
among	O
the	O
mangroves	O
,	O
to	O
convince	O
them	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
yet	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
reach	O
:	O
upon	O
hearing	O
the	O
ball	O
they	O
quickened	O
their	O
pace	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
soon	O
lost	O
sight	O
of	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
thought	O
they	O
would	O
now	O
give	O
us	O
no	O
more	O
trouble	O
;	O
but	O
soon	O
after	O
we	O
heard	O
their	O
voices	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
and	O
perceived	O
that	O
they	O
came	O
nearer	O
and	O
nearer	O
.	O

I	O
set	O
out	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
with	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
and	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
more	O
,	O
to	O
meet	O
them	O
:	O
when	O
our	O
parties	O
came	O
in	O
sight	O
of	O

,	O
they	O
halted	O
;	O

one	O

man	O

who	O
came	O
forward	O
to	O
meet	O
us	O
:	O
at	O
length	O
he	O
stopped	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
uttered	O
some	O
words	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
sorry	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
understand	O
,	O
he	O
went	O
back	O
to	O
his	O
companions	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
whole	O
body	O
slowly	O
retreated	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
means	O
however	O
to	O
seize	O
some	O
of	O
their	O
darts	O
,	O
and	O
continued	O
to	O
follow	O
them	O
about	O
a	O
mile	O
:	O
we	O
then	O
sat	O
down	O
upon	O
some	O
rocks	O
,	O
from	O
which	O
we	O
could	O
observe	O
their	O
motions	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
also	O
sat	O
down	O
at	O
about	O
an	O
hundred	O
yards	O
distance	O
.	O

After	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
,	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
again	O
advanced	O
towards	O
us	O
,	O
*	O
carrying	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
a	O
lance	O
without	O
a	O
point	O
:	O
he	O
stopped	O
several	O
times	O
,	O
at	O
different	O
distances	O
,	O
and	O
spoke	O
;	O
we	O
answered	O
by	O
beckoning	O
and	O
making	O
such	O
signs	O
of	O
amity	O
as	O
we	O
could	O
devise	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
the	O
messenger	O
of	O
peace	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
supposed	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
,	O
turned	O
and	O
spoke	O
aloud	O
to	O
his	O
companions	O
,	O
who	O
then	O
set	O
up	O
their	O
lances	O
against	O
a	O
tree	O
,	O
and	O
advanced	O
towards	O
us	O
in	O
a	O
friendly	O
manner	O
:	O
when	O
they	O
came	O
up	O
,	O
we	O
returned	O
the	O
darts	O
or	O
lances	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
taken	O
from	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
perceived	O
with	O
great	O
satisfaction	O
that	O
this	O
rendered	O
the	O
reconciliation	O
complete	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
in	O
this	O
party	O
four	O
persons	O
whom	O
we	O
had	O
never	O
seen	O
before	O
,	O
who	O
as	O
usual	O
were	O
introduced	O
to	O
us	O
by	O
name	O
;	O

the	O
man	O
who	O
had	O
been	O
wounded	O
in	O
the	O
attempt	O
to	O
burn	O
our	O
nets	O
and	O
linen	O
,	O
was	O
not	O
among	O
them	O
;	O
we	O
knew	O
however	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
dangerously	O
hurt	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
distance	O
at	O
which	O
the	O
shot	O
reached	O
him	O
.	O

We	O
made	O
all	O
of	O
them	O
presents	O
of	O
such	O
trinkets	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
about	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
walked	O
back	O
with	O
us	O
towards	O
the	O
ship	O
:	O
as	O
we	O
went	O
along	O
,	O
they	O
told	O
us	O
,	O
by	O
signs	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
set	O
fire	O
to	O
the	O
grass	O
any	O
more	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
distributed	O
among	O
them	O
some	O
musquet	O
balls	O
,	O
and	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
make	O
them	O
understand	O
their	O
use	O
and	O
effect	O
.	O

When	O
they	O
came	O
abreast	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O

they	O
sat	O
down	O
,	O
but	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
prevailed	O
upon	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
board	O
;	O
we	O
therefore	O
left	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
about	O
two	O
hours	O
they	O
went	O
away	O
,	O
soon	O
after	O
which	O
we	O
perceived	O
the	O
woods	O
on	O
fire	O
at	O
about	O
two	O
miles	O
distance	O

In	O
the	O
morning	O
therefore	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
11th	O

I	O
set	O
out	O
in	O
the	O
pinnace	O

accompanied	O
by	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O

whose	O
fortitude	O

made	O
him	O
a	O
party	O
in	O

for	O
the	O
northermost	O

of	O

at	O

In	O
my	O

I	O
passed	O
over	O
a	O

lies	O
about	O

About	O
one	O
o'clock	O

we	O
reached	O
the	O
island	O

and	O
immediately	O
ascended	O
the	O
highest	O
hill	O

with	O
a	O
mixture	O
of	O
hope	O

fear	O
,	O
proportioned	O
to	O
the	O
importance	O
of	O
our	O
business	O

and	O
the	O
uncertainty	O
of	O
the	O
event	O
:	O
when	O
I	O
looked	O
round	O
,	O
I	O
discovered	O
a	O
reef	O
of	O
rocks	O

lying	O
between	O
two	O

three	O
leagues	O
without	O
the	O

extending	O
in	O
a	O

N.	O

S.	O

farther	O
than	O
I	O
could	O
see	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
the	O
sea	O
broke	O
in	O
a	O
dreadful	O
surf	O
;	O
this	O
however	O
made	O
me	O
think	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
shoals	O
beyond	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
conceived	O
hopes	O
of	O
getting	O
without	O
these	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
perceived	O
several	O
breaks	O
or	O
openings	O
in	O
the	O
reef	O
,	O
and	O
deep	O
water	O
between	O
that	O
and	O
the	O
islands	O
.	O

I	O
continued	O
upon	O
this	O
hill	O
till	O
sunset	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
weather	O
was	O
so	O
hazy	O
during	O
the	O
whole	O
time	O
that	O
I	O
came	O
down	O
much	O
disappointed	O
.	O

After	O
reflecting	O
upon	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
,	O
and	O
comparing	O
the	O
intelligence	O
I	O
had	O
gained	O
with	O
what	O
I	O
expected	O
,	O
I	O
determined	O
to	O
stay	O
upon	O
the	O
island	O
all	O
night	O
,	O
hoping	O
that	O
the	O
morning	O
might	O
be	O
clearer	O
,	O
and	O
afford	O
me	O
a	O
more	O
distinct	O
and	O
comprehensive	O
view	O
.	O

We	O
therefore	O
took	O
up	O
our	O
lodging	O
under	O
the	O
shelter	O
of	O
a	O
bush	O
which	O
grew	O
upon	O
the	O
beach	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
three	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
*	O
having	O
sent	O
the	O
pinnace	O
with	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Mates	O
whom	O
I	O
had	O
brought	O
out	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
to	O
sound	O
between	O
the	O
island	O

the	O
reefs	O
,	O
and	O
examine	O
what	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
channel	O
through	O
them	O
,	O
I	O
climbed	O
the	O
hill	O
a	O
second	O
time	O
;	O
but	O
to	O
my	O
great	O
disappointment	O
found	O
the	O
weather	O
much	O
more	O
hazy	O
than	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
.	O

*	O
About	O
noon	O
the	O
pinnace	O
returned	O
,	O
having	O
been	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
reef	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
between	O
fifteen	O
and	O
twenty-eight	O
fathom	O
of	O
water	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
blew	O
so	O
hard	O
that	O
the	O
Mate	O
did	O
not	O
dare	O
to	O
venture	O
into	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
channels	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
said	O
appeared	O
to	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
narrow	O
:	O
this	O
however	O
did	O
not	O
discourage	O
me	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
judged	O
from	O
his	O
description	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
at	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
seen	O
it	O
to	O
disadvantage	O
.	O

While	O
I	O
was	O
busy	O
in	O
my	O
survey	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Banks	O
was	O
attentive	O
to	O
his	O
favourite	O
pursuit	O
,	O
and	O
picked	O
up	O
several	O
plants	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
before	O
seen	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
the	O
island	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
visible	O
at	O
twelve	O
leagues	O
distance	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
about	O
eight	O
leagues	O
in	O
circumference	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
general	O
very	O
rocky	O
and	O
barren	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
north	O
west	O
side	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
some	O
sandy	O
bays	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
low	O
land	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
covered	O
with	O
long	O
thin	O
grass	O
,	O
and	O
trees	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
kind	O
with	O
those	O
upon	O
the	O
main	O
:	O
this	O
part	O
also	O
abounded	O
with	O
lizards	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
large	O
size	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
took	O
.	O

We	O
found	O
also	O
fresh	O
water	O
in	O
two	O
places	O
;	O
one	O
was	O
a	O
running	O
stream	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
brackish	O
where	O
I	O
tasted	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
sea	O
;	O
the	O
other	O
was	O
a	O
standing	O
pool	O
,	O
close	O
behind	O
the	O
sandy	O
beach	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
perfectly	O
sweet	O
and	O
good	O
.	O

Notwithstanding	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
this	O
island	O
from	O
the	O
main	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
surprize	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
sometimes	O
visited	O
by	O
the	O
natives	O
;	O
for	O
we	O
found	O
seven	O
or	O
eight	O
frames	O
of	O
their	O
huts	O
,	O
and	O
vast	O
heaps	O
of	O
shells	O
,	O
the	O
fish	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
supposed	O
had	O
been	O
their	O
food	O
.	O

We	O
observed	O
that	O
all	O
these	O
huts	O
were	O
built	O
upon	O
eminences	O
,	O
and	O
entirely	O
exposed	O
to	O
the	O
S.	O
E.	O
contrary	O
to	O
those	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
seen	O
upon	O
the	O
main	O
;	O
for	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
built	O
either	O
upon	O
the	O
side	O
of	O
a	O
hill	O
,	O
or	O
under	O
some	O
bushes	O
which	O
afforded	O
them	O
shelter	O
from	O
the	O
wind	O
.	O

From	O
these	O
huts	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
situation	O
,	O
we	O
concluded	O
that	O
at	O
some	O
seasons	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
the	O
weather	O
here	O
is	O
invariably	O
calm	O

no	O

can	O

In	O
this	O
dreadful	O
situation	O

no	O
resource	O
was	O
left	O

the	O

the	O

which	O

by	O
the	O

abaft	O

got	O
the	O

which	O

if	O

might	O
at	O

it	O

But	O
it	O
was	O
six	O
o'clock	O
before	O
this	O
was	O
effected	O

and	O
we	O
were	O

a	O

broke	O
to	O
a	O

height	O
the	O
very	O
next	O
time	O
it	O
rose	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
between	O
us	O
and	O
destruction	O
there	O
was	O
only	O
a	O
dreary	O
valley	O

no	O

of	O
one	O

and	O
even	O
now	O
the	O
sea	O
under	O

was	O
unfathomable	O

at	O

no	O

was	O
to	O

twenty	O

During	O
this	O
scene	O
of	O

the	O
carpenter	O
had	O
found	O
means	O
to	O
patch	O
up	O
the	O
pinnace	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
hoisted	O
out	O

in	O
aid	O
of	O
the	O

to	O

all	O
our	O
efforts	O
would	O

ineffectual	O

if	O
,	O
just	O
at	O
this	O
crisis	O
of	O
our	O
fate	O
,	O
a	O
light	O
air	O
of	O

had	O
not	O
sprung	O
up	O

so	O
light	O

that	O
at	O
any	O
other	O
time	O
we	O
should	O
not	O
have	O
observed	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
which	O
was	O
enough	O
to	O
turn	O
the	O
scale	O
in	O
our	O
favour	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
conjunction	O
with	O
the	O
assistance	O
which	O
was	O
afforded	O
us	O
by	O
the	O
boats	O
,	O
to	O
give	O
the	O
ship	O
a	O
perceptible	O
motion	O
obliquely	O
from	O
the	O
reef	O
.	O

Our	O
hopes	O
now	O
revived	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
less	O
than	O
ten	O
minutes	O
it	O
was	O
again	O
a	O
dead	O
calm	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
ship	O
was	O
again	O
driven	O
towards	O
the	O
breakers	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
not	O
now	O
two	O
hundred	O
yards	O
distant	O
.	O

The	O
same	O
light	O
breeze	O
however	O
returned	O
before	O
we	O
had	O
lost	O
all	O
the	O
ground	O
it	O
had	O
enabled	O
us	O
to	O
gain	O
,	O
and	O
lasted	O
about	O
ten	O
minutes	O
more	O
.	O

During	O
this	O
time	O
we	O
discovered	O
a	O
small	O
opening	O
in	O
the	O
reef	O
,	O
at	O
about	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
:	O
I	O
immediately	O
sent	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
Mates	O
to	O
examine	O
it	O
,	O
who	O
reported	O
that	O
its	O
breadth	O
was	O
not	O
more	O
than	O
the	O
length	O
of	O
the	O
ship	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
within	O
it	O
there	O
was	O
smooth	O
water	O
:	O
this	O
discovery	O
seemed	O
to	O
render	O
our	O
escape	O
possible	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
all	O
,	O
by	O
pushing	O
the	O
ship	O
through	O
the	O
opening	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
immediately	O
attempted	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
uncertain	O
indeed	O
whether	O
we	O
could	O
reach	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
if	O
we	O
should	O
succeed	O
thus	O
far	O
,	O
we	O
made	O
no	O
doubt	O
of	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
through	O
:	O
in	O
this	O
however	O
we	O
were	O
disappointed	O
,	O
for	O
having	O
reached	O
it	O
by	O
the	O
joint	O
assistance	O
of	O
our	O
boats	O
and	O
the	O
breeze	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
it	O
had	O
become	O
high	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
surprize	O
we	O
met	O
the	O
tide	O
of	O
ebb	O
rushing	O
out	O
of	O
it	O
like	O
a	O
mill-stream	O
.	O

We	O
gained	O
however	O
some	O
advantage	O
,	O
though	O
in	O
a	O
manner	O
directly	O
contrary	O
to	O
our	O
expectations	O
;	O
we	O
found	O
it	O
impossible	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
the	O
opening	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
stream	O
that	O
prevented	O
us	O
,	O
carried	O
us	O
out	O
about	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
:	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
narrow	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
keep	O
in	O
it	O
longer	O
;	O
yet	O
this	O
tide	O
of	O
ebb	O
so	O
much	O
assisted	O
the	O
boats	O
that	O
by	O
noon	O
we	O
had	O
got	O
an	O
offing	O
of	O
near	O
two	O
miles	O
.	O

*	O
We	O
had	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
reason	O
to	O
despair	O
of	O
deliverance	O
,	O
even	O
if	O
the	O
breeze	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
now	O
died	O
away	O
,	O
should	O
revive	O
,	O
for	O
we	O
were	O
still	O
embayed	O
in	O
the	O
reef	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
tide	O
of	O
ebb	O
being	O
spent	O
,	O
the	O
tide	O
of	O
flood	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
our	O
utmost	O
efforts	O
,	O
again	O
drove	O
the	O
ship	O
into	O
the	O
bight	O
.	O

About	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
we	O
saw	O
another	O
opening	O
,	O
near	O
a	O
mile	O
to	O
the	O
westward	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
immediately	O
sent	O
the	O
First	O
Lieutenant	O

Mr.	O
Hicks	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
small	O
boat	O
to	O
examine	O
:	O
in	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
we	O
struggled	O
hard	O
with	O
the	O
flood	O
,	O
sometimes	O
gaining	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
losing	O
;	O
but	O
every	O
man	O
still	O
did	O
his	O
duty	O
,	O
with	O
as	O
much	O
calmness	O
and	O
regularity	O
as	O
if	O
no	O
danger	O
had	O
been	O
near	O
.	O

About	O
two	O
o'clock	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Hicks	O
returned	O
with	O
an	O
account	O
that	O
the	O
opening	O
was	O
narrow	O
and	O
dangerous	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
passed	O
:	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O
passing	O
it	O
was	O
sufficient	O
encouragement	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
attempt	O
,	O
for	O
all	O
danger	O
was	O
less	O
imminent	O
than	O
that	O
of	O
our	O

the	O
very	O
tide	O
of	O

that	O
without	O
an	O

would	O
have	O
been	O
our	O
destruction	O

we	O
entered	O
it	O

were	O
hurried	O
through	O
with	O
amazing	O
rapidity	O

by	O
a	O

that	O
kept	O
us	O
from	O

against	O
either	O
side	O

about	O

his	O

Dr.	O
Solander	O
,	O
being	O
in	O
all	O
twelve	O
persons	O
well	O

;	O
we	O
rowed	O
directly	O
towards	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
*	O
but	O
the	O
water	O
was	O
so	O
shallow	O
that	O
we	O
could	O
not	O
reach	O
it	O
by	O
about	O
two	O
hundred	O
yards	O
:	O
we	O
waded	O
however	O
the	O
rest	O

left	O
two	O

Hitherto	O

at	O
this	O
place	O
;	O

as	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
got	O
ashore	O
we	O
discovered	O
the	O
prints	O
of	O
human	O
feet	O
,	O
which	O
could	O
not	O
long	O
have	O
been	O
impressed	O
upon	O
the	O
sand	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
below	O
high-water	O
mark	O
:	O
we	O
therefore	O
concluded	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
were	O
at	O
no	O
great	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
thick	O
wood	O
came	O
down	O
within	O
a	O
hundred	O
yards	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
we	O
thought	O
it	O
necessary	O
to	O
proceed	O
with	O
caution	O
,	O
lest	O
we	O
should	O
fall	O
into	O
an	O
ambuscade	O
and	O
our	O
retreat	O
to	O
the	O
boat	O
be	O
cut	O
off	O

We	O
walked	O
along	O
the	O
skirts	O
of	O
the	O
wood	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
about	O
two	O
hundred	O
yards	O
from	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
we	O
landed	O
,	O
we	O
came	O
to	O
a	O
grove	O
of	O
cocoa-nut	O
trees	O
,	O
which	O
stood	O
upon	O
the	O
banks	O
of	O
a	O
little	O
brook	O
of	O
brackish	O
water	O
.	O

The	O
trees	O
were	O
of	O
a	O
small	O
growth	O
,	O
but	O
well	O
hung	O
with	O
fruit	O
;	O
and	O
near	O
them	O
was	O
a	O
shed	O
or	O
hut	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
covered	O
with	O
their	O
leaves	O
,	O
though	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
now	O
fallen	O
off	O
:	O
about	O
the	O
hut	O
lay	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
the	O
shells	O
of	O
the	O
fruit	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
which	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
just	O
fresh	O
from	O
the	O
tree	O
.	O

We	O
looked	O
at	O
the	O
fruit	O
very	O
wishfully	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
thinking	O
it	O
safe	O
to	O
climb	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
leave	O
it	O
without	O
tasting	O
a	O
single	O
nut	O
.	O

At	O
a	O
little	O
distance	O
from	O
this	O
place	O
we	O
found	O
plantains	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
breadfruit	O
tree	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
had	O
nothing	O
upon	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
now	O
advanced	O
about	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O
from	O
the	O
boat	O
,	O
three	O
Indians	O
rushed	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
wood	O
with	O
a	O
hideous	O
shout	O
,	O
at	O
about	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
a	O
hundred	O
yards	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
they	O
ran	O
towards	O
us	O
,	O
the	O
foremost	O
threw	O
something	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
hand	O
,	O
which	O
slew	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
burnt	O
exactly	O
like	O
gunpowder	O
,	O
but	O
made	O
no	O
report	O
:	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
instantly	O
threw	O
their	O
lances	O
at	O
us	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
no	O
time	O
was	O
now	O
to	O
be	O
lost	O
,	O
we	O
discharged	O
our	O
pieces	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
loaded	O
with	O
small	O
shot	O
.	O

*	O
It	O
is	O
probable	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
feel	O
the	O
shot	O
,	O
for	O
though	O
they	O
halted	O
a	O
moment	O
,	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
retreat	O
;	O
and	O
a	O
third	O
dart	O
was	O
thrown	O
at	O
us	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
thought	O
their	O
farther	O
approach	O
might	O
be	O
prevented	O
with	O
less	O
risk	O
of	O
life	O
,	O
than	O
it	O
would	O
cost	O
to	O
defend	O
ourselves	O
against	O
their	O
attack	O
if	O
they	O
should	O
come	O
nearer	O
,	O
we	O
loaded	O
our	O
pieces	O
with	O
ball	O
,	O
and	O
fired	O
a	O
second	O
time	O
:	O
by	O
this	O
discharge	O
it	O
is	O
probable	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
wounded	O
;	O
yet	O
we	O
had	O
the	O
satisfaction	O
to	O
see	O
that	O
they	O
all	O
ran	O
away	O
with	O
great	O
agility	O

As	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
disposed	O
forcibly	O
to	O
invade	O
this	O
country	O
,	O
either	O
to	O
gratify	O
our	O
appetites	O
or	O
our	O
curiosity	O

and	O
perceived	O
that	O
nothing	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
upon	O
friendly	O
terms	O
,	O
we	O
improved	O
this	O
interval	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
destruction	O
of	O
the	O

was	O
no	O
longer	O
necessary	O
to	O
our	O
own	O
defence	O
,	O
and	O
with	O
all	O
expedition	O
returned	O
towards	O
our	O
boat	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
were	O
advancing	O
along	O
the	O
shore	O
,	O
we	O
perceived	O
that	O
the	O
two	O
men	O
on	O
board	O
made	O
signals	O
that	O
more	O
Indians	O
were	O
coming	O
down	O
;	O
and	O
before	O
we	O
got	O
into	O
the	O
water	O
we	O
saw	O
several	O
of	O
them	O
coming	O
round	O
a	O
point	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
about	O
five	O
hundred	O
yards	O
:	O
it	O
is	O
probable	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
the	O
three	O
who	O
first	O
attacked	O
us	O
;	O
for	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
saw	O
us	O
they	O
halted	O
,	O
and	O
seemed	O
to	O
wait	O
till	O
their	O
main	O
body	O
should	O
come	O
up	O
.	O

We	O
entered	O
the	O
water	O
,	O
and	O
waded	O
towards	O
the	O
boat	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
remained	O
at	O
their	O
station	O
,	O
without	O
giving	O
us	O
any	O
interruption	O
.	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
aboard	O
we	O
rowed	O
abreast	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
number	O
then	O
appeared	O
to	O
be	O
between	O
sixty	O
and	O
a	O
hundred	O
.	O

We	O
now	O
took	O
a	O
view	O
of	O
them	O
at	O
our	O
leisure	O
;	O
they	O
made	O
much	O
the	O
same	O
appearance	O
as	O
the	O
New	O
Hollanders	O
,	O
being	O
nearly	O
of	O
the	O

stature	O

having	O
their	O
hair	O
short	O
cropped	O
:	O
like	O
them	O
also	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
stark	O
naked	O

we	O
thought	O
the	O
colour	O
of	O
their	O
skin	O
was	O
not	O
quite	O
so	O
dark	O
;	O
this	O
however	O
might	O
perhaps	O
be	O
merely	O
the	O
effect	O
of	O
their	O
not	O
being	O
quite	O
so	O
dirty	O

All	O
this	O

fire	O

resembling	O
those	O
of	O
a	O

and	O
of	O
no	O

This	O
wonderful	O
phaenomenon	O
was	O
observed	O
from	O
the	O

and	O
the	O
deception	O
was	O
so	O
great	O
that	O

fire-arms	O

in	O

we	O
had	O
looked	O
at	O
them	O
attentively	O
some	O
time	O

without	O
taking	O
any	O
notice	O
of	O
their	O
flashing	O

we	O
fired	O
some	O

I	O

to	O
say	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
strongly	O
urged	O
by	O
some	O
of	O

to	O
send	O
a	O
party	O
of	O

ashore	O

cut	O
down	O
the	O
cocoa-nut	O

for	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
the	O

.	O

This	O
I	O
peremptorily	O
refused	O
,	O
as	O
equally	O
unjust	O
and	O
cruel	O
.	O

The	O
natives	O
had	O
attacked	O
us	O
merely	O
for	O
landing	O
upon	O
their	O
coast	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
attempted	O
to	O
take	O
nothing	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
therefore	O
morally	O
certain	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
have	O
made	O
a	O
vigorous	O
effort	O
to	O
defend	O
their	O
property	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
invaded	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
case	O
many	O
of	O
them	O
must	O
have	O
fallen	O
a	O
sacrifice	O
to	O
our	O
attempt	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
also	O
some	O
of	O
our	O
own	O
people	O
.	O

I	O
should	O
have	O
regretted	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
measure	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
want	O
of	O
the	O
necessaries	O
of	O
life	O
;	O
and	O
certainly	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
highly	O
criminal	O
when	O
nothing	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
obtained	O
but	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
hundred	O
of	O
green	O
cocoa-nuts	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
at	O
most	O
have	O
procured	O
us	O
a	O
mere	O
transient	O
gratification	O
.	O

I	O
might	O
indeed	O
have	O
proceeded	O
farther	O
along	O
the	O
coast	O
to	O
the	O
northward	O
and	O
westward	O
,	O
in	O
search	O
of	O
a	O
place	O
where	O
the	O
ship	O
might	O
have	O
lain	O
so	O
near	O
the	O
shore	O
as	O
to	O
cover	O
the	O
people	O
with	O
her	O
guns	O
when	O
they	O
landed	O
;	O
but	O
this	O
would	O
have	O
obviated	O
only	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
mischief	O
,	O
and	O
though	O
it	O
might	O
have	O
secured	O
us	O

it	O
would	O
probably	O
in	O
the	O
very	O
act	O
have	O
been	O
fatal	O
to	O
the	O
natives	O
.	O

Besides	O

we	O
had	O
reason	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
before	O

a	O

would	O

at	O
first	O
I	O
thought	O

were	O
close	O
in	O

,	O
to	O
our	O
very	O
agreeable	O
surprise	O

numerous	O

This	O
was	O
a	O
temptation	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
resisted	O
by	O
people	O
in	O
our	O
situation	O

were	O
in	O

it	O
was	O

Mr.	O

the	O
Second	O

sent	O

taking	O
with	O

should	O
appear	O

was	O
gone	O

we	O
saw	O

seemed	O
to	O
be	O
riding	O
upon	O
the	O
hills	O
for	O
their	O
amusement	O
,	O
and	O
often	O
stopped	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
ship	O

By	O
this	O
we	O
knew	O
that	O
the	O
place	O
had	O
been	O
settled	O
by	O
Europeans	O

and	O
hoped	O

that	O
the	O
many	O

circumstances	O
which	O
always	O
attend	O
the	O
first	O
establishment	O
of	O

would	O
be	O
avoided	O

Mr.	O

landed	O
in	O
a	O
small	O
sandy	O
cove	O
near	O
some	O

was	O
met	O
by	O
eight	O

ten	O
of	O
the	O
natives	O

who	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
in	O
their	O
dress	O
as	O
their	O
persons	O
,	O
very	O
much	O
resembled	O

Malays	O

they	O
were	O
without	O

their	O
custom	O
to	O
wear	O

one	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
a	O

courteously	O
invited	O
him	O
ashore	O

In	O
a	O

returned	O
with	O
this	O
report	O

and	O
,	O
to	O
our	O
great	O
mortification	O

added	O

that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O

I	O
sent	O
him	O

Dr.	O

went	O
in	O

him	O

In	O

kept	O

off	O

seemed	O
to	O

to	O

perceived	O
several	O

to	O

something	O

upon	O

from	O

we	O
conjectured	O

there	O
were	O

somewhere	O

a	O

attempted	O
to	O
converse	O
with	O

should	O
see	O
somewhat	O

which	O
he	O
expressed	O
by	O

his	O

the	O

at	O
each	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
ridge	O
that	O
terminates	O
the	O
roof	O

and	O
these	O
were	O
certainly	O
what	O
the	O
Indian	O
intended	O
to	O
represent	O
by	O
crossing	O
his	O
fingers	O
,	O
though	O
our	O
Portuguese	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
a	O
good	O
Catholic	O
,	O
construed	O
the	O
sign	O
into	O
a	O
cross	O
,	O
*	O
which	O
had	O
persuaded	O
us	O
that	O
the	O
settlement	O
belonged	O
to	O
his	O
countrymen	O
.	O

In	O
this	O
place	O
we	O
met	O
Mr.	O
Lange	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
King	O
,	O
whose	O
name	O
was	O
A	O
Madocho	PNM
Lomi	PNM
Djara	PNM
,	O
attended	O
by	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
principal	O
people	O
.	O

We	O
told	O
them	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
boat	O
goods	O
of	O
various	O
kinds	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
proposed	O
to	O
barter	O
for	O
such	O
refreshments	O
as	O
they	O
would	O
give	O
us	O
in	O
exchange	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
leave	O
to	O
bring	O
them	O
on	O
shore	O
;	O
which	O
being	O
granted	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
brought	O
ashore	O
accordingly	O
.	O

We	O
then	O
attempted	O
to	O
settle	O
the	O
price	O
of	O
the	O
buffaloes	O
,	O
sheep	O
,	O
hogs	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
commodities	O
which	O
we	O
proposed	O
to	O
purchase	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
which	O
we	O
were	O
to	O
pay	O
in	O
money	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
this	O
was	O
mentioned	O
Mr.	O
Lange	O
left	O
us	O
,	O
telling	O
us	O
that	O
these	O
preliminaries	O
must	O
be	O
settled	O
with	O
the	O
natives	O
:	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
received	O
a	O
letter	O
from	O
the	O
Governor	O

in	O

the	O

of	O
which	O

us	O
when	O
he	O
returned	O

As	O
the	O
morning	O
was	O
now	O
far	O
advanced	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
very	O
unwilling	O
to	O
return	O
on	O
board	O
and	O
eat	O
salt	O
provisions	O
,	O
when	O
so	O
many	O
delicacies	O
surrounded	O
us	O
ashore	O
,	O
we	O
petitioned	O
his	O
Majesty	O
for	O
liberty	O
to	O
purchase	O
a	O
small	O
hog	O
and	O
some	O
rice	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
employ	O
his	O
subjects	O
to	O
dress	O
them	O
for	O
us	O

He	O
answered	O
very	O
graciously	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
could	O
eat	O
victuals	O
dressed	O
by	O
his	O
subjects	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
could	O
scarcely	O
suppose	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
do	O
himself	O
the	O
honour	O
of	O
entertaining	O
us	O

We	O
expressed	O
our	O
gratitude	O
,	O

immediately	O
sent	O
on	O

About	O
five	O
o'clock	O
,	O
dinner	O
was	O
ready	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
served	O
in	O
six	O
and	O
thirty	O
dishes	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
baskets	O
,	O
containing	O
alternately	O
rice	O
and	O
pork	O
;	O
and	O
three	O
bowls	O
of	O
earthen	O
ware	O
,	O
filled	O
with	O
the	O
liquor	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
pork	O
had	O
been	O
boiled	O
:	O
these	O
were	O
ranged	O
upon	O
the	O
floor	O
,	O
and	O
mats	O
laid	O
round	O
them	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
sit	O
upon	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
then	O
conducted	O
by	O
turns	O
to	O
a	O
hole	O
in	O
the	O
floor	O
,	O
near	O
which	O
stood	O
a	O
man	O
with	O
water	O
in	O
a	O
vessel	O
,	O
made	O
of	O
the	O
leaves	O
of	O
the	O
fan-palm	O
,	O
*	O
who	O
assisted	O
us	O
in	O
washing	O
our	O
hands	O
.	O

When	O
this	O
was	O
done	O
,	O
we	O
placed	O
ourselves	O
round	O
the	O
victuals	O
,	O
and	O
waited	O
for	O
the	O
king	O
.	O

As	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
come	O
,	O
we	O
enquired	O
for	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
told	O
that	O
the	O
custom	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
did	O
not	O
permit	O
the	O
person	O
who	O
gave	O
the	O
entertainment	O
to	O
sit	O
down	O
with	O
his	O
guests	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
we	O
suspected	O
the	O
victuals	O
to	O
be	O
poisoned	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
come	O
and	O
taste	O
it	O
.	O

We	O
immediately	O
declared	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
such	O
suspicion	O
,	O
and	O
desired	O
that	O
none	O
of	O
the	O
rituals	O
of	O
hospitality	O
might	O
be	O
violated	O
on	O
our	O
account	O
.	O

The	O
prime	O
minister	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Lange	O
were	O
of	O
our	O
party	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
made	O
a	O
most	O
luxurious	O
meal	O
:	O
we	O
thought	O
the	O
pork	O
and	O
rice	O
excellent	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
broth	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
despised	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
spoons	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
made	O
of	O
leaves	O
,	O
were	O
so	O
small	O
that	O
few	O
of	O
us	O
had	O
patience	O
to	O
use	O
them	O
.	O

After	O
dinner	O
,	O
our	O
wine	O
passed	O
briskly	O
about	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
again	O
enquired	O
for	O
our	O
royal	O
host	O
,	O
thinking	O
that	O
though	O
the	O
custom	O
of	O
his	O
country	O
would	O
not	O
allow	O
him	O
to	O
eat	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
he	O
might	O
at	O
least	O
share	O
in	O
the	O
jollity	O
of	O
our	O
bottle	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
again	O
excused	O
himself	O
,	O
saying	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
master	O
of	O
a	O
feast	O
should	O
never	O
be	O
drunk	O
,	O
which	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
certain	O
way	O
to	O
avoid	O
but	O
by	O
not	O
tasting	O
the	O
liquor	O
.	O

We	O
did	O
not	O
however	O
drink	O
our	O
wine	O
where	O
we	O
had	O
eaten	O
our	O
victuals	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
had	O
dined	O
made	O
room	O
for	O
the	O
seamen	O
and	O
servants	O
,	O
who	O
immediately	O
took	O
our	O
places	O
:	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
dispatch	O
all	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
left	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
women	O
who	O
came	O
to	O
clear	O
away	O
the	O
bowls	O
and	O
baskets	O
,	O
obliged	O
them	O
to	O
carry	O
away	O
with	O
them	O
what	O
they	O
had	O
not	O
eaten	O
.	O

As	O
wine	O
generally	O
warms	O
and	O
opens	O
the	O
heart	O
,	O
we	O
took	O
an	O
opportunity	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
thought	O
its	O
influence	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
felt	O
,	O
to	O
revive	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
the	O
buffaloes	O
and	O
sheep	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
in	O
all	O
this	O
time	O
heard	O
a	O
syllable	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
were	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
brought	O
down	O
early	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
.	O

But	O
our	O
Saxon	O
Dutchman	O
,	O
with	O
great	O
phlegm	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
communicate	O
to	O
us	O
the	O
contents	O
of	O
the	O
letter	O
which	O
he	O
pretended	O
to	O
have	O
received	O
from	O
the	O
Governor	PNM
of	PNM

He	O
said	O
,	O

that	O
after	O
acquainting	O
him	O
that	O
a	O

steered	O
from	O
thence	O
towards	O
the	O
island	O

we	O
were	O

ashore	O

required	O
him	O

if	O
such	O
ship	O
should	O
apply	O
for	O
provisions	O
in	O
distress	O
,	O
to	O
relieve	O
her	O
;	O

not	O
to	O
suffer	O
her	O
to	O
stay	O
longer	O
than	O
was	O
absolutely	O

nor	O
to	O

any	O

of	O
superior	O

be	O
afterwards	O
distributed	O
among	O

but	O
he	O
was	O
graciously	O
pleased	O
to	O
add	O

that	O
we	O
were	O
at	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
general	O
opinion	O
that	O
this	O

In	O
the	O
evening	O

we	O
received	O
intelligence	O
from	O
our	O
trading-place	O
that	O
no	O
buffaloes	O

hogs	O
had	O
been	O
brought	O
down	O

only	O
a	O

taken	O
away	O
before	O
our	O
people	O

who	O
had	O
sent	O
for	O
money	O

could	O
procure	O
it	O

Some	O
fowls	O

had	O

a	O

quantity	O
of	O

sold	O
at	O
a	O
very	O
low	O
price	O

We	O
complained	O
of	O
our	O
disappointment	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Lange	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
now	O
another	O
subterfuge	O
;	O
he	O
said	O

that	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
gone	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
beach	O
ourselves	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
have	O
purchased	O
what	O
we	O
pleased	O

that	O
the	O
natives	O
were	O
afraid	O
to	O
take	O
money	O
of	O
our	O
people	O
,	O
lest	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
counterfeit	O

We	O
could	O
not	O
but	O
feel	O
some	O
indignation	O
against	O
a	O
man	O
who	O
had	O
concealed	O
this	O
,	O
being	O
true	O
;	O
or	O
alleged	O
it	O
,	O
being	O
false	O

I	O
started	O
up	O

went	O
immediately	O
to	O
the	O

no	O

well	O
enough	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
succeed	O
no	O

than	O
my	O
people	O

told	O
Mr.	O

that	O
the	O

displeased	O
at	O
our	O
not	O
having	O
offered	O

Mr.	O

did	O
not	O

it	O

rose	O
up	O

down	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O

had	O
given	O
a	O
reason	O
for	O
our	O
disappointment	O
somewhat	O
more	O
plausible	O
;	O

said	O
that	O

next	O

we	O
went	O
ashore	O
again	O

Solander	O
went	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
town	O
to	O
speak	O
to	O
Lange	PNM

I	O
remained	O
upon	O

to	O
see	O
what	O
could	O
be	O
done	O
in	O
the	O
purchase	O

I	O
found	O
here	O

Indian	O

who	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
appeared	O
to	O
have	O
some	O
authority	O

called	O
the	O
Prime	O
Minister	O

to	O
engage	O
this	O
man	O
in	O
our	O

I	O
presented	O
him	O
with	O
a	O
spying-glass	O

but	O
I	O
saw	O
nothing	O
at	O
market	O
except	O
one	O
small	O
buffalo	O
.	O

I	O
enquired	O
the	O
price	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
told	O
five	O
guineas	O
:	O
this	O
was	O
twice	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
worth	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
offered	O
three	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
could	O
perceive	O
the	O
man	O
who	O
treated	O
with	O
me	O
thought	O
a	O
good	O
price	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
said	O
that	O
he	O
must	O
acquaint	O
the	O
King	O
with	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
offered	O
before	O
he	O
could	O
take	O
it	O
.	O

A	O
messenger	O
was	O
immediately	O
dispatched	O
to	O
his	O
Majesty	O
,	O
who	O
soon	O
returned	O
,	O

said	O

that	O
the	O
buffalo	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
sold	O
for	O
any	O
thing	O
less	O
than	O
five	O

This	O
price	O
I	O
absolutely	O
refused	O

give	O

another	O

was	O

away	O

an	O

the	O
Doctor	O
told	O
me	O

that	O
Mr.	O
Lange	O
had	O
interpreted	O
to	O
him	O
a	O
message	O
from	O
the	O
King	O
,	O
purporting	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
would	O
not	O
trade	O
with	O
us	O
,	O
because	O
we	O
had	O
refused	O
to	O
give	O
them	O
more	O
than	O
half	O
the	O
value	O
of	O
what	O
they	O
had	O
to	O
sell	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
permitted	O
to	O
trade	O
upon	O
any	O
terms	O
longer	O
than	O
this	O
day	O
.	O

Besides	O
the	O
officers	O
who	O
commanded	O
the	O
party	O
,	O
there	O
came	O
with	O
it	O
a	O
man	O
who	O
was	O
born	O
at	O
Timor	PNM
,	O
of	O
Portuguese	O
parents	O
,	O
and	O
who	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
afterwards	O
discovered	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
kind	O
of	O
colleague	O
to	O
the	O
Dutch	O
factor	O
;	O
by	O
this	O
man	O
what	O
they	O
pretended	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
King	O
's	O
order	O
was	O
delivered	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
purport	O
with	O
that	O
which	O
Dr.	O
Solander	O
had	O
received	O
from	O
Lange	PNM
.	O

We	O
were	O
all	O
clearly	O
of	O
opinion	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
mere	O
artifice	O
of	O
the	O
factors	O
to	O
extort	O
money	O
from	O
us	O
,	O
for	O
which	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
prepared	O
by	O
the	O
account	O
of	O
a	O
letter	O
from	O
Concordia	PNM
;	O
and	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
hesitating	O
what	O
step	O
to	O
take	O
,	O
the	O
Portuguese	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
the	O
sooner	O
accomplish	O
his	O
purpose	O
,	O
began	O
to	O
drive	O
away	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
had	O
brought	O
down	O
poultry	O
and	O
syrup	O
,	O
and	O
others	O
that	O
were	O
now	O
coming	O
in	O
with	O
buffaloes	O
and	O
sheep	O
.	O

At	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
I	O
glanced	O
my	O
eye	O
upon	O
the	O
old	O
man	O
whom	O
I	O
had	O
complimented	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
with	O
the	O
spying-glass	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
by	O
his	O
looks	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
heartily	O
approve	O
of	O
what	O
was	O
doing	O
;	O
I	O
therefore	O
took	O
him	O
by	O
the	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
presented	O
him	O
with	O
an	O
old	O
broad	O
sword	O
.	O

This	O
instantly	O
turned	O
the	O
scale	O
in	O
our	O
favour	O
;	O
he	O
received	O
the	O
sword	O
with	O
a	O
transport	O
of	O
joy	O
,	O
and	O
flourishing	O
it	O
over	O
the	O
busy	O
Portuguese	O
,	O
who	O
crouched	O
like	O
a	O
fox	O
to	O
a	O
lion	O

he	O
made	O

were	O

supply	O
us	O
with	O
whatever	O

and	O
seemed	O
also	O
to	O

to	O
convince	O
him	O

that	O

he	O
should	O
be	O
delivered	O
up	O

some	O
